Hundreds of people who bought Olympics tickets through Thomas Cook have been told they will have to come to London to collect the tickets after they failed to arrive in the post. The troubled retailer- which has been criticised for selling ‘overpriced’ Olympics packages - has told the worried customers that they will now have to queue up to collect their tickets, in some cases just hours before the event. Some families will be forced to come to London a day early as a result of the problems while others said they feared missing their event because they were stuck in a queue for tickets. Fiasco: Hundreds of people who bought Olympics tickets through Thomas Cook have been told they will have to come to London to collect the tickets after they failed to arrive in the post . Aaron and Danielle Highley, who booked . tickets and a hotel through Thomas Cook, were horrified to find out . they would have to queue for their tickets in central London on the day . of their event after their tickets failed to arrive. Mr . Highley, 28, said feared they would miss the event anyway if they had . to queue for tickets in west London just an hour and a half before it . started. ‘I was told that their office would open at 8.00am,’ he said. ‘But the handball event starts many miles away - and a transport nightmare away - at 9.30am. ‘So . we would have to travel into the centre of London, join a very long . queue then have absolutely no chance of making it to the Olympic Park . for the event we have paid to attend.’ Mr Highley, from Woodbury in Devon, paid £250 for the break and tickets for him and buyer wife Danielle, 26. ‘We just wanted to experience the once-in-a-lifetime event,’ he said. Some families will be forced to come to . London a day early as a result of the problems while others said they . feared missing their event because they were stuck in a queue for . tickets . ‘We . booked a hotel outside the congestion zone to save money and we are due . to see a handball event in the Olympic Park which we are excited about . visiting.’ But . when the tickets failed to arrive as promised, Mr Highley, an online . retailer, contacted Thomas Cook to find out what was going on. ‘I spent more than an hour holding on an expensive phone line before anyone at Thomas Cook answered the phone,’ he said. ‘In his words he said “yes sir, there has been a major cock up”. He told me it was chaos.’ Mr . Highley was told that he and his wife would have to make their way to . Marble Arch in West London along with thousands of others over the . weekend to pick up their tickets. He was warned that he would have to be at the office very early on Sunday morning as they were expecting long queues. But Mr Highley said the queues could be so long that by the time they get to the venue and got through security, they could miss the event anyway. But when he asked about a refund, the Thomas Cook worker said that they would only refund the £5 cost of the courier who didn’t arrive as a ‘goodwill gesture.’ Last night dozens of other customers took to twitter to complain about the problems. Richard Rolfe wrote: ‘Where are my Olympic Tickets. You don’t respond to email, you keep me on the phone an hour...how do I get through?’ Another customer wrote: ‘Despite the vast sums of money paid for my #olympic swim tickets @ThomasCookUK still not delivered them and can’t get through on phone.

A Victorian law used to imprison pranksters who played 'knock down ginger' has been brought back into use to arrest and fine dangerous rickshaw drivers in London. The 173-year-old Metropolitan Police Act prevents anyone 'riding or driving furiously such as to endanger the life or limb of any person' and officers have impounded more than 100 of the pedi-cabs using it. Section 54 of this act, made law in, also outlaws 'wantonly disturbing people by ringing doorbells', an act carried out by most Britons in their lifetime, which was punishable by 14 days in prison nearly two centuries ago. Crackdown: Police are impounding and fining dangerous rickshaws (file picture) by dusting off a 173-year-old law . Any 'nuisances by Persons in Thoroughfares', 'singing of any obscene songs and ballads' as well as excessive blowing of horns or dangerous kite flying can also be stopped using the law. Details released under the Freedom of Information today show the Met stopped 534 rickshaw drivers in London in the three-month period between January and March. Police are cracking down on them as many motorists and pedestrians have been put in danger by reckless rickshaw drivers. Battle: Chief Supt Simon Ovens, who is in charge of policing the West End, wants rickshaws removed completely . From that a total of 101 rickshaws were impounded and 53 drivers were fined £80, new figures reveal. Chief Supt Simon Ovens, who is in charge of policing London's West End, where the majority of these rickshaws are, said: 'I would like to see them taken off the road altogether. They put passengers at risk — particularly passengers who have had too much to drink — and the drivers are unqualified.' The local council also has pledged to get tough on them. Cllr Ed Argar, Westminster City Council’s cabinet member for city management and transport, said: 'Just a few pedicabs blocking the footway or road or travelling carelessly can have a huge effect on traffic congestion in the busiest part of London and put all road users' lives in danger. 'Westminster City Council demands that the pedicab industry improves standards and safety, and has been working for several years with the better sections of the pedicab operators and police to do just that. 'The use of this particular law demonstrates that the police will take tough enforcement action where necessary with the full support of Westminster City Council.' There was a call from MPs that they should be banned during the Olympics for the safety of the public. These rickshaws, which are not regulated like other taxis, were a 'danger' and risked getting in the way of the emergency services during the Games. Hayes and Harlington MP John McDonnell tabled a Commons motion listing a series of concerns, noting that rickshaw drivers do not have criminal record or police checks, are uninsured and can rip off passengers because there is no set fare structure. It also expressed 'shock' that the vehicles do not have to pass crash tests. 'This House notes with concern the danger posed by pedicabs to the general public and visitors to London during the Olympic and Paralympic Games,' the motion read. Rickshaws were branded a 'dangerous menace' during the mayoral election campaign, with candidates Boris . Johnson, Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick all saying the Government should legislate to remove them from the West End.","1839 Metropolitan Police Act used to impound 101 pedi-cabs and fine 53 dangerous drivers, FOI reveals .

The world’s only mobile submarine museum, crafted from an old canal boat, is going on sale after a 90 per cent drop in visitors. ‘Captain’ Richard Williams is being forced to sell the mock U-8047 after he was made to move the vessel 100 yards from Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds and visitors disappeared. Only a fifth of the length of a real-life submarine the World War II replica U-boat is priced at £30,000. Captain: Richard Williams built the replica from an old canal narrow boat and now welcomes visitors to his museum . The boat has been moored outside the Royal Armouries Museum at Clarence Dock in Leeds attracting tourists and museum visitors to come and have a look inside the submarine. However, a recent request from British Waterways  for it to be moved 100 yards away made it less visible to museum-goers, and killing the trade for Mr Williams and his crew. The self-styled 'Captain' Williams built the submarine from an old canal boat and with the help of a company which supplied props for the Star Wars and Bond movies it was turned into a floating museum. The mock U-8047 u-boat stands out alongside the other canal boats in its new home the dock unlike its previous spot near the Royal Armouries Museum . The floating museum is a hybrid of a German U-boat and a British Submarine from the Second World War . Captain Williams, 52, said: ‘I’m gutted. We were offered a place here, we came here. ‘We’re all volunteers and don’t make any money out of it. ‘We suffered the winter and lost a lot of money which we were expecting to make back in the summer, but we are not doing 10 per cent of what we were doing.’ Capt Williams, who spent 50,000 pounds creating the hybrid German U-Boat and British submarine, is hoping the boat can be sold but still run by the current “crew”, aided by corporate sponsors, or sold outright. The boat is a much smaller version of the real thing - only a fifth of the size of a real submarine - and is the only floating submarine museum in the world . If you are not a museum sort of person, the boat is still fully functioning as a narrow boat - but you would probably get some funny looks from the shores . The boat, which has a coning tower, periscope and torpedo room, is being sold with German and British items, uniforms, sonar, whoopar horn and morse key. Capt Williams added: ‘This is a unique opportunity to own the world’s only mobile submarine museum, which is based in Leeds but able to travel the canal network.’ The boat is currently operated under the U-8047 Trust, a social enterprise offering children education about German submarines during the Second World War. Children are allowed free entry and adults are asked to make a 1 pound donation for visits. The boast cost Captain Williams £50,000 to make and the interior was made with the help of prop-workers from the James Bond and Star Wars movies . Fans of memorabilia and collectors alike can get their hands on the U-8047 for £30,000 .","The world's only floating submarine museum is on the market after number of visitors drop by 90 per cent .

"By . Jean Smith . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 27 October 2012 . I’m from Iowa in the American Mid-West, a friendly place where people smile, chat and even wink. So you’ll understand my confusion when I first arrived in Britain, a land where social mixing seems impossible without beer. I love the people, the politeness and the scones. But when it comes to flirting, you British have much to learn. As a social anthropologist, I’ve spent more than a decade looking at how men and women interact and I recently completed a four-country comparison. Much to learn: Britons need to take notes from across the pond or end up going home alone at the end of the night, according to research . On the basis of what I found, I’m sorry to say flirting is all too rare in Britain – and when it does take place, it’s likely to fail. New Yorkers get right down to business; Parisians take refuge in ornate but time-proven ritual; but here people just give up and go home. On their own. Britain’s problems start with men. Protocol dictates that men approach women. The guys know this, yet it’s clear they’re horrified at the idea of rejection. ‘Perhaps I am intruding  upon her and her friends,’ they think. ‘She might not welcome the interruption!’ New York men can cope with rejection: they laugh about it with friends, denigrate the  girl, buy another drink, and move on. But men here seem swallowed up in despair. British women agree that the man should make the first approach. But women here, too, are at fault, because they give no clear signs of encouragement to the few men who dare. Clueless Brits: According to statistics British men are particularly bad at flirting and most are unable to tell when a woman is flirting with him . What British women count as obvious eye contact is, to men, no more than a blink. When asked how they let a man know they are interested, women say ‘I look at them; I don’t need to do anything physical. The fact I’m listening makes them feel important,’ or ‘I do obvious body language, like pointing my knee in his direction while we chat.’ Such gestures seem to be lost on the intended flirtees. It is no surprise that only 35 per cent of British men can tell if a woman is flirting with them. British men, it seems, like a good deal of reassurance. ‘It’s best when women do something deliberate,’ said one man. ‘Like put their hand on my knee or just tell me.’ British women are slightly better placed: 57 per cent think they are good at spotting flirtation. Yet it is the smallest percentage in the survey. In Paris, 53 per cent of men and 95 per cent of women think they know what’s happening. British men are expected to make the first move, yet a full 30 per cent say they’d never approach anyone in a flirtatious way. Perhaps, as I suspect, British men and women approach people they’ve known for a long time or,  better still, to whom they  have been introduced. Flirt-phobia isn’t limited to a class . or social group. It afflicts even the rich and beautiful: I was . recently asked to help Made In Chelsea stars Cheska Hull and Ollie . Locke. Despite their good looks and confidence, they still needed a few pointers on meeting the opposite sex. I recommend lessons from abroad. In New York nothing is left to doubt. Yes, women prefer the man to make the . first move. But if he doesn’t, she makes the running herself. And if . that fails, she just moves on, quickly. In . Paris a complex game is carried out under the guise of serious . conversation. Neither party will make genuine feelings obvious. If they . do, they have ‘lost’. Glam help: Channel 4's Made in Chelsea stars Francesca Hull and Ollie Locke both received some helpful tips on how to flirt . Women in particular must keep feelings private, often even avoiding eye contact, lest they be thought ‘easy’. It’s amazing that anything happens at all. But it does, because men and women are both au fait with the rules of engagement and keep to them. In gender-equal Stockholm, women feel free to make their interest clear. I’m not sure walking up to a man and saying, ‘Let’s go home now’ counts as flirting. But it’s effective. In Britain, I’ve seen men and women talk for hours to people they don’t fancy because they don’t wish to give offence. And the result is stultifying. Cheska and Ollie listened to advice and accept the need for a more direct approach. For all his confidence on TV, Ollie feels a bit inhibited in reality. Cheska now believes in flirting more often and more openly. She even got a date during filming. After 13 years in Britain, I like it so much I’ve taken citizenship. But when it comes to meeting the opposite sex, someone needs to say something. So, here it is: if you’re interested in a person, tell them; if not, move on gently with a smile. It’s to your advantage. As the golfer Arnold Palmer famously said: ‘The more I practise, the luckier I get.’ The Flirt Interpreter, by Jean Smith, is published by Lucidus,  priced at £12.99 (paperback) and £5.98 (Kindle).

The high-speed 'Javelin' train designed to whisk Olympic visitors to Stratford had a false start on the opening day of the Games when this morning's first official train departed late because a driver failed to turn up for work. The Southeastern train company had designated the 7.04am from St Pancras station in London to the Park in Stratford as the beginning of the service. But the 140mph Japanese-built train did not leave Stratford until 7.09am, as travel bosses were forced to delay the train while it waited for a replacement driver, as the scheduled worker had called in sick. Left waiting: Olympic volunteers and Games visitors wait to board the delayed Javelin train this morning, on its first day whisking people to Stratford . Officials said the delay was caused by a driver who did not turn up at work due to illness . The train, pictured this morning, will eventually ferry 25,000 people per hour to and from the Olympic Park . One of those on the delayed train today was a chef working in a hospitality area at the Park. He has been travelling to Stratford from Luton via St Pancras for the past few days. He said today: 'Not one of my trains has been on time. It was 15 minutes late one day.' Once under way, today’s delayed 7.04am service raced to Stratford International Station in east London in less than seven minutes. There were also travel problems in and around east London on the day of the Opening Ceremony, as tube lines and mainline services were delayed. Super quick: Once working, the 140mph Javelin trains will whisk Games visitors from St Pancras station (pictured) to Stratford in just seven minutes . One of the hold-ups was at North Greenwich where the Games’ gymnastics and basketball is being held. The . North Greenwich problem was a signal failure on the Jubilee line - just . two stops from the main Olympic station at Stratford. Those heading to London from East Anglia were delayed by a broken-down train at Ingatestone in Essex. This caused hold-ups for Greater Anglia train company services into London’s Liverpool Street. Fast travel: The Javelin train is designed to whisk Games visitors from St Pancras directly to the Olympic Park . Meanwhile, Olympic fans heading for . London on the M1 hit noontime gridlock and delays of nearly 2 hours . after a multi-vehicle smash involving an overturned lorry today. Black-cab London taxi drivers staged an hour long go-slow protest at Hyde Park Corner in central London over Olympic traffic lanes. Traffic was at a standstill for about 50 minutes from 2.50pm when police cleared the area, said BBC London Travel. This in turn led to congestion on all approaches to Hyde Park Corner at Grosvenor Place. The demonstration came hours before . thousands of spectators and world leaders were expected to attend the . opening ceremony of the London Olympics. Cabbies have held two protests over being barred from 30 miles of ‘Games Lanes ‘ reserved for  VIP Olympics officials and athletes. They argue that they are an intrinsic part of London’s public transport system and should be allowed access to the lanes. But their views have fallen on deaf Olympic ears. Len Martin, vice chairman of United Cabbies, had said: 'We don't want to disrupt Londoners, what we want to do is to bring to the public's attention the plight of the London cab driver who is unable to bring a service to the Olympic Games during the Games.' Transport for London said cabs were able to use some lanes to collect fares.

"PUBLISHED: . 17:28 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:29 EST, 27 October 2012 . He has been dubbed ‘Millionaire Miliband’ by Tory MPs, who accuse him of mounting attacks on David Cameron’s wealth from the comfort of his own £2 million London home. Now new light has been shed on  Ed Miliband’s finances after it emerged that his barrister wife  Justine Thornton helped to fill the marital coffers with lucrative work representing both toxic waste exporters and travellers who set up an illegal camp. In October last year – just two weeks after her husband mounted an attack on capitalist ‘predators’  in his party conference speech – Ms Thornton appeared in the Court of Appeal on behalf of four polluters accused of illegally shipping 158 tons of hazardous waste to Nigeria. Controversial: Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband with wife Justine, who is k representing both toxic waste exporters and travellers who set up an illegal camp . Ms Thornton, whose legal work earns her an estimated £200,000 a year, was attempting to block criminal charges against her clients. The case was the culmination of Operation Boron, the codename given to the Environment Agency’s unprecedented prosecution of 15 individuals and companies for shipping waste from the electronics industry to the African country. The agency said it had mounted the prosecution – the largest ever of its kind – because British law bans exporting such waste as it ‘risks harm to human health and the environment in the recipient country’ through unsafe disposal methods, such as burning plastic. Nigeria has been described as  ‘the world’s PC dumping ground’, with up to 50 million tons of old computers thrown away each year on waste dumps. Children earn about £1.30 a day scavenging on the dumps, putting their health at risk as old computers can contain toxins such as mercury, nickel, cadmium, chromium and lead. And research from a Nigerian university has warned of a ‘chemical timebomb’ as toxins from dumps seep into the water table. Ms Thornton’s defence case rested on claiming that British laws on waste export were incompatible with EU ones – but the subsequent trial found that the European laws had been breached. In his 2011 conference speech, Mr Miliband pledged that Labour would use higher taxes to punish ‘predator’ companies with a ruthless attitude to capitalism. Des res: The Miliband's £2m house . Ms Thornton has also acted for Felix Doran, an Irish traveller who illegally set up a caravan site on Green Belt land in Bedfordshire, when he used the Court of Appeal in a failed bid to block attempts to remove him. Mr Miliband provoked fury in No 10 by citing David Cameron’s wealth in his attack on the Prime Minister for cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. ‘David Cameron isn’t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one,’ the Labour leader said. ‘He’s going to be getting the millionaires’ tax cut.’ Mr Miliband and his wife live with their two children in a four-bedroom house in an affluent North London area, which they bought for £1.6 million three years ago. The house is registered in Ms Thornton’s name only. Mr Miliband is believed to contribute to  the estimated £400,000 Barclays mortgage from his £130,000 party leader’s salary. Dangerous: Refugee children collect scrap materials in a waste dump . Ms Thornton bought the property – which also has a large garden and a ‘granny flat’ in the basement – from the National Trust. The house had been left to the organisation by violin teacher Elspeth Iliff. It is in a fashionable enclave which is also home to the Labour MP and former actress Glenda Jackson, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and writer Julian Barnes. The house is also in the catchment area for  Gospel Oak primary school, where chairman of the governors is Fiona Millar, partner of Tony Blair’s former media chief Alastair Campbell. Last night, Tory MP Rob Wilson  said: ‘There’s something mildly repugnant about Millionaire Miliband talking about predator companies when they are helping to pay his household bills.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘Justine Thornton is a specialist environmental lawyer and like all lawyers she is professionally obliged to  represent clients allocated to her whatever her views. It is the way the British legal system works. ‘To suggest there is anything wrong about her taking these cases is either malicious or reveals a  profound lack of knowledge about the legal system.’","Justine Thornton appeared in the Court of Appeal .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 13:41 EST, 28 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:15 EST, 28 October 2012 . A copper knife handle depicting a couple having sex and an animal bone carved into the shape of a penis with wings are among thousands of artefacts unearthed across Britain by amateur treasure hunters. The erotic art is part of a huge haul of almost 25,000 Roman artefacts - mainly coins - discovered in England and Wales and documented as part of the Portable Antiquities Scheme. The finds, reported in 2011 and dating back between 1,600 and 2,000 years, also include a copper bust of a bare-chested man - thought to be Antinous, the male lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian - and an unusual silver and gold brooch in the shape of a leaping dolphin. Explicit: The copper alloy knife handle is carved in the shape of a couple having sex . Amateurs in England and Wales are allowed to use metal detectors to search for artefacts and possibly - depending on the nature of their finds - keep them. While the treasure hunter who unearthed the lewd copper knife handle in North Yorkshire may have had something of a shock, an expert said it was 'not uncommon' to find sexually explicit iconography in a Roman household. John Pearce, archaeology lecturer at King's College London, said in an article about the discoveries published in the journal Britannia: 'One theory is that those scenes that show sexual activity have an apotropaic power, because they make you laugh so that wards off the evil eye.' Another amateur archaeologist stumbled across a penis with a pair of wings that has been carved from animal bone, while a hollow gold pendant in the shape of a penis was also discovered. Lover: This hollow copper bust is believed to depict Antinous, the Greek lover of the emperor Hadrian . 'Rare': This unusual brooch in the shape of a leaping dolphin could have been worn by a man or a woman, experts say . Mr Pearce said a three-dimensional dolphin brooch - which could have been worn by either a man or a woman - found in Essex was particularly unusual, according to Foxnews.com. The lecturer said he had been unable to find an example of another one like it. The hollow copper bust depicting a bare-chested young man was discovered near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire. While experts can't be certain it is of Hadrian's lover Antinous, the hairstyle closely matchs other statues that are known to be of him. The affair between Hadrian - who ruled from AD 117 to 138 - and Greek Antinous was widely known and would not have been perceived as unusual at the time. When Antinous died in Egypt in AD 130, the grief stricken emperor ordered that he be deified, and statues of his dead lover sprung up throughout the empire. Artefacts: Phallic symbols were a common theme in Roman art . The practice of amateur treasure hunters searching for artefacts in England and Wales is controversial, with some critics arguing it could lead to potential archaeological sites being disturbed and the loss of provenance information. The government backed Public Antiquities Scheme records all findings in an online public database.","A knife handle in the shape of a couple having sex and a penis carved from animal bone among 25,000 Roman artefacts unearthed across Britain .

A four-year-old girl has a rare genetic condition that makes her so fragile even a gust of wind can knock her over. Abbi Bennett, suffers from a muscle-wasting condition that affects just one in a million babies. It means that although she can walk a little, the slightest touch can send her tumbling over. On one occasion the four-year-old, from Bournville, Birmingham, was blown down by a gust of wind while with her mother Sarah at a supermarket. Abbi was diagnosed with a genetic condition when she was two, which affects just one in a million people . Mrs Bennett, 32, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when a gust of . wind knocked her over. We had arrived at the supermarket and I’d put her . down for just a few seconds to get my bag out the car, when there was . this gust of wind. 'The next thing I knew she fell and hit . her head on the floor and was bleeding. I was shocked at how easily she . went over. It left her very scared of wind for a while afterwards. 'We have to be so careful around her, making sure she doesn’t fall over and hurt herself. 'She can just about walk 10 metres, but if there is a bumpy surface she can collapse. 'At first she suffered some nasty falls, . bumping her head. However, over time she has learned to take the brunt . of any falls on her knees. A lot of people don’t realise she has a . disability as she looks normal so they won’t think anything of brushing . past her. But Abbi cannot keep her balance and they will knock her . over.' Abbi was diagnosed with the muscle-wasting condition Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD) at the age of two. The condition, which is linked to Muscular Dystrophy, affects just one in a million babies. It not only leaves her frail, but she has bendiness in the joints of her hands and feet and she suffers from curvature of the spine and has respiratory weakness. Abbi has a rare syndrome which causes muscle weakness. Here pictured with mother Sarah, father Gary and sisters (l-r) Amber, Ashleigh and Ava . Abbi, pictured as a baby, never crawled and didn't start walking until 18months . Sarah, a psychology student and . husband Gary, 32, a learning mentor, realised there was something wrong . with their daughter soon after she was born. But as so little is known about UCMD, it took two years for them to get a diagnosis. Sarah, who also has Ashleigh, 12, . Amber, six, and two-year-old Ava, said: 'I knew there was something . different about her after having two other children, I could tell. Her . feet could touch her shins and she was super flexible, which we know now . is part of the disease’s symptoms. 'But . there were other clues. She struggled to hold her own body weight as . she got older. We were in and out of the doctors for two years as her . weight also fluctuated. 'She was never able to crawl and when she did eventually start walking at 18 months old, it was more like a waddle and then she’d fall over.' It was only after the family was referred to specialist Helen Roper at the Birmingham Children’s Hospital that Abbi was diagnosed. 'She spotted it straight away,' Sarah said. 'When we found out it was UCMD it hit us hard. I thought my world was over. I started looking it up on the internet but there wasn’t a lot of information about at the time. Out and about: Abbi can walk about 10metres but will end up completely wheel-chair bound as her condition worsens . 'Gary worked at a special needs school and knew about two brothers who had the Duchenne’s version of the illness which only affects boys, so he had an idea of what muscular dystrophy was. 'Luckily UCMD doesn’t affect the heart like Duchenne’s but Abbi has all the other symptoms and problems. 'It will mean in a few years that she will become totally reliant on a wheelchair when her muscles will no longer be able to cope. She will also suffer respiratory problems. 'There is no cure at the moment for Abbi’s condition as so little is known about it. But there is a clinical trial that will take place which will investigate UCMD. 'Our aim now is to raise as much awareness as we can about the disease, so that the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign can use the money to help other parents and continue ground-breaking research. 'We have started up our own charity committee on Facebook called Abbi’s Campaign - 1 in a Million, where funds raised will go towards the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign.' Sarah added: 'We’ve met other UCMD sufferers, but there are only three that we know of in the UK. We hope a cure will be found. 'Abbi will need continuous support for the rest of her life and we want people out there to know that this condition does exist.'","Abbi has a muscle-wasting disease, which makes her vulnerable to toppling over .

Experts fear a repeat of the devastation caused by Dutch elm disease as an infection threatens a third of the country’s trees. Importing ash trees is to be banned Monday, following the burning of 100,000 specimens with ash dieback. The fungal infection, which ravaged other European countries before spreading to the UK, kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects. Forest favourite: One of Britain's 80 million ash trees, which could soon be wiped out . Desperate measures are being taken  to . protect Britain’s 80million ash trees, which support wildlife as well . as the £10billion timber industry. Experts believe it may already be too . late to prevent an environmental catastrophe on the scale of the Dutch . elm disease outbreak that destroyed 25million trees in the Seventies and . Eighties. Ministers have been criticised for . failing to act earlier when the parasite was first detected in a nursery . in February. It is now feared to have spread to 20 sites. Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment . spokesman, said the Government – which only opened a consultation on ash . dieback with businesses and scientists last month – had been ‘asleep on . the job’. The disease was found at the start of . the year in a consignment of 2,000 trees imported from the Netherlands, . most of which had already been sold by the time the infection was . detected. Fungus: Ash dieback can lay undetected for years before killing trees . Countryside crisis: The fungus now poses the greatest threat to British woodland since the 1970s . Last week the first cases in mature . trees were confirmed in East Anglia. Saplings in Leicestershire, . Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire and Scotland have also been affected. Ash dieback’s microscopic fungus – . chalara fraxinea – infects the leaves, bark and wood of ash trees, . causing them to develop black spots and cankers, and then wither and . die. Stop dieback: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is 'ready to go' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in Britain . Owen Paterson, the Environment . Secretary, said yesterday: ‘We will be introducing a ban on imports. I . have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go.’ The . movement of saplings around the country will also be strictly . controlled. A task force of 100 people from the . Forestry Commission and other bodies are now tracing all ash imports . into the UK for the past five years – at thousands of sites – in an . attempt to trace when the disease first arrived here. Ash dieback has devastated mainland . Europe, from where more than a million of Britain’s ash trees have been . imported over the past two years. It has all but wiped out common ash . species in Denmark, Poland and Lithuania. A survey has found 20 ‘suspicious’ sites in Britain, but they are yet to be confirmed by scientists. Stuart Burgess, of the Forestry . Commission, said it was a race against time to detect new cases before . the falling of autumn leaves made them very difficult to track. There are concerns that the fungus may . have been lurking undetected for several years, as it can take this . long before it becomes apparent. Scientists are not certain how it . spreads, but they suspect it is carried by rain, wind or insects. About 58,000 trees have been burned in Scotland so far, with a further 40,000 destroyed around the rest of the UK. The Horticultural Trades Association . said it first raised the issue of ash dieback in 2009, when it called . for import restrictions. At that stage the disease was thought to be . caused by a fungus already endemic in Britain, making a ban ineffective. It has since been discovered that the fungus is a new one. Tim Briercliffe of the HTA said it was . ‘hugely disappointing’ that the Government had not acted more quickly. National tragedy: Timber is a £10 billion a year industry threatened by the ash dieback disease crisis . ‘We are looking for Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and . Rural Affairs] to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as . a result of this,’ he added. Steve Marsh, of the Woodland Trust, . said: ‘We feel this hasn’t been taken as seriously as it should. We . should have an emergency summit like we had with foot and mouth disease. 'This could rip massive holes in our landscape – it kills the tree, so . it could easily be as bad as Dutch elm disease.’ Dame Fiona Reynolds, the outgoing . director-general of the National Trust, warned that an outbreak in the . UK could be ‘horrific’. ‘We’re just praying that this ash dieback can be . understood, and managed, quickly,’ she said. Harry Cotterell, president of the . Country Land & Business Association, said it was a ‘great pity’ that . an ash tree ban was not announced earlier in the year to prevent . further imports from Europe, where the disease is rife. Mr Paterson denied that the Government . had taken too long to act, saying a ‘detailed process’ would be carried . out at 1,000 sites to identify where trees had come from. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: . 'As soon as the first case was . confirmed in February, we immediately began to trace its source, so we . could get it under control and minimise the spread of the disease. 'We immediately arranged for any . infected trees to be destroyed. 'We held urgent talks with the industry . about the impact of Chalara Fraxinea resulting in a voluntary import . ban. 'I announced last week that a ban on the import of ash trees and . movement controls within the UK would come into force on Monday/today, . well before the planting season begins. 'I have set up a new plant health task . force which will look at further ways to prevents pests and diseases . from entering the country in the future.'","Government criticised for taking so long to act against killer tree fungus .

Death: A coroner said Cheshire police had 'serious deficiencies' in procedure exposed by an inquest into the death of former cage fighter Jacob Michael, who died after he was pepper-sprayed by officers . A coroner criticised a police force today after 'serious deficiencies' in procedures were exposed by an inquest into the death of a former cage fighter who died in custody after he was pepper-sprayed by officers. Jacob Michael, 25, died by misadventure as a result of 'cocaine induced excited delirium', an inquest jury agreed, but also found that a catalogue of police failures may have contributed to his death. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Michael’s mother, Christine Michael, said she was 'disappointed' by the verdict and said she still held the police responsible. The coroner listed a number of police . failures, including: failures in police training, 'serious gaps' in the . knowledge of operational officers, lessons were not learned as it was . the second death in a relatively short period of time after a person was arrested and they had not recognised Michael needed urgent medical attention. Cheshire Police said lessons had been learned and that a range of improvements had already been put into action. The inquest was told that Mr Michael called police on August 22 last year after he believed somebody had pulled a gun on him. He then locked himself in his bedroom in Lacey Street, Widnes, and was restrained by police officers after a struggle. Police officers said Mr Michael threatened them with a hammer, which led them to incapacitate him with pepper spray. Mrs Michael, who wept in court on hearing the jury’s verdict, said: 'I’m very disappointed, but we didn’t have much faith in getting a good result.' Scroll down for video . Controversial: CCTV shows Jacob Michael slumped in a police van(top right) after he was restrained and put inside by officers . She said: 'He should have been left in his room. He dialled 999, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He should have been left alone for us to deal with. It was an abandoned phone call, they should have just left and left Jacob and he’d be alive today.' Mr Michael was arrested for alleged affray and taken by police van to a custody suite with his hands cuffed and his legs in restraints. Footage taken from the police van and the custody office was shown to the inquest in which Mr Michael, who was known as Jake, can be heard repeatedly saying 'please' and 'sorry'. The footage shows Mr Michael face down in the cell with his hands cuffed and his legs restrained - moments before police realised he was unwell. Tributes: A man leaves flowers where Mr Michael was arrested in August last year in Widnes, Cheshire . Two police officers can be seen with their feet on his leg. The four-week inquest heard that Mr Michael was a cocaine user who would occasionally 'binge' on the drug, and had been taking it on the weekend prior to his arrest. He had also been warned by doctors about the adverse effects cocaine could have on his heart. The jury of eight women and one man at Warrington Coroner’s Court, sitting at Daresbury Park Hotel, reached its verdict after more than two days of deliberations. Reading their narrative verdict, Nicholas Rheinberg, the Coroner for Cheshire, said: 'Partying and his heart’s susceptibility to cocaine probably contributed to the death.' The 'fear, flight and fight' response caused during the arrest 'may have also contributed to the death', the jury found. Message: A note left at the scene showed the level of feeling the in community after he died . The jury also ruled that 'ineffective' police training, procedural failures, failures to carry out a 'timely assessment' and a lack of communication may have also contributed to the death. In a statement delivered through the family solicitor, Kate Maynard, Mrs Michael added: 'We believe that if the police had not stormed into Jacob’s bedroom then he would still be alive. Instead he died on the floor of Runcorn custody suite while handcuffed, face down and with police officers treading on his legs.' A spokeswoman for Cheshire Police said the constabulary has already acted on information from the findings after a review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into its processes, procedures and training. New systems include: improved training around the condition of excited delirium; redesign of transport vans to improve the ability of drivers and escorting officers to monitor detainees; an ongoing roll-out of the issue of “long” handcuff keys to assist in the speedy removal of handcuffs. Deputy Chief Constable Helen King expressed the 'sincere sorrow' of the police that Mr Michael died in their care. She added: 'We are fully committed to ensuring we very carefully consider the findings we have just heard and we will diligently put in place those further steps that will help safeguard all who are dealt with by the police.' Deborah Coles, co-director of campaign group INQUEST, said: 'This was a shocking death. Yet again, another inquest into a death following use of force has found failures at an individual and senior management level, and those responsible must be held to account.'","Jacob Michael died of 'cocaine induced delirium'  but Cheshire Police may also have contributed to his death, inquest hears .

He also said investigators were . trying to determine if Sigg had access to a royal blue, four-door sedan . described by witnesses in both cases. The September child enticement cases involved a man who tried to lure two boys about the same age as Jessica into a car. No suspects were identified in those incidents. Sigg is being held without bail on . suspicion of murder and kidnapping in the death of Jessica, and . attempted murder and attempted kidnapping in the case of runner at a . neighborhood lake in May.

Foster, 19, said he didn't know Sigg . well, but 'he used to hang out with a lot of us in what we called the . goth corner (of the school cafeteria), where all the metal heads were.' 'He wore all black so he fit it,' Foster said. He added he wasn't surprised that Sigg left high school after the 11th grade. 'I know he didn't like his classes very much,' Foster said. 'He always complained about school.' Neighbor Brooke Olds, 13, said Wednesday she usually saw Sigg alone on a skateboard or scooter. 'He was shy and kept to himself,' she said.

But Westminster police . investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a . definite clue in the case. A spokesman told the Denver Post last . week that there was nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with . Jessica or was even human.

The grieving family of a deceased Californian man is now trying to find his missing body after the funeral home he was in closed down. Morris Carruth, 45, died of a heart on August 9, and his body was placed in the hands of Advanced Care Funeral and Cremation in Sacramento. But the Carruth family were never given Morris’s remains, despite asking the funeral home to cremate him two months ago. Advanced Care Funeral and Cremation in Sacramento lost the body after the business closed down . Carruth’s sister, Lisa Evans, said she visited the offices of the Sacramento company and found the funeral home closed down and cleared out. She told Fox40 News: ‘The new stress is now we can’t find his body. ‘He was to be cremated after the funeral, they told us the body would be delivered to us in two weeks, and it never happened.’ It has now been revealed that Advanced Care Funeral Services had their license revoked by the state of California and in consequence, shut down. The California State Cemetery and Funeral Bureau is currently investigating the company for mishandling five people’s remains and has a temporary restraining order. State agents also revealed the director of Advanced Care Funeral Services was only working minimal hours and might have authorised non-licensed people to work with the remains of bodies. Evans said she now has no idea where her brother’s remains are. ‘I owe this to him, most defiantly owe this to him, he needs to rest in peace and he is not in peace right now’, she said.

In a withering assessment of the close links between the police and the newspaper, it was claimed ‘professional boundaries became blurred, imprudent decisions taken and poor judgment shown by senior police personnel’. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said former Met Assistant Commissioner John Yates passed the CV of Mr Wallis’s daughter Amy to human resources director Martin Tiplady in January 2009.

Found 153 to 333 pounds underweight suffering now long-term dental and other health problems, the horses' discovery came after SPCA officers in Camden received an anonymous call last week reporting their dangerous conditions. The four mares and single gelding between four and 14 years of age were removed from the farm last Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Rescued: Five horses seen boney, diseased and malnourished were removed from a property in Camden where officials say the animals had been abused . Owner's care: Animal officials say the owner of the horses were ordered to see a veterinarian and take better are of them in July but a meal plan prescribed to them was not followed . Their owner, who has not been identified, faces numerous charges of animal cruelty. It was only last July according to the Kent County SPCA that the owner was ordered to provide nutritional and dental care for the horses. The owner complied with that order to seek veterinary care and received a specific nutrition plan to put the horses on a path of recovery, SPCA Major Brian Whipple told Delaware Online. They failed to follow the plan, however, with officials now finding the horses each 153, 203, 308, 315, and 333 pounds underweight. Diseased: In addition to being found malnourished, the horses also suffered rain rot, a skin disease that causes their coats to develop scabs and lesions . Starved: The horses were each found 153, 203, 308, 315, and 333 pounds underweight, their hip bones and rib cages easily visible . Moving forward: Once the animals' health is improved they will be up for adoption while their owner faces numerous animal cruelty charges . Seen with spotted coats, they also had developed rain rot, a skin disease that causes a matted coat and bumps that can escalate to scabs and lesions. When more healthy their dental problems will also require anesthesia, said Major Whipple. Once that is complete they will be available for adoption.

Vanished: Hany Nabil Mustapha, 46, was trying to sailing from Poole, Dorset, to Hayling Island, near Portsmouth . A BUSINESSMAN disappeared at sea only hours after buying a yacht and sailing off to meet his wife. Hany Mustapha was last seen sailing out of Poole harbour with his new purchase on Saturday, the day after he had celebrated his 46th birthday. He was planning to travel 46 miles to Hayling Island, near Portsmouth, where his wife Liz, 44, was to join him the next day. But his yacht, Brigand, was found grounded on a sandbank with the engine still running and one sail up, near Brighstone, Isle of Wight, at 5.15pm on Saturday. Despite an extensive search by coastguard helicopters and RNLI lifeboats, no sign of him has been found and the search was called off on Sunday. Coastguards had received no distress signal from the Brigand and it is believed Mr Mustapha was wearing a buoyancy aid rather than lifejacket when he left the harbour. An experienced yachtsman who is studying for his Master Yachtsman certificate, Mr Mustapha, from Worcester Park, South-West London, is a member of the Thames Motoring Yacht Club. Described as ‘fit and active’ by his surgeon father Nabil, he is also a keen sportsman who cycles ‘everywhere he goes’ and plays cricket and golf. The day before picking up the new yacht, he had celebrated his birthday at a Chinese restaurant in Surrey with his wife, his daughter from his first marriage, Nadia, 19, his parents, his sister May, 47, and her three children. His family said he had been excited about collecting the boat and his trip to Hayling Island. Mystery: 'Brigand', which Hany Mustapha had bought the same morning, washed ashore with nobody on board . Empty: Rescue services began a land, sea and air search after a member of the public found the boat . The small boat was found on the Isle of Wight with its engine running and one of its sails still up . He had driven down to Poole after the meal so he could be ready pick it up in the morning.Mr Mustapha is thought to have paid £750 for the boat, a  21-foot pocket cruiser, that had been advertised on eBay. His relatives are baffled at his disappearance. His mother Laila said: ‘He loves the water and he did it [sailing] impressed when I went on his boat. He is always very careful. If something about the water looked dangerous, he would not do it.’ She described her son and his wife as ‘very close’. ‘He has a very good relationship with his wife,’ she said. ‘She is always with him. She is a great rock for him. She encourages and supports him in every way.’ Beached: The boat ran aground on the Isle of Wight. Rescue workers are searching the area around The Needles (pictured) The birthday meal had been his daughter Nadia’s idea and she had come back from university in Aberystwyth to join the party, which was organised by her grandparents. 'He was so happy.' Mr Mustapha’s mother  said. ‘He was joking, asking me if I had to put the 4 and the 6 on his cake. He just said “thanks so much for all of this Mum”.’ Mr Mustapha is director of several IT businesses and was described by family as ‘very successful’ and ‘determined’. His parents are of Egyptian origin but he and his sister were born in Aylesbury.Neighbours in the cul-de-sac where Mr Mustapha and his wife live described him as ‘always smiling’. ‘We are all praying for him,’ said one. ‘He is such a nice person, he was always very friendly and good with the children. He is really lovely.’ A woman answered the door at the couple’s £430,000 semi-detached house but declined to comment. A Solent Coastguard spokesman said: ‘The search has been suspended but if we get any new information that prompts us to an area then we will recommence a search.’ Earlier this month, millionairess Mary Unwin, 65, disappeared on a voyage around Land’s End in her new £32,000 boat, a wedding present from her husband.

Even the most casual of viewers of the Olympics over the past two weeks could not have failed to spot the luminous yellow trainers that seemed to be worn by almost every athlete at the Games. The unmissable neon footwear dominated at the Olympic track and field events - with the most high profile outing of all being the moment Mo Farah sped to success in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres wearing the yellow spikes - amid a sea of fellow runners wearing identical pairs. In fact, an incredible tally of more than 400 athletes wore the brightly coloured trainers - meaning that barely an event went by without them making an appearance. A sea of yellow: Almost all the athletes in the men's 5,000 metres wore the Nike Volt running shoes - including twice Olympic champion Mo Farah, front right . Gold standard: Mo Farah speeds to victory in the 5,000m - adding to his 10,000m success earlier in the week . Of those 400, 68 athletes won medals - including a gold tally of 25. The gold-standard kit in question was the high-tech Nike Volt range - a collection of footwear designed especially for the Olympics by Nike. The collection covered footwear for athletes taking part in events on track, field and road, and a handful in boxing and fencing too. The trainers are tailored for each individual event, with 16 variations in total. Sprinters chose from a selection of four different spikes, including the . Nike Zoom Superfly R4, a shoe that . fuses Nike's revolutionary Flywire technology - a featherlight woven fabric that provides a dynamic, sock-like fit - with a lightweight spike plate. Winning style: The high performance shoes are described as Nike's lightest, fastest spike ever . Mo Farah raced to gold in the 5,000m . and 10,000m wearing the Zoom Victory Elite, one of three spikes created . especially for distance runners. Nike report that the Zoom Victory Elite . is the lightest, fastest 1,500m race spike they have ever made, combining what they describe as an ultra-responsive carbon plate with the dynamic Nike Flywire upper. For marathon runners, they created . the Nike Flyknit Racer, an ultra-lightweight trainer 'knitted' from . single lengths of high-tech thread meaning no bulk, virtually no seams . and no superfluous weight. The . marathon shoe weighs just 5.6 ounces for a size 9, and is engineered for a . precision fit to create a feeling of a second skin for the endurance . athletes for whom comfort is paramount. Nike say that the Flyknit Racer conforms with their commitment to combining 'high performance with environmentally sustainable design', because the knitted part of the upper does . not use cuts of multiple materials and sections found in traditional . sports footwear, thus reducing waste in the manufacturing process. So not only are the Nike Volt's bright yellow - they're green too. The .

Ciaran Finn-Lynch, pictured in 2010, had a windpipe transplant made with his own stem cells . A British boy who made medical history by having a new windpipe built from his own stem cells is still doing well two years after the operation. Doctors say Ciaran Finn-Lynch, 13, from Northern Ireland, has grown four inches in height and returned to school since the surgery. He is continuing to live a normal life free from medication to stop his immune system rejecting the transplant. Ciaran was the first child in the world to undergo the pioneering tracheal transplant. The procedure involved seeding stem cells taken from Ciaran's bone marrow into the collagen ""skeleton"" of a donor windpipe stripped of its own cells. Once the structure was implanted, the stem cells matured, grew and divided to create a new organ. A groundbreaking feature of the treatment was that the stem cells were allowed to mature in Ciaran's body, rather than in a laboratory ""bioreactor"". Ciaran, a keen drummer, underwent the operation at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in March 2010. The surgery was a desperate attempt to save his life after earlier treatment failed. The boy was born with a condition called Long Segment Tracheal Stenosis which left him with a very narrow windpipe, making it hard to breathe. A follow-up report published in The Lancet medical journal today said the new organ had strengthened and showed no signs of rejection. Doctors called for more research to speed up the recovery of future patients and increase the availability of donor windpipes, or tracheas. Dr Paolo Macchiarini from AOU Careggi Hospital prepares a windpipe for a teenage transplant patient in 2010 . Martin Birchall, Professor of Laryngology at University College Hospital Ear Institute, said: 'Since the treatment plan for Ciaran was devised in an emergency, we used a novel mix of techniques that have proved successful in treating other conditions. 'To minimise delays, we bypassed the usual process of growing cells in the laboratory over a period of weeks, and instead opted to grow the cells inside the body, in a similar manner to treatments currently being trialled with patients who have had heart attacks. 'We need more research on stem cells grown deliberately inside the body, rather than grown first in a laboratory over a long time. 'This research should help to convert one-off successes such as this into more widely available clinical treatments for thousands of children with severe tracheal problems worldwide.' Prof Birchall was a member of the transplant team led by Professor Martin Elliott, from Great Ormond Street Hospital.",Ciaran has grown four inches in height and returned to school since the pioneering surgery .

Shockingly, he describes seeing an American man climbing to the top of the world's biggest mountain carrying his bicycle with him. Speaking to The Guardian about the scene he photographed, Mr Dujmovits said: 'Watching them, I had a strong feeling that not all of them would come back, and I wrote as much in my internet diary.

Trapped: This image shows where the climbers photographed by Mr Dujmovits were pictured queuing . Mr Dujmovits had reached the South Col of the mountain - at a height of just under 8,000 metres, when he decided to turn back because of the stormy conditions at the summit. As he struggled to descent the mountain in treacherous conditions, he was left stunned to see the long queue of tourists slowly making their way up the mountain. According to the mountaineer, who was attempting to climb Everest for the sixth time, there were 39 expeditions taking place at the same time involving more than 600 people. He took the incredible images as he had never seen the feared mountain as crowded before. He described the weather prospects as being bad and the queues of people as appalling. He has since been pleased by the response his picture has provoked, and hopes it will prevent inexperienced 'hobby climbers' from attempting Everest.

Shah's last words were 'Save me' He described being left horrified by what he witnessed on the mountain, with people attempting the climb when they should never have even been allowed anywhere near it. This includes an: 'overweight French journalist – a small woman weighing around 80kg, who had used her entire supply of oxygen before she'd reached any height at all, and an American of Turkish origin who was carrying his bicycle with him because it had always been his dream to take it to the summit and insisted on fulfilling that dream at whatever cost'.

Huge swathes of the Gloucestershire countryside have been submerged underwater after the wettest April on record . Going under: Pictures from ground level show the extent to which Tewkesbury has been battered by flooding in recent days . On a day when 36 flood warnings were . in place across England and Wales and a 52-year-old man was killed after . his wife’s car was swept into 5ft of floodwater in Berkshire, the . Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury was facing the prospect of another . disaster. Jack .

Scores of people were trapped and hundreds of houses devastated on what became known locally as the Isle of Tewkesbury. Catastrophic: Five years ago one of the iconic images of the widespread flooding was this shot of Tewkesbury Abbey surrounded by water . Tewkesbury was turned into a virtual island after the 2007 floods, and as the River Severn burst its banks again this year there were familiar scenes .

Waterlogged: Farming fields in Gloucestershire also bore the brunt of the severe conditions which have emerged in the past week . Taking evasive action: Sheep and livestock were also forced to move away from the rising waters amid near-identical scenes to 2007 . Warnings: Rising levels of water have once again put Tewkesbury on high alert .

If we do... don’t quote me.’ Residents have been told that sandbags will be available from the council, but yesterday I saw none. There . may be a kind of taboo about putting them out early, but in any case, . several people told me, they are virtually useless at stopping anything . more than the wash from passing vehicles.

Newly obtained footage from security cameras at the Metro PCS store next door shows the gunman calmly walking to the salon and then running away less than a minute later, after the slayings. Killer: Bradford Baumet, 36, opened fire inside a Casselberry hair salon, wounding his ex-girlfriend and gunning down two other women . The Metro PCS staff are seen peering out the door and then running for cover inside the store when they hear gunfire. A second video shows Baumet in a McDonald's drive-through half an hour before the shooting took place. As they release the footage, police have also linked Baumet to the death of 28-year-old Roberto Colon, whose car he had stolen and was driving on the day of the shootings. Officers found Colon dead inside his home on Friday night after neighbours asked police to check on him. Authorities haven't confirmed whether they believe Baumet was responsible for Colon's death and it remains unclear whether or how the pair knew each other. 'It's a tragedy,' neighbour Miguel Torres told WDBO. 'When they told me about it, I felt bad, though, because he never looked for trouble with nobody. Everybody liked him.' Neighbours also told the TV channel that Colon was a friendly man who often lent his cars to people. Baumet shot dead the three women, including one who was five months pregnant, before turning the gun on himself on Thursday. Investigators say the gunman opened fire mid-morning in the Casselton Corners plaza shopping mall. Baumet’s . ex-girlfriend, Ms Santiago, 44, who managed the salon was shot five times, according to her ex-husband, William Ayala. Ayala said he had a daughter with Santiago and the girl lived with him. 'I heard he was violent and had a criminal record,' he said. Spree: Baumet was caught by security cameras before the shooting, left, and running away, right, less than a minute after . Massacre: A man opened fire inside Las Dominicanas M & M Hair Salon in Central Florida, killing three women and injuring another before taking his own life . Both she and . the owner, Eugenia Marte, had filed domestic violence injunctions . against Baumet in recent weeks. Santiago . was scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm on Thursday for a domestic . violence case, during which a judge would have decided whether to make a . temporary injunction against the man permanent. Josefa Herrera, Marte’s mother, told the Orlando Sentinel her daughter was among the dead. She also added that she had warned both Marte and Santiago to be cautious with Baumet because he would harm them. Dominicanas . employee Noelia Gonzalez, 28, who was five months pregnant, was shot dead along with salon customer Gladys Cabrera, 52, of Orlando. Victims: The gunman's ex-girlfriend Marcia Santiago, right, was injured, while salon owner Eugenia Marte, left, was killed . Motive: A relative of Baumet said he had mental illness issues and was in a rocky relationship with Santiago . Heartbreak: Friends of the victims react to the shooting at a central Florida beauty salon in Casselberry . One witness, who didn’t want to be identified, said the gunman was her family member and may have had some mental problems. 'My . cousin, he’s been having problems. He’s mentally, like, not there. We’ve been telling them to keep away from him, keep away from him. Get a . restraining order,' the woman said. Dead: Roberto Colon, 28, pictured, was found dead in his home the day after the gunman stole his car . Records in Florida and Rhode Island . show Baumet has been previously arrested for domestic assault, felony . assault, stalking, burglary and drug possession. The wounded victim was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in serious condition, Bay News 9 reported. Casselberry Police spokeswoman Sara Brady said two other women who were at the salon at the time managed to escape unharmed. The women hid inside a bathroom and one ran outside through a back door. Juan Diaz, who works at the nearby Metro PCS store, recounted to the Orlando Sentinel how he and his customers heard gunshots at around 11am and saw the gunman as he left the salon. 'We saw the guy with the gun in his hand…..coming this way…on foot with the gun in his hand. 'When . we realized the guy was gone … we went in the hair salon. And once we . were in the hair salon we just saw a bunch of dead bodies,' Diaz said. According to police, Baumet was found . with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound at a friends' house in a . residential area of Winter Park about five miles from the shopping . center. Seminole County Sheriff's deputies said he told friends: 'I have problems I cannot remedy,' before shooting himself inside the property. The shooter appeared anxious and agitated when arrived at the home in the 1300 block of Paradise Lane, telling the couple who lived there that he had some problems he could not remedy, police said. Shortly after, Baumet  committed suicide without revealing to his friends what he had done. Three people were at the house at the time of the shooting. Legal matters: Both Santiago, left, and Marte, right, both had filed domestic violence injunctions against Baumet . Baumet had had many . run-ins with the law in the past, with dozens of arrests in Florida and . Rhode Island, for charges that ran the gamut from making obscene phone . calls to stalking and burglary. As recently as last Sunday, the 36-year-old was in police custody for . allegedly operating a vehicle with a suspended license. He pleaded no . contest and was sentenced to time-served and a fine. In 2004, Baumet was arrested on charges of stalking and burglary. He . pleaded no contest, spent a short time behind bars and got two years of . probation. That same year, a woman filed a domestic violence injunction against . Baumet in Broward County. Earlier this year in Seminole County, Baumet . was sentenced to nearly a year in jail after pleading no contest to . selling pirated music CDs, according to court documents cited by the . Sentinel. Orange County court . records show that on October 5, Baumet drove to the Casselberry salon, . banged on the locked door and threatened to kill the women inside. Tragic end: The suspected gunman was found with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound in a residential area of Winter Park . Trail of violence: Baumet told his friends he had a problem he could not fix, but did no reveal to them what he had done . Just days later, both Marte and Santiago filed and obtained temporary injunctions against Baumet. ‘I am scared and feel my life is in danger,’ Santiago wrote in her injunction application. Santiago also told the court about previous incidents, where Baumet manhandled her, forced her to have sex and made threats on her life. ‘I did not file right away because Brafort [sic] threatened me that if I file an injunction that he will kill me,’ Santiago stated. ‘I got scared.’ Shortly after the shooting, about two dozen mourners gathered near the salon, located in a strip mall. Police taped off the parking lot and officers stood guard outside the business. Yellow paper covered up some of the glass windows. A Dominican Republic flag hung in the storefront along with a neon sign that read: Hair Cut. Color. Perm. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the shooting spree was the second time in three weeks that men hunted down their former girlfriends at central Florida workplaces and shot multiple people, then killed themselves.","Bradford Baumet, 36, opened fire in the Casselberry shopping mall at 11am on Thursday .

The teenage student who watched her legs get severed at the knees while she attempted to jump aboard a moving freight train has thanked her rescuers four months after the near-fatal accident. Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three male friends last September in Longmont. But the student, who had train hopped almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath its steel wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed under the 118-car train. Scroll down for video . Injured: Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three men last September in Longmont . ‘I remember looking down at my leg dragging on the ground and I saw how fast the wheels were turning and how fast the rails were going by,’ she said, reported the Longmont Times-Call. ’It almost occurred to me, and I was like, “Oh my god, I am gonna get”… and then it happened. I remember sitting there looking at my legs. She remembered being under the train for six seconds at the most, thinking to herself immediately after: 'A: What do I do now? B: What did I just do to myself?’ The four friends had visited Denver on Labor Day weekend and they had been given a ride by one of the young men’s fathers to Longmont on the way back to CSU, reported the Longmont Times-Call. But the father was unaware of the group’s plan to jump aboard a train from there to Fort Collins. Anna said their idea was quite common and the railway goes through the university campus. Wheelchair: Two employees at Longmont United Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured by Anna along with others at a ceremony on Saturday . Freight locomotive: The student, who had train hopped almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath the train's steel wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed . The student, who was 17 at the time, had just seen one friend make it onto the train and another slip but roll away to safety. She decided to go for it, despite concerns she ‘might not fare so well’. 'I remember looking down at my leg dragging on the ground and I saw how fast the wheels were turning and how fast the rails were going by' Anna Beninati . ‘I remember watching that and thinking: “Something tells me I shouldn't be running right now, something tells me that is going to happen to me”. I had this feeling and I went for it, anyway.’ One of her friends, Charlie Hamilton, 25, a former Army medic, pulled her from underneath the train and two hospital staff, who were stopped at a rail crossing, ran over to help him begin first aid. The employees at Longmont United Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured along with others at a ceremony on Saturday, reported the Longmont Times-Call. ‘I never would have made it this far if it weren't for these guys,’ Anna said she realised when she turned 18 on Christmas Eve last month. She has had 11 surgeries on her legs since the accident. In hospital: Anna Beninati, seen last September with friends, from left, Sean Halla, Charlie Hamilton and Micauley Ayraud in Longmont, Colorado. Anna, then 17, suffered the loss of both legs .

Barcelona's footballing superstars sent secret signals to Syria's gun-smuggling rebels during a match, the beleaguered nation's state TV has astonishingly claimed. Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Pedro were said to reveal the best way to bring arms into Syria during an El Clásico encounter against Real Madrid. In the outrageous Addounia channel footage World Cup winning midfielder Iniesta is said to portray the first part of the route, when arms are loaded from Lebanon. He passes to Messi who dribbles around several of the European Champions arch-rival's stars before setting up a goal for Pedro. Scroll down to see video... Outrageous: Ridiculous claims have said Barcelona star Lionel Messi (left) is helping Syrian rebels trying to oust President Bashar Assad (right) from power . Secret code: The way Lionel Messi and his Barcelona teammates play gave tips to Syrian rebels, it was claimed . His run, it is claimed, can be deciphered as a secret code used by rebels who can then draw a route into Syria by tracking the direction of the dribbles, passes and shot. The running commentary says: 'Here we see the first stage where arms are loaded from Lebanon. 'Then they pass through Homs and are delivered to another terrorist. We also see how they warn that they will face some obstacles until they reach Dayr Al Zawr. 'Then they are transported by bus to the final destination, located in Al Magadin.' Start of the move: Andres Iniesta starting of the move is said to signify the arms being unloaded out of Lebanon . Dribble sign: Messi's run, through his Real Madrid opponents, signifies how the rebels will face 'some obstacles' until they reach Dayr Al Zawr . End move: The goal, by Pedro, is decoded as the arms being transported by bus to the final destination, in Al Magadin . The staggering allegation is believed by some to be an elaborate hoax, while others see it as government propaganda. The ridiculous claims of Lionel Messi's co-operation with Syrian rebeal came as he became Barcelona's all-time record scorer. The 24-year-old Argentine ace (right) set the record last night in the 5-3 La Liga match against Granada at the Nou Camp. He equalled the mark of 232 official goals set by Cesar Rodriguez during the 1940s and 50s when he slotted home Isaac Cuenca's cross in the 17th minute. The then secured the record outright in the 68th minute when he lobbed the ball over goalkeeper Julio Cesar. The 24-year-old completed his hat-trick - his eighth of the season for Barcelona - in the 86th minute after rounding the keeper and slamming the ball into the roof of the net. The three-time FIFA World Player of the Year has scored an incredible 48 goals in 40 games for the Catalan giants this season. In his Barcelona career, he has netted an incredible 234 goals in 314 games. in just over seven years. Rodriguez took 13 years to rack up his impressive tally. Still more think the crazy claims about . the European Champions, sponsored by Qatar Foundation, were produced by . the rebels in a bid to make dictator Bashar Assad look foolish.Professor Mark Almond, of Oxford University, told the Sun: 'If I were a Syrian rebel, or someone sympathetic to them, I might make such a video to show the world how silly the Assad regime is.' The astonishing claims came as fresh violence erupted outside the capital Damascus, and in two of its suburbs, Hasrata and Irbin, and in the south, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon said the 'extremely dangerous' conflict could have global repercussions. The uprising that began a year ago has transformed into an armed insurgency that is pushing the country closer to a civil war. Because of Syria's close alliances with Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, there are deep concerns that the violence could spread beyond its borders, especially if other nations arm the rebels or send in their own troops. Ban said: 'We do not know how events will unfold. But we do know that we all have a responsibility to work for a resolution of this profound and extremely dangerous crisis. 'A crisis that has potentially massive repercussions for the region and the world.' The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, is the most potent armed group challenging the regime. But the group is outgunned and disorganised. Still, few countries are even considering arming the opposition, out of fear that it would make the conflict worse. Record breaker: The staggering claims came as Lionel Messi (centre) became Barcelona's highest scorer with a hat-trick against Granada . Searching: Syrian army soldiers pictured looking for rebels in Damascus yesterday . Falling down: Black smoke rising from buildings in Homs yesterday . The UN estimates that more than 8,000 people have been killed since the uprising began. Yesterday, Syrian soldiers backed by tanks seized the eastern city of Deir el-Zour from rebels, the latest opposition stronghold to fall to an offensive by the better equipped Syrian military. Activist Osama Mansour said government troops and armoured cars entered the city about 60miles from the Iraqi border from four sides, sparking short gunbattles with fighters from the Free Syrian Army. Mansour, reached by telephone in Deir el-Zour, said the rebels quit fighting and took shelter in homes and apartments, fearing that protracted clashes would destroy the city. Taking back rebel-held cities in the past weeks, government troops have often heavily shelled neighbourhoods before sending in troops, killing civilians and damaging buildings. 'They knew they could not hold control of the neighbourhoods, so they decided to stop fighting, knowing that the regime would bring in heavy weapons and kill many civilians,' Mansour said. He added that the rebels also lacked guns and ammunition.","World's best footballer, Andres Iniesta and Pedro said to reveal best route for arms into country by their dribbling .

A rare photograph of the Beatles that disproves a conspiracy theory about Sir Paul McCartney's 'death'  has sold for £20,000 at auction. The photo shows the band walking in the 'wrong' direction across the famous Abbey Road zebra crossing - and more importantly shows McCartney wearing a pair of white leather sandals. For decades fans of the Fab Four have suggested the singer was killed in a car crash and replaced with a lookalike - pointing to his barefoot appearance on the Abbey Road album cover as proof. Iconic image: Taken at the same time as the famous Abbey Road album cover in 1969, this picture clearly shows Paul McCartney, third from left, wearing a pair of sandals . The photo on the album cover was in fact just one of ten taken during the same 1969 shoot by photographer Iain Macmillan . The outtake has been kept hidden away by a music memorabilia expert who put it up for sale at auctioneers Bloomsbury in London on Tuesday. The print had an estimate of £10,000 but it ended up selling for nearly twice that amount, to an anonymous private British collector who bid £19,600. Alive and well: Paul McCartney on stage in Mexico City last week . Sarah Wheeler, the music specialist at auctioneers Bloomsbury, said: 'Both we and the vendor are thrilled with the price it achieved. 'Although there were 25 chromogenic prints of frame two of the shoot made at the time, it is still very rare for one to come on the market. 'The market is also very strong for Beatles memorabilia and it is these two reasons why it did so well.' Macmillan, who died in 2006, was chosen for the shoot in North London because he was friends with Yoko Ono. It was staged in August 1969 and featured John Lennon leading the band over the zebra crossing next to the Abbey Road studios. The location has become something of a mecca for Beatles fans, and thousands of tourists have the photographs taken at the pedestrian crossing every year. In 2010 the crossing was given Grade II listed status so it can be preserved for the future. According to a theory at the time, McCartney died in an accident and was replaced with a lookalike. Conspiracy theorists believed the Abbey Road cover contained clues, as the band wanted to reveal the truth of their guilty secret. John Lennon, in white was seen as a preacher leading a funeral procession, Ringo Starr’s black outfit indicated he was an undertaker, while a denim-clad George Harrison was the grave-digger. This left McCartney as the corpse because he was barefoot and out of step with the rest of the band. Other so-called ‘clues’ include a car number plate relating to his age - 28 - if he had been alive, and the grouping of onlookers. It was also claimed that the fact left-handed McCartney had a cigarette in his right hand had significance. The theorists constructed a back-story that McCartney had been beheaded in a car crash earlier in the 1960s and the Beatles had continued with a replacement . The band, and Macmillan, always denied this. McCartney insisted he had merely kicked off his sandals because it was a hot summer’s day. On the day of the photoshoot, The Beatles were dressed in the suits of Tommy Nutter, Savile Row’s enfant terrible of the time – all except George Harrison, who insisted on wearing denims.

"Nicholas Gough, 59, tried to persuade his victim to blame the family's dog after she was left disfigured . By . Katherine Faulkner . PUBLISHED: . 17:58 EST, 23 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 23 March 2012 . Vicious: Father-of-six Nicholas Gough, who admitted wounding with intent . A teacher bit off his wife’s nose during a row – then tried to persuade her to tell doctors the family dog did it. Nicholas Gough, 59, attacked his wife Lynne in their garden gazebo after drinking a bottle of wine. The ‘possessive’ science teacher swore at the 52-year-old and held her down on the floor. He then sank his teeth into the end of her nose, leaving her face pouring with blood. After the attack, Gough tried to persuade his wife to blame the injury on their pet. Instead she reported him to the police and yesterday he was jailed for five years after admitting wounding with intent. Sentencing him at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Judge Martin Walsh said the attack had left his wife ‘disfigured’ for life. ‘You grabbed her by the throat and tried to kill her,’ he said. ‘She has had to have three operations and required plastic surgery.’ Mrs Gough watched in the public gallery surrounded by family as the sentence was passed. Neither she nor her former husband showed any emotion as the sentence was handed out. The couple had been married for 24 years and had three children together, as well as three others between them from previous relationships, the court heard. Gough was a ‘well respected’ teacher of science at the West Bromwich Phoenix Collegiate Academy, and also worked as a volunteer for the NHS in his spare time. Scarred: Lynne Gough arrives at Wolverhampton Crown Court, where her estranged husband was jailed for five years for biting off the tip of her nose . But beneath the façade of their happy marriage, Gough was a jealous and possessive husband who constantly accused his wife of being unfaithful. In June last year, Mrs Gough left her husband for a work colleague, saying she had ‘had enough’ of his controlling behaviour. But after her new partner died suddenly the following month, she reconciled their marriage and returned to their four-bedroom home near Wolverhampton. On the night of the attack last September, Gough had returned from work and drunk a bottle of wine in just half an hour. Seeing his wife was upset over her deceased partner’s birthday,  he became ‘aggressive’, the prosecution said. Gough launched a tirade of abuse at his wife and accused her of having an affair with a soldier. Hoping he would calm down, she left the house, returning 15 minutes later to sit in the gazebo of their garden. But five minutes later, Gough reappeared and launched his attack. ‘He repeatedly punched Mrs Gough to the face using  both of his hands,’ prosecutor Sati Ruck said. ‘The defendant dragged her down the bench by her legs, pinned her arms down, placed his mouth over her nose and said, “No one will want you after what I am going to do to you”. ‘He then bit the tip of her nose. ‘The defendant then leaned in close and said, “Stop screaming, I am going to kill you”. He tried to strangle her, and said, “If I can’t have you no one else will”.’ Defending the teacher, John Rowe said he had suffered a breakdown due to the pressures on their marriage, as well as those he was facing at work.‘He stands before you a man in turmoil,’ Mr Rowe said. ‘He accepts responsibility for his actions. He can’t fully remember the incident.’ Mr Rowe added: ‘He was a positive role model for teachers and pupils at the school. ‘He was clearly a man who was a positive part of society for 59 years. He has found himself in a waking nightmare, a man tormented to despair at the thought of what he has done, the pain he has inflicted on his wife.’","Nicholas Gough, 59, tried to persuade his victim to blame the family's dog after she was left disfigured ."
"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 18:53 EST, 21 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 25 March 2012 . Hot food bought from bakeries and supermarkets is to become more costly thanks to George Osborne's Budget, it emerged today. The Chancellor has decided that VAT at 20 per cent should be added to all hot takeaway food, not just products sold by fast food chains. This means that at the Greggs bakery chain 18p will be added to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll and 30p to a £1.49 pasty. The revelation came as millions of pensioners counted the cost of Mr Osborne's £3.5billion tax grab. The Chancellor has decided that VAT at 20 per cent should be added to all hot takeaway food, not just products sold by fast food chains . The 'takeaway  tax' means the price of a £5 hot rotisserie chicken at a supermarket will rise by a £1. Mr Osborne said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies. His decision will raise an extra £125million this year and £350million a year by 2016. George Osborne said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies . The Government insists the new regime will simplify the tax rules surrounding take-out food. However, a guidance note issued by Whitehall suggests it may fuel confusion. The note states that 20 per cent VAT will have to be added to all hot food, including rotisserie chicken, pies, pasties, toasted sandwiches and other products which are ‘above the ambient air temperature at the time they are provided to the customer’. This means anything that is hotter than the surrounding air temperature when it is handed over at the till should carry VAT. However, the same note to retailers states that a shop can sell a selection of cold sausage rolls, pasties or cooked chicken, which are below the surrounding air temperature, without applying the sales tax. But the main focus of the Budget has been the so-called 'granny tax'. The Treasury was taken aback by the strength of the backlash against Mr Osborne’s decision to freeze or axe tax allowances to be able to raise threshold at which workers start paying income tax. The . tax raid, described privately by some Tory MPs as a serious political . mistake, overshadowed other measures in the Chancellor’s widely trailed . statement. So strong was the reaction that Mr Osborne was forced to go on a charm offensive this morning to explain his position. He toured television and radio studios . to defend his reforms against accusations he was penalising millions of . pensioners while some of the country’s richest people would enjoy a cut . in taxes. He said: 'We’ve tried to spread the . burden as fairly as possible across the income deciles. We’ve definitely . focused our efforts on the top 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent . have had more loss as a percentage of income as well as absolute . amounts. 'Inevitably when you are saving . welfare, you affect people in receipt of welfare. But it is improving . their work incentives as well. We are trying to sort out a welfare . system where it didn’t pay to work.’ Other VAT changes announced by the . Chancellor will see the sales tax applied to sports drinks in the same . way that it is already charged on sugary fizzy drinks. In . future self-storage firms, which effectively rent secured rooms for . people to store their belongings, will have to add VAT to their service . charges. At the same time, hairdressers who rent a chair in a salon will have to pay VAT on the fee, which will be passed on to customers in the form of more expensive cuts. The new regime comes into effect in October. Audrey Fearing, VAT partner at Ernst & Young, warned: ‘Consumers can expect to see the cost of some of their favourite hot pies, pasties and the like jump by 20 per cent.’ Greggs condemned the move, saying: ‘We . do not believe that our freshly baked savoury products should be . subject to VAT and we will be making strong representation to the . Government regarding the proposed changes.’ Among . the changes buried in the Budget smallprint is the decision that VAT is . also to be added to the cost of alterations, such as extensions, to . listed buildings including churches. Treasury documents suggested that . at least some of this increased cost to churches would be offset by . improvements in government grants. Greggs . reported profits of more than £50million in both 2010 and 2011. The . results were due in part to a rapid expansion that has seen the bakery . chain increase its number of stores. It now boasts nearly 1,500 outlets . in the UK – more than McDonalds. There are plans for the figure to reach . 2,000. In 2009, a study found that annual sales of pies nationwide had reached £941million. The Chancellor made a series  of bold statements during his Budget address. Here, JAMES SLACK  examines whether he was giving the public the full . picture. Claim: Cutting the top tax rate from . 50p to 45p will cost only £100million. ‘The new taxes I’ve introduced on . the rich today directly raise five times that amount.’ Reality: The actual cost of cutting the top rate of tax to 45p is . £3billion. The Chancellor assumes he will get £2.9billion of this  back . from people who – because of the high rate – currently avoid paying all . the tax they owe. Labour says it is a huge gamble to assume that the tax . cut will make people change their behaviour. If less than £2.9billion . is recovered, the central claim – that, overall, the wealthy will pay . five times more than the cost of cutting the 50p rate – collapses. Experts say that it is inevitable the wealthy will find ways of seeking . to avoid his two new taxes, on expensive properties registered overseas. Claim: 'Some would have been tempted . to spend the windfall (from the transfer of £28billion of assets from . the Royal Mail pension fund to the Exchequer). I do not propose to . spend it. Instead, I have used it to pay off debt.' Reality: A disingenuous statement. The pension fund may have £28billion . of assets – but it also has crippling historic liabilities of around . £37.5billion. In effect, Mr Osborne has saddled the country with an . extra £9.5billion of future debt. In a sleight of hand, only the assets . of the fund are included in the  Treasury accounts. The liabilities – to . be met by future generations – are not. Claim: ‘Over time we will simplify the . tax system for pensioners by doing away with the complexity of the . additional age-related allowances...It is a major simplification. It . saves money. And no pensioner will lose in cash terms.’ Reality: Pensioners will consider these weasel words. Age-related tax . allowances will be frozen – and stopped altogether for anyone turning 65 . after April 5, 2013. This means that, every year, they will lose their . value in real – rather than cash – terms.  An estimated 4.41million . people will be worse off, by an average of £83, in real terms in . 2013-14. People turning 65 next year will lose up to £322. Claim: ‘We have...scrapped the last Government’s fuel duty escalator of . annual above-  inflation rises, regardless of the oil price – and are . today confirming the fair fuel stabiliser. Government has eased the . burden on motorists by £4.5billion at a time when money is very short.’ Reality: The Freight Transport Association says the stabiliser is a . ‘damp squib’ as it only serves to prevent prices falling too low, not . soaring too high. It stops way short of demands for a proper stabiliser . which means duty would fall when the price of oil rises, and vice versa. The increase in fuel prices since 2010 has put on an extra £14.46 for . petrol and £17.60 for diesel each time drivers fill an  average tank. Claim: ‘We’re publishing our plans today to remove loopholes and . anomalies (in VAT), but we keep the broad exemptions on food, children’s . clothes, printed books and newspapers.’ Reality: From now on, VAT will start  applying to hot food bought in . supermarkets,  such as roasted chickens, sausage rolls bought from . bakeries and sports drinks, along with  holiday caravans, and the rental . of hairdressers’ chairs.  There will be further VAT rise of over . £350million a year starting on October 1, 2012.","At Greggs the move will add 18p to a 90p sausage roll and 30p to a pasty .
The price of a £5 hot rotisserie chicken at a supermarket will rise by a £1 .

Don Lemon is the latest CNN anchor to say ‘n*****’ during a live broadcast that went unbleeped, though he said the racial slur while discussing the ethics behind the decision of many journalists to refrain from saying the entire curse on air after deeming it too offensive. Mr Lemon was specifically talking about when the curse was used in the context of a story, or when journalists are reading a quotation that uses the word. During that discussion, Mr Lemon- who is African American- said that by refusing to say the word when used in the context of a story, journalists were effectively lessening its impact. Added to the list: Don Lemon is the latest CNN anchor to say 'n*****' during a live broadcast that went unbleeped . ‘I think it takes the value out of what that word ready means, especially when we are reporting it,’ he said. ‘And I don't care what color the reporter is, I think someone should say, ""That person calls someone n****,"" instead of saying the N-word, because I think it sanitizes it,’ he said, using the full word during the quotation. Mr Lemon went on to clarify his distaste for the word, saying: ‘I hate it in music. I hate in those kinds of things. I hate one when it's misogynistic 's and rap and all that. But what I'm saying is in the reporting of a story, you should say the word not to sanitize it.’ The discussion was particularly poignant because another CNN reporter did just that the following day, leading to a backlash from viewers. Susan Candiotti was reporting on the . Good Friday shooting spree in Tulsa, in which a white man named Jake . England randomly gunned down five black victims on the second . anniversary of his father's death - he had been shot dead by an African . American. On Thursday, a day before the shootings, England took to his Facebook page to vent his anger about the man who shot him dead.

Apology: At the end of Ms Candiotti's report, anchor Fredricka Whitfield, left, said 'We apologize to our viewers for the profanities used' When quoting England's Facebook page in her news report on Sunday for CNN Newsroom, Susan Candiotti repeated the profanity he used. 'Today is two years that my dad has been gone, shot by a f****** n*****.' The network did blur the words out when it showed a graphic of the post. Ms Candiotti had prefaced the comment by saying, 'Please excuse the language, it's very sensitive.'

Explaining the June killing of Craig Anderson, 47, Griffin says: 'Deryl Dedmond backs up and gets a good aim and just plows him over on the way out.

Miss Hogg described the moment she was . told as the ‘worst moment’ of her life – but kept her grief to herself . while she competed on the programme. However, days later she was fired by Lord Sugar, in scenes shown to viewers this week. Miss Hogg said: ‘When you hear that . someone you cared for deeply – and who did something as amazing as . giving you a child – has gone through that ordeal it hurts like mad. It . was really disturbing.’ The 28-year-old was taken aside during . filming in October and told that her former partner, Chris Lindsay, had . been killed in a vicious street attack in the Costa del Sol. The pair were in a relationship for two years before separating eight weeks after the birth of their son Reece, now four. The exact circumstances surrounding the 34-year-old’s death during a work trip to Spain remain a mystery. The salesman became separated from colleagues and was later found on the roadside, viciously beaten. He never regained consciousness and died from liver failure five days later in hospital.

Controversial Facebook pages that pit good looking children against each other in a bid to find the 'most beautiful teenagers' have been branded as 'bait for paedophiles'. Several contests have been set up in recent weeks inviting youngsters to post provocative pictures of themselves so they can be rated by other users. Hundreds of boys are seen posing without their tops on, while girls as young as 12 pout for the camera wearing skimpy outfits or bikinis. The one who receives the most votes each week is then named 'most beautiful teen'. Controversial: Facebook pages that pit good looking children against each other in a bid to find the 'most beautiful teenagers' have been branded as 'bait for paedophiles' Suggestive: Several pages have been set up in recent weeks inviting youngsters to post provocative pictures of themselves so they can be rated by other users . But the seemingly innocent past-time has sparked a rash of complaints from parents - who say online predators will use the pages for 'the wrong reasons'. They are also angry about the comments posted by 'internet trolls' on some of the photos - which has seen young girls and boys labelled as 'fat', 'too ugly' and 'disgusting'. Other comments on 'contestants' include: 'I wouldn't touch her with a 10ft pole', 'her nose is too big' and 'pluck dem eyebrows gurl'. A backlash by Facebook users saw the site shut down the 'most beautiful teenager in the world' page, which had almost 100,000 users, earlier this week. Taken down: This page has been partially deleted by Facebook after complaints from parents and security experts . Problem: But a host of other similar pages have sprung up in its place . Facebook said the page violated its statement of rights and responsibilities and added: 'We don't tolerate bullying and take action on content reported to us which we categorise as such.' But a raft of similar sites have sprung up in its place. A disabled teenager targeted after posting a photo of herself on one of the pages has launched a campaign against the bullies. Andie Proskus, 19, said she was not letting the incident 'bring her down'. And she and now wants others 'to know there is help you can get and things do get better'. Wheelchair-bound Proskus, from Portland, Oregon, who has the muscle weakening disorder myopathy, added: 'I stand up for myself and others who are getting bullied. They include 'Teenage Natural Beauty Contest', 'Competition for the most beautiful teenager' and 'Competition for the most beautiful teenager in Europe'. A mother from Wigan, England, issued a warning after she saw suggestive remarks posted under photographs of her daughter on one of the pages. Paula Jones told WiganToday.net that, underneath a photo of 12-year-old Michaela, were comments from two men. She said: 'One was asking how old she was and then one asked if she knew what a paedophile was and to look it up. 'She deleted her photo and left the group. When I clicked on the link there were lots of young girls, of a similar age. 'There were some very crude and suggestive remarks and men asking girls to add them as Facebook friends. 'These girls are only young and would take the comments as a nice compliment and not know what they are getting into.' Issues: The seemingly innocent past-time has sparked a rash of complaints from parents - who say online predators will use the pages for 'absolutely the wrong reason' Abuse: Parents are also angry about the comments posted by 'internet trolls' on some of the photos - which has seen young girls and boys labelled as 'fat', 'too ugly' and 'disgusting' Paula's friend Joanne Boxell added: 'The stuff written on the site is disgusting. We have tried to report it but the person who runs this Most Beautiful Teens group keeps changing the site details. 'It just isn't normal and girls and their parents need to be warned and made aware of this.' Concerned Marcy Kemp-Rank, whose 15-year-old daughter Amy posted a picture on the site, also said she was 'horrified' by some of the comments. She told ABC News: 'She read them [the comments] to me, several of them. I couldn’t handle hearing them because it just made me very upset and angry. 'I think that was a good thing they took it down.  I think it was a way of bullying.' And the British based Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre also warned children of online dangers. A spokesman said: 'Children and young people always need to think very carefully about the information, videos and pictures they put online or exchange with friends. 'You can pass over ownership and therefore lose control of anything published and anyone can then change or share the images.

Among the spectacular terrain of the Andes mountains, there should have been plenty of opportunities to capture footage that would dazzle viewers. But while explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes was prepared for almost any eventuality on the trip, it seems he may not have been prepared to leave such things to chance. The adventurer has been accused of faking accidents with the help of an Oxford graduate to make his expedition look more exciting on television. Scroll down for video . Sought compensation: Miss Harrison sued the travel company that supplied the guides after claiming they should have stopped her taking part in the stunts . Sir Ranulph, described as ‘the world’s greatest living explorer’ by the Guinness Book of Records, wanted to show a dramatic fall as he crossed a glacier but did not want to perform the stunt himself, the Court of Appeal heard. Natalie Harrison said he suggested over dinner that she should perform the fall instead, and she agreed. Miss Harrison, now 38, was filmed for a television documentary as she jumped across a glacier crevasse but pretended to fall short, leaving her dangling from her climbing ropes. She said the glacier stunt caused long-term headaches and a second staged fall, during a mountain climb, left her with soft tissue damage to her neck. Volunteer: Natalie Harrison (pictured outside court, left)) revealed how she was asked to take part in fake mountaineering accidents by legendary explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, including this staged fall (right) Sir Ranulph, who was the first person  to have climbed Mount Everest and crossed both polar ice caps, sent her a £200 cheque for four osteopath sessions after she contacted him about her neck injuries from the trip to Ecuador. Miss Harrison, of Portland, Dorset, took legal action against the holiday company which provided guides for the expedition and told the Court of Appeal the firm owed her a ‘duty of care’ and should have stopped her from performing the stunts. Sir Ranulph, 68, was not directly involved in the court battle but lawyers claimed the staged falls were his idea. The court heard that the former Army officer invited Miss Harrison on the expedition to the Cotopaxi region of Ecuador as a ‘thank you’ for work she had done on his 2003 book, Scott of Antarctica. US television network HBO sent a cameraman with them as they headed across the Andes in October 2004. Instigator: Sir Ranulph said he 'wanted to secure some exciting footage for the cameraman' during a trip to the Cotopaxi region of Ecuador in October 2004, a court heard . Adventurers: Sir Ranulph and Miss Harrison on a ride during their expedition in Ecuador in 2004. Miss Harrison had been invited along as a 'thank you' for helping him with his book, Scott of Antartica . Faked accidents: Legendary explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes addresses the camera in a promotional video for adventure holiday company Jagged Globe (Alpine) in the Cotopaxi region of Ecuador in 2004 . Lord Justice Pitchford said: ‘Sir Ranulph suggested they should undertake a staged fall which would be captured on camera. The victim would fall into a crevasse. Miss Harrison volunteered to be the victim. ‘She would jump a crevasse, fall slightly short and be held suspended on climbing ropes by the guides. The stunts were suggested as an exciting piece of footage by Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Miss Harrison was present at supper when this was discussed. ‘Sir Ranulph Fiennes did not want to do the stunt himself, that is why she volunteered. She volunteered freely and without compulsion. Hair-raising: Sir Ranulph hugs Oxford graduate Natalie Harrison on a training expedition in Cotopaxi before the HBO trip, when she suffered head and neck injuries after volunteering to take part in the stunts . Stunt-shy: The 68-year-old adventurer (pictured) suggested to Miss Harrison that she take part one of the falls because he was 'not willing to perform it himself' Poetic licence: The stunts involved 'pretending' to fall down a crevasse in a glacier and another one during a climb (not pictured) ‘Sir Ranulph Fiennes wanted to secure some exciting footage with the cameraman in attendance. It was his idea but he didn’t want to perform it himself.’ During the first stunt, the crevasse leap, Miss Harrison’s head hit the wall of the glacier and she claimed it had caused long-term headaches. In a second faked accident, she pretended to fall while climbing and said it caused a soft tissue injury to her neck. Thankful: Jagged Globe boss Simon outside the Court of Appeal after judges overturned a decision by a lower court to award compensation to Miss Harrison for her injuries sustained on the trip . Her lawyer Sarah Prager said the guides provided by climbing holiday firm Jagged Globe were asked to provide for her safety and to supervise the expedition. She told the court: ‘They failed to prevent those stunts taking place and provided negligent advice, and Jagged Globe is liable for the negligence.’ Patrick Limb QC, for Jagged Globe and its owner Simon Lowe, said the company could not be held responsible for injuries Miss Harrison suffered while performing television stunts. He questioned why Sir Ranulph did not give evidence, saying: ‘If leadership involves responsibility – and it does – Mr Lowe regrets that Sir Ranulph Fiennes was so absent a figure in regard to the trial. I say this openly.’ Last year Miss Harrison won her court case when a judge found Jagged Globe was liable for her injuries, opening the door for a damages payout of up to £30,000. But yesterday the Appeal Court exonerated the Sheffield-based holiday firm of any responsibility, and ordered Miss Harrison to pay legal costs of £50,000. Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting with Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Lloyd-Jones, said: ‘The guides were able, experienced, conscientious and diligent... The execution of stunts formed no part of the package provided by Jagged Globe to Miss Harrison.’ He added: ‘When a person is perfectly well aware of the risk they are taking, the defendant doesn’t owe such a duty.’ Miss Harrison refused to comment as she left court. Mr Lowe said the five-year legal fight had been ‘a dreadful battle’. He added: ‘The question of why Sir Ranulph didn’t come forward and take responsibility is one for him.’ Sir Ranulph, who lives in Exmoor, Somerset, with his second wife  Louise Millington, was unavailable for comment. His office said he  was ‘away’. It was not clear if HBO used any footage from the expedition. • PRESENTER Griff Rhys Jones admitted misleading BBC viewers by falsely claiming to have reached the summit of Ben Nevis in his 2007 series Mountain. He later admitted he was 400ft short of the 4,406ft peak, but blamed thick fog for obscuring his view. • Survival expert Bear Grylls faked a bear attack on his Born Survivor programme by getting a colleague to dress up. Grylls also apologised for ‘misleading audiences’ in scenes where he was apparently abandoned in the wild, but a source claimed the star actually stayed in a motel. • A scene in Gordon Ramsay’s series The F Word was faked to make it look as if the celebrity chef had caught several fish at sea. He was filmed during an expedition into coastal waters and returning to the shore with a number of sea bass, but it emerged that an expert caught some beforehand to guarantee Ramsay had something to cook. • A British TV company was accused of mistranslating quotes from an Amazonian tribe to make them look ‘savage’ and ‘sex-obsessed’ in documentary Mark & Olly: Living with the Machigenga, which aired in the US.

The 17-year-old honour student forced to spend a night in jail for missing too much school after she worked two jobs to keep her family afloat has had the charges against her dropped. There was international outcry after Texas teenager Diane Tran was ordered to spend 24 hours behind bars, with thousands of people donating a total of $100,000 to a fund send up by supporters. Now, as the teenager has the charges against her dismissed, she has also refused to accept the generous sum, explaining: 'There's some other kid out there struggling more than me.' Scroll down for video . Relief: A judge has dismissed the charges against honour student Diane Tran after she spent a night in jail for excessive truancy from school. She worked two jobs to support her siblings . Justice of the Peace Lanny Moriarty dropped the charges against her after looking into her extenuating circumstances, the Houston Chronicle reported. They were also dismissed as court summons did not notify the student of her right to an attorney or to have one appointed for her, officials said. The Chronicle reported Moriarty had counseled Tran when she was first summoned to court for truancy in April and explained the importance of attending school. But on May 23, she was brought back after she missed an extra four days at school, as well as parts of a further four days. During these visits, she never indicated her home issues, he said. Support: People from all over the world donated to a fund to help Diane Tran to support her family. But the teenager has refused to accept the $100,000 raised . Her attorney, Brian Wice, told the Chronicle Tran was under an incredible amount of pressure from her extra work and had not known what to tell the court. 'She is not someone unwilling to come to class because she's attending a rock concert,' Wice said. 'She's an incredible gal who is working and studying sometimes 24 hours a day and contributing to her siblings' support more than a teenager should have a right to do.' After her parents got divorced, her mother left the state and her father often worked too late to come home. She began supporting her older brother and younger sister. After going to school from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m., she worked full-time at a dry cleaner's, and on weekends, she helped organise weddings for a local business. She told KHOU 11 News that she missed around three days of school every month because of sheer exhaustion. Devastated: Diane, who spent a night in jail, was not told she had a right to an attorney, officials said . Abandoned: Her parents divorced 'out of the blue' and left Tran and her two siblings to fend for themselves . To help her cope, Louisiana Children’s Education Alliance set up a website, HelpDianeTran.com, demanding justice for the teen and raised more than $100,000 for her family. LCEA president Charlie Davis told Fox News that the . story of Ms Tran is just one example of a ‘student who’s obviously . working so hard and is being taken advantage of by the system.’ He . continued: ‘I think Diane unfortunately is at the centre of two failed . systems in America – our public education system and our judicial . system.’ Mr Davis said he hopes the 17-year-old student puts the money to supporting her brother and sister, and her college education. But ABC reported that she had refused to accept the donation, saying: 'There's some other kid out there struggling more... than me.' U-turn: Judge Lanny Moriarty had ordered Tran to pay a $100 fine, but has now dismissed the charges . Honour student: Tran works a full time job, a part-time job and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School near Houston, Texas . Since her story spread around the world, the Texas teenager told KHOU that she’s fixing all of her attention on finals, and will grant more interviews once the school year is over. According to Texas state law, . students who are absent from school without parental consent for three . days in a four-week period or ten or more days in a six-month period are . subject to prosecution. The exact punishment for offenders is left for the judge to decide. Parents of children who miss excessive amounts of school may also be prosecuted. The strict law is in place to keep students in school and learning. According to Texas state law, Ms Tran . violated the state’s truancy laws, which do not allow more than 10 days . of absences within a six-month period. Ms . Tran said she works a full time job, a part-time job, and takes . advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School. '[I . take] dual credit U.S. history, dual credit English literacy, college . algebra, Spanish language AP,' she said of her impressive academic . workload. However, the high-achiever cannot devote as much time as she would like to her schooling as she often misses an entire day, reported KHOU. Ms Tran said that her parents divorced 'out of the blue,' leaving her and her two siblings to fend for themselves. And . so, it fell to Ms Tran to support her siblings, who include an older . brother at Texas A&M University and a younger sister who lives with . relatives. Local authorities are using Ms Tran's case to crackdown on truancy. At the sentencing, Judge Moriarty ordered the exhausted student to pay a $100 fine and spend 24 hours in jail as a lesson. 'If you let one [truant student] run loose, what are you gonna' do with the rest of 'em? Let them go too?' he said. Ms . Tran's employer at the Waverly Manor wedding venue, where she works . over the weekends, suggested that the authorities should 'help [the . family], don't harm them'. Offering help: Louisiana Children's Education Alliance president Charlie Davis helped raise more than $100,000 for Ms Tran . Her co-worker and classmate Devin Hill told the network how hard her friend works. 'She goes from job to job, from school, she stays up 'til 7 o'clock in the morning to study,' she said. On the homepage of the school's website, there is a warning to students to be vigilant about their attendance. 'Should a student have multiple unexcused absences and a pattern of failing to attend school regularly, the law is clear that the matter becomes the jurisdiction of the court system,' it states. However, locals are arguing that Ms Tran's case is unique and should be treated with more leniency. Ms Tran, in the meantime, is worried this could mar her future ambitions - she one day hopes to become a doctor.

The incredibly-rare French-made Panhard-Levassor motor, one of only hundreds made for Britain, was picking up London's upper classes in 1910, and is now up for auction. Toot toot! This incredibly rare original London black cab from 1910 has emerged from a barn in Gloucestershire where it has been languishing for 15 years . Piece of history: The black cab was in its heyday 100 years ago and still retains its taxi meter and includes switches in the back so the passengers could tell the driver which way to go . With its original taxi meter, and century-old intercom system, it has not been seen widely since 1955,  when it appeared alongside star Moira Shearer in the 1955 flick ‘The Man Who Loved Red Heads’. The car, which has a top speed of 40mph, has been kept in a barn near Wotton-Under-Edge in Gloucestershire for the last 15 years. Now, it could fetch more than £20,000. Richard Edmonds, whose saleroom is selling the car, said: 'Panhard-Levassor was a quality French manufacturer. Off the road: The 102-year-old cab in the barn at Gloucestershire, and it has now been beautifully restored and prepared for sale . History: A newspaper article about the car being bought 60 years ago. It has been in the same family ever since . 'They were the original black cabs and took over from horse drawn . carriages. I expect most of them have been destroyed and we don’t know . how many are left. The first London black cab - a horse and coach - appeared in the 17th Century, named after the French term hacquenée, which means literally 'ambling nag'. In 1625 there were as few as 20, operating out of pub yards. Until 1831 anyone, generally, could drive one until The London Hackney Carriage Act was passed, and the Met took over licensing the trade. Then 60 years later fixed fares ended when the taximeter was invented and added, allowing drivers to charge for each trip individually. It also led to the name 'taxi'. The first motorised version came towards the end of the 19th century, and was electrically powered. Around a decade later petrol cars took over but they were from all over the world and different shapes and sizes. It was only in the 1930s that the cabs had to be British and the last horse and coach taxi disappeared in 1947. 'This is in great condition with the original leather interior and it . still has its meter. There is also a mechanism for the passengers to . tell the driver which way to go. 'It has a 16 horsepower . engine with a three speed gearbox and would have gone about 30 or 40mph. 'It has wooden wheels with early pneumatic tyres and has paraffin powered lights on the front and back. 'It became a minor celebrity in its own right and made public appearances and appeared in films. 'I’m sure there will be a lot of interest at the sale.' The French firm made 1,400 of the cars, with 800 right-hand drive versions being exported to the UK. It is not known how many are left today. Its history with the family that now owns it began when a Reverend Martin Atkinson saw it by chance in Liverpool, where it was due to be exported to America, and bought it in the 1950s. It has remained in the family ever since. The auction will be held at The Castle Combe race circuit, Chippenham, Wilts, on June 30. Long gone: In the past London was filled with carriages like this one, but motorised vehicles spelled the end for them .","The 102-year-old cab is up for sale and could fetch more than £20,000 .

General Sir Peter Wall said military chiefs had been ‘unsuccessful’ at ensuring the forces reflected the make-up of British society. The Chief of the General Staff said the Army could reach full strength only by getting better at recruiting from ethnic communities, who make up 29 per cent of young people of fighting age, and women. Important: Army recruits from ethnic communities make up 29 per cent of young people of fighting age. Sir Peter Wall said the Army had to get better attracting such recruits and women . The country’s top soldier said: ‘For a long time we have been trying to get the balance in the Army across the piece, including female soldiers, more in kilter with the make-up of British society. ‘We have made strenuous efforts in the past to correct this imbalance, without startling success. ‘Those who are serving from different ethnicities in the Army are making a huge contribution on a day-to-day basis and on operations. We need to acquire more of them.’ In December, the Royal Navy broke with 100 years of tradition to allow women to serve on submarines for the first time. General Wall says there could be significant ‘side benefits’ from boosting recruitment, especially from Muslim communities and places from where there is a terror threat. Benefits: General Wall says there could be significant ¿side benefits¿ from boosting recruitment, especially from Muslim communities and places from where there is a terror threat . The Army was ‘very proud’ of soldiers from foreign and Commonwealth countries who had joined up, but recruitment ‘at home’ was vital to ensure the force was at full strength. General Wall’s comments to a conference organised by the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, echoed those made last month by Philip Hammond when he indicated regiments with significant numbers of soldiers from Commonwealth countries would be abolished or merged. The Defence Secretary said the most vulnerable units were those that failed to recruit their full  complement of soldiers in Britain and made up their numbers from Fiji and the Caribbean. The Army will be downsized from 102,000 personnel to 82,000 by 2020 in an effort to cut costs. The Ministry of Defence will inform another 2,900 soldiers as early as next Tuesday that they are to be axed, shrinking Army numbers to 97,000 – their lowest since the Crimean War. About 1,000 posts will be axed in the RAF and 300 in the Navy. Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former commander of British troops in Bosnia, warned the cuts would see the Army reduced to little more than a home guard. He said: ‘An Army used to be defined by being 100,000-strong. If it is less than that, some people argue it is a self-defence force. We will certainly carry less clout in the world.’ Mr Hammond is poised for a bitter backlash over plans to slash the number of Army regiments. Women wanted: Women like teritorial army soldier Nina Dainese, pictured, could make a big difference to British forces fighting abroad . The last cavalry regiment in Wales, the 1st Battalion The Queen’s Dragoon Guards, has already launched a campaign to save itself from the chop. Ray Scanlon, whose son Richard, 31, died in Afghanistan serving with the unit, said: ‘My son would turn in his grave if he could know what was going on and be doing the same as me – standing up to bureaucracy, standing up for Welsh life.’ Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy accused Mr Hammond of ‘presiding over decline, not planning for the future’. He said: ‘The Government plans to plug self-made capability gaps rather than reform our forces for the future.’","Army could only reach full strength by getting better at recruiting from ethnic communities, says general .

England striker Jermain Defoe returned flew back to England today after learning that his father had died after losing his battle with throat cancer. The Tottenham striker left England's hotel ten minutes before the rest of the squad boarded a coach for their first training session in Poland having only arrived in the country on Wednesday evening. Defoe – dressed in jeans, trainers and a black top – was escorted from the Stary Hotel by an FA chaperone and taken by car to Krakow airport for a flight back to the UK. Scroll down to hear from Jermain's team mate Joe Hart . Jermaine Defoe (right) left Krakow this morning following the sudden death of his father, Jimmy, (left) The Daily Mail has learned that . England manager Roy Hodgson was 'aware' of the illness affecting Defoe's . 47-year-old father and knew there was a possibility that the player . might have to return home to be with family and friends sometime during . the tournament. 'Jermain's father had been ill for some time,' said an FA source. 'He had been treated for throat cancer . at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London for some time so this was not a . bolt from the blue for Jermain. Defoe pictured leaving the England team hotel in Krakow, Poland, 10 minutes before the rest of the team was due to start training . 'He was told the sad news that his father had passed away overnight and we made plans for him to fly home as soon as possible. 'Jermain is a strong lad and was quite . pragmatic about events. Roy Hodgson felt it was right that he flew back . immediately to be with his famly. 'He will miss at least two days of . training prior to the opening match against France on Monday therefore . we do not know if he will play any part in that game.' As Defoe flew home his England . teammates took part in a 'closed' training session in Krakow before . manager Roy Hodgson was due to speak to the media this afternoon. Eight years ago it was revealed that . Defoe's dreadlocked father Jimmy, 39 — who split with Jermain's mum when . he was a baby — was living on £53.05 a week benefit. The jobless decorator lived in a small . shared flat in Forest Gate, East London, just six miles from where his . millionaire son was then living with his mother Sandra. Jimmy was reportedly not receiving any . financial help from Jermain but said at the time: 'I am so proud of . him. He is a fantastic player. But we live in different worlds.' Jimmy married Sandra in 1981 but the couple split soon after Jermain was born in 1982. Defoe then stayed with his mother who has since remarried. Tottenham Hotspur released a . statement on the club's website which said: 'Jermain Defoe has returned . home from the England squad base in Poland this morning after receiving . the sad news of the passing away of his father overnight. 'Everyone at the Club sends their sincere condolences to Jermain and his family.' The FA said in a statement 'Jermain . will re-join the England Euro squad in due course.

The Football Association and England manager Roy Hodgson have said they will offer Defoe as much time off as he needs and still view him as a central component of the squad, even though he was unlikely to start against France. Roy Hodgson was aware of Defoe's father's condition ahead of his death and has said he will support the player . It was Defoe whose goal against Slovenia in the last World Cup propelled England into the knockout phase, although he has been a peripheral figure for much of the European Championship qualifying campaign after scoring a hat-trick in the win over Bulgaria in September 2010. With Wayne Rooney suspended, either Danny Welbeck or Andy Carroll will get the nod against the French, with Ashley Young expected to operate just behind. In 2009 Defoe's brother, Jade, was . killed following a street attack in Leytonstone, east London, when his . skull was fractured and suffered devastating brain damage.

Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts revealed today that she will undergo chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant after being diagnosed with a blood and bone marrow disorder called MDS. The 51-year-old, who battled breast cancer in 2007, said her older sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, will be her donor, as she is a perfect match. This morning's announcement triggered an outpouring of support for Roberts, who has co-anchored the ABC show for seven years. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Robin Roberts revealed that she will undergo a bone marrow transplant after being diagnosed with a blood and bone marrow disorder MDS . Fight: The anchor said she will undergo chemo and a bone marrow transplant this year as 'pretreatment' for the disease, which she says she has known about for several weeks . The award-winning broadcaster, who grew up in Mississippi, became a trending topic on Twitter and more than 13,500 people commented on an ABC post on Facebook. A tearful Roberts tried to smile as she spoke about the disease live on air this morning. 'It is something that is called MDS… . It is a rare . blood disorder that affects the bone marrow,' she said. 'I'm going to beat this. My . doctors say it and my faith says it.' MDS, or myelodysplastic . syndrome, is a blood and bone marrow disease once known as preleukemia . because of the progression that can be seen from MDS to leukemia. Actor Rob Lowe was one of the first people to show his support for the journalist. 'My best thoughts to Robin Roberts at #GMA. She's a great lady and a fighter,' he Tweeted. ESPN broadcaster Erin Andrew added: . 'Sending all the best to @RobinRoberts..I hate to hear she's going thru . this, but know how hard she'll fight.' Roberts' co-anchor George Stephanopoulos, who held her hand during this morning's emotional annoucement, Tweeted: 'All our love and prayers with @RobinRoberts. She’ll beat this with all the grace & grit she’s had her whole life.' Perfect match: The 51-year-old said that her sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, right, is going to be her donor . Proud: Good Morning America co-host George Stephanopoulos told Roberts that he was in awe of the way she handled her diagnosis . About 18,000 . people develop MDS each year and it can affect all blood cells, . leading to problems such as anemia, infections and bruising. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells. Age and past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy affect the risk of developing the disease. It affects about 18,000 people each year - but only several hundred of those are as a result of cancer treatment. Symptoms can include shortness of . breath, weakness or feeling tired, skin that is paler than usual, easy . bruising or bleeding and fever or frequent infections. The primary approach to treating MDS is a bone marrow transplant. The more closely matched the donor . and recipient are, the more likely the immune system will not reject the . new marrow and treatment will be successful. Roberts, who reportedly has a net worth of $14 million, said she contracted the disease through her treatment for breast cancer. She will undergo chemo and a bone . marrow transplant this year as 'pretreatment' for the disease, which she . says she has known about for several weeks. She revealed that she will begin . treatment today, which is why she shared the news live on air because . she did not want viewers to be concerned if she turned up to work in bandages tomorrow. 'It's about focusing on the fight and not the fright,' Roberts said. The veteran anchor said she was given . the upsetting diagnosis on the same day she found out she would be . interviewing President Obama. While some of her bone marrow was extracted for testing, she was told . that she would be meeting the President the next day, which is where Obama revealed his support for gay marriage. 'The combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having . a drill in my back reminds me that God only gives us what we can handle . and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into . the absurdity of life,' she said in a blog post.

While she says she will miss some days off work because of the treatment, she is determined to remain on the air. 'Bottom line: I’ve been living with this diagnosis for a while and will continue to anchor GMA,' she added in the post. 'I love what I do and the people with whom I do it. Along with my faith, family and friends, all of you at ABC News give me the motivation and energy to face this challenge.'

The body of a sixth family member who fell out of their plane before its crash Thursday afternoon has been recovered approximately a half a mile from the wreckage police in Florida report. Officers with the Polk County Sheriff's department believe 13-year-old Boston Bramlage was thrown from his family's aircraft immediately before its crash landing near Tampa. About six feet of the plane's right wing fell off prior to its crash and is still unaccounted for with an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board on-going. Scroll down for video . Siblings: The body of Boston Bramlage, seen with his other three siblings, was located on Friday a day after his parents' plane crashed leaving no survivors . Scene: The 13-year-old was found about a half mile away from the scene of the crash, where the rest of his family was found . 'We know there is a gaping hole in the aircraft in the area of one of the seats,' Polke County Sheriff Grady Judd told KCTV during their search efforts for the boy. Boston's parents Ron Bramlage, 45, and Rebecca Bramlage, 43, as well as siblings Brandon, 15, Beau, 11, and Roxanne, 8, all from Junction City, Kansas, were killed in the wreckage. Mr Bramlage, a business man who owned Roadside Ventures LLC, was piloting the  2006 . Pilatus Pc-12/47, a single-turboprop, fixed-wing . plane he purchased just one month ago when it went down around 12.30pm. 'The pilot of another aircraft heard the pilot of this aircraft announce a mayday, gave his call sign, but was not specific about the nature of the emergency,' Tim Monville, a Senior Air Safety Investigator with the NTSB told WOFL. Tragedy: Piloting the plane, businessman and philanthropist Ron Bramlage (left), perished with his wife, Rebecca (right) after returning with his family from the Bahamas . Several witnesses reported seeing the aircraft appearing 'flat' and 'rotating' before its crash, according to Sheriff Judd. The family were returning home from a vacation in the Bahamas where they have relatives. Over 100 volunteers scoured the rural terrain before the boy's discovery Friday. 'We are looking for this child as if he were our child out here,' Sheriff Judd told KCTV during their search. 'It's pretty rough terrain, the only real way to access it is by swamp buggy, or ATV,' Joe Brooks, who is an investigator with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission told WOFL. In the family's hometown, friends gathered to light candle's outside their home, both overtaken by the news but relieved after the last family member's recovery. Crash: The family was returning home to Junction City, Kansas when the plane's right wing came off, sending it spiraling to the ground according to witnesses . 'It's just a horrific loss,' Junction . City Mayor Pat Landes said, adding that the couple supported many local . projects and provided college scholarships. The family was well known . in town and at Kansas State University, where the basketball arena is . named for Ron Bramlage's grandfather. At least two dozen bouquets of flowers . lined the black wrought-iron fence surrounding the family's ranch-style . home by Thursday evening. A trampoline sat in the front lawn, and a . hammock hung between two large trees in the wooded yard. Standing in his front yard across the . street, Rick Bazan said he had been friends with Ron Bramlage since . childhood. He said his friend would often help local families . financially, such as paying for kids to go to wrestling camps if their . parents couldn't afford to send them. Condition: Ron Bramlage only purchased the plane a month ago before its crash Thursday afternoon . Unclear: The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, and parts of the plane were found miles away . He said Rebecca, who was president of the local school board, 'never stopped working. She was tireless.' She would be embarrassed by the outpouring of support now at her home, where at least a half-dozen friends of the couple's children were always running around, Bazan said. 'It's going to be a long time getting over this one,' he said as he watched the family's neighbors and friends gather outside. Bella Omann, 14, who went to middle school with the two younger boys, said Beau 'was really the funniest kid I've ever met.' She had an advanced geometry class with Boston, whom she said 'loved reading books. We would always talk about our favorite books,' including the Harry Potter novels. He read so much, she said, that their teacher wouldn't allow extra material on students' desks to keep him from reading. Search efforts: Over 100 volunteers searched for the boy who is suspected as having been sucked out of the hole left by the plane's detached wing . Another neighbor, Joann Williams, recalled driving by the home and seeing the children bouncing on the trampoline. 'They were just a beautiful family. They were just so together, cohesive,' she said. The couple were graduates of Kansas State University and members of the K-State Alumni Association, President's Club, Foundation Trustees and Ahearn Fund. 'The Bramlage family holds a special place in the history of Kansas State University and K-State Athletics, and Ron and Becky have been loyal supporters and great fans of K-State. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bramlage family during this difficult time,' University President Kirk Schulz and Athletics Director John Currie said in a joint statement. Ron was the grandson of the late Fred Bramlage, a 1935 graduate of K-State and Junction City businessman. Fred Bramlage was the lead contributor to the construction of Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that opened in 1988 and is home to the K-State men's and women's basketball teams. Mourning: Beloved in their hometown, friends left flowers and lit candles outside the family's house in mourning . A library in the city is named for Ron Bramlage's grandmother, Dorothy Bramlage. Ron Walker, superintendent of the local school district, said the family was down-to-earth despite their wealth and famous name. He said Rebecca, along with heading the school board, was a board member of the local school foundation. 'I've been here about 10 years now. She and Ron, they were among the first people to greet me. I didn't even know they had any wealth at all for about five years. It was just, ""How can we help you, how can we serve?''' The 4,900-acre Tiger Creek Preserve about 50 miles southwest of Orlando contains hardwood swamps, hammocks, scrubby flatwoods, pine flatwoods, sandhill and longleaf pine/wiregrass habitat, according to its website. The family had stopped for customs in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had taken off half an hour before the crash.

For three decades, it has teased afternoon television viewers with its classic murder mystery plot . So you would imagine Agatha Christie’s drama Death on the Nile would be the last thing to fall foul of the censors. Yesterday, however, TV watchdogs ruled that the 1978 thriller – starring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot – is too violent to be screened on daytime television in its uncut form. Murder Mystery: Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot (standing) in a scene from Death on the Nile . Following a single complaint from a viewer to Ofcom, ITV executives have promised that in future they will edit the closing scene, which shows a character committing suicide, when showing the film before the 9pm watershed. The move comes despite the fact that the film has already been shown before that time on more than 20 occasions since 2004 alone. A viewer complained after the film was shown at 3.30pm on Saturday, March 17. In the closing moments, after the murderer has been identified, the character Jackie de Bellefort – played by Mia Farrow – shoots her lover in the head off camera. She then puts the revolver to her head and shoots herself, causing blood to trickle from the wound. The viewer complained to Ofcom that the scene was too violent to be transmitted when children would have been watching – breaching the rule that violence shown before the watershed must be justified by the context. Ofcom yesterday criticised ITV for screening the scene. ITV said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that Agatha Christie detective stories were not of particular interest to children . It said: ‘Her suicide was shown in some detail and was not appropriately limited. ‘Given the Saturday afternoon scheduling of this film, our assessment was that it was likely that a significant number of children would have been watching ITV’s main and public service channel at this time.’ It said audience figures indicated that 71,000 viewers watching were under 16. ‘While recognising the importance of including such a pivotal scene, we were concerned that the impact of the second gunshot was not edited or removed,’ it said. ITV said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that Agatha Christie detective stories were not of particular interest to children – especially younger children. But it said: ‘In keeping with our periodic review of pre-watershed material and in the light of viewer concerns, particularly those of parents, we undertook some additional editing of this scene for future daytime broadcasts.’","Viewer complained to Ofcom about scene where woman puts revolver to her head and shoots herself .

Moe Sbihi, Britain's first Muslim Olympic rower, was worried that the clash of Ramadan and the Games would affect his performance . It was a sporting quandary with uncanny echoes of the movie Chariots Of Fire. When Moe Sbihi was selected for the British Olympic 2012 rowing squad, he was naturally delighted – but his joy quickly faded when he realised he might not be able to compete properly because of his religious convictions. Unfortunately for Moe – Britain’s first Muslim Olympic rower – the Games fall during Ramadan,  when Muslims may not eat or drink in daylight hours. Moe, the son of a Moroccan father and English mother, knew that failing to eat properly would badly affect his performance in the men’s eight, so considered postponing his fast. But an imam he consulted warned that for each of the 30 days of Ramadan that he transgressed the rules he would incur an entire month of fasting later on. ‘That could have meant years of not eating between sunrise and sunset,’ Moe, 24, told The Mail on Sunday. Desperate to find another solution, he then heard about Moroccan goalkeeper Badou Zaki, who though a Muslim never fasted during his time at Real Mallorca  in Spain’s La Liga. Instead, he would go to Morocco each year to pay for thousands of meals for the poor. A cousin in Tangiers, the home town of Moe’s father, consulted scholars to come up with the final answer. Moe would follow the example of Ezzaiki and provide 60 meals for the poor for each day he misses the fast. So this summer, up to 1,800 people in Morocco will eat a meal thanks to a 6ft 8in rower chasing a gold medal in the UK. He will pay for the food by donating £1,000 to a British charity, Walou4us (‘nothing for us’), which helps homeless children in Morocco, and giving a further £1,000 to the poor via his family. ‘Scripture says you must fast unless you . have “due cause”. The way I see it, I have a cause, which is the Olympic . Games,’ Moe said. Sbihi is looking to tackle the issue by providing meals for 1,800 people . 'A few people have mentioned the comparison with Chariots  Of Fire. It was a tough decision. 'I wanted to pay my dues in full and I’m very fortunate that I can.' The 1981 film Chariots Of Fire told the story of runner Eric Liddell at the 1924 Paris Olympics. The devout Christian refused to run a heat in his best event, the 100 metres, because it was on a Sunday, but then ran the 400 metres in world record time to win gold. Moe is one of an estimated 3,000 Muslim athletes at the Games  who will cope with Ramadan in a variety of ways. Special provision has been made in the Olympic  Village for those who fast, including pre-dawn breakfasts. All competition venues will also provide a meal immediately after sunset. Chariots of Fire: Moe's story has been likened to the 1981 film about Christian runner Eric Liddell at the 1924 Paris Olympics who refused to run on a Sunday but then ran 400 metres in world record time and won gold . He said: ‘The decision I’ve made  is the right one for me, but there will be athletes who are fasting and others who postpone their fast, or do what I’m doing, but everyone’s making their own decision for themselves.’ Brought up in Surbiton, Surrey, Moe was spotted by a GB Rowing scouting programme visiting his comprehensive school when he was 15 years old. Going on to study sports science at St Mary’s University College, Twickenham, he fasted for a month in 2010 to investigate the results while still training. The effect was dramatic. ‘I normally weigh about 16½ stone but during fasting I stuffed my face at 4am trying to eat enough to get through the day. By nightfall, I weighed 11lb less than in the morning.’ Badou Zaki, who played in goal for Morocco (left) and also managed the national team (right), never observed Ramadan while playing in Spain, instead choosing to feed the poor in his homeland .","Religious rules prevent him eating and drinking in daylight hours .
Imam warned him that for each day he transgressed the rules he would incur an entire month of fasting .
Now he plans to emulate Moroccan goalkeeper Badou Zaki who would go to to his home country each year to pay for thousands of meals for the poor ."

Friends of the hospital receptionist allegedly shot dead at point-blank range by a prominent surgeon have revealed she was 'deathly afraid' of the man, her former boyfriend. Jacqueline Wisniewski, 33, was lured into a stairwell at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday morning and shot multiple times in the head and upper body, police said. The woman, who had a young son and was training to be a nurse, was allegedly gunned down by her ex-boyfriend Timothy V. Jorden, a former Army weapons expert who is still at large. Her friends have now revealed that Wisniewski had been in an abusive relationship with the man, who allegedly stalked her and once held her captive in her home, wielding a knife. Scroll down for video . Fears: Jackie Wisniewski, left, was allegedly shot dead at blank point range in the hospital where she worked by former boyfriend Dr Timothy Jorden, right, who friends say was abusive . 'She told me, ""I'm scared"",' her friend, Heather Shipley, told the Buffalo News. 'She said: ""If anything happens to me, you know who did it"".' Shipley said Wisniewski had . lived with Jorden but left him as she believed he was having affairs . with other women. When they broke up after more than a year of dating, he refused to move on. Wisniewski . said the surgeon had put a GPS tracking device in her car to keep track . of her movements. After she discovered the device, she filed a police . report, Shipley said. '[He] knew everywhere . she was going,' Shipley told WIVB. 'He was driving by her house, sitting in . the parking lot across from her street, stalking her.' On another occasion, he held her . captive in her home for a day and a half with a knife and stabbing her deep enough to draw blood, the . friend said. He also once gave her a black eye, she said. 'He threatened to kill her a couple . of times,' Shipley added. 'But I think in her mind she wouldn't believe . it would actually happen.' Victim: Jackie Wisnieski, 33, had a young son and was studying to become a nurse . Split: She dated Jorden for a year and lived with him, but they broke up as she thought he was having affairs . But she added: 'She was afraid of him. She was deathly afraid of him.' Shipley . said she believed her friend did not speak out more as she loved him. 'She didn't want to get him in trouble because he was a surgeon and she . didn't want to ruin his reputation,' she explained. Wisniewski's boss at ECMC's Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Dori R. Marshall, said the woman had told her she was in an abusive situation with a physician, but did not name him . Cheektowaga . police told the News that Jorden had been involved in two domestic . incidents in 2003. 'It didn't involve this victim,' said Capt. James J. Speyer Jr. 'It was other people.' The 49-year-old prominent trauma surgeon and former Army medic has eluded authorities since the shooting on Wednesday morning. Witnesses reported hearing four shots just after 8 a.m. Ms Wisniewski's body was found in a covered passageway connecting the Kidney Center and another wing of the hospital. Killed: Ms Wisniewski told a friend Dr Jorden put a GPS device in her car to track her movements . Tears: Friend Heather Shipley revealed Wisniewsi was 'deathly scared' of Dr Jorden but loved him . The shooting prompted a four-hour . lockdown of the hospital, as SWAT teams and K-9 units swarmed the campus . in an attempt to corner the killer. Authorities . blocked a road leading to Jorden's home in an isolated area of private . Lake View residences near the Lake Erie shore. Officers . obtained a warrant and used specialised robotic devices to . enter and search the home. But hours later, they determined he was not inside. SWAT team members in camouflage . arrived in unmarked SUVs and say he may be armed and dangerous. Police believe Jorden, who they have . named as a 'person of interest', could be 'special weapons trained' from . his time in the Army. While many have described him as a popular surgeon, sources told the Buffalo News that he has recently suffered some emotional problems and it is believed he had recently lost 75 pounds. Hunt: The hospital went into lock down as officers - on the ground and in the air - searched for the gunman . Lockdown: SWAT teams swarmed the 65-acre campus but the gunman has not yet been found . 'He . might have been having mental health issues,' a police official told . the News. Another official suggested he might have 'some type of serious . physical ailment that caused the drastic weight loss'. Sources . added that it appeared the man had been living in his office as food . containers and dirty laundry were found in the ceiling. 'Person of interest': Surgeon Timothy Jorden was said to have been suffering from emotional problems . Neighbours said he started losing the weight around three months ago, when they also began seeing him at the home less frequently. Officials said as many as 400 patients and about half of the hospital's 2,000 employees were on the grounds at the time of the deadly shooting. 'The . SWAT Team is in control of the situation,' Buffalo police spokesman . Michael J. DeGeorge said during a news conference after the shooting. 'It is an active situation.' The hospital also diverted emergency room patients to Buffalo General Hospital but most of the campus re-opened at 2 p.m. 'Normally this is very safe,' hospital volunteer Lois Peterson told the Buffalo News. 'I've . volunteered here for 42 years. But this is tragic.' Police described Jorden as a bald, . black male, about 6ft 2 and 250 pounds, and showed his photograph at . check points in the search for tips. Authorities also described the four vehicles - two GMC Sierra pickups, a Cadillac and a Chevrolet Cobalt - registered in his name. After completing high school, Jorden . joined the Army and served with the Army's Special Forces, as a weapons . expert then as a medic. His military career spanned 18 years and he served in the Caribbean, Japan and Korea. He earned numerous medals including . the Army Achievement Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Master Parachute . Badge Scuba Diver Badge Special Forces Tab, ABC reported. Francisca Wellsbury, who was married to Jorden before they divorce, told ABC she was shocked her former husband was the suspect. Law enforcement: Authorities, who also swarmed Jorden's home, said the shooting was 'not a random act' Police presence: Officers hand out photographs of Jorden, who is a 'person of interest' in the crime . Patrol: Staff and patients were refused entry to the hospital over a four-hour period . 'We've . lived separate lives for a long time,' Wellsbury, who lives on the West . Coast, said. 'I'm just as shocked as anyone. It's traumatic.' She added: 'This is not the person I knew. I wish he would seek help.' Jorden has been licensed to practice . medicine in New York since 2002 and treats patients at the medical . center and other major hospitals in the area. 'I've . wanted to be a doctor since early in my military career as a medic,' Jorden told the Buffalo News in a 1996 profile, which featured pictures . of his wife and their son.

A family of eight are fighting to save their property - after discovering that a planned high speed rail network could leave them homeless. Widow Vikie Shanks, 54, and her seven children are set to lose out if their seven bedroom home is compulsorily purchased to make way for the HS2 line - just 130-metres away. All the money from the buy up would go straight to the family’s mortgage lender - leaving them with no money to spend on another home. Desperate: Vikie Shanks (far left) and her seven children could lose their home if it is compulsorily purchased by HS2 . They have now filed a lawsuit in the hope they can challenge the amount they will be offered by the new high speed London to Birmingham rail network. Vikie said: 'I have been hit hard by the depression and with a family with seven children it is hard to keep up with payments. 'When my husband died I sat the children down and they were adamant they wanted to stay here. The happy memories with their dad are here. 'I promised them I wouldn’t leave and that the house would always be in the family. 'Bearing in mind I have four autistic children I can’t even move the dining room table without them having a melt down. 'I can’t and I don’t want to think about moving them out of this home - let alone having nowhere else to go.' Homeless: Vikie Shanks says all the cash from the buy up would go straight to the family's mortgage lender - leaving them with no money to spend on another home . Home: The family have a strong emotional connection to the house in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, and are distraught that they might lose it . The large family have lived in the house, in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, for 25 years. They formed a deep emotional attachment to the home after the death of husband and father, Paul, in 2007, which left the family clinging to the last remaining memories of him. But they discovered the planned HS2 network high speed rail link between London and Birmingham will pass through their 13 acres of land - just 130-metres from their home. Some homes on the train line route face being the subject of a Compulsory Purchase Order by the network - which pays an aggravated valuation of each house. Before his death Paul took out a £600,000 mortgage on his house - but the family now say the house could be worth just £400,000. Vikie said: 'The compensation scheme gives you the market valuation of the house, which then goes straight to your mortgage lender so you don’t get to see it at all. 'At the moment my house is valued at £200,000 lower than my mortgage - which leaves me with £200,000 left to pay. 'I would end up bankrupt without a home and with no ability to buy one - how can that possibly be legal?' Vikie, who runs a corporate entertainments business, currently only pays the interest on the mortgage because she cannot afford to pay anymore. Autistic Nikita, 14, Osborn, 13, and Pippa, 11, each attend special schools and due to the severity of their condition cannot be moved through fear of making their situation worse. Difficult: According to their mother Vikie four of the Shanks children have autism and would find any move very traumatic . Circled: The Shanks' home could be demolished to make way for the HS2 rail link from London to Birmingham . Their worried mother fears that by losing the house she may have to look else where for somewhere to live, uprooting her children and losing the stability they have. She said: 'It will devastate my children. I can’t imagine how it will affect them. 'I just couldn’t change their schools - it would be the worst thing I could contemplate doing, I just couldn’t think about it. 'I’m very anxious, we’re all very anxious. My life is tough as it is but now I have to deal with this as well. 'I don’t mind still having the debts and the negative equity but I need some where which is equivalent. 'How can it possibly be right when I’m going to end up in a situation where I will be homeless? 'The government should re-house them in the same type of property with similar debts.'The lawsuit, against Secretary of State for Transport, Justine Greening, was filed by her 21-year-old daughter, Jamie Shanks, who is receiving legal aid for the case, on May 22. She said: 'This is our home and it represents 25 years of blood, sweat and tears by my parents. 'We can’t take our memories that the house represents with us. This is our sanctuary.' A spokeswoman for HS2 said: 'We have advised the Shanks’ family that their building has not been identified for demolition or as being at risk of demolition in our assessments to date. 'According to the land ownership information we have obtained from Land Registry, the line does appear to pass through some of the land associated with the Shanks’ property. 'Until further design and planning work has been completed we are not in a position to confirm the extent of the land that would need to be acquired. 'We have advised the family that if it did become necessary to buy land which they own, they would be fully compensated for it.'","Widow Vikie Shanks and her seven children could lose their home and be left with no money to purchase another .

Accused: Nicholas Saunders, pictured arriving at Gloucester Crown Court today, had sex with his ex-wife's dog after she rejected his advances, it is alleged . A man rejected by his ex-wife went on to have sex with her bull mastiff dog shortly afterwards, a court heard today. Kelly Thacker claims to have found her ex-husband Nicholas Saunders, with whom she has two children, in her bed having intercourse with the animal on January 15 last year. The 46-year-old denies the charge but accepts he was naked in the bed with the dog. Gloucester Crown Court heard Saunders had been kicked out of his house following an argument with his girlfriend and had sought out sympathy at his ex-wife's home. The pair had remained on friendly terms following their separation and Saunders, from Lechlade, Gloucestershire, had visited Mrs Thacker and stayed overnight at her house in the past. But, the prosecution said, Saunders was looking for more than just comfort that night and when Mrs Thacker made it clear to him he did not have a chance with her he turned to the large dog, named Sasha. Frank Abbott told the jury of seven women and five men that Saunders had got undressed and climbed into Mrs Thacker's bed while she went downstairs to sleep. He said: 'A little later, the dogs - one of which is a bull mastiff, a large dog - came upstairs and laid on the bed. He said to the dog ""You've just ruined my chances."" 'Meanwhile, downstairs in the lounge, Mrs Thacker could hear things going on upstairs. She heard the defendant rummaging around. 'She then heard him whistle to the dogs, which had since gone downstairs, and they went upstairs. 'Sasha, the dog, got onto the bed. Mrs Thacker became curious and she went upstairs. 'She saw him, in fact naked, the dog on the far side of the bed facing away from the defendant and that he was clearly trying to have sex with the dog. 'She couldn't believe what she was seeing.' Defendant: Saunders, pictured leaving court with an unknown woman, had been kicked out of his house following an argument with his girlfriend and had sought out sympathy at his ex-wife's home . The jury was told Saunders claims he was in the bed with the dog, but denies trying to have sex with it. Following his arrest Saunders provided police with a sample from his genitals and forensic examinations showed the DNA of a dog was found, Mr Abbott told the court. He added: 'There is no doubt that that is the position and that supports what the witness said happened.' He told the jury they would have to consider the possibility the dog left DNA on the bed and because Saunders was naked it could have been picked up from the covers. But he also asked them to think about where the DNA had been found on Saunders' penis. Giving evidence, Ms Thacker, who was married to Saunders from 1999 to 2002, told the court the incident left her in 'utter shock'. Ms Thacker, who owns a male boxer as well as the bull mastiff dog, said her ex-husband turned up at her house at about 1.45am and was 'a little bit drunk' following the argument with his girlfriend. She said: 'He was staggering a bit. He said ""She's f***** me about again"". I presumed that she'd been seeing someone else.' She told the court that later that night she went upstairs and was looking through the banisters when she saw Saunders with the dog. A bull mastiff: The jury was told Saunders claims he was in the bed with the dog, but denies trying to have sex with it (file picture) She said: 'It was just too quiet, whereas he'd been mumbling before, so I thought I would just go and check. 'I didn't go all the way up, just halfway to the top banister.' Ms Thacker said she saw Saunders trying to have sex with the animal. She told the court: 'I think I must have hit some kind of shock and I hid back a bit. I then looked round again. 'He was on all fours holding her thighs. He was having intercourse with her. She wasn't even moving. 'I plucked up the courage to go upstairs and told him to get out. He jumped off the dog and laid down and just said he was tired.' Ms Thacker reported the incident to the police later that day after discussing the incident with their teenage daughters. But in cross-examination it was suggested to the court that it was Saunders who spurned Ms Thacker's advances that night. 'Isn't it right that as Mr Saunders climbed over the dog to get into bed that you said ""I bet you'd rather shag the dog than me""?' Sarah Jenkins, defending, asked. 'No,' Ms Thacker said. Miss Jenkins went on: 'You were spurred by him that night. It was out of spite you made this complaint.' It was also alleged that Ms Thacker was annoyed that her ex-husband used her house as a bed for the night and it was for these reasons that she made the allegation against her ex. Mrs Thacker told the court: 'I don't lie. It's been a long, hard year and a half, but I stick to what I saw.' Saunders, of Bell Lane, has pleaded not guilty to having intercourse with an animal . The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nicholas Saunders, 46, is accused of having sexual intercourse with his ex-wife's pet Sasha ."

British airports charge more to park a family car than a private plane, an investigation has revealed. The survey into costs at the UK's ten busiest flight hubs has proved that it is cheaper to leave your six-seater light aircraft on the tarmac for 24-hours than your Mini in the short-stay car park. The revelation puts into stark context the extent to which holidaymakers are being fleeced to keep British airports in competition with their global counterparts. Tightly packed: Cars fill the parking lots of of Heathrow Airport where it costs £51.80 for a 24-hour stay . The most expensive airport to park a car was Heathrow where it costs an eye-watering £51.80 for 24 hours. However, light aircraft are not usually allowed to stop at Britain's largest airfield. The survey, carried out by The Independent, found that the widest disparity was at Liverpool John Lennon Airport which charges nearly four times more to park a car than a light aircraft. It's plane shocking: The survey into costs at the UK's ten busiest flight hubs has proved that it is cheaper to leave your six-seater light aircraft on the tarmac for 24-hours than your Mini in the short-stay car park . There, a 24-hour short-stay for a vehicle costs £39.99 while a plane would set you back just £10.72. The general rule is that airports demand a flat rate for all cars, no matter what size, while aircraft are charged according to their weight. At Manchester, the world's biggest jet, the Airbus A380, would cost almost £4,000 for a 24-hour stop-over. But Emirates, which runs the 'superjumbo' from Manchester to Dubai pays nothing because the first four hours are free and its scheduled layover is 105 minutes. Russell Craig of Manchester airport said in the past airports made much of their revenue from planes. That, he said now accounts for less than half. He told The Independent: 'To be able to keep investing, you've . got to find new revenue streams and some of that is car parking. But . pre-booking is the way to save money. The turn-up prices are what they . are.' Pilots face a string of fees including air-traffic and runway charges. But this may appear a good deal when compared to the amount extracted from holidaymakers in air-passenger duty, which ranges from £13 to £184. At Birmingham Airport drivers are charged even if they are dropping a friend or relative off. There, a car costs £22.50 in the short stay while a plane is just £10.80. In Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, a car is more than double the price of a two-ton plane. Paul Watters of the AA said: 'Drivers will probably look . enviously at parked aircraft wondering just how it can be that motorists . pay more when the space they are using is much less.'","The most expensive airport to park a car was Heathrow where it costs an eye-watering £51.80 for 24 hours .

Maoj Masih, 32, had just phoned his wife Rachel, 22, to say he was on his way home to join her, their son and his father when the accident happened. The vehicle, which had been waiting at lights in Sydney while the truck turned left beside him, was flattened to a height of about 18 inches where Mr Masih was sitting. This photo shows the impact of the horrific accident which flattened Maoj Masih's car . Firefighters and police were said to be in 'disbelief' when they arrived at the scene of the accident, pictured, which happened at traffic lights in Sydney . Police, firemen and ambulance officers were stunned when they arrived at the scene, staring in disbelief at the crushed vehicle. Motorist Mark Young, who had watched in horror as the huge container crashed down on Mr Masih's small car, ran to the vehicle to see if he could help. 'I couldn't see much at all,' said Mr Young. 'His torso was covered in metal but his hand was sticking out. I called out ""Mate, are you all right?"" but there was no response.' He said he had noticed a children's toy . on the back seat of the mangled car and his heart sank as he realised . there might have been a child in the car.

"By . Chris Brooke . UPDATED: . 19:15 EST, 2 July 2012 . Accused: Hannah Bonser when she appeared at magistrates court earlier this year accused of killing Casey Kearney, 13, at a park in Doncaster . As a sensible 13-year-old, Casey Kearney had been allowed by her mother to travel alone to visit a friend for a sleepover. But her treat ended in tragedy when she encountered former psychiatric patient Hannah Bonser. As the pair – who had never met – passed  each other in a park, 26-year-old Bonser  plunged a large kitchen knife into the schoolgirl’s chest before calmly walking off, a court heard yesterday. Casey managed to ring 999 on her mobile phone and collapsed. She was helped by passers-by and rushed to hospital, but died that evening. ‘The attack was sudden and caught Casey completely unawares,’ prosecutor Graham Reeds, QC, said. ‘There was no argument, no shouting and no warning that anything was about to happen.’ Bonser, who was said to have a ‘troubled history’, had been treated in a psychiatric hospital four months earlier and had been involved with an organisation helping those with mental health problems. Just three days before the attack she told a friend she was going to stab her ex-boyfriend to death because he made her have an abortion years ago and she was ‘going to get anyone else who crossed her in her life,’ Sheffield Crown Court was told. There was also evidence from damage to the door of her flat that Bonser ‘practised inflicting a stab wound’ to someone of a similar height to Casey. After walking out of the park in Doncaster with the ‘murder’ weapon – which she had bought earlier that day – hidden up her sleeve, the defendant went to the offices of the mental health charity Rethink and told a member of staff she knew that she had killed someone, the court was told. Much-loved: A friend described murdered Casey Lyanne-Kearney as a 'really lovely' girl with 'loads of friends' Schoolgirl: Casey in her uniform, left, and taking a picture of herself with her phone, right . Murder scene: The forensics tent mark the place of the attacks beside a children's playground where two ten-year-olds were playing at the time . The worker immediately rang police and . told the operator: ‘She’s been out at a park and she’s passed a girl on . the park and she’s stabbed her.’ Bonser denies murder and the court . heard that her defence is likely to argue her crime was that of . manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. Casey was killed on Valentine’s Day this year as she travelled to stay with a friend during half-term. Described as ‘very sensible and mature . for her age,’ she was allowed to travel alone by bus and was texting . her friend during the journey. Mr Reeds said she was stabbed once and . the six-inch blade cut an artery, causing severe internal bleeding that . made the damage ‘irreversible and unsurvivable’. The schoolgirl and the defendant were . walking in opposite directions through Elmfield Park and the attack . happened just yards from a children’s playground. Sadness: Friends of tragic teenager Casey embrace at Elmfield Park in Doncaster where she was stabbed to death . Attack: Casey, pictured at a family event holding a baby, managed to call police after she was stabbed . Casey’s last text was sent at 1.11pm . and her 999 call after the stabbing was made seven minutes later. Two . ten-year-olds who had been close by were said to have heard no screams . and noticed no signs of a struggle. Moments later Casey was spotted on her . knees ‘as if she were looking for a lost earring or a dropped phone’. In reality she was close to losing consciousness. There were no signs of . blood and the women who found her initially thought she was ‘having a . fit’ rather than the victim of a stabbing. It was only when paramedics arrived . that the seriousness of her condition became clear. Kerry Berry came . across Casey lying on the ground and put her in the recovery position. She said: ‘Her hair was all over her face. ‘I moved her hair back and stroked her face. ‘She was foaming at the mouth so I thought she was fitting.’ Mr Reeds said psychiatrists on both sides would give evidence about Bonser’s mental state. He said she should be convicted of . murder, telling the jury that despite her ‘troubled’ background and a . history of ‘mental difficulties’, she ‘managed to look after herself and . lived independently’ and her ability to do so was ‘not substantially . impaired’. A friend apparently thought her behaviour had been odd since last summer. In September last year, the court . heard, Bonser was caught in the street with a kitchen knife in her coat . pocket and the following month spent a short time in a psychiatric . hospital in Doncaster. She lived alone and was said to want to move to a . safer area. Bonser bought two kitchen knives less . than three hours before the killing and was carrying them both when she . handed herself in. Mr Reeds said there was ‘no other discernible purpose other than to use as weapons in a stabbing’. He added: ‘As to why she did it, the prosecution say only she knows, and she is not saying.’ Violence: The injured teenager managed to stagger away after the attack in Elmfield Park, Doncaster and dialled 999 . Bonser refused to answer police . questions and her solicitor told police ‘she’s hearing voices telling . her to do things and not to do things’. The court also heard a statement from . Casey’s mother Kerry Day, 32, who recalled how when her daughter had . left the house they said ‘I love you’ to each other. The trial continues.

Earlier this year, the phone company won live rights to 38 Premier League games a year from 2013 after paying £738million. On the move? Gary Lineker, pictured presenting the Euro 2012 final last night,  is considering leaving the BBC for BT's new sports channel . It now wants a big name presenter to front the channel and has set aside 'serious money' to pay for the right person. A BT spokesman told MailOnline the company was looking for 'top talent' and said it had been approached by many agents on behalf of their clients - although nothing had been decided yet. Representatives of Lineker have been in touch with the company to voice an interest in the role on his behalf. The BT spokesman said: 'He's not anymore of a candidate than anyone else. We haven't had any meetings and we haven't spoken to anyone.' Cut: Lineker is facing a pay cut to his £2million-a-year BBC salary . However, he added: 'We are looking for serious talent to front the programme. Of course Gary is the Match of the Day presenter, he's got pedigree and stature.' Rumours surrounding a possible BBC . exit come as the 51-year-old former England and Spurs player is facing a . pay cut to his £2million-a-year salary. MOTD pundit Alan Hanson has already taken a £500,000 pay-cut and Lineker is expected to do the same as part of the BBC's economy drive. His contract is also due to expire in August next year leaving the door open for a possible move.

The thrilling Olympic athletic heat . which ended in a tie will be re-run today to decide which runner will . make it to the Games in London this summer. The two female sprinters involved in . the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss . of a coin, but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead. However, Jeneba Tarmoh insists that . the winner-take-all race - which will be held at 5pm local time at . Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon - is unnecessary, as she won fair and . square. The young sprinter wants no part of a . run-off with training partner Allyson Felix to settle the last spot for . the Games in the women's 100 metres. Too close to call: Jeneba Tarmoh (bottom) and Allyson Felix both cross the finish line for the Olympic trials with a time of 11.068. The race is decided by when their torsos cross the line, and the picture showed a tie . 'In my heart of hearts, I just feel like I earned the third spot. I almost feel like I was kind of robbed,' Tarmoh said. Tarmoh was originally declared the . third-place finisher of the event on June 23, even going on a . celebratory lap around the track, being presented a medal and then . showing up at a news conference. Only after her drug test did she discover the controversy - race officials had declared a dead heat. Now, after not making the team in the . 200m, Tarmoh has to regroup and step up to the starting line, trying to . reclaim a spot she believed rightfully belongs to her. Battle: The track timer had initially named Tarmoh, right, as the winner before officials reviewed the results . 'I'm not that excited at all. This . decision was really hard for me to make,' said Tarmoh, who is eligible . to run on the Olympic 400m relay team. 'I was pushed into a corner. They . said if you don't make a decision, you give your spot up. I work too . hard to just give my spot up. I had to say it was a runoff.' The controversy in the 100 . overshadowed the entire trials simply because USA Track and Field had no . protocol in place to deal with a dead heat. USATF officials quickly . scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure. The athletes had a choice between a . runoff or a coin flip. They chose to settle matters on the track, not . with the flip of a quarter. 'They both feel they deserve a spot . on the team and they're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a . competitive fashion,' USATF President Stephanie Hightower said. 'I think . it's good for the sport and it's good for them to show their level of . competitiveness and passion and drive for what they've been working so . hard to accomplish. 'The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the best way to be able to resolve this issue.' Disbelief: The two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women's 100m Olympic team . The resolution was delayed for eight . days because their coach, Bobby Kersee, wanted to wait to make a . decision until after 200m on Saturday. Felix turned in a personal-best . time of 21.69 seconds, the fourth-fastest by an American. 'I didn't get to really enjoy it,' Felix said. 'As soon as I came off, that's the first time that I . actually thought about the process. Of course, I wasn't thinking I . wanted to do a coin toss, but that's the first time I sat down and went . through things in my head. 'Once this is over, I'll be happy about it.' After two races and six rounds, both . will be running with fatigued legs - so much so that Felix said she . won't take any chances. If she steps into the blocks and does not feel . right, she will pull out of the competition. 'We're both not feeling our greatest,' Felix said. For Tarmoh, there is also an emotional component. 'I went to bed so happy and then I . woke up to do something I don't want to do at all,' Tarmoh said. 'If . it's in the best interest of someone's job or the sport, that's what . I'll do.' Support: The two women have the same trainer and . contracts with Nike . Anxious: Felix (right) is keen to compete in the Olympic 100m even though her main event is 200m . Tarmoh's agent Kim Holland was asked if there might be any sort of legal recourse should her clieent not win the race. 'I'll have a sidebar conversation . with Jeneba and see how she wants to proceed, meaning if it's really . over with the run,' Holland said. Tarmoh indicated the matter would be concluded with the runoff. 'I wouldn't want to pursue anything else,' she said. 'This has been a long road already.' As for their friendship, Felix said . it has not been affected by the situation. They both train under Kersee . and were practicing starts together leading up to the 200m. 'There's never any question about any of that,' Felix said. Since Felix had already earned a spot . in the 200m, there was speculation she might simply concede the 100m to . Tarmoh. But Felix said the 100m is vital to her preparation for the . 200m, where she's a favorite to win Olympic gold. 'People may wonder, ""What in the . world? Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (of Jamaica) ran 10.70 and you're nowhere . close to that,""' Felix said. 'But it's about making my 200m better and . giving it my all.' The runoff is a boon for track and will be shown on NBC in conjunction with the network's coverage of the swimming trials. 'This will reintroduce people to the . sport and showcase world-class athletes and great competition,' newly . hired CEO Max Siegel said.",Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh will face off for a ticket to London 2012 .

Labour last night caved in and backed Government plans for Parliament to investigate the banking scandal instead of a judge-led public inquiry. Following the most bad-tempered Commons debate for decades, party leader Ed Miliband reluctantly agreed, for now, to back a probe headed by senior MPs and peers, though he insisted it would be ‘inadequate’. Ministers offered a significant concession, saying a cross-party joint committee of both Houses of Parliament would be given resources to hire a QC who could either advise on the questioning of witnesses, or even conduct it. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne and his opposite number Ed Balls were involved in angry exchanges as MPs debated proposals for an inquiry into the banking scandal. MPs last night voted for a Parliamentary probe into rate-fixing . Balls insisted Labour would continue to press for a broader judicial probe . Ex-Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond praised his former bank as he appeared before MPs earlier this week . The Government and the opposition have been arguing for days over the nature of an inquiry into the rate-fixing scandal that has engulfed Britain’s banks, and lessons to be learned about the wider culture and practices of the finance industry. Labour lost a Commons vote calling for a judicial probe, on the lines of that led by Lord Justice Leveson into the media, but agreed to cooperate with a more rapid Parliamentary inquiry after MPs voted in favour of that instead. However, shadow Chancellor Ed Balls insisted Labour would continue to press for a broader judicial probe to follow - warning the Government that if future banking scandals emerged it would be blamed. Chancellor George Osborne and Mr Balls were involved in venomous exchanges as they debated the issue. Mr Osborne challenged Mr Balls to say who were the ‘Labour ministers’ who raised concerns with the Bank of England about the high rates being declared by Barclays on how much it was paying to borrow at the height of the financial crisis. The bank has been fined £290million for fiddling the Libor rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other - forcing its chief executive Bob Diamond to quit. ‘Do you know who those ministers are?’ the Chancellor demanded, as deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans struggled to maintain order. ‘Let him explain what Labour’s role was. Who were the ministers, who had the conversation, who were the senior figures?’ Mr Osborne asked, saying Mr Balls had to ‘answer for his time in office’ as Labour’s City minister. Barclays has been fined £290m for fiddling the Libor rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other. Above, Bob Diamond, who was forced to quit, addresses Treasury Select Committee MPs . Bob Diamond passes protesters waving monopoly boards as he leaves after giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee at Portcullis House, central London . The Chancellor mentioned a report called ‘Reducing Libor’ drafted by bankers at UBS and circulated in Whitehall by Baroness Vadera, then a Cabinet Office minister, in 2008. The peer, who was one of Gordon Brown’s closest economic advisers, has admitted commenting on the report but denied having any conversation with the Bank of England about getting the rate down. Mr Balls denied any involvement and claimed Mr Osborne’s ‘cheap, partisan and desperate’ conduct ‘demeans the office he holds’. He complained that the Chancellor had ‘impugned my integrity’ and demanded an apology. ‘If he has any evidence, he should produce it. He should either push up or shut up,’ Mr Balls said. The Chancellor retorted: ‘The idea that I am going to take lessons in integrity from the man who smeared his way through 13 years of Labour government, who half the people who ever served with him think he was a disgrace in his post is another thing.’ Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi asked Mr Balls: ‘Can you confirm that in your time in office, no other minister either in Number Ten or the Treasury spoke to the Bank of England on Libor that you know about?’ Clutching two bottles of Bollinger two 'bankers' appear outside Parliament yesterday in a tongue in cheek protest about greed in the financial services sector . The Shadow Chancellor did not answer directly, telling him: ‘The reason why we advocate an open, public inquiry, judge-led, is to get precisely to the bottom of all these things.’ Mr Osborne said it was ‘completely fanciful’ for Labour to suggest a judge-led inquiry could produce a report that would be completed in time to inform banking reform legislation due early next year. Since the Inquiries Act was passed in 2005, only one judge-led investigation, into an explosion at a Glasgow plastics factory, had been completed in under two years, he told MPs. ‘The idea that a widespread, judge-led public inquiry into the culture and professional standards of Britain’s largest industry is going to take place much quicker than a public inquiry into the explosion at a plastics factory in Glasgow I think is just fanciful,’ Mr Osborne said. ‘It just leads me to believe that the Labour Party wants to put off the moment when we actually investigate what happened.’ Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the Government’s most senior lawyer, prompted further confusion as he warned criminal charges against bankers could hamper either a judge-led or a Parliamentary inquiry. ‘It could present such a difficulty,’ he told MPs. Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, who the Government has selected to run the inquiry, had threatened to pull out unless there was cross-party support. A Labour source said Mr Tyrie was an ‘honourable man’ but claimed his inquiry would be ‘incredibly limited’ in scope. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, yesterday criticised the Bank of England over its handling of the rate-rigging scandal. ‘I don’t know what the ECB would have done but I hope we would have done better,’ he said. ‘A lot of action should be taken to improve governance of the Libor process.’ A Treasury source said all Mr Osborne had ever said about Mr Balls specifically was that he had questions to answer, insisting that was ‘undeniably the case’.

In tears: It appeared that Amy Senser had been crying before she went into the court room for her sentencing hearing in Minnesota on Monday . The wife of an ex-Minnesota Vikings football player told the family of the man who she killed in a hit and run accident that she was so remorseful that she tattooed the victim’s name on her wrist and said that she waits for the day she can meet him. Amy Senser, the wife of former NFL player Joe Senser, tearfully apologized to the family of Anousone Phanthavong on Monday, moments before a judge rejected her request for probation and sentenced her to nearly 3-and-a-half years in prison. Hennepin County Judge Daniel Mabley said Senser's remorse rang true, but he wasn't satisfied with her account of what happened last August 23, when she struck and killed Phanthavong, 38, on a freeway exit ramp. Judge Mabley said Senser avoided taking responsibility, even after the panic immediately following the crash had subsided. 'This . avoidance of responsibility was not out of panic or confusion. It was . orchestrated,' he told an overflowing courtroom in Minneapolis. 'A certain momentum develops around these denials.' The . judge said the prison sentence was important to deter what he called an . 'epidemic' of hit-and-run deaths in the state, though he gave her the . minimum possible sentence of 41 months in jail. Senser, 45, was convicted in May of leaving the scene of an accident and failure to promptly report an accident, both felonies. Phanthavong's car had run out of gas and he was filling the tank on the side of the exit ramp near the Thai restaurant where he worked when he was struck and killed. Parts of a Mercedes were found at the scene, and authorities appealed to the public for help in finding the driver. Emotional: During the hearing, Amy Senser (seen here with her lawyer Eric Nelson) sobbed repeatedly and spoke directly to the victim's family saying that she took full responsibility for the accident . Forgiving: The victim's parents, Phoxay (right) and Keo Ptanthavong (left) said that they felt justice had been served and accepted Senser's tearful apology . Nearly 24 hours later, Mrs Senser’s defense attorney Eric Nelson called authorities to tell them they could pick up the vehicle involved at the Sensers'. Victim: Anousone Phanthavong was killed in August of last year by Amy Senser in a hit-and-run accident . But the Sensers didn't talk to police, fueling speculation about who was driving and whether alcohol was involved. It was more than a week later that Amy Senser admitted she was driving. During the emotional sentencing hearing, Phanthavong's mother and other relatives cried as his niece and brother relative read victim impact statements. Senser sobbed, her shoulders shaking, and at one point she cried out, 'I'm sorry! I'm sorry!' Khonevichith Phanthavong, the victim's brother, said they had started talking about opening a restaurant together after taking years to get close. 'Now we no longer have an opportunity to make our dreams come true,' he said. 'All because of one night.' 'There isn't a day when I don't think about it and miss him so much,' said Sayaphome Phouthavongsay, the victim’s niece. Support: Amy's husband Joe Senser (left) was not present at Monday's sentencing hearing, though he is seen here at an earlier court appearance. He opted instead to stay at home with the couple's daughters . Deliberation: The jury found Amy Senser guilty of two of the three counts after she fatally hit Anousone Phanthavong on August 23 last year and left the scene of the accident . Senser cried later as she apologized to members of Phanthavong's family, some of whom wore T-shirts bearing his picture. 'I've . waited a long time to say I'm sorry. I hope you can believe me that I . never saw your son that night and if I had I would have stopped to help . him,' Senser said, turning in her seat to face Phanthavong's relatives . in the courtroom. 'I take full responsibility for his death. It was my fault.' She added: 'I just hope someday you can forgive me for taking Anousone from you.' Mabley's sentence was on the low end of the range of 41 to 57 months called for in sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum prison term, saying Senser had shown no remorse and made only excuses for the crash. Moving forward: In a May court appearance, members of victim Anousone Phanthavong's family embraced Amy Senser after she was deemed guilty . Brittani Senser, left, testified that she was . 'furious' that her stepmother, Amy Senser, pictured right, had not come . forward about driving the SUV that struck and killed a man as everyone then thought it was her . Senser's . criminal trial has been one of Minnesota's most closely watched in . years, particularly due to the suggestion of a cover-up and the . defendant's marriage to a well-known figure in the state. Joe . Senser was a tight end for the Vikings in the early 1980s and has . remained visible as a game commentator and as owner of a string of . restaurants in his name. Joe Senser did not attend the sentencing hearing. Their lawyer said he was with the couple's daughters. At trial, her stepdaughter Brittani . testified that Amy Senser only came forward only after Brittani — angry . that some people had speculated she was the driver — threatened to go to . authorities. Amy Senser testified that the night . of the crash, she went to meet her daughters and their friends at a Katy . Perry concert at St Paul's Xcel Energy Center, and had part of a glass . of wine at a nearby restaurant before going inside. After about 90 minutes, suffering from a headache, she left, intending to have her husband pick up the girls. Popular: The trial was closely followed in Minnesota because Joe Senser was a star tight end for the Vikings football team in the 1990s and now owns a chain of restaurants . Drive: On the night of August 23, 2011, Amy Senser was behind the wheel of the Mercedes-Benz SUV that struck and killed 38-year-old Anousone Phanthavong but drove off after she hit him . As she was driving home, she changed . her mind and decided to return to St Paul. Shortly after turning onto a . freeway exit ramp in a construction area in Minneapolis, Senser said she . felt a jolt at the front of her Mercedes-Benz SUV. She said she was looking to the left at the time, and thought she had hit an orange construction barrel or a pothole. She said she didn't realize a man had been hit until seeing news reports the next day. But . prosecutors said Senser had to have known she hit someone, and . highlighted numerous texts that were deleted from Senser's cellphone the . night of the crash and the next day. The Sensers settled a civil lawsuit filed by the Phanthavong family shortly after the criminal trial ended. Mr Nelson said Amy Senser got the tattoo of Phanthavong's name after the guilty verdict 'as a reminder to carry him with her.' 'She's not a monster,' Mr Nelson said. 'She would have never knowingly left someone to die. It's just not in her.' After . the sentencing, attorney Jim Schwebel said the Phanthavong family . accepted Senser's remorse and felt that the sentence was fair. 'What we got was justice today,' said Khonevichith Phanthavong. 'We forgive her.'","Amy Senser was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident and failure to report an accident and sentenced to 41 months in jail .

A bank manager who with the help of her mother fleeced friends and family of £200,000 to buy themselves a ‘happy life’ have both been jailed. Debra Cox, 37, secretly applied for personal loans in the names of her in-laws and ‘drip-fed’ most of the cash into the account of her mother Carol Collier, 56. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the pair used the money to ‘enjoy the good life’ with regular holidays in the sun. Greed: Debra Cox, left, wanted to 'buy her way to a happy life' and drip-fed tens of thousands of pounds into the bank account of her mother Carol Collier, right, which the pair used to treat themselves to luxury holidays . Cox worked as a financial planning manager then as a retail branch manager in Chingford, east London between June 2002 and September 2008. She was later employed as a mortgage manager in central London until February 2010. Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: ‘On February 9, 2010, Debra Cox was dismissed from HSBC bank for gross misconduct. ‘Four months later, her ex-husband, Dave Cox, contacted the fraud investigations department of HSBC in relation to a number of suspicious transactions identified on accounts held by his family and close friends. ‘Mr Cox identified five people that he believed had been subjected to fraudulent banking and asked for their accounts to be investigated.’ Mr Cox’s parents, Christine and Keith, were the first to fall foul of the scam, followed by his brother, Robert, and family friends Stephen and Lorraine Edwards. ‘A thorough investigation took place by HSBC with all five being interviewed,’ Ms Fawcett added. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the pair used the money to 'enjoy the good life' with regular holidays in the sun . ‘In short, the investigation . identified that Debra Cox had opened a series of fraudulent mortgages, . personal loans and secondary bank accounts in those people’s names. ‘She . completely abused her position to continuously view the accounts of her . in-laws without their authority and arrange payments to and from their . accounts without their knowledge, trying to cover her tracks by . diverting all bank communication to the address of her parents.’ HSBC has since reimbursed all the victims of the fraud which ran from October 2006 to June 2010. Defending Cox, Quentin Hunt said: ‘Beneath the veneer of prosperity, Ms Cox was significantly troubled by her criminality. ‘The motivation behind this was an attempt to buy her way to a happy life. ‘She didn’t set out to defraud her friends and family. Things spiralled out of control.’ Judge Inigo Bing, pictured, jailed Cox for four years and Collier for 15 months . Michael Edmonds, for Collier, added: ‘This is not a case where a plan was hatched between Ms Cox and Mrs Collier. ‘She is mortified and ashamed by the position she finds herself in.’ Jailing Cox for four years, Judge Inigo Bing said: ‘This was a serious fraud of its type. ‘You occupied a position of trust as a mortgage manager who had the responsibility of authorising loans, top-up loans and mortgages for customers, actions which would involve thousands if not hundreds of thousands of pounds. ‘But there was another breach of trust, that of your family and close friends. ‘You systematically misled them about what you were doing with their accounts and it was clear from the evidence that they felt utterly betrayed by you. ‘This was a thoroughly dishonest operation made possible by many acts of deception. ‘Your motivation was to buy your way to a happy life but another way of expressing that is greed. ‘To say this was a grave breach of trust is only to state the obvious.’ Sentencing Collier to 15 months in prison, Judge Bing added: ‘Your culpability is much lower than your daughter’s. ‘It would be a hard-hearted judge that could not have regard to the fact your husband is seriously ill and requires care, but the fact remains that you acquired £142,000 and the money was drip-fed to your bank account on 19 separate occasions. ‘Being a willing recipient of the money, you helped to conceal the fraud you knew or suspected was being conducted by your daughter.’ The pair, both of Huntsman Road, Ilford, east London, had denied the charges. But after a four-week trial Cox was found guilty of 24 counts of fraud by false representation and two counts of obtaining money by deception. Collier was convicted of five counts of converting criminal property and a single count of possessing criminal property.","Debra Cox, 37, applied for personal loans in the names of in-laws then 'drip-fed' money into mother Carol Collier's account, the court heard .

Making their point: About 500 protesters are believed to have demonstrated against the circus last night . Earlier this year, actor Alec Baldwin filmed a four-minute video on behalf of PETA, urging Americans to boycott Ringling Bros and other circuses because of their inhumane treatment of elephants. He claims that elephants live very different lives than their wild cousins and from a young age are ‘stretched out, slammed to the ground, gouged with bull hooks, and shocked with electric prods'. In the video, Baldwin describes the apparent horrors suffered by elephants in the circus. ‘Having . worked with actors for many years, it’s hard to believe that anyone . would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business,’ Baldwin begins. ‘But for the elephants for Ringling Bros and other circuses, that’s exactly what happens.’ He cites a 2009 PETA investigation in which animal handlers are shown beating elephants moments before they appear in the ring. Baldwin says the conditions in which these elephants live is deplorable, adding that the pachyderms are ‘kept chained and confined to cramped boxcars. The lack of mental and physical stimulation results in severe frustration, and is the reason why you frequently see elephants in circuses swaying back and forth.' Outspoken: In a video on behalf of PETA, Alec Baldwin details the abuse circus elephants must endure . Broken: The actor said elephants' spirits are broken for the brief amusement of circus-goers . Star attraction: Elephants have been one of the main events at Ringling Bros, called 'The Greatest Show on Earth' A spokesman for Ringling Bros Barnum & Bailey condemned the video for rehashing old footage and distorting its meaning. ‘The health and vitality of our animals is something we can showcase at every Ringling Bros performance,’ Stephen Payne said. ‘We invite families everywhere to come and see for themselves how all the animals are thriving at ""The Greatest Show on Earth"".' However, . Feld Entertainment – which owns the circus company – agreed to pay a . $270,000 fine last November for allegedly violating the Animal Welfare . Act. Though the company never admitted to any wrongdoing or violating regulations, it is still the largest AWA fine on record. Since the settlement, employees who work with animals must undergo AWAK compliance training.

Mr Page, a double-glazing salesman, relived his terrifying ordeal for the first time yesterday. Close call: Ms Weston cried when she saw the CCTV footage and couldn't believe she nearly killed Mr Page, a friend she hadn't seen for many years . He said: 'It’s all a surreal blur.

An unemployed man suspected of walking into a bar and shooting customers at random before setting fire to his former workplace and a fuel rig has been charged with 18 counts of attempted murder. Nathan Wilkins, 44, is said to have entered the Copper Top in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, shortly after midnight on Tuesday morning. He then opened fire with a military-type assault weapon, wounding 17 people, including one critically and three others seriously, it is claimed. Police believe he earlier shot a man answering the door of his nearby apartment. Brian Felton, who lives at the property, last night claimed that the gunman came to his front door looking for his black flatmate Andrew Clements, who had earlier been drinking at the Copper Bar. The door was opened by another flatmate,  Bruce Bankhead. Using racist language, the gunman asked if Mr Clements was home before opening fire and wounding Mr Bankhead. Neither Mr Felton nor Mr Bankhead know Wilkins. But after the shooting Mr Felton said he found that someone had scratched 'KKK' into his pick-up truck. Mr Clements had been with the brother of . Wilkins' ex-wife earlier in the evening, but left the Copper . Top before gunfire broke out there and was not wounded. Mr Felton said: 'Even Andrew doesn't know why he's upset with him.' Police said they were not yet able to verify a racial motive to the shootings. Sgt Kip Hart said: 'We haven't had anything concrete that it was racial.' Wilkins is also suspected of an arson . attack in the early hours of the morning on the Capstone Oil company . premises in nearby Brookwood, where he worked until March. A fuel well . rig near the offices was also set ablaze. Scroll down for video . Captured on CCTV: Surveillance footage shows the gunman walking down a street near the Copper Bar in Tuscaloosa, Alabama . Armed: In the black-and-white video the man appears to be carrying a military-style assault weapon . Police launched a manhunt before . receiving a call from an employee at a FedEx store in Jasper, a town 55 . miles north of Tuscaloosa. The employee said Wilkins was there and had . confessed to the shooting. Wilkins was then arrested 'without incident'. He told police that he had wanted them to kill him, but lost his nerve. Captain Larry Cantrell said: . 'The only thing he said was that he wanted to die and was hoping the . Tuscaloosa Police Department had killed him. 'He said, ""I wanted the Tuscaloosa police to kill me, but I got scared and left before they got there.""' Survivors of the Copper Bar shooting today revealed the terror that gripped customers when the gunman opened fire. Local resident Davis Leavelle said: 'We were in the middle of ordering drinks and I saw the shooter open fire. 'I grabbed my sister and we ducked . under the pool table. I saw eight or nine people who were shot. Two of . our friends were hit in the leg and foot. 'Shell casings hit me and my sister on the back as we sat under the table.' Police said Wilkins' bail had been set at $2million and offered no possible motive for the shooting. The suspect's Facebook page showed . photos of a balding, shaven-headed man with tattoos on his arms, posing . with an assault rifle, standing in front of a Confederate flag and . making an obscene gesture, local media said. The page was taken down shortly after the incident. Victim: Riley Dunn was one of those caught up in the shooting . Scene: The Copper Top bar in Tuscaloosa, where Wilkins is accused of shooting 17 people . Wilkins has a history of violent outbursts and legal scrapes dating back to the 1980s. He was fired from his job at Capstone Oilfield Services in March after a fistfight with a co-worker. Neither was seriously hurt, and Brookwood Assistant Police Chief Jimmy Sellers said he didn't know what caused the fight. Wilkins told police in April he was . angry about his firing from Capstone, and he was pressing assault . charges against the co-worker, Chief Sellers said. The other man had also been . fired but not arrested. Wilkins is suspected of setting . three fires to equipment or property owned by Capstone. A fire was set . to a Capstone vehicle parked at someone's house after the first . shooting, and fires were set at two Captsone locations in Brookwood . after the gunfire at the bar. Chief Sellers said Wilkins will be charged with . arson. He speculated that once Wilkins snapped, he may have . decided to respond to a number of perceived slights. Chief Sellers knew of no . connection between the shooting victims and Wilkins' former employer. He said: 'From . what we're hearing, he started something so big the night before last . that he just said: ""I'm going to take care of everything at one time.""' The firing from the supervisory position Wilkins had held for . at least six years likely worsened existing financial problems. A . bankruptcy filing from July 20, 2011 shows that Wilkins was taking home . about $4,400 each month at the time and that he had grossed about . $83,000 in 2010 as a supervisor at Capstone. Records show that . his bankruptcy declaration last year was his third since 1991, and he . faced a hearing in a couple of weeks. The move prevented a credit union . from garnishing his wages at Capstone, to collect a $15,000 debt. Wilkins' wife Amy filed for divorce in July 2004 after 16 years of marriage, . according to Tuscaloosa County court records.

A couple's dream getaway to celebrate their wedding anniversary turned into the 'holiday from hell' when a waiter’s attempt to flambe a fish for their family meal went disastrously wrong. Parents Tony, 42, and Kirsty Barr, 35, had gone out for an evening meal to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary with their three children while on a two-week break at the Turkish resort of Marmaris. But the couple and two of their children ended up in hospital with severe burns after a bottle of alcohol held by their waiter exploded in their faces as he attempted to flambe their fish dinner. Horrific injuries: Both Kirsty, left, and Tony Barr, right, suffered burns to their head, arms, neck and chest . Holiday hell: The incident at the La Luna restaurant happened just five days into their two week holiday . Mr Barr threw himself from a 20ft high window in a bid to stop the fire from spreading to others. But the couple’s two-year-old baby daughter Rosie suffered burns after her pram caught fire. Her 15-year-old sister Jessica, whose own arms and legs were on fire, managed to free Rosie and douse her with water from the restaurant sink. Only Mr Barr's 15-year-old daughter Amy managed to escape the flames by diving for cover as the bottle exploded.

Nightmare holiday: The couple, who didn't have travel insurance, were left with a £3,500 hospital bill for the treatment of their injuries . Ordeal: Kirsty Barr, 35, suffered burns to her face as well as the upper part of her body . Mr Barr added that he was very proud of his brave step-daughter Jessica for her quick actions in helping her little sister Rosie. He said: 'She is a hero as no one else could do anything to help Rosie. 'She would have died if it wasn’t for Jessica as when someone is on fire every second is like a minute.' He added: 'I won’t be going on holiday abroad again. It was like the worst nightmare for all of us. Devastated: The couple said the holiday was a 'complete nightmare' and they are still recovering from their ordeal . We are still trying to get over it.

After one of the dullest, wettest starts to the summer in memory, temperatures are expected to reach 20C (68F) today, 23C (73F) tomorrow and 25C (77F) on Monday in the South and East.

This will allow more traditional summer weather to arrive in most places. The washout spring and summer may have forced many retailers to start their sales early, but at least demand for wet weather gear has been high.

A council-owned civic centre is under fire after charging an astonishing £18 for a single bowl of nuts. The centre in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, recently re-opened after a £5million refit and a private contractor was brought in to run the catering facilities. But several users have complained of sky-high prices, including a delegation from Wiltshire College who hired a function room for a celebration event. They forked out £240 for a selection of snacks - but arrived to find just handful of bowls filled with peanuts and crisps, working out at £18 per portion. Caterers at Trowbridge Civic Centre charge £18 for a bowl of peanuts . A letter of complaint from the college read: 'We ordered a selection of snacks with a budget of £200 including VAT £240. 'What was presented on the day was a bowl on each table with not a selection but filled up with either one type of crisps or peanuts. 'This worked out at over £18 per bowl! This we believe was totally unacceptable.' Trowbridge Civic Centre, which is owned by Trowbridge Town Council, was reopened in December after receiving new kitchens, a cafeteria and bar areas. Crown Catering fended off strong competition to win the contract to provide food and run the bar, with 40 per cent of the profits going to the council. But the company could now lose the contract following a string of complaints. In a report to the management committee, Karl Buckingham, facilities manager at the venue, said that he was very concerned that Crown Catering was not able to provide a simple service with out his intervention. He said: 'It concerns me greatly that Crown are not able to provide a simple service effectively and professionally without the need for myself to intervene and provide solutions, or for me to provide my own staff to assist with their poor planning. 'I strongly feel that we should look to terminate the contract and revert back to the way the service was provided before.' He added that Crown seems to struggle . with orders of more than 100 covers, and high prices and lack of sales . meant the council was taking a 40 per cent cut of 'nothing'. There have been several complaints of sky-high prices at the Civic Centre, including a delegation from Wiltshire College who hired a function room for a celebration event . There are several clauses that would allow either party to terminate the contract, including if the town council believed Crown were failing to perform. Councillor Bob Brice, who chairs the centre's management committee, said: 'We're under contract and we're working through it. 'We're looking for some improvement which hasn't quite happened.'There's some disappointment as to the service and the fact is maybe we can do better independently. We're trying to get the best for the Civic Centre.' Graham Payne, a town councillor, said that he was concerned that unless the Civic Centre established a good reputation it could become a 'white elephant around the neck of the taxpayer'. He added that the number of complaints he had seen in the eight months since he started seemed 'to be excessive'. However Darren Gadd, director of Crown Catering, defended his company's service, stating that complaints were not always justified. He said: 'We provide an excellent service. We are wedding caterers of the year for the south west. 'We have a very good relationship with the management at the Civic Centre. 'The contract is not under review, it is for three years. People have complained about the food at the Civic Centre and those complaints have not always been justified.

A businesswoman who has been missing for three months has been impersonated by at least three women trying to use her credit cards since she vanished, police believe . Detectives investigating the disappearance of millionairess Carole Waugh have also charged an unemployed man with fraud offences after hundreds of thousands of pounds were taken from her bank accounts. The 50-year-old vanished from her £650,000 London flat on May 4 and has not been heard from since April 17. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been . taken from her bank and her cash cards have been used in shopping . sprees at the Westfield centre in West London. Scotland Yard released CCTV images yesterday of two women buying goods there with Miss Waugh’s bank cards on July 13. These images were taken at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherds Bush on Friday July 13. Detectives want to speak to the two women pictured here in connection with the search for Miss Waugh . Detectives believe the pair may be part of a gang that abducted her and made her divulge her PINs. Officers from Scotland Yard last week . arrested four men and two women in connection with their inquiry and . yesterday charged unemployed Rakesh Bhayani with three counts of . conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The charges relate to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth in the region of £280,000, police said. Bhayani, 40, of Wembley, will appear via virtual court at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later today. The five other suspects have been bailed pending further investigations, the Met added. Ms Waugh, whose disappearance is being investigated by the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, lives in the exclusive Marylebone area of the capital. The detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take several days. The former civil servant, who made a . fortune working in Libya as a finance manager for oil companies during . the reign of Colonel Gaddafi, returned to London in 2008, apparently . looking for love. She was single and police are trying to trace men she may have met through internet dating sites. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said there has been no . confirmed contact with her for three months. Carole Waugh was last seen shopping in Central London on May 4. She failed to turn up for family birthday celebrations or for the start of a new job in Malta . He said: 'There have been a number of . sightings of her but I have not been able to confirm them at this . stage. The last time she had any contact with her family was on April . 17. 'Since Carole was last seen at least . three women have been involved in impersonating her at a number of . different venues. I also believe there are a number of men involved in . the fraud.' Yesterday it emerged that power cables to a CCTV camera pointing at her flat were cut in the lead-up to her disappearance. Neighbours have reported large numbers of people coming and going from her home following her disappearance. Yesterday her brother Chris, a . 54-year-old bank manager, said: ‘She is a very confident businesswoman . who has done very well for herself. ‘She is very wealthy and she doesn’t need to work. Despite her being a very focused businesswoman, she was looking for Mr Right. ‘I think someone has targeted her as a . single woman in London with a nice property and money and we don’t know . if they have befriended her or just taken her.’ Just before she went . missing, Miss Waugh turned down a job offer in Malta and was planning a . 50th birthday trip to Las Vegas with a group of friends. Her brother and 78-year-old mother . Margaret, who both live in Durham, last saw her at Easter when she told . them about the American trip scheduled for June. ‘She seemed fine. She . was really looking forward to it,’ added Mr Waugh. ‘She was not worried about turning 50. She was looking forward to all the fuss and attention. ‘She phoned her mother every other day and suddenly the calls just stopped. My mother is absolutely beside herself. ‘We are very concerned about her. My mother is rather ill and it has had a real impact on her health.’ Miss Waugh's family say her disappearance is 'totally out of character' Forensic experts are now examining . Miss Waugh’s two-bedroom flat near Marble Arch in central London for . signs of a break-in or struggle. Police say she was last seen shopping in the capital on May 4. Her hobbies included going to the . opera, ballet and jogging and she was often seen sporting a £4,000 . Cartier gold bracelet and a man’s Breitling watch worth a similar . amount. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, said: ‘Miss . Waugh is a successful businesswoman, originally from the Durham area. ‘She has worked in the Middle East and has maintained a home in central London for a number of years. ‘Her disappearance is very out of . character. Both her family and I are very concerned, and ask for the . help of the public in tracing her.

The head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, has raised serious concerns about levels of morale among staff who are employed to look after the nation's security. Sawyers says poor pay and working conditions are making spies ‘unwilling to go the extra mile' and triggering them to seek alternative ‘less risky' employment in the private sector. Exit door: Spies are leaving the intelligence services to take up posts with internet companies which can pay up to three times as much in salaries . A new employee at the three intelligence agencies – MI5, MI6 and GCHQ (the government's communications headquarters) - would expect to earn £25,000, with the salary only rising to £43,000 after ten years' service. In comments made in the intelligence and security committee's (ISC) annual report Sawyers said: ‘People are less likely to go the extra mile and do the more dangerous thing or take that added level of risk if they feel they are not recognised for it and their rewards are somehow inadequate… now this is a growing problem.' The image of a hard-up, demoralised spy is a world away from the big screen portrayal of Bond carrying out audacious missions with a plethora of high-tech gadgets, driving top of the range Aston Martins and staying in some of the world's best hotels. Sawyers added: ‘We may have to do something which recognises that the staff of the intelligence agencies, a bit like the police or the armed forces, do something that's unique and those unique qualities should be recognised.' Different world: The image of a hard-up, demoralised spy is a world away . from the big screen portrayal of James Bond, as shown here played by . Daniel Craig, in Casino Royale . Chairman of the committee Malcolm Rifkind has called for ‘flexibility' in the government's civil service pay policy, particularly for ‘unique' sectors such as the intelligence services. His concerns are recognised by Iain Lobhan, director of GCHQ, who said companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are attracting computer experts with salaries three times as high of those they receive at GCHQ. New move: The recruitment issue has prompted Jonathan Evans, head of MI5 to participate in an advert which aims to portray the agency in a positive light . The report highlights a deterioration in the organisation's ability to hold on to internet specialists over the last year with staffing levels now a matter of ‘grave concern'. However, according to espionage historian Nigel West, quoted in the Sunday Times, those thinking of a career in the intelligence services should not be motivated by money but because of the ‘prestige' and because of ‘making a difference'. He argued that any lack of morale was due to bureaucracy as opposed to poor pay. The recruitment issue has prompted Jonathan Evans, head of MI5 to participate in an advert which aims to portray the agency in a positive light. In the film he describes the organisation as ‘fun' and exciting'. He told the ISC that in 2010-11 a total of £20million was spend on exit packages as 216 members of staff left the services.","Starting salaries for three intelligence agencies start at £25,000 .

Calling for change: Professor John Kay said cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to end the culture of short-term profit in the City . Cash bonuses for executives should be scrapped to help end the culture of short-term profit in the City, according to a Government-backed review. The report also questions whether the directors of large companies should be paid any bonuses at all. Professor John Kay, from the London School of Economics, said: ‘Many people doing responsible and demanding jobs – Cabinet ministers, judges, surgeons, research scientists – do not receive bonuses, and would be insulted by the suggestion that the prospects of bonuses would encourage them to perform their duties more conscientiously.’ But he stops short of demanding an end to boardroom bonuses altogether. Instead, the review recommends all bonuses should be paid in shares that can be cashed in only once an executive has retired. The Kay report is a key plank of attempts by Business Secretary Vince Cable to overhaul the financial sector. Mr Cable has already unveiled reforms aimed at giving investors more say on excessive rewards. The report found ‘short-termism’ is strangling growth in the UK economy by starving it of investment as executives seek to bump up their bonuses with quick profits, through risky takeovers or cost-cutting,  regardless of the long-term consequences. Executive bonuses were unusual in the UK until the 1980s, Professor Kay said, when incentive schemes started to become increasingly common. Overhaul: The report is a key plank of attempts by Business Secretary Vince Cable to reform the financial sector . Most bonus schemes encourage chief executives to make decisions that will boost profit in the short-run, even if they have negative effects in the longer term, he added. The failed banks RBS and HBoS were . ‘characterised by acute short-termism’ in the run-up to their collapse . and bailout by taxpayers, Professor Kay said. Public . outrage over multi-million pound banker bonuses soared after a series . of scandals scarred the finance sector, including the systems failure at . RBS, money-laundering at HSBC and the Libor rate-rigging debacle. 'Hanging bankers at the end of the street' will not help solve the economy’s problems, Tony Blair said last night. Defending free market principles, the former prime minister warned against increased state intervention and the desire for revenge. He insisted public anger should not lead to a reversal of reforms started by Margaret Thatcher. ‘Don’t take 30 years of liberalisation, beginning under Mrs Thatcher, and say this is what caused the financial crisis,’ he said. Mr Blair, who is an adviser to the investment bank  JP Morgan, said: ‘We must not go back to the state running everything. ‘We must regain the basic values of what society is about. We’re not against wealth, but we are in favour of social responsibility.’ Mr Blair, who stepped down five years ago, is thought to be on an annual income of £20million. He also has a role with insurer Zurich. Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, who quit over the Libor scandal, was forced to waive his £20million golden goodbye. However he is still walking away with around £2million, on top of a total of around £120million he pocketed from the bank since the credit crunch began in 2007. Unprecedented pay revolts  have rocked a number of companies in this year’s so-called Shareholder Spring, including insurance company Aviva, media group Trinity Mirror, and drugs firm AstraZeneca. ‘It is great John Kay has raised the question of why executives need any bonus,’ said Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre. ‘They already receive a very generous level of basic pay and they should be making their maximum effort anyway, without needing a further incentive. ‘Would they really get out of bed two hours later if they did not have the prospect of a bonus?’ But Professor Kay’s proposals are likely to be met with stiff resistance in boardrooms and the Confederation of British Industry has given them a lukewarm reception. ‘Executive pay should always be linked squarely to good performance over a meaningful period of time, but it is for individual companies to decide their own pay strategy,’ said Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets. Previous attempts to rein in boardroom pay have failed to curb the tide of excess. Mr Cable aims to respond to the review later this year.

Situated in a desirable village and with a large  garden and four bedrooms, it would appear an ideal family home. But Tom and Shirley Wardle have encountered a distinct lack of interest in their property – after five separate out-of-control cars demolished their front garden wall since the property went on the market two years ago. The newly retired couple say their house and the stretch of road it lies on have become notorious as an accident black-spot. They are lobbying the local council to resurface the road in an attempt to improve drivers’ grip and prevent further accidents. Frustrated: Tom Wardle, 66, had to repeatedly rebuild his garden wall after five drivers crashed into it in two years. His home sits 75 yards from the apex of a sharp bend in the village which is a notorious blackspot . Although the Wardles live on a 30mph . stretch of road, their home is close to a sharp bend which continually . catches drivers out, especially in wet conditions. The couple have knocked £75,000 off the original £350,000 asking price to spark interest in the property, so far to no avail. Mr Wardle, 66, and his 72-year-old . wife said the string of accidents – which included two within a few . weeks last August, requiring their garden wall to be rebuilt each time – . has cost their insurers £15,000. Mr Wardle, a former shipbuilder, said . he had counted 16 accidents on the road since a car ploughed into the . wall outside their home in Bretforton, near Evesham, Worcestershire, in . September 2010. Number one: The first car that smashed into Tom's property on the 29th September, 2010 leaving bricks strewn everywhere. It happened just months after the couple put their £350,000 home on the market . Number two: The second car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th April, 2011 is pictured dangerously close to the house. The accident happened at night and house-buyers have been put off buying the property . He said: ‘It is only a matter of time before someone gets really seriously hurt or killed. ‘It would appear the road surface has . become so worn that as soon as it starts to rain the grip level of the . surface decreases dramatically. ‘There will be an accident here where a child gets killed. That’s my big fear. ‘I can’t sleep at night because every time I hear tyres screeching I am just waiting for the inevitable smash of my wall.’ The couple put the property, where . they have lived for 18 years, on the market in May 2010. But they were . forced to take it off four months later following the crash on September . 29, so the wall could be repaired. Number . three: The third car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th . August, 2011. Mr Wardle and his wife say they can't sleep and are afraid . there could be a fatality if nothing is done to improve the road's grip . Number . four: The fourth car that smashed into Tom's property on the 26th . August, 2011. Mr Wardle has had to drop the price of his house by . £75,000 but it remains unsold due to the problems with the crashes . Number . five: The fifth car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th July, . 2012 completely destroys the wall. It was driven by a middle-aged driver . who lost control of his red Ford and careered into the driveway . The couple put the house on the market again in November but withdrew it after a crash on April 4, 2011. Builders had to repair the couple’s . wall twice in one month after a car crashed through it on August 4 and . another car hit it on August 26. The latest crash took place on the . evening of July 4 this year. Worcestershire County Council denied the road surface was responsible for the accidents.

Briggs, whose children are aged seven, 10 and 11, polished off eight cans before going out to get another 10. By 6pm, he had only two cans left and was drunk, said Mrs Ward. She . continued: 'When one of the children entered the shed he became angry . and then left the shed holding one of the guinea pigs, which he threw . against the house wall. 'It didn’t die straight away.' Realising that the three children were upset, the defendant’s partner came out into the garden. When a police officer arrived, he saw one of the children holding the injured guinea pig, which moved slightly and then died. Mrs Ward added: 'The mother of the children outlined what had happened but declined to make a formal written statement.' Guilty: Stephen Briggs lost his temper and threw the guinea pig (not pictured) against the wall of his house in front of his three children after drinking 16 cans . When interviewed by police, Briggs said he had been drunk after consuming 16 cans of lager but he then became very upset, admitting that he had killed the guinea pig while the children were there. In court, Briggs, now living at Guisborough, Cleveland, blamed his actions on his drinking, saying: 'I was in the wrong.' He said he was now living with his parents and worried that his children might think he was evil. He added that he hopes to go back to his wife and family.

She told Miss Duggar she had photographic proof that the 25-year-old was having an illicit affair and wanted a $10,000 pay off. The pictures turned out to be innocent snaps of Amy with her singing mentor James Garrett, a John Denver impersonator 21 years her senior. Innocent snap: Amy Duggar, 24, pictured with her mentor James Garrett. Teresa Hunt tried extorting $10,000 from Discovery Communications over this image . Hunt faced one charge of extortion in federal court in Davenport, Iowa after trying to blackmail Amy and Discovery Communications, the company which owns TLC who make the Duggar family's popular reality show. Amy Duggar told the Quad-City Times that Hunt was a complete stranger to her. Mr Garrett had previously said that Hunt worked as a personal photographer for him, providing his publicity shots. Hunt's scam was revealed after an FBI sting where an undercover agent posed as an employee from Discovery Communications. Hunt claimed to the agent that three media outlets had each offered $3,000 for the pictures of Amy Duggar. Hunt then emailed the pictures unwittingly to the FBI with a demand for $10,000 to be wired into her bank account. Amy Duggar, a devout Christian, said that justice had been served, telling RadarOnline: 'It is a sad situation and it didn’t affect me at all. Forgiveness: The Duggars' niece Amy said she was glad justice had been served. She had always denied claims that were made about her and James Garrett, a John Denver tribute singer (right) 'I’m deeply saddened that she is going to have time in prison and I hope to God she gets her heart healed, whatever is hurting her.' Teresa Hunt, of Bettendorf, Iowa, told the judge that she had used anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for 20 years. She claimed that there was 'two sides to every story' as she left court. Hunt is due to be sentenced on November 9 and faces up to two years in prison. James Garrett earlier told RadarOnline that he and Amy had enjoyed a good laugh that the photos would be considered incriminating but that the whole experience had been unsettling. According to Mr Garrett, Amy sang with the . John Denver tribute show in Branson, Missouri for four years and their . working friendship was strictly platonic and professional. Hunt had worked for Mr Garrett as his personal photographer providing . pictures for his billboards and magazine ads. Country singer Amy occasionally appears on the reality series as a guest star. Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar are a deeply religious couple who shun contraception and have a family of 19 children. They have been married since 1984 and have ten boys, nine girls and two grandchildren.

Fined: Wolfgang Menzel, pictured outside court today, had to pay the court £500 for trying to sell £23,000 of tickets . A foreign ticket tout who tried to sell £23,000 worth of Olympic tickets on the streets of London has escaped with a paltry fine. Wolfgang Menzel, 57, was arrested when police spotted him brazenly selling tickets for the opening ceremony for £1,100 each at Westfield Shopping Centre, just next to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. Yesterday the German, who had 51 tickets worth £23,900, was fined just £435 after convincing magistrates he was a ‘genuine sports fan’ who had bought too many tickets. But afterwards, the tout told the Daily Mail he had also made bumper profits hawking 2010 World Cup tickets in South Africa. Several suspected overseas sellers appeared in court yesterday as concerns grow that prized tickets entrusted to foreign delegations are being openly sold on the black market. Scotland Yard has made 29 arrests. Stratford Magistrates Court heard yesterday that Menzel, a mortgage broker, was caught hours before the opening ceremony on Friday trying to sell 31 tickets to various Olympics events after buying them in his native country. A further 20 were seized from the room where he was staying in Bloomsbury. Menzel told police he had been trying to sell four tickets for the opening ceremony because his friend and family members couldn’t attend. Sabrina Samaroo, prosecuting, said Menzel was stopped by police after being seen approaching a man holding a sign that read ‘two tickets needed’. She added: ‘He said he was selling them for £1,100 each. He said he was planning to sell other tickets because he had spent 30,000 euros on tickets.’ But Nicole Lody, defending, said Menzel was a ‘genuine sports fan’ who planned to attend many events, but got carried away and bought too many tickets. The maximum penalty for ticket touting at the London Games is a fine of £20,000. But Menzel escaped with a £435 fine after admitting the charge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tout: Wolfgang Menzel was caught outside the Olympic Stadium trying to sell tickets to the opening ceremony for more than £1,000 . A Canadian tourist caught red-handed trying to sell Olympics tennis tickets for face value walked free from court today despite pleading guilty to ticket touting. Kenneth Gaba, 38, was caught by police touting the two tickets for the tennis in Wimbledon, south west London, on Saturday. Officers became suspicious when they saw Gaba, who was on holiday in London from Vancouver, carrying a newspaper strangely. Having followed him to a bus stop they saw another man give him £100 for the two tickets and swooped to arrest him. The Canadian said he was only trying to get the money back for the tickets he had bought legitimately as he had lost his pal and didn’t want to watch the tennis on his own. Gaba, who spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, pleaded guilty to selling Olympics tickets without authority when he appeared before Lavender Hill Magistrates Court in south London today. However, District Judge Ken Grant accepted Gaba's version of events. Ms Samaroo said: 'The defendant was seen to approach the male holding the sign and they had a conversation. 'As officers approached they heard the male saying: ""that’s much too expensive"". 'They also heard another man say: ""do you have another two?"" 'He walked away and was followed by another two males and it became obvious to the officers he was attempting to sell tickets.' The court was told that when interviewed by police, he admitted trying to sell four sought-after tickets for the ceremony. Ms Samaroo said: 'In his interview he made admissions. 'He said he was selling the tickets because his family couldn’t attend. He said he was selling them for £1,100 each. 'He said he was planning to sell other tickets because he had spent 30,000 euros on tickets.' Nicole Lody, in mitigation, told the court Menzel bought too many tickets. She said: 'He wasn’t aware that he couldn’t sell them in the UK because in Germany tickets are being advertised very widely on the internet and ebay. 'He has suffered a significant loss - all his tickets have been seized. 'He is not going to the Olympic Games and that money is lost. He is clearly very remorseful and embarrassed that he is in court today.' Fining Menzel District Judge Mark Radway said: 'It is accepted that these were genuine tickets and it is not challenged that you didn’t know you were not entitled to re-sell them in the UK. 'Taking into account the fact that you have lost the value of these tickets and you have pleaded guilty, the fine is going to be based on one week’s wages.' Menzel's fine came as spectators who fail to take their . seats within 30 minutes of the start of an Olympic event were warned they could lose them . under plans being considered by Games organisers. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said today the new rule was being explored after many events began in half-empty stadia. Organisers . Locog have already drafted in troops, teachers and schoolchildren to . sit in empty seats in a desperate bid to fill venues. Some 3,000 Olympics tickets have been taken from international sporting . federations and put 'back in the pot' to be bought by members of . the public. Problems: The Games has been plagued by empty seats at events but Menzel is one of several touting tickets because they have too many . Announcement: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that people who are not in their seats within 30 minutes of the events starting could forfeit their tickets . An Olympic Games employee charged over a ticket scam involving the . theft of media passes to travel in VIP Games lanes through London appeared in court today. Canadian Alkyiham Sachedina, 29, an international logistics . specialist who came to the UK a year ago to work for Locog, is charged . with the theft of two Olympic route network passes. The passes guarantee fast travel through the capital’s clogged streets in reserved lanes. He appeared alongside fellow Canadian national Ian Hamilton, 52, who . is charged with handling the stolen passes, which were reported stolen . by LOCOG on July 16th and July 18th. It is alleged Sachedina carried out the theft while working at the . Games and passed them on to Hamilton who was staying with him at his . temporary address in Dundee Road, Plaistow, east London. The pair were arrested by police after being seen acting suspiciously . outside Stratford station on Friday while Sachedina was wearing full . Olympic uniform. The court heard Hamilton, who also works in international logistics, . travelled to London to attend the Olympics on a working holiday after . securing a contract to provide services to sponsors at the Winter . Olympics in Russia in 2014. Refusing the pair bail, Judge Radway said: 'These offences involve . potentially serious security breaches that may well lead to you . absconding. The remand for you both is in custody.” They are next due to appear at Highbury Magistrates Court on August 6th.

Footballer Nicklas Bendtner has been ordered to pay almost £5,000 in fines after he was caught driving without a licence and insurance. The Arsenal striker, who was on-loan to Sunderland last season, was pulled over by police in South Tyneside. Detectives discovered the 24-year-old was not insured on his £40,000 Audi and had no driving licence. Bendtner, who was charged with driving without the correct licence, using a vehicle without insurance and two counts of driving a vehicle with a registration plate not conforming with regulations was found guilty in his absence by magistrates at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. He was fined £4,750 and had six points added to his licence. The 24-year-old Danish international, who has been linked with a move to Spanish side Celta Vigo at the weekend, was also ordered to pay £85 costs. Bendtner allegedly told police when asked why there was no insurance or proper number plates on his Audi Q7, that he had a 'friend who sorts that out for me.' The court heard that the striker had no licence after failing to re-apply for it having receiving a 56-day driving ban for speeding in February. Rachael Dodsworth, prosecuting, said: 'It was 6.50pm on May 13 when police stopped the defendant’s silver Audi Q7. 'There were more than two people in the car and there were no ‘L’ plates. 'There was no trace of the registration number, and there was no insurance on the car.'

There were just 92 seconds on the clock when Arsenal player Houghton rounded the Brazilian goalkeeper and finished from a difficult angle . The 1-0 win over tournament favourites Brazil delighted the crowd of 70,584 inside Wembley Stadium - a record for a women's football match in Britain . The win means Hope Powell's side have . topped their group without losing a game and will face Canada in the . quarter-final in Coventry on Friday. The result is  arguably the finest in the history of British women's football. Although there have been more significant achievements, FA officials privately conceded that against such formidable . opposition, in front of a record  crowd, there has been no . better evening.

But Kelly Smith's penalty was saved by the Brazilian keeper. The previous highest crowd at a women's match in England is recorded as 53,000 for an exhibition match between Preston-based Dick Kerr Ladies, a famous touring side of the age, and St Helens Ladies, at Goodison Park, Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920.

She rejected getting a solicitor to present the case herself to an employment judge and said: 'When he knew it was cancer he asked me to pursue this tribunal process for him. 'He knew it was too late to help him but he just hoped it might help others. This is what has been driving me.' The mother-of-three said Amazon should not have kept her son away from work without pay while he was ill. The hearing in Cardiff was told how keen windsurfer David first suffered from cancer in 1998. The disease did not develop and he continued with his life having regular checkups with his GP. David started working for Amazon through an agency in September 2008 before becoming a full time member of staff in July 2009. When he was taken on by the company he filled in a questionnaire telling them about his medical problems. This was passed onto Amazon's occupational provider Manor House Health Care Limited. But when David started complaining of back problems in November 2009 the company did not pass the relevant information onto his bosses. Heavy lifting: The mother says David was forced to do strenuous work in the Amazon warehouse when he was unwell and then sent home without pay . Employment judge Roger Harper said: . 'Manor House should have put two and two together and noticed a link . between his history of cancer and the back pain he suffered. 'But Amazon could not have been expected to make the link themselves.' Mrs Peregrine-Davies said that when David was told to go home because his role was causing him too much pain, he had been excluded from work: 'It was additional worry causing him stress at a time when he needed it least. 'It affected him emotionally and financially, he was not allowed to go to work, not given any reason and not paid.' The hearing was told that David had used up his paid sickness leave and had no other source of income. He fell behind with payments on his car insurance and ended up being unable to drive. David was forced to lodge a grievance with Amazon in a desperate attempt to get back to work. This took two months for Amazon deal with while they tried to get his doctors records and David never received the results. Amazon, who have since changed their . occupational health providers, were criticised by Mr Harper for the way . they dealt with David's case. Mr Harper added: 'As an act of desperation David issued a grievance, he made it crystal clear he was suffering physically, emotionally and financially.' Warring with a giant: The mother says after her son was sent home without pay, he fell behind on his bills ad payments . 'Amazon would have been left in no doubt about the impact this was having on him. 'But the delay in there obtaining the . medical notes was unacceptable and for whatever reason he never received . the results - and this was inexcusable behaviour. Mr Harper also said that Amazon should have considered putting David on full paid medical suspension. Speaking after the case Mrs . Peregrine-Davies said: 'I am naturally saddened by the decision that has . been handed down by the employment tribunal today. 'When David knew he was too ill to . return to work, it was still my son's wish to continue to fight his case . as he felt that it might at least help others. 'During the last few months of his . life my son was made to suffer the most awful financial and emotional . distress that added greatly to the physical difficulties that had begun . to beset him. 'I have now done everything that I could have in an attempt to get justice for my son. 'For me it was still worth the fight . if it serves to improve Amazon's practices and prevents anyone else . suffering unnecessarily.'","Son was sent home with a mystery illness later diagnosed as cancer .

A pensioner caught with nearly £700 of crack cocaine hidden in his woolly hat was told by a judge that he should be enjoying his retirement instead. Reginald 'Shaggy' Johnson, 69, was pulled over by police when they spotted him driving 'somewhat strangely' down the busy A19 in September last year. A court heard officers then search the Vauxhall Omega car and discovered 6.8g of crack cocaine, worth £682, tucked inside a beanie hat that Johnson had been attempting to hide. Johnson was today jailed at Teesside Crown Court by Judge Taylor - who told him he should be enjoying his retirement. Mrs Sue Jacobs, prosecuting, told the court how police targeted the pensioner because his car was being driven ‘somewhat strangely.’ Mrs Jacobs said that the pensioner claimed he had been visiting a friend in Huddersfield who had left the hat in his car but in fact he had bought the drugs locally to share with a friend. Johnson has previously received a five-year jail sentence in 2007 for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine. The court heard Johnson occasionally puts a bet on the horses but that he also occasionally smoked crack. Jailed: Johnson was sentenced to 18 months in prison for possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) Johnson, from Middlesbrough, was jailed for 18 months after he pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply. Passing sentence, Judge Taylor added: 'He should be reaching the stage of his life where he enjoys pensioner status on the outside and not the inside. 'I have no choice but to impose a custodial sentence, but bearing in mind your age and the particular circumstances I am going to be merciful. 'Let me give you this warning, that if you appear in court again for a similar offence it would be a minimum starting point of seven years.'","Reginald 'Shaggy' Johnson, 69, jailed for 18 months ."

'Dishonest': Carer Monica Owusu (pictured) stole £50,000 by continuing to claim her dead husband's benefits after his death . A widow stole more than £50,000 by continuing to pocket her husband’s benefit payments for nearly three years after his death. Part-time carer Monica Owusu, 50, received £1,895 every month into their joint account, but did not tell the council her husband had died. She used the money to pay bills and her mortgage, a court heard. Owusu was sentenced to thirty weeks in prison, suspended for twelve months, and ordered to complete 80 . hours community service. She was also told to repay the money after pleading guilty to stealing £52,122 from the London Borough of Croydon between September 1, 2007 and May 18, 2010. Sentencing her, Recorder Ian Bourne QC said: 'You withdrew the money and used it for your financial commitments, knowing it did not belong to you and should have been returned to the local authority,' The family home, which she inherited from her late husband, will now be sold to repay the debt. Owusu’s husband received the benefit for home care from September, 2004, but passed away three years later. 'He had required full-time care and was paralysed,' prosecutor Francesca Levett told Croydon Crown Court. 'Monica Owusu was in charge of his finances. 'She informed their occupational therapist when her husband died, but this information did not reach the relevant department and direct payments continued to be made. 'The account continued receiving the payments for months, but it was not until August Mrs Owusu accessed the account and saw the large sum of over £20,000. 'That’s when, the prosecution say, she became dishonest and withdrew large sums without notifying the local authority.' 'Eternal regret': Owusu has agreed to Croydon Council (above) the money back at the rate of £150 a month after pleading guilty to the theft . Eventually, Croydon Council stopped the payments and interviewed the defendant. 'She said she used it to pay bills and her mortgage and said she did not know why she did not tell the local authority. 'All the money was withdrawn. Nothing was left in the bank account.' Owusu, of Oval Road, Croydon, agreed to repay the council at the rate of £150 per month, but stopped after nine payments. Owusu’s lawyer Kwame Inyund said: 'To her eternal regret, she took advantage of the situation with the money she was not expecting. 'There is no evidence of a lavish lifestyle or money taken out of pure greed. 'It is her intention to make good what is owed to the local authority out of the sale of the property.' Recorder Bourne told the first-time offender: 'It is obvious to everyone that you did not set out to steal such a large amount of money from the local authority. 'It was inevitable that you would have been caught one day.'","Monica Owusu had £1,895 a month paid into her joint bank account .

A pharmacology professor at the University of California, Irvine is accused of starting several fires at his son’s former high school and plotting to kill both students and administrators. Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, 48, is charged with setting five fires on the campus of University High School, as well as a local park. Authorities also found worrying emails Reinscheid sent to his wife in April, which allegedly said how he was going to burn down the school, buy guns, shoot students and administrators, and then kill himself. His 14-year-old son had been a student there and had been disciplined this past spring before later committing suicide at a nearby park. Scroll down for video . Fallen: Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, pictured left on his faculty bio page and right, in his booking photo, is a pharmacology professor at UC Irvine, and was charged with several counts of arson . Set alight: Prosecutors alleged that the professor started several fires around University High School in Irvine, where his son went until his death in March . Tragic end: Reinscheid's son, 14, attended the school, but hung himself in a nearby park in March . The college professor, who earned his PhD in Hamburg, Germany, was arrested in the middle of the night on July 24, after Orange County police allegedly caught him trying to start fires in Mason Park Preserve – the same park where his son had hanged himself in March. Prosecutors accused Reinscheid of starting five fires at University High School earlier in July, allegedly setting fire to various objects such as newspapers, books, fireplace logs, and a plastic porch chair. Reinscheid was arrested last week in connection with the fires and posted $50,000 bail. However, after he bailed out, authorities found emails on his cell phone addressed to his wife describing a plot to burn down the high school, commit sexual assaults and purchase weapons to murder school officials and students there before killing himself, according to Orange County District Attorney spokeswoman Farrah Emami. ‘This is unusual, and obviously very alarming. Based on these private emails, it’s clear that he’s a very dangerous person for wanting to murder students and administrators,’ she told MailOnline. Prosecutors believe Reinscheid was acting alone but it wasn't clear if he was targeting anyone specifically. 'I can only at this point tell you, he laid out in sufficient detail plans to purchase guns and murder lots of people,' Orange County Deputy District Attorney Andrew Katz told The Associated Press. Gone too soon: His son hanged himself in Mason Park, pictured, in March; police did not find any drugs or alcohol in the teenager's system . Scene: In March, a maintenance worker found the boy's body in Mason Park, right; University High School can also be seen, bottom left . After the emails were discovered, Ms Emami said Reinscheid was arrested again. 'The emails by themselves do not support a criminal charge but they do support our argument that he should be denied bail because he's dangerous' she told AP. Reinscheid will now be held without bail in conjunction with his alleged crimes. ‘We believe he’s dangerous, and we believe he’s a risk to public safety,’ Ms Emami told the Los Angeles Times. According to the Orange County Register, which initially reported the boy’s death, the student was found by a maintenance worker on March 14, and had apparently hanged himself in the park the night before. He had been disciplined earlier this year, though it is unclear what he did to merit punishment. A toxicology report conducted by the Orange County Coroner’s Office revealed that the teenager had no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of his death. Reinscheid was charged with five counts of arson, one count of attempted arson and a misdemeanour count of resisting or obstructing a police officer. If convicted, he faces 12 years and eight months in prison. The Orange County D.A.’s office declined to say how exactly Reinscheid’s son was disciplined at the high school, but Irvine United School District spokesman Ian Hanigan told the OCRegister.com that Reinscheid was ‘extremely distraught.' However, Mr Hanigan added that in the months following his son's suicide, Reinscheid never threatened any of the high school staff, nor acted aggressively toward them. Knowledge is power: Reinscheid is an associate professor Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences . Reinscheid is a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California, Irvine, and has been there for about 12 years, said a university spokeswoman, who referred further comment to authorities.According to his faculty profile, Reinscheid received his PhD in Neurobiology of Invertebrates from the Center for Molecular Neurobiology in Hamburg, Germany in 1993. He was awarded two research awards and has been published in several dozen scientific journals, and earned a salary of $87,016 in 2010, according to university records. Cathy Lawhon, Director of Media Relations for UC Irvine, told MailOnline that Reinscheid is an associate professor who has worked at UC Irvine for 12 years. She said: ‘We do background checks with everyone who’s hired, and had been alerted by Irvine PD after the first arrest, and campus police had been cooperating with them at that point.’ The university will issue an alert later tonight to inform students about the professor’s arrest. Reinscheid will next appear in court August 8th for a continued arraignment, as he did not offer a plea in Tuesday's court appearance.","Rainer Klaus Reinscheid, 48, accused of setting five fires around University High School in Irvine .

Ultra cost-cutter Ryanair wants to widen its doors in yet another scheme to make themselves cash. The Dublin-based airline says allowing people to get on or off in twos could boost their profits as it would speed-up their turnaround at airports. Ryanair's outspoken boss Michael O'Leary is famous for his cost-cutting ideas, including charging £1 to use the toilet or even offering standing tickets on flights. Now Mr O'Leary is in talks with a Chinese company to help him herd passengers on and off in record times. Good things come in twos: Ryanair wants to get people on and off quicker by widening its doors . The state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China is already considering putting a prototype together for them. 'The Chinese are willing to listen to what we want,' Ryanair’s chief financial officer, Howard Millar said. Full of ideas: Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary has considered many extrovert plans to make more money . 'A plane manufactured by Boeing or Airbus is a one-size-fits-all. We want two people to walk through the door.' It came as last night Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary said he was upset he could not charge more for tickets, as profits fell by almost a third. 'We’re always trying to increase fares, but this time demand doesn’t allow it,' he said. He added that austerity and European economic woes would ‘restrain fare growth’ going into next winter. Lower demand for air travel by hard-pressed passengers was also keeping prices down, he said. He blamed the 28 per cent fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £88million on the rising costs of aircraft fuel. The amount the company pays for its fuel has risen by 27 per cent in the last year, he said, and now makes up almost half of total operating costs. But it transpired that the airline had locked itself into paying a higher price for the fuel, after striking a deal. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's plan for wider doors is the latest scheme from the budget airline. Some have been implemented, while others have not. They include... Last year it paid the equivalent of . $82 a barrel for the fuel, but this year is shelling out between $100 . and $104 – more than it would be paying on the open market. The deal means Ryanair will pay out . the higher amount until March next year, but O’Leary said it was worth . it for the certainty on costs. Profits between April and June fell by 28 per cent to £88million, while passenger numbers increased by 6 per cent to 22.5million. Revenues, which rose 11 per cent to . £1billion, were held back by ‘heavily discounted fares’ from some of . Ryanair’s regional British airports and a number of its continental . destinations. But the airline has often been accused of adding on additional and hidden charges in the past. O’Leary said the summer’s trading was . still poor, with Europeans being put off by high prices and many Brits . choosing to stay at home to watch the Olympics. He refused to comment on Ryanair’s offer for Aer Lingus, which is currently being assessed by European competition authorities. Shares, which are up 25 per cent in the last 12 months, rose 8.8c to close at €4. A turbulent ride: Ryanair profits between April and June declined by 28 per cent to £88million .","Getting people off and on in twos will speed up airport turnarounds - key for budget airlines' profits .

The 20-year-old has taken to Twitter this morning to complain that her her golden post box will be placed in Harlow, Essex when it should be in Cheshunt . Yesterday she was on top of the world after thrashing the U.S to win an Olympic gold medal in a world record time. But despite her astonishing success in the cycling team pursuit, not everything has gone to plan for Laura Trott. The 20-year-old has taken to Twitter this morning to complain that her golden post box will be placed in Harlow, Essex, when it should be 13 miles away in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. She has now asked her 22,000 followers to contact the Post Office on her behalf to see if it can be changed. The gold-medal winner wrote: 'So people i need you to tweet @PostOffice for me.. my postbox is going in harlow which isnt in my hometown Cheshunt is where it should be!!' The star was clearly thrilled by the prospect of having a golden postbox as she had last night asked her followers to tweet her pictures of them next to it. Her tweet prompted a response from a number of her fans, including cycling great Sir Chris Hoy. Referring to her attempt to win a second gold in the Omnium event, he said: 'You're just going to have to win another one in the omnium and get it in the right place!' The confusion appears to come from the fact that Trott was born in Harlow but now lives in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. She grew up in Hertfordshire and attended Turnford secondary school in Cheshunt. Every time a British athlete wins a gold medal in the Olympics or Paralympics, Royal Mail is painting a post box in their home town gold to celebrate. A dedicated team armed with brushes and tins of gold paint are going to be busy dashing around the country to transform post boxes within days of a medal win. The first golden post box was unveiled outside Westminster Abbey in London. It is the first time since 1874 that the Royal Mail has changed its iconic red post boxes. Request for help: Trott has now asked her 22,000 followers to contact the Post Office on her behalf to see if the location of her golden post box can be changed . Mistake: The confusion appears to come from the fact that Trott was born in Harlow but now lives in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire . Many of Britain's first boxes were pained green in order to blend in with the countryside, but the bright red colour was introduced to make them more visible to the public. Royal Mail stressed that collections from the golden boxes will remain the same despite the new look and that they would in time return to the normal red colour. Tim Cowen of Royal Mail said the mistake was made because her home town is listed as Harlow on the Team GB website. 'We tweeted her straight back to say we'll be delighted to do one in Cheshunt as well.' Tribute: This gold post box is for cyclist Victoria Pendelton in Stotfold, Bedfordshire . Happy: Great Britain's, left to right, Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell celebrate with their gold medals after winning the Women's Team Pursuit Final .

It is understood the Saudi Royal Family own ten of the street's 66 properties, with other billionaire owners including the Sultan of Brunei and Britain's richest man, Lakshmi Mittal. Very few of these ambassadorial-type houses come onto the market and they attract global attention on the rare occasions they are made available.

'Trickster': Police are trying to figure out the true identity of 52-year-old Roy Antigua, pictured . Some may have known Roy Antigua as a CIA agent, a member of NASA or even a doctor - but all the police can be sure of is that he's a fake. Officers in New Port Richey, Florida are appealing for the public's help after they unearthed a startling cache of fake ID cards and uniforms at Antigua's home - and want to know if he has ever posed in a position of authority. They found U.S. military medals, identification cards from NASA, the CIA and Homeland Security, a flight helmet, uniforms from U.S. Customs and the Navy and even a diplomatic license plate. In one particularly chilling discovery, officers also found a doctor's bag filled with equipment and a picture of Antigua holding a newborn baby while wearing scrubs. 'We need to know, from start to finish - who is Roy Antigua?' New . Port Richey Police Chief James Steffens said at a news conference on Monday, Fox News reported. Officers were led to the home after New Port Richey Police Officer Edward Campbell pulled Antigua over during a routine traffic stop, and was suspicious of the U.S. Coast Guard card he used as ID. 'It had a gold chip that was missing,' he said. 'The back of the ID resembled a hotel card.' Antigua is in jail after being arrested for driving without a license and a parole violation, and police are appealing for help to determine if he has carried out any other crime. While they cannot yet be certain that he used the ID cards and uniforms to trick people into believing a fake identity, they know he pretended to be a Coast Guard on at least one occasion. Discovery: Police found numerous fake IDs, uniforms and badges, pictured, at his Florida home . Fakes: Officers found U.S. Coast Guard uniforms, left, and a special agent badge, right . Medals: Police found the uniforms after Antigua used a fake ID during a routine traffic stop . Steffans recalled seeing Antigua at a . Memorial Day event at a cemetery, where he was wearing a uniform and . introduced himself as a . Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander. He . walked over to a special section for officials and sat next to the . police chief in a move that Steffans said was an offense to veterans and . fallen soldiers. 'Everybody around there thought that he was the real deal,' Steffens said. The only ID that proved genuine with an identification card for the Coast Guard Auxiliary in Miami. Concerning: As well as ID badges, police also found a picture of Antigua holding a baby in scrubs, right . Worrying: Among the uniforms there were ones for the Boy Scouts of America, pictured .

Officers also found a Boy Scout troop leader uniform - a discovery they found particularly frightening. 'It's actually scary. You see these Boy Scout uniforms, who knows if . he's been around young children and what his intentions were,' an . official told MyFoxTampaBay.com. Authorities are trying to figure out whether he used the collection just to dress up - or for more sinister means. Who is he?

Is he really a threat or is he someone who is living a very involved . fantasy life?' Steffans asked. 'You don't have this collection just to keep it in your house and look in the mirror.'

It has been a long four years for Jenn Suhr, whose dramatic journey had her fighting back from a debilitating illness and other injuries to defeat the Russian favourite and come out on top with Olympic gold in the pole vault. Suhr, 30, had a tough foe in Yelena Isinbayeva, of Russia, who was aiming to be the first woman in track and field history to win the same individual event in three straight Olympics. She was Jenn Stuczynski back in 2008 when she competed against Isbinbayeva in the pole vault at the Beijing games. First place: Jennifer Suhr of the U.S. runs with the American flag after winning the women's pole vault final . Coach and husband: Suhr had a helping hand in her intense training by husband and coach Rick Suhr . But it was her Russian rival who triumphed, breaking her own world record and clearing a height of 16 feet and seven inches. The world was watching when, after coming up short against Isinbayeva and picking up the silver medal, her coach, Rich Suhr, could be seen berating her. What the world didn’t know was that the athlete and her coach were dating, and in 2010, they were married. With Beijing in her rear-view mirror, Mrs Suhr began to focus on the London games, but it didn’t come easy. Great heights: Jennifer Suhr of the U.S. took the gold medal in the women's pole vault at the London Olympics . While training last year, she was having difficulty bouncing back from workouts and was constantly feeling weak and suffering abdominal pain. She later found that she had Celiac disease, a digestive illness caused by the protein gluten. There is no cure for the disease, but its symptoms can be avoided by switching to a gluten-free diet, which she did in order to continue her training. The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that her Olympic journey hit another snag in May, when she tore her right quadriceps muscle. Battle: With the help of her coach and husband Rick, Jenn Suhr triumphed over her illness to win Olympic gold . Achievement: Following her success, Suhr was congratulated by her husband and coach Rick . Throw in an Achilles injury, and the odds were dramatically against her. Suhr's husband could not help but recall another underdog story, the 1980 U.S. hockey team, who beat the odds and beat their Russian rivals in the Lake Placid. Celiac disease is a digestive illness that is caused by a reaction to the protein gluten. The condition can cause damage to the walls of the small intestine making it difficult to absorb certain nutrients, according to the Mayo Clinic. Gluten is primarily found in foods like pasta, bread and pizza crust. There is no known cure for the disease, and patients are advised to switch to a gluten-free diet to avoid symptoms, which include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and fatigue. Like the Americans on the ice, Suhr came back stronger than ever, and blew away the competition - including Isbinbayeva, who wound up with the bronze. It was a shining moment for the 30-year-old as she embraced her husband, who wrapped an American flag around her as she sobbed. Following her success, Suhr wrote on Facebook: 'It’s very emotional. It’s something that you work so hard for, for four years, and heartbreak and joy, and then some more heartbreak. 'To overcome it and come out on top is something that whenever I thought of I started crying, so I knew it was just going to be emotional, whenever I thought about how it would feel to win gold. 'Then I would think of how it would feel to be fourth, and I'd cry over that too. It was definitely something that I’ve wanted, I don’t think I've ever wanted anything so bad.' Back then: Suhr, left, finished with the silver medal behind arch rival Yelena Isinbaeva, centre, of Russia in the 2008 Beijing games .","Jenn Suhr bounced back from Celiac disease, an Achilles injury and a torn quadriceps muscle to achieve Olympic gold .

David Cameron faced embarrassment last night after it was revealed compulsory PE lessons in schools have been scrapped – at the same time as he vowed to ‘get serious’ about investing in sport. The Prime Minister promised to keep ploughing money into British sport  yesterday as he hailed ‘a golden summer’ of achievement by the Olympic team. But he faced criticism after the Department for Education confirmed schools will no longer be forced to provide two hours of physical education and sport every week – a requirement brought in under Labour.

He told Sky News: ‘I think its time to get serious about putting money into sport. One of the great reasons why Britain did so well in Beijing and I think is doing well at these Olympics, is called John Major. ‘He introduced the National Lottery, and that National Lottery has provided and will go on providing great funding for sport.’ Mr Cameron spoke out amid warnings from Olympics mastermind Lord Coe and former Sports Minister Lord Moynihan - both Tories - that money must continue to flow to top athletes if the UK is to build a worthwhile sporting legacy to the Games.

But new figures released by the Department for Education show that Mr Gove has received 22 requests to dispose of school playing fields since May 2010 and has approved 21, with one pending a decision. But officials pointed out that 14 of the 21 cases related to schools that had closed while four were sites that became surplus to requirements when existing schools merged.","The Prime Minister hailed 'a golden summer' of achievement by the Olympic team .

He said he hoped winning a gold medal would improve his chances with the ladies. But show-jumper Scott Brash yesterday admitted it hadn’t quite worked out. The single 26-year-old – who won a team gold in the show-jumping on Monday – was seen out celebrating that night in Greenwich. But yesterday, the day he competed in the individual event, he revealed he ended that evening without a lady in tow. He had earlier told BBC presenter Claire Balding, who asked him how the win would change his life: ‘I really hope this win improves my pulling power with women, if I’m honest! That’s about it.’ But yesterday the rider from Peebles said things hadn’t gone to plan. ‘The medal hasn’t had the good effect I hoped for,’ he admitted – adding: ‘I had too good a celebration and a sore head the next day.’ Brash, 26, was one of the British riders who won gold in the team show-jumping on Monday. Both he and veteran Nick Skelton competed again yesterday for individual medals – but both narrowly missed out after incurring faults on the final round. Skelton’s hopes were dashed in Greenwich Park when he hit a fence called Cutty Sark. It was his first error over six rounds of team and individual jumping but it meant he slipped from a potential gold medal jump-off to finish equal fifth with Brash. Despite his disappointment, popular Skelton, who became Britain’s oldest medallist on Monday, received a standing ovation after his performance. Competing: Scott Brash on Hello Sanctos during the Individual Jumping Final Round A at Greenwich Park . Feeling confident: Brash talks to media at a press conference at Greenwich Park . Although he had a hip replacement last year, a shoulder operation the year before that, and has ‘problems walking about’, Skelton was instrumental in Team GB’s victory in team show-jumping on Monday. It was an amazing comeback for the colourful rider, who feared he would never ride again after he was thrown from his horse 11 years ago, broke his back and almost died. When asked about his injuries, Skelton joked: ‘I’ve had two cartilage operations, a shoulder replacement, a hip replacement, a broken neck and I’ve got to get a back replacement – but apart from that I’m fine.’ After finishing his round, the rider shrugged and smiled before taking his hat off for the crowd and clapping the spectators. He was rewarded with an enthusiastic send off, with 23,000 spectators cheering and stamping for the popular rider. Afterwards, the 54-year-old - who is on his sixth Olympics - said he was ‘disappointed’ not to get another medal.

It is great for the sport, great for me.’ Steve Guerdat, 30, ended an 88-year wait for a Swiss gold medallist in individual show-jumping.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:38 EST, 11 August 2012 . The Colorado man accused of hiding in the tank of a portable toilet to spy on women while also creating peep holes in other restrooms across the city of Boulder has pleaded not guilty to several charges. Luke Chrisco, 31, pleaded not guilty on Friday to eight felony counts of second-degree burglary as well as two misdemeanor counts of unlawful sexual contact and criminal invasion of privacy. Chrisco was arrested a few days after a woman using a portable toilet at a Boulder yoga festival last summer noticed something moving in the tank and then saw a feces-stained man emerge and run away. Pervert: Luke Chrisco has pleaded not guilty to accusations among many that he hid in a women's portaloo to spy on women contracting his previous confessions last year . Police also think he created peep holes in the bathrooms of several Boulder businesses and on the University of Colorado campus. Arrested for an unrelated incident in Vail, police said he confessed in detail to specific locations, offering enough description to connect him to the accused hiding places. Chrisco is being held on $250,000 bond, the Daily Camera reports. After his arrest last June he spoke openly of his perverted fetish to local news reports, revealing his motivation for the bizarre acts as it making him feel 'blessed' by other's bodily fluids. In a remarkably frank confession, Chrisco spoke of about how his bizarre obsession began, and how he even changed toilets mid way through so he could watch more women in a 'busier' one. Shock: The female festival-goer lifted the loo seat last June to discover a man hiding in the tank . Speaking to FOX31 Denver, he said: 'I was…doing a little bit of yoga, and I'm just seeing all these goddesses. 'It seems crazy, but I just felt like I was being blessed by their energy.' - Luke Chrisco in 2011 . Not put off by the foul odour and threat of catching disease, Chrisco admitted to shifting between different toilets at the Hanuman Yoga Festival on June 17. He said: 'There's bacteria in there, but to me it's just normal...we all have bodily fluids. 'It seems terrible, but it didn't actually smell that bad or anything. 'I still would have done it even if it smelled a little weird, because where there is muck, there is gold.' In the remarkably frank interview, Chrisco described how he climbed into the tank, without any shoes, wearing just a t-shirt. Pervert: Chrisco was only caught after a Boulder cop recognised him from a description of the man who fled a festival covered in faeces . The shocked festival goer who spotted Chricso, told police she dashed outside after noticing something moving inside the tank when she lifted the lid. Believing there might be a person trapped she asked a man who was standing nearby to go in and check. He confirmed that there was a man covered in a tarpaulin hiding inside the tank. A few minutes later, he heard the door lock from the inside. A festival security man waited outside for several minutes before the man finally emerged. According to festival officials, security tried to detain the man but he ran away, covered in faeces. Speaking to Boulder's Daily Camera newspaper he described how his sick habit began while travelling through Europe several years ago. Goddesses: The incident happened at the Hanuman Yoga Festival in Boulder, Colorado where Chrisco described the women as goddesses . He said it began in France when he crept into the girls changing room and, noticing a loose air vent, crept in and hid. He said: 'These chicks started showing up that I . never had a chance with. 'But I figured at least I . can see them change or something. I've come to know how interesting they . are.' 'I wanted to start a new goddess religion. 'I . always wanted to be a pimp or create a church of porn or a church of . tantric, some place people could be spiritual but also instinctual.' Shockingly Chrisco said he may have spied on as many as 200 women. Boulder Police spokeswoman Kim Kobel said: 'Detectives have already confirmed that there are 'peepholes' in the restrooms of several local businesses. 'Owners of those businesses are taking appropriate action to seal the holes.'","Luke Chrisco, 31, pleaded not guilty to eight felony counts of burglary, sexual contact and privacy .

"By . Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 9 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:35 EST, 9 August 2012 . A 12-year-old drug dealer caught with skunk cannabis had withdrawn £2,000 from his bank account in the days beforehand, a court heard. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was carrying his Nationwide bank book and 23 grams of the drug when police stopped him in a park. Details of the case emerged today when the boy, who has previous convictions for burglary, was sentenced for supplying a Class B drug with intent to supply. Illegal: The 12-year-old boy was found carrying cannabis with a street value of £230 . The boy was arrested on October 19 last year after police approached a group of youths in Heavitree Park in Exeter, Devon. Officers took a large bag from him and found it contained skunk cannabis with a street value of £230. Further checks found that the boy, from Exeter, had made five cash withdrawals from his personal bank account in the eight days before he was caught. Prosecutor Ann Hampshire told Exeter Youth Court: 'When he was searched he had in his possession a quantity of small plastic bags of the type which deals of drugs can be placed. 'He had on him his Nationwide bank book, a mobile phone and a small quantity of cannabis.' As well as the cannabis, which the prosecution claimed was due to be sold in £10 deals, the boy possessed £240 in cash. Miss Hampshire said police examining his phone found damning text messages which suggested drug dealing, such as ‘Do you need any stink?’ and ‘I can get you £25 worth, is that alright?’ The prosecutor said the boy had intended to deal the drugs after school. 'It was a clear indication of his intention to supply cannabis to a friend or an acquaintance,' she said. When interviewed by police, the boy claimed he had found the cannabis and bags in a rubbish bin near some toilets in the park - but there were no bins in the area. He told police he was a cannabis smoker and said he recognised some of the smaller drug deal bags from seeing crime shows on television. Narcotic: A dried bud of skunk cannabis. Exeter Youth Court heard that the 12-year-old boy intended to sell the drug in £10 deals . The boy admitted possessing a Class B drug with intent to supply and was given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order. Speaking directly to the three magistrates in court, the boy said he knew what he had done was wrong. 'I should not have done it,' he said. 'It is not worth it anymore.' The boy apologised to his mother, who was weeping in court during the hearing, adding: 'I am sorry for stuff I have done to her.' Defence lawyer Stephen Nunn said the boy was supplying a friend who had bemoaned the fact that another dealer had ripped him off over a deal and he had lost his money. Mr Nunn added: 'He had come into some money and was free to buy the sort of things lads do, not just cannabis.' Ordering that his phone, drugs and bags be destroyed, the magistrates told the boy: 'It was your offence and it is your responsibility. Behave yourself and follow the rules.'","Young drug dealer, from Exeter, Devon, had drugs with a street value of £230 .

A pediatrician who is an eminent researcher in near-death experiences in children has been accused of 'waterboarding' his 11-year-old daughter as punishment while his wife stood by and watched. Dr Melvin Morse, a published author who has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King, allegedly held the girl's face under a running faucet on four occasions for as long as five minutes. Authorities were alerted to the alleged abuse at the Sussex, Delaware home after a neighbour called police to say Morse had dragged the girl by her ankles across their driveway and spanked her. 'Abuse': Dr Melvin Morse, left, allegedly held his daughter's face under a running tap to 'waterboard' her as a punishment while his wife Pauline, right, watched and did nothing to help her . Officials arrested Morse, 58, after the incident on July 12 but he was released on $750 bail. On August 6, the girl was interviewed at the Child Advocacy Center and talked about a punishment her father called 'waterboarding', the Delaware State Police told The News Journal in Delaware. She said he held her under faucets in the kitchen, bathroom and bathtub so the water would shoot up her nose, in a known torture tactic that simulates the sensation of drowning. Her mother, Pauline Morse, 40, watched but did nothing to help, she said. 'Cruel': Morse is a pediatrician and has co-authored books on near-death experiences in children . Frightening: The girl told social workers that her father, left, said she could last for five minutes under the water without getting brain damage. Her mother Pauline, right, has been released on bail . Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over someone's face, simulating the sensation of drowning. A cloth is often placed over the captive's face so their breathing is restricted for up to 40 seconds as water is continually poured onto them. It dates back to the Spanish Inquisition, when it was a preferred interrogation technique as it leaves no marks on the person's body. The practice can cause extreme pain and distress, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, long-lasting psychological damage and death. It can also cause broken bones as the captive attempts to escape. In 2007, it emerged that the CIA had waterboarded three Al-Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003. The Bush administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of torture. In 2009, President Obama banned its use, but the Department of Defense has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops. Once, her . father said he 'was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so . that she could not move', she said. Another time he allegedly told her . she 'could go five minutes without brain damage'. The girl added that Morse would . 'sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he . would lose track of time and she would die'. After the alleged torture, she would 'go outside and cry', but Morse would come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand, according to court documents. 'He would tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape,' police noted. 'He would not let go until she lost feeling and . collapsed to the ground.' The girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened. Her five-year-old sister was also interviewed and said that, although she witnessed the abuse to her sister, she was never targeted 'because she is too young for it', The News Journal reported. The abuse allegedly took place between 2009 and 2011. Morse and his wife were arrested for the second time on August 7 and both face charges of reckless endangerment, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child. Morse was being held in the Sussex Correctional Institution on $14,500 bail, while Pauline Morse was released on the same amount. Eminent: Dr Morse, right, was interviewed by Larry King, left, about near-death experiences in children . High profile: In 1992, he was also interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, pictured holding up a copy of his book . Both have been ordered to have no contact with their two children, who are being cared for by the local Division of Family Services. The . state Attorney General’s Office filed a motion on Wednesday for the . emergency suspension of Morse’s medical license. He works at a private pediatric practice in Milton. He also specialises in near-death . experiences in children and has co-authored a handful of books on the . subject including Closer to the Light in 1991 and Transformed by the . Light in 1992. 'In . hundreds of interviews with children who had once been declared . clinically dead, Dr. Morse found that children too young to have . absorbed our adult views and ideas of death, share first-hand accounts . of out-of-body travel, telepathic communication and encounters with dead . friends and relatives,' one book review reads. Research: He has written the above books after interviewing children declared clinically dead . Morse was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and . Larry King about the subject, as well as on radio shows and ABC's 20/20. He runs a nonprofit organization . called The Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. Pauline Morse lists herself as a researcher and the treasurer at the institute on her Facebook page. On her page on Wednesday, she wrote: 'I do not wish to talk.

Facing prosecution: Greba Lilly, from Hull, who has been accused of fly tipping by her local council after leaving bags of clothes by a charity bin . When Greba Lilly dropped off three bags of clothing at an overflowing charity  recycling bank, she was thinking only of others. But the teaching assistant’s act of goodwill has seen her accused of fly-tipping by the local council. In a strongly-worded letter Mrs Lilly, 54, has been ordered to attend a taped interview under caution or face arrest. Mrs Lilly, a mother of two, said: ‘I can’t sleep and I can’t eat. I’m so upset, worried, afraid, and stressed. I have never done anything wrong before. I’m a bit of a goody-goody two-shoes really. ‘If someone had told me I had made a mistake I would have rolled up my sleeves and cleaned it up myself. ‘That’s the kind of family we are and that’s why this has hit us so hard.’ Mrs Lilly fell foul of Hull council after she cleared her father’s house. He suffers from Alzheimer’s and has moved into a home to receive round-the-clock care. Rather than throw away his old clothes, she decided to donate them to her local charity shop. But as she was passing the local Asda on a shopping trip, she spotted the council-run recycling centre behind the store. The recycling area was already littered with bags because the skips were full, so she left her three bags next to one of the charity clothing bins. While clearing up the area of excess bags following a complaint from Asda, council officials identified Mr Lilly’s donations,  which contained stray personal papers with her details on. Mrs Lilly added: ‘If I’d known what was going to happen I would have put them in the bin at home, but I like to give to charity. ‘There was a big pile of bags there so I just left my three. ‘Then I got this terrible letter from the council stating I could be arrested if I did not respond.’ Mrs Lilly said she has no choice but to attend the interview at the end of the month. Local authorities have the power to question suspects under caution during taped interviews. If the council does not find in Mrs Lilly’s favour following the interview, she could be handed a fixed-penalty fine for fly-tipping. Recycling centre: Mrs Lilly received a 'terrible letter' from the council after investigators tore open the bags she left and found letters with her personal details . She is the latest casualty of a zero-tolerance approach by the council that saw a mother prosecuted after she refused to pay a fine when her daughter dropped a piece of sausage roll in Hull city centre. The case was later thrown out by a judge. Mrs Lilly’s MP, Labour’s Karl Turner, said this latest case was ‘complete nonsense’. ‘This legislation was meant to target unlicensed fly-tippers who cause a lot of damage – not people like Mrs Lilly,’ he said. ‘There has been a lot of public money wasted on this investigation already. Common sense should prevail but clearly it isn’t.’ 'Completely bonkers': Karl Turner, Mrs Lilly's local MP, who has vowed to help her with her legal battle against the local council . Mr Turner, a barrister, added: ‘I have arranged for a solicitor to be present at her interview and, if it comes to court, I will be defending her myself. ‘I reckon it will cost the council £12,000 to prosecute this case and the most she could possibly get is an absolute discharge, so it’s completely bonkers.’ A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said it was ‘astounded’ at the treatment of Mrs Lilly, adding: 'Mrs Lilly was trying to do the right . thing by giving the clothes to charity rather than throwing them away, . so the council’s reaction was completely over the top. ‘Civic leaders in Hull should concentrate on providing the services for which residents pay considerable amounts in council tax, rather than spending scarce . resources pursuing someone like Mrs Lilly.' Mark Charlton, of the council, said it would pursue the case. ‘The council has received a complaint and an investigation is ongoing. Until it is complete we are unable to comment,’ he said. Mrs Lilly added that her ordeal had not deterred her from recycling – but from now on she would only be doing it at home.","Greba Lilly had been clearing out her father's home before he went into care .

The man arrested for attempting to weapons into a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Ohio was not planning an attack but simply wanted to protect himself. Scott A. Smith was taken into police custody after he allegedly  tried to bring a satchel containing a loaded gun, ammunition clips . and four knives into a 10pm Saturday showing of the Batman movie in Cleveland. But the 37-year-old's legal representative said he was not planning a copycat action but was in fact fearing for his safety after the Aurora shootings and had brought the weapons for protection. Copycat: Scott Smith, 37, from Ohio, was arrested on Saturday night for trying to smuggle weapons into a screening of The Dark Knight Rises . Scene: The manager of Regal Cinema in the Crocker Park shopping center, became suspicious of Smith who allegedly tried to bring a satchel into the theater . Police were called to Regal Cinemas after an off-duty police officer working security found a loaded 9mm Glock and the ammunition and knives in Mr Smith's bag. Mr Smith was arrested and authorities believe they prevented a copycat attack of the Dark Knight Rises massacre. Police later performed a search of the 37-year-old's home, where they found about eight rifles and handguns along with gas masks and bulletproof vests. Mr Smith raised suspicion after arriving at the late-night screening 30 minutes early and taking a seat at the top of the theatre with his back against a wall. Local police said this gave him a 'tactical advantage' and questioned why Mr Smith brought weapons to a movie theatre and in particular a viewing of The Dark Knight, considering the events in Aurora, Colorado. Smith's attorney, Matthew Bruce, explained to Cleveland.com that his client was just protecting himself. 'This was simply an instance where a man felt fear going into a movie theater in light of recent shootings and incidents around the country, and he wanted protection for himself.' Westlake Police Lt. Ray Arcuri with the Westlake Police said Mr Smith cooperated fully once suspicions were raised. 'It was a consensual . encounter.' Police believe they have foiled another Aurora style massacre after apprehending a man trying to smuggle guns and knives into an Ohio move theater . Copycat: James Holmes is accused of killing 12 people in last month's shooting rampage in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater . The 37-year-old is refusing to talk to police and is being held without bail. It comes just a few weeks after James Holmes allegedly walked into a midnight showing of the Batman movie at a Colorado theater and shot dead 12 people and injured 58. Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, has been charged with 24 counts of murder and 116 counts of attempted murder and authorities have 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to seek the death penalty. The 24-year-old's first court appearance was televised and showed a bleary-eyed young man with dyed orange hair who refused to speak. It emerged earlier this week that the psychiatrist who counselled Holmes at the University of Colorado had warned university officials about his behaviour. Dr Lynne Fenton told campus police and members of an University threat assessment team that she was concerned about Holmes' mental state but once Holmes left the institution they did not follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction. Police believe Smith, who has a wife . and young daughter, spent a short time in the military. He does not have . a permit to carry a concealed weapon and was arrested on suspicion of illegally carrying a concealed weapon and three other weapons charges.","Scott Smith, 37, arrested at a 10pm showing of Dark Knight Rises on Saturday .

A Welsh historian claims a greyhound owned by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess raced throughout the war at Merthyr Tydfil. Dewi Bowen says Nimrod the dog – a regular at Penydarren Park – was given to Hess after he took his crazy flight to the UK in 1941 in a bid to sue for peace with Churchill. Hess spent most of his time as a POW confined to Maindiff Court Military Hospital in Abergavenny. Adolf Hitler (LEFT) gives a Nazi salute, with deputy Rudolf Hess . Mr Bowen, 85, says Nimrod was given to him in a bid to keep his mind off of committing suicide. 'Almost every Saturday afternoon during the Second World War a private soldier with a greyhound traveled down from Abergavenny to Merthyr Tydfil by train and dropped off at Cefn Coed to quench his thirst at the Railway Inn.

Sickening journal entries revealing Steven Powell's obsession with his missing daughter-in-law Susan have been released, providing a disturbing glimpse into his spiraling love and sexual fantasies for her. The Pierce County Sheriff's Office released almost 3,000 pages of evidence in the case against Steven Powell - who was sentenced to 30 months in prison in June on voyeurism charges for filming two of his neighbor's daughters. Utah mom Susan Cox Powell has been missing since December 2009. Her husband Josh killed himself and their two sons earlier this year after taking a hatchet to their sons, aged five and seven, and setting their Washington state home alight. Both Josh and Steven were suspects in Susan's disappearance. Her body has never been found. Jailed: Disturbing journal entries of Steve Powell, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison, have been released . Victim: Evidence relating to Powell's missing daughter-in-law Susan was not allowed to be used in the trial . Sick: The Pierce County Sheriff's Office released about 3,000 pages of evidence in the case against Steven Powell, including entries from his journals that detail his uncontrollable love for his daughter-in-law Susan Cox Powell . In passages from 17 spiral notebooks . written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about . and urges towards Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes . they would be together. 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am . right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem . of her being married to my son.' 'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.' 'My biggest problem as well as my . greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been . madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan.' 'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.' 'I am now going crazy with desire for her but I do not regret any of it.' 'I would be devastated were I to find out Susan was dead from any cause. I am still so in love with her I can barely function.' He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am . right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem . of her being married to my son. 'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.' He also wrote: 'My biggest problem as well as my greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan. 'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.' He admitted in the passages that he . secretly recorded his daughter-in-law from as early as January 2003 and . would watch videos of her while masturbating. He admitted 'looking at her naked body . under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a . 'sick' thing to do. His obsession with her, he said, . 'represents the first time I’ve mentioned fetishes and what might be . considered sociopathic. I mean, who looks under the bathroom door with a . mirror?' The journal included countless photos . of Susan and different parts of her body. He also revealed he stole some . of her belongings including her underwear, her hair and even discarded wax . strips. On May 11, 2010, police obtained a warrant to search a locked cabinet belonging to Powell. In it they found, as well as the photos he took of her, completely nude females bodies with the original heads replaced with Susan's. He wrote more than 50 songs about her and secretly scanned her childhood diaries so he could read them at night. But there is no hint in the passages . that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he . made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is . what Josh Powell told police. Hearing: Powell at today's sentencing, where he got a sentence much more lenient than prosecutors wanted . Stalker: Multiple photographs of Susan that appeared to be secretly taken were stuck to the book, like this one of her 'applying makeup' Obsession: Steve Powell wrote 50 songs about his daughter-in-law as well as collecting her hair, leg wax strips and underwear . He also revealed he lost 20 pounds . when she disappeared. Powell took two days off work also and wrote in . his journal that she was his reason for living. He wrote at this time: 'I would be devastated were I to find out Susan was dead from any cause. I am still so in love with her I can barely function.' Powell eventually told his . daughter-in-law how he felt about her, but she responded by refusing to . speak to him for five months and asking Josh to break contact with his . father. After this he wrote in his journal: 'I am now going crazy with desire for her but I do not regret any of it.' According to the Salt Lake Tribune, he sold the house he raised his children in to buy a bigger one  in case she one day agreed to marry him. There is also a lack of journal entries between October 2009 and April 2010 and then again between October 2010 and January 2011. The final entry that was released appears to be from January 15, 2011, when Powell talked about a dream he had playing a piano to co-workers on a bus. Steve Powell was convicted in May of . 14 counts of voyeurism for filming two of his neighbor's daughters, then . aged nine and eight, during 2006 and 2007. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. It was also revealed that authorities . investigating the Utah mother's disappearance almost immediately began . classifying the case as a murder and kidnapping probe as they focused . largely on the woman's husband. According to heavily redacted court . documents released on Tuesday, as early as two days after Susan Powell . was reported missing, authorities in their hometown of West Valley City, . Utah, were describing the case as a murder, kidnapping, unlawful . detention and obstruction of justice probe. Publicly, they would only say the case . remained active while sharing little else, and they never specifically . labeled Josh Powell a suspect. That was despite the fact that . authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in . which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her. Family: Powell's son Josh killed himself and his two children Charlie and Braden in February this year . Tragedy: . Powell blew up his Washington home, pictured, killing himself and the . two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit . Utah authorities maintain the . investigation remains active and open, but said the documents reveal . their painstaking efforts to close the case and find Susan. The records help 'make the public . aware, to some extent, of what's been going on', West Valley City police . Sgt Mike Powell said on Tuesday. 'We've been working diligently and . very hard on this investigation.' Josh Powell had always maintained his innocence in his wife's disappearance and said he had taken the couple’s boys, then two and four, on a midnight camping trip in freezing temperatures the night she disappeared. When questioned about his impromptu late-night camping trip, Powell told authorities he was testing out a new generator, according to the documents. Charles Cox, Susan’s father, has said one of the Powell’s sons told social workers his mother came along on the midnight camping trip but was 'in the trunk'. One of the children told investigators that his mother had gone on the camping trip 'but decided to stay and not come home', according to the records released on Tuesday. Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan . Powell's parents, said that's not good enough. She has been fighting for . the release of the entire case file under a Utah law that provides . victims the same rights and access to investigative records as criminal . defendants. 'We'll keep making attempts to get the . full measure of the records,' Ms Bremner said on Tuesday. 'Until I'm . satisfied that I have everything, my clients have instructed me to keep . going forward.' While accusations continue to fly that . authorities could have done more to protect the Powell's two sons, . Susan Powell's parents have insisted all along that police had enough . circumstantial evidence to charge Josh Powell. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said police were still trying to 'put together the strongest case they could'. 'They didn't have a body. They didn't . know the manner in which she died,' Mr Gill said on Tuesday. 'This was a . complex matter and it continues to be.'","Almost 3,000 pages of entries detailing his spiraling love for Susan Powell .

"By . James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 18:52 EST, 16 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:52 EST, 16 August 2012 . Ministers were last night accused of plotting to introduce secret inquests by the back door. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke promised the idea had been abandoned after critics including the Daily Mail and civil liberties groups campaigned fiercely against it. But MPs and peers now say a clause has been quietly slipped into the Justice and Security Bill, which is going through Parliament, allowing ministers to revive it. Backtracking? Justice Secretary Ken Clarke had promised that the idea of secret inquests had been abandoned . Alarmingly, an influential Lords committee says the decision could be taken on the orders of a Cabinet minister without the need for Parliamentary legislation. Critics say the move would mean inquests into police shootings and soldiers killed by so-called ‘friendly fire’ could take place behind closed doors. Clare Algar, executive director of the campaign group Reprieve, said: ‘Ministers claim secret courts will only be used for a tiny number of cases but what this development shows is that once this dangerous legislation is on the books there is a real risk it will be used by future governments to cover up embarrassing facts which they would rather the public did not hear. ‘Secret courts are not just a threat to centuries of British legal freedoms, but also to the central principle of our democracy: That politicians must be accountable to the people that they serve.’ Last night it emerged that ministers want to ban the public from knowing that a secret evidence session is even taking place in civil cases, such as a torture compensation hearings. The Press would not be told that an application to hold parts of the hearing behind closed doors had been lodged by the Government, preventing journalists challenging the request or even reporting it. Campaigners likened the proposal to the ‘super injunctions’ obtained by adulterous celebrities. The controversy centres on the Government’s plan to introduce secret courts in civil cases involving national security. It claims they are needed to deal with compensation claims brought by terror suspects who allege they have been tortured with the complicity of our security services. Similar cases have already led to payments of millions of pounds to former Guantanamo Bay detainees and other alleged fanatics. Ministers say that if a case involves sensitive intelligence that could identify an agent’s identity, or was provided by an ally who wants it to remain secret, the Government should be able to present evidence in secret. However, in a hugely contentious move, ministers originally also proposed going even further by allowing inquests to be held behind closed doors. This provoked a ferocious backlash, led by the Mail, civil liberty campaigners and the Royal British Legion, which was appalled by the idea of military equipment shortages or friendly-fire deaths being hushed up. In May, however, Mr Clarke conceded defeat over inquests. Writing in the Mail, he said: ‘It’s hardly a secret that I hail from the liberal wing of the Conservative Party. ‘If protecting our democratic society means riding roughshod over historic freedoms – freedom of speech, a free Press, an independent judiciary and open justice – then truly we have forgotten what we are fighting for.’ But analysis of the remaining elements of the Justice and Security Bill reveal a clause that critics say could allow the idea to be revived. Clause 11(2) says the ‘Secretary of State may by order... add or remove a court or tribunal’ to the list of civil hearings that can be held in secret. Having scrutinised the Bill, the Lords Constitution Committee said this could be used to add inquests. The Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee agreed, warning that the clause meant no legislation would be needed for a future Secretary of State to introduce them. It said: ‘The powers are undoubtedly wide. They would, for instance, enable the Secretary of State to specify any court or tribunal, although not in so far as it exercises a criminal jurisdiction; and they might, in our view, be exercised so as to specify a coroner’s court.’ Ministers deny this is the case. They also insist there are no plans to break their pledge on inquests. But campaigners want no room for doubt that could be exploited by a future government. Baroness Williams of Crosby said: ‘I can think of nothing that would do more to undermine public confidence in the judicial system than an attempt to try to include coroners’ courts. ‘There has been a promise from the Lord Chancellor that this will not happen. But I cannot understand why the Bill still clearly indicates that there could be a power to include such a court. ‘The Bill says that in exact terms. The idea... would so outrage large sections of the public, especially on publicly very sensitive cases, that I can think of little that would do more to undermine confidence.’ Last night, Ministry of Justice officials insisted the legislation would not cover inquests and said any change to the law would require primary legislation, adding: ‘The Justice and Security Bill does not and could not in the future allow closed procedures to be used in inquests. ‘Nothing currently heard in open will go into closed session, but these reforms will enable the media to report judgments in cases which currently receive no media scrutiny.’","MPs and peers say clause has been quietly slipped into the Justice and Security Bill .

Anti-separation politicians at Westminster have been emboldened by a poll showing a post-Olympic bounce in favour of keeping the Union. The poll, unveiled yesterday by the Mail on Sunday, showed 60 per cent of Scottish voters now oppose independence. Just 27 per cent said they backed plans to separate from the rest of Britain – compared with 52 per cent in 2006 – while 13 per cent were undecided. The Scottish National Party has demanded that 16 and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote in the referendum.  It hopes to cash in on stronger support for separation among younger Scots.

Unionists fear the SNP could achieve ‘separation through the back door’ by asking multiple questions on independence or further devolution, rather than offering a simple ‘in or out’ choice. Mr Salmond is known to favour a ‘devo max’ fall-back, which would give Scotland more tax-raising powers and autonomy without full independence.

Controversial: Cannibal killer Graham Fisher, 39, has had a gastric band operation on the NHS in a private £1,000-a-night hospital after ballooning to 23-stone . A cannibal who weighs 23 stone has received gastric band surgery in a private  hospital – paid for by the NHS. Graham Fisher, 39, who killed two women, requested the operation after becoming obese on a diet of crisps and cake. The procedure – from which he is said to be recovering in a private room – is thought to have cost taxpayers £15,000. Fisher, who ate the flesh of one of the women he killed, put on weight at the high-security Broadmoor Hospital. After complaining to staff that he was too fat and unfit, he was given permission to have the £8,000 operation. He was reportedly taken by guards to a private hospital in Oxfordshire last week after being on a waiting list for just three months. It is expected he will recover from the surgery in a private en-suite room for several days, bringing the cost of the entire procedure to £15,000. Fisher’s first victim was Clare Letchford, 40, in January 1998. He killed the recluse at her flat in Hastings, East Sussex, before cutting flesh from her arm and eating it. Eight days later, Beryl O’Connor, 75, was found dead at her home nearby. Both of the victims – who had been former neighbours of Fisher – were strangled before Fisher set the bodies on fire.Just days later Fisher attempted to rape and murder a 19-year-old Czech student on a train. It was not until 2010 that he was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court to 21 years for the manslaughter of Miss Letchford and Miss O’Connor. Fisher had confessed to his psychiatrist after being  transferred to Broadmoor during a five-year jail term for indecently assaulting two Spanish students at knifepoint in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in May 1998. He was transferred to Broadmoor under the Mental Health Act following concerns that he was a ‘grave danger’. Lewes Crown Court heard he confessed because he knew he remained a danger. Prosecutors said Fisher targeted lonely women, some of whom he knew, to satisfy what one psychiatrist described as a ‘sexually sadistic’ aspect to his personality. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the extraordinary case would ‘go down poorly with ordinary people’ who are struggling financially. A spokesman for West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which is in charge of Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire, said: ‘People receiving treatment for mental illness are entitled to the same level of care as anyone else.’ Eight thousand surgical weight-loss operations were carried out in England on the NHS last year, most of them using a gastric band – in which a silicone band is fitted around the stomach to make it smaller. The other major operation is a gastric bypass, where a small pouch is created at the top of the stomach and connected to the small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel.The aim is to reduce appetite and speed up feelings of fullness.

He is the only moors victim whose body has not been discovered . The family of moors murders victim . Keith Bennett have criticised police for not renewing the search for the . body of the 12-year-old whose mother died on Saturday without . fulfilling her dream of laying him to rest properly. They said they were fed up with ‘pointless platitudes’, amid claims that it was only because of a forthcoming TV documentary that officers . carried out high-profile raids to trace a letter in which killer Ian . Brady may have finally revealed the burial site. Keith’s brother Alan Bennett spoke following the death of their mother, Winnie Johnson, at 78. The mother, who was taunted until the very end by Brady, has asked that her grave have a plot left empty beside it for her murdered son's burial, if he is ever found, the Mirror reported. Her family have vowed to continue her fight, after she spent her whole life trying to find Keith's remains, despite Brady refusing to tell her their location. Meanwhile 74-year-old Brady’s health was reported to be fading amid claims that after 13 years on hunger strike, injuries he sustained after a seizure last month meant he is now too ill to be force-fed. Mrs Johnson died after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the possible existence of Brady’s letter. Last week Martin Bottomley, head of Greater Manchester Police’s cold case unit, said his officers would act on any credible new information about its whereabouts. However following Mrs Johnson’s death, Alan Bennett, 56, accused officers of not taking reports of the letter seriously until spurred on by media attention. He also claimed detectives – who have classified the search for his brother’s body as dormant after repeated efforts came to nothing – had ignored leads from two ‘credible’ witnesses in recent months. 'In an open letter he complained that ‘all we receive is pointless platitudes and false statements that all new information will be treated seriously’. Winnie Johnson, pictured in 2010, lost her battle with cancer on Saturday without knowing where her son's body is . Ian Brady, left, and Myra Hindley, right, who died in 2002, have never revealed where Keith Bennett's body is . And he warned: ‘As far as I am concerned, until Keith is found then he is still in the possession of Brady and Hindley. ‘Our fear as a family is that now my . mother is no longer with us, this may be seen by the police and the . media as some sort of closure to the case. This must not be allowed to . happen both out of respect for Keith and my mother’s memory and for . those of us who loved them both.’ Keith’s half-brother Kenny Johnson, 46, added yesterday: ‘Greater Manchester Police only act when they’re prompted. They’ve not been very helpful for years. It does all come down to money – it wasn’t high on their list of priorities. But it’s what people want, they want to find him.’ It is claimed that after being force-fed for 13 years, Brady, who is in a high-security hospital, has been receiving only water since fracturing two vertebrae in a fall five weeks ago as he can no longer sit up to be given nourishment through tubes into his nose. Keith Bennett was on his way to visit his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester, when he was snatched by Brady and Myra Hindley on June 16, 1964. Until her health failed her, Mrs Johnson made frequent trips to Saddleworth Moor where Brady and Hindley – who died in 2002 – buried four out of their five child victims. Greater Manchester Police declined to comment yesterday on criticism of their handling of the search for Keith’s body or of their hunt for Brady’s purported letter. Officers called me scum . Alan Bennett has cut a lonely figure during the 20 years he has dug in the peat on the bleak and windswept Saddleworth Moor. His tireless search has so far been in vain. And like his mother Winnie . Johnson before him, it is a quest he will pursue doggedly until his dying day. For Winnie’s death at the weekend does  not bring her family’s suffering to a  close. Alan, 56, is the forgotten victim of the Moors Murders. His elder brother Keith was snatched by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley as he walked the short distance to their grandmother’s home in 1964. The 12-year-old’s body has never been found. And the death of their mother has made Alan more determined to find where Brady concealed Keith’s body. It is a search that has taken its toll on Alan’s life in many ways: ‘It’s always on my mind – I can’t get rid of it,’ he said. During his search, he even agreed to meet Hindley in the hope that she might give him a clue. What drives him is more than brotherly love. He is also determined to ensure that Brady is not allowed the final insult of taking his secret to the grave. Alan Bennett, pictured right, with sergeant Mick Swindells during a search in 2001 for his brother's body on Saddleworth Moor . Alan was just eight when Keith went  missing. On his website (searchingforkeith.com) he explains how they used to share a room in the end of terrace house in Eston Street, in the Longsight area of Manchester.  He recalls how they bent the street light which was positioned near their bedroom window so it almost came into their room. ‘We had the biggest bedside light in  Longsight. The room was flooded with an orange glow every night,’ he says. ‘Keith thought it was hilarious when we were told to be quiet and turn the light out.’ To this day, Alan treasures his brother’s 1962 school report card which noted how Keith struggled with reading, despite his brother’s attempts to help him. In return, Keith tried to teach Alan how to swim. Alan adds: ‘Keith had little time for anything but laughter and nature. He was an ordinary, uncomplicated child.’ He recalls how Keith disappeared on June 16, 1964, four days after celebrating his  birthday. ‘He just vanished from our lives.’ Within days, the now well-known photo of his brother with a wide grin and NHS  spectacles appeared on a ‘missing’ poster in shops, on billboards and in newspapers.  Suddenly, for Alan and his other five siblings, Keith’s disappearance marked the end of the innocence of youth. ‘He was there one day and gone the next. I used to lie in bed at night talking to him, saying: “Where are you Keith?” At first we used to imagine he’d been kidnapped, then gradually you realise he’s not coming back alive.’ Alan was plagued by the ‘what ifs’ about that fateful day. Even when Brady and Hindley were convicted in 1966 for the murders of John Kilbride, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, the pair refused to put the Bennett family out of their misery by admitting they had murdered Keith, too. In 1985, Brady finally confirmed that he had murdered Keith and Pauline Reade, 16.  The confession, which came out of the blue, led Alan to begin digging on the moors. He says: ‘It will never bring him back to life, but finding Keith and giving him a proper burial would be a way of bringing it to an end. ‘We went up every weekend and dug it until we hit rock. We went down until we couldn’t go any further.’ He was often accompanied by well-wishers who had been moved by the family’s plight. For their part, Greater Manchester Police called in archaeologists, anthropologists, geologists, geophysicists and geochemists – before giving up. Keith’s body is the only one of the Brady’s victims not to have been found. Alan’s meeting with Hindley came after he wrote to her and she invited him to meet her in prison. An aerial view of Saddleworth Moor where moors murderer Myra Hindley claims is the last resting of 12-year-old Keith Bennett . He was shocked when she grabbed his arms and sobbed as she repeatedly said sorry for her ruthless crimes. But although she did provide some maps before her death in 2002, it was not enough to pinpoint Keith’s body. Alan’s decision to meet the Moors Murderess horrified his mother. Anne West, the mother of Lesley Ann Downey, also condemned him as a ‘treacherous fool’. But he felt justified because Hindley was the only person likely to reveal where his brother was buried. Later, his mother said she understood what he had done. The search, though, at what he calls ‘that lonely place’, has had an adverse effect on his family life. ‘I regret the effect it had on my relationship with my son Robert, whom I hardly ever saw,’ he says. Last night, someone had placed flowers on the moors near to where Alan has spent years digging. An accompanying card reads: ‘Both together at last’ – a reference to how  Keith and his mother are  reunited in heaven. It is a sentiment Alan cannot share. ‘Until Keith is found he is still in the possession of Brady and Hindley,’ he says.  ‘Our fear as a family is now my mother is no longer with us, this may be seen as closure. ‘This must not be allowed to happen out of respect for Keith and my mother’s memory. He was a son, a brother, a friend and should have been a father and grandfather. He should have been whatever he wanted to be.’","Winnie Johnson asks for a plot left to her grave be left empty for her murdered son's burial .

Prime suspect: Terri Horman, left, the stepmother of Kyron Horman, right, was named the 'prime suspect' by a judge in a civil case . Last seen: Kyron, pictured at a science fair on the morning of June 4, 2010, aged 7, was last seen by his stepmother walking off to class; this is the last known picture of him . Proceedings: His biological mother, Desiree Young, is pictured in court on August 15 with her attorney, Elden Rosenthal; Young filed a $10m civil suit against the stepmother . Little Kyron, a bespectacled blonde boy with a toothy smile, disappeared on June 4, 2010, aged 7, after attending a science fair at his school in Portland and has not been seen since. In his ruling, Judge Kantor wrote: ‘Witnesses and evidence may disappear. Memories may fade. The opportunity to find Kyron alive or dead, lessens.’ Ms Young accused Horman of knowing what happened to Kyron. She told the East Idaho News in June: ‘I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.’ The suit Ms Young filed asks the judge to order Horman to return Kyron or, if he is dead, reveal where his remains are located. According to NWCN.com, Horman was the last to see Kyron alive. Ms Young’s civil suit accuses her of kidnapping him from Skyline Elementary. Following Judge Kantor’s decision, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a statement that stated the civil case was separate from the continuing criminal investigation against Horman. No stone unturned: Authorities have searched more than 28,000 hours for Kyron since his 2010 disappearance; here, recovery workers take to the water . Three if by sea: Three rescue workers from the Tualtin Valley Water Rescue Unit posed for a picture ahead of a rescue mission . A mother's grief: Young is seen speaking with reporters after filing the lawsuit against Kyron's stepmother on June 1 of this year . The statement read: 'While there may be rulings regarding the court's opinions as to how the case may proceed, these rulings/legal opinions are part of the civil court case. The civil case is a process that is independent of the active, on-going criminal investigation being conducted by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges. When the lawsuit was filed June 1, Young's attorney, Elden Rosenthal, said it would be on a 'parallel track' with the criminal investigation. He would not say what kind of reaction the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office gave when he informed them of Young's decision to sue. Horman believes the suit is working to advance the aims of local law enforcement. She points out that the judge hearing her divorce from Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, delayed that case while the criminal investigation plays out. 'Plainly and simply, Young's lawsuit is a quest for information to move the criminal investigation forward and to taint any jury pool,' according to the filing. Civil allegations require a lower standard of proof — a preponderance of evidence — than criminal charges, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Compelling her to testify, Bunch wrote, could force Terri Horman to invoke her constitutional right against self-incrimination, pointing out the weak spots in her case. Happier times: Young smiles and holds her son on the beach . Playtime: A family photo shows a smiling Kyron enjoying the playground . 'The burden on Horman of being required to participate in this lawsuit before the district attorney and police have completed their investigation squarely jeopardizes her constitutional rights,' Bunch wrote. 'We've racked our brains trying to think . of reasons why. We cannot come up with anything. It’s like a portal . opened up in the school and Kyron just vanished into it.' -Biological mother Desiree Young . According to local news reports at . the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair . at the school that Friday morning. Initial sheriff’s reports said that Horman saw Kyron walking off to his classroom, and judging that he was on his way, left. The teacher of Kyron’s class didn’t see him at the 10am start, and marked him absent. His parents were alarmed when Kyron didn’t get off the school bus that afternoon, and called the school. Skyline, in turn, called 911 to report the boy missing. According to East Idaho News, the police department has spent a collective 28,000 hours searching for him. Progression: A composite by Missing & Exploited imagines what Kyron could look like today, aged 9 . Horman’s former husband Kyron Horman first filed a restraining order against her and later divorced her. They have a young toddler together. Ms Young told Good Morning America in a 2010 interview that her son’s disappearance was ‘a parent’s worst nightmare.’ She said: ‘We’ve racked our brains trying to think of reasons why.

Threat: Despite the Palace and Prince Harry's lawyers saying that papers would breach PCC rules if they printed the naked photos, they are yet to complain about The Sun's front page . There was a deafening silence from the Palace today despite the infamous naked photos of Prince Harry partying in Las Vegas being published in the British press for the first time. So far more than 850 people have . officially complained about The Sun putting his nude body on its front . page this morning. But the Press Complaints Commission . has told MailOnline this afternoon that none of those protests came from the beleaguered prince, his lawyers, or the royal household. The third in line to the throne was . pictured in just a necklace with a naked girl hiding behind him having played a game of . strip billiards in his VIP Las Vegas suite. Another showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug. Until The Sun published them today, British . newspapers and websites were unique in the world at being unable to show naked photographs of Prince Harry, despite tens of millions . seeing them online across the globe. This was at the insistence of St James’s Palace, who said despite these circumstances they were a gross invasion of the . prince’s privacy and must not be used. Harry's lawyers, Harbottle & . Lewis, also sent warning letters to national newspapers via the Press . Complaints Commission stating that if they were printed they would then breach PCC guidelines. But despite that threat, the Palace has not complained and today repeated their statement of last night: 'We have made . our views on Prince Harry's privacy known. Newspapers regulate . themselves, so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a . decision for editors to make,' a spokesman said. A PCC spokesman confirmed to MailOnline that a full investigation could be launched after a third party complaint, but this was unlikely to happen in a privacy case like this one unless Harry made a protest. Letting his heir down: Prince Harry relaxed poolside surrounded by bikini-clad girls in Vegas before his naked antics came to light . Quiet: Despite warnings about printing the pictures, so far St James Palace, pictured, nor Harry's lawyers have complained to Britain's press watchdog . Rupert Murdoch's paper The Sun argued . the decision to print the images was is in the public interest and a 'crucial' test of Britain's free press, especially as an estimated 40 million . across the globe have already seen them online. Their front page carried the headline: 'Heir it is!' adding in its editorial: 'We believe Harry has compromised his own privacy, adding it was 'vital' that the paper ran them as 'the Prince Harry pictures are a crucial test of Britain's free Press.' Sun managing editor David Dinsmore . said the paper had 'thought long and hard' about whether to use the . pictures. Anger: Former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott said the decision was not about privacy, it was about 'money, money, money' He said: 'We are not against him letting his hair down once in a while. For us this is about the freedom of the press. 'This . is about our readers getting involved in discussion with the man who's . third in line to the throne, it's as simple as that.' The newspaper's decision to publish the images provoked mixed reaction among those both and in and outside the media industry. Former . deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said The Sun had shown 'absolute . utter contempt' for the law and for the Lord Justice Leveson inquiry . into media ethics. 'It . is not about privacy. It is about money, money, money. And they know . that by exclusively printing the pictures, assuming they are the only . (British) paper which does, they will get everybody buying the paper to . see this.' Meanwhile, Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie welcomed the move. 'If . Prince Harry with no clothes on in a Las Vegas hotel room surrounded by . one naked woman and a load of other people he has just met in . drinking-stripping game is not a story then it is hard to know what is,' he told BBC2's Newsnight. 'He . must realise that with his rather important role as a prince of our . country and is number three (in line) to the throne that he has to carry . various responsibilities. 'People . should stop worrying about privacy and start worrying about what free . speech will mean to this country if the Levesons and the Camerons of . this country have their way.' Until . now, the public has been able to read about the prince's antics but to . see the images has had to access the US-based celebrity gossip website . TMZ that broke the story, or scores of other internet pages across the . globe.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:39 EST, 23 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:01 EST, 25 August 2012 . A heartbroken father whose daughter was diagnosed with schizophrenia after trying to jump out of a second-story window at age six has described his despair in a new book. In his memoirs 'January First,' Michael Schofield chronicles his family's experience with the devastating mental illness, which usually presents itself at least a decade later - between the ages of 18 and 22. The Santa Clarita, California, man and his wife, Susan, were forced to hospitalise their daughter, January, on multiple occasions, fearing for their and their baby son Bohdi's lives. Heartbreak: Michael Schofield, right, has chronicled his family's experience in a book titled 'January First' The girl, who is now 10, was formally diagnosed after she tried to choke herself and jump out of her second-story bedroom window. Schofield knew something was wrong when Jani, as they call her, was just a baby, as she rarely slept and the parents had to visually stimulate her at all times to stop her screaming. But Jani's behaviour became increasingly disturbing as she grew older, with her even trying to harm herself and her newborn brother. 'One minute she'd be sweet and loving and then it was like a switch was flipped, and she was trying to attack Bohdi, or Susan, or me,' Schofield told Fox News. Family: Michael Schofield, right, and wife, Susan, left, were forced to hospitalise January, centre, on multiple occasions, fearing for their and their baby son Bohdi's lives . Sick: January, pictured, was formally diagnosed after she tried to choke herself and jump out of her second-story bedroom window . 'And then, as fast as it came, it would . turn off again. She would act like nothing happened – there was no . pouting, and there were times she was fine with Bodhi.' Jani, who was also incredibly bright, with an IQ of 146, wouldn't interact with kids her own age. She instead lived between reality and an imaginary island she called Calalini, where her 'friends' included animals and people she named after numbers. Book: The memoirs, pictured, describes January's decent into madness and her father's struggle to save her . The family visited scores of doctors who failed to diagose her, instead throwing around conditions such as autism or bipolar. She was prescribed several medications but nothing calmed her. It wasn't until she was in UCLA that Dr Mark DeAntonio, clinical professor and director of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric services at Resnick Neurospsychiatric Hospital, gave Jani's illness a name. 'She was not unique, but for a child that age to have such floored psychotic symptoms with visual and auditory hallucinations – you don’t normally see that in a six-year-old,' he told Fox. 'We do have children that age in the hospital, but not for those reasons.' Schofield said he had a mixed reaction to finally hearing his daughter's diagnosis. 'There was a brief second of happiness – finally we have a name to it – and then the reality of what it meant hit me,' he said. 'Her life expectancy is shorter, and I might outlive her – and I couldn’t deal with that.' Now 10 years old, Jani is on a cocktail of clozapine, Thorazine and lithium, and attends almost daily therapy sessions to keep her symptoms at bay, although her hallucinations and the voices she hears will never completely disappear. 'We’ve helped educate her as to when her experiences are psychotic symptoms, how she can get her needs met, and getting her to work better with her peers,' Schofield told Fox. Dangerous: Jani's behaviour became increasingly disturbing as she grew older, with her even trying to harm her newborn brother, Bohdi, right . Close: January's parents took her to scores of doctors before the disturbed young girl was correctly diagnosed as schizophrenic . 'I don’t remember who I was before all . of this, and there’s no going back. But, there are a lot of kids out . there like Jani and no support system.' According to the National Institute of Mental Health, schizophrenia affects about 1 per cent of Americans and is thought to be hereditary. It’s a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder that causes people to hear voices and have hallucinations, believe other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them. But the illness is usually diagnosed in the late teens or early 20s. 'It’s unusual to see it present itself below 12 years of age,' DeAntonio said. Childhood schizophrenia, also known as childhood-onset schizophrenia or early-onset schizophrenia is basically the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it sets in earlier in life. The condition is rare in children and difficult to recognise during its early phases. Early-onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged between 13 and 18 years, although very early-onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged 12 years or less, as in January's case. The psychiatric illness can have a massive impact on the child's ability to function properly. A child with schizophrenia may have hallucinations, delusions, irrational thinking, bizarre behavior and difficulties performing everyday tasks, such as washing. He or she may have gradual changes in behavior, for example a child who once enjoyed relationships with others may begin to become withdrawn and shy, and appear to be in a world of their own. The child may start talking about unusual ideas and fears. They may become clingy with their parents and say things that do not make any sense. Experts are not sure what the causes of schizophrenia are. Recent studies suggest a combination of factors, including brain changes, as well as biochemical, environmental and genetic factors may play a part. Schizophrenia cannot be cured with modern medicine and therapies. However, it can be controlled.","January Schofield's behaviour was disturbing even as a baby .

Cover: The Dutton publishing company announced today that No Easy Day will be published on September 11 . A first-hand account of the Navy SEAL mission that killed Osama bin Laden is coming out September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC. The book's publisher announced on today that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day' will 'set the record straight' on the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011 that led to the terrorist leader's death. 'Mark Owen' is a pseudonym for the combat veteran who was one of the first fighters to enter bin Laden's third floor hideout and also witnessed his death, according to Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group. The co-author, journalist Kevin Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan. Maurer spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer. One senior military official said the manuscript was not shared with special operations officials, to check for possible disclosure of classified information. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the vetting of classified information. The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported that the book also goes into detail about Owen's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL. The blog said that Owen's 'blow by blow' account of the raid will begin with the helicopter crash in bin Laden's backyard that almost killed him to the terror mastermind's death. Owen has since retired from active duty. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . And just because the author is remaining anonymous does not mean that he won't do a book tour, as The Times reports that Owen will make TV appearances while wearing a disguise. No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a Team Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates in 2009. Owen's book comes on the heels of . another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed . three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary . Clinton. Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down . Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . That explosive allegation is contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a myth. Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday. A film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19.

Wreckage: The burnt wreckage of a double-decker sleeper bus and a tanker loaded with highly-flammable methanol . Tragic scene: Police and rescuers remove the bodies from a burnt out double-decker sleeper bus . The tanker had just returned to the road after an early morning rest stop when it was apparently rear-ended by the bus at around 2.40am, close to the city of Yan'an in Shaanxi province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The bus had left Hohhot in Inner Mongolia last night and was headed south to Xi'an city, it said. Xinhua news photos showed the charred metal skeleton of the bus rammed up against the back of the tanker. Burnt shell: A policeman surveys the scene after China's worst crash in a year . The survivors have been hospitalised, but their condition has not been described. An official with the local Communist Party propaganda bureau in Yan'an confirmed that the crash occurred but was unable to give details and was unsure of the death toll. But Xinhua has reported a total of 36 bodies were pulled from the charred shell of the bus and three people were taken to hospital. Road safety is a serious problem in China. According to Xinhua, poorly maintained roads and bad driving habits result in about 70,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries a year. Horror crash:The full scale of the tragic accident can be seen. The burnt out shell of the bus sits directly behind the tanker . A traffic police official said the fact most the passengers were asleep at the time might account for the high number of deaths. It is thought they may have been unable to escape because there was just one door. The driver and passenger of the tanker were taken into police custody, according to the official China news website. Pictures from the scene show the front of the tanker is relatively unscathed. Meanwhile the bus has been almost completely destroyed by the blaze. The accident is the worst in China since a fire on an overcrowded sleeper bus carrying flammable materials killed 41 passengers in central China in July last year, according to the country's work safety watchdog.Police are now investigating the cause of the accident, which happened on the Baotou-Maoming Expressway, spanning the length of China from the northern city of Baotou to the southern province of Guangdong.

A retired New York City police officer living in Bennett, Colorado, came home earlier this week to a scene of carnage, discovering five of her rare pet parrots brutally murdered and dismembered. Cherie Morales, 55, said someone broke into her 12-by-16-foot backyard aviary and slaughtered most of its feathered inhabitants, among them Greater Vasa parrots. ‘When I saw that gate open, I immediately thought, “Oh no,”’ Morales told ABC7. ‘Then, I started seeing bodies and bodies without heads.’ Slain: Murphy the Greater Vasa parrot was among the five birds found brutally killed inside Cherie Morales' backyard aviary . Break-in: Morales said someone opened the gate of her enclosure while she was out and deliberately killed only her rare Greater Vasa parrots . Carnage: A neighbor described a horrific scene similar to a battlefield with the birds' tiny bodies strewn about the yard . Three of the birds were killed by decapitation, while the other two had their necks broken. ‘The three birds who were the sweetest of all of them had their heads ripped off from the neck,’ she said. ‘Their wings were pulled off. These birds had been brutalized past that.’ Neighbor David Lewis, who helped Morales pick up the birds’ tiny corpses, said one on the first things he saw in the yard was the head of one of the parrots on the ground and feathers everywhere. ‘It was really gruesome…like the aftermath of a war scene,’ he said. Survivor: Of the seven Greater Vasas, only two birds survived by fleeing the aviary, and one of them later returned . Beloved pet: Morales is looking for the other surviving Greater Vasa parrot named Matisse who she believes is still in the area . ‘It looked like a battle had happened . and then the bad people left and left all this aftermath of dead little . bodies,’ Lewis told ABC7. Heartbroken: Morales, a former New York City cop, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest . Two African gray parrots who were also . in the aviary were left unharmed, leading Morales to believe that . whoever did this targeted the Greater Vasas because everyone knew they . were her favorites, according to ABC News. Of the seven rare birds that were in the enclosure, two managed to escape, but one of them later returned. Now, Morales is searching for the other surviving Greater Vasa parrot that goes by the name Matisse. Morales said she has heard his bird call and believes he is still in the area. ‘These birds are so easy, so trusting,’ the 55-year-old said. ‘I have always prided my house on being a sanctuary for whatever person or critter need to come in.’ Morales posted a $1,000 reward on Craigslist for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the killings. The Adams County Sheriff's Department said it is investigating the case.","Cherie Morales, 55, found five of her seven rare Greater Vasa parrots brutally killed .

A woman lost her $4.7million deposit because she refused to buy an $18.8million luxury New York City apartment when she found out it was 'unfinished and had no heat, hot water, air conditioning or gas.' Roberta Campbell put down the cash on the suite in the Mark Hotel on the city's Upper East Side in January 2008 as the company was renovating the building. A judge ruled on Monday that the conditions inside, while certainly not what Ms Campbell expected, did not prevent her from moving in on time, and thus didn't violate the property developer's side of the agreement. Lost: Roberta Campbell, pictured with her ex-husband William Campbell, lost her deposit because the contract she signed protected the property developer . 'Only in New York,' US District Judge William Pauley said, according to Courthouse News Service. The contract Ms Campbell signed promised a doorman, a concierge, elevator service, a package room, maintenance personnel, a fitness center, room service and dry cleaning. However, when she went to inspect her apartment April 15, 2009 -- just days before she was set to close on the apartment -- she discovered it still wasn't complete. Ms Campbell, the ex-wife of wealthy software tycoon William Campbell, brought along a home inspector, an architect and two attorneys to view the space. They found 'dangerously large gaps between the pavers on the terrace,' unfinished floors and non-functioning heat, hot water, air conditioning, and cooking gas, according to court documents. Judge Pauley ruled that the contract protected the developer because it said the company was not liable for 'the interruption, discontinuance or quality of any such services' in the apartment. Furthermore, the judge disagreed with the claims of Ms Campbell's inspectors and said the developer reserved the right to repair 'minor defects' after the closing. Pulled out: The Mark Hotel, pictured here, is the luxury building where Roberta Campbell put down a deposit for a condo but later backed out . 'The absence of heat, hot water, and . air conditioning on April 15 did not prevent Campbell's occupancy of the . suite because the relevant systems were completely and properly . constructed, heat and air conditioning in fact were available, and gas . service credibly could have been activated within Con Edison's next . eight hour shift,' the judge said in his order. Furthermore, the contract stipulated that construction on the building wouldn't be finished for one year after the closing. Despite . the ruling against her, it all seemed to work out for Ms Campbell in . the end. She currently owns an apartment at 15 Park Avenue, one of the . most enviable addresses in the city, the judge pointed out. Mark Hotel has had just two apartments sold in the last three years. Thirty more are being operated as hotel suites.","Roberta Campbell paid $4.7million in January 2008 to reserve a new apartment that was under construction .

Accused: Along with 15 members of his Amish sect, Samuel Mullet, Sr. will stand trial Monday on charges that include federal hate crimes, conspiracy and obstruction of justice . Sixteen members of a breakaway Amish sect that federal prosecutors have labeled a 'cult' will stand trial Monday for a laundry list of misdeeds officials say were hate crimes against their brethren. Samuel Mullet Sr. allegedly ordered beatings of wayward Amish, slept with married women to 'cleanse them,' and, last fall, instructed followers to shave off the beards and hair of his critics - a deeply offensive act within Amish culture. The 'Amish 16' - including four of Mullet's 17 children, his son-in-law and three of his nephews - are to stand trial in Cleveland on federal charges of perpetrating hate crimes, conspiracy, evidence tampering and obstruction of justice. The defendants maintain the government is on a witch-hunt - and shouldn't intrude on internal church disciplinary matters. They've denied the charges and rejected plea deals that would carry sentences of two to three years in prison instead of what they now face - sentences of 20 years or more. Mullet has said he didn't order the hair-cutting but also added he didn't stop anyone from carrying it out. He also has defended what he thinks is his right to punish disobedient sect members. 'You have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody doesn't obey them, you punish them,' Mullet told the Associated Press last October. Charged: Mullet Sr. allegedly ordered beatings of wayward Amish, slept with married women to 'cleanse them,' and, last fall, instructed followers to shave off the beards and hair of his critics - a deeply offensive act within Amish culture . 'But I'm not allowed to punish the church people? I (should) just let them run over me? If every family would just do as they pleased, what kind of church would we have?' 'You have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody doesn't obey them, you punish them. But I'm not allowed to punish the church people? I (should) just let . them run over me? If every family would just do as they pleased, what . kind of church would we have?' At stake is prosecutor's ability to vividly portray how an Amish sect struggles with the encroaching modernity assaulting its insular community. In the case of the Mullet sect, the alleged knee-jerk reaction, they claim, violently broke the law. 'When there are conflicts and you find yourself outside the accepted set, it's a very difficult place to be,' said Matthew Schrock, a one-time member of Holmes . County's Amish community during the 1990s. 'When someone believes something slightly different, (people believe) that's a threat to my existence.' Schrock added that religious disputes were commonplace in the often-time strictly-observant Amish culture - and often took an emotion toll on those not directly involved. To wit, it was just such a religious dispute that lead to the creation of the Amish, as a whole. Schisms: Deep differences within the Amish about how to cope with modernity have lead to dozens of splinter groups, one being the radical sect whose members (pictured) now stand trial . The group famously broke away from the Mennonites . in 1693 over the practice of shunning church members. Another group . known as the Beachy Amish formed in 1927 and soon began allowing the use . electricity and automobiles. Since then, multiple schisms within the church, which has no central authority, have created a range of Amish churches with varying rules and beliefs. David McConnell, a professor at Wooster College, said there are a dozen Amish groups living in Ohio's Holmes County, alone, home to one of the nation's largest Amish settlements. Mullet, Sr. relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the West Virginia panhandle after a dispute with his former group . 'It's a divorce within the . congregation,' said Karen Johnson-Weiner, a professor at the State . University of New York in Potsdam. 'It's very, very sad and heart-breaking.' The usual expectation is that the breakup is the end of the dispute, she said. 'Each side says you go off and do your own thing and that's the end of it,' said Johnson-Weiner. 'There's an understanding that you can't judge them. It's up to God to judge the choices they make.' In the case of a break-up, new bishops and ministers assume control. Sometimes the new group will move away but not usually. Those that are pulled apart can join together at weddings and funerals but not for worship services. Even families can be divided. Mullet relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the West Virginia panhandle after a dispute with his former group. They now  live on farms along a gravel road.The 66-year-old, who has fathered at least 17 children, has denied characterizations from authorities that his group is a cult. The hair-cuttings, he has said, were a response to continuous criticism he'd received from other Amish religious leaders about his being too strict, including excommunicating and shunning people within his own group. The Amish believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry. In one of the attacks, authorities say, one couple acknowledged that their two sons and another man came into their house, held them down, and cut the father's beard and the mother's hair. They refused to press charges.

A British schoolboy trapped abroad by a flying phobia is now marooned permanently in the desert by an acute terror of all travel. Joe Thompson, aged 11, had hoped to return home by land, sea and train, but is now too terrified of ANY transport. It means his father Tony must now find another job in the Gulf while his desperately worried mother Pauline, remains at home in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and visits him only in the holidays. Heartbreak: Tony Thompson with his son Joe who suffered an anxiety attack on the driveway of his home as he tried to leave his Gulf home . Parted: Joe and his mother Pauline who can only see her son when she comes out to Dubai on holiday . The latest setback came at the weekend after they tried leaving Al Ain in the UAE and taking a hire car to Jordan, in the hope of catching a ferry to Haifa, Israel. But the boy suffered massive panic attacks and hyper ventilated on the driveway of their home. The symptoms were worse than during his four failed attempts to board an aircraft for the seven-hour flight back to Heathrow, in recent weeks. One of Joe’s hands became paralysed and he was barely able to breath as he tried getting into the passenger seat for the 1,500 mile journey. Tony, a former aide to then Deputy PM John Prescott and a superintendent with British Transport Police, has now vowed to end his son’s torment by scrapping talk of getting home overland, while getting him urgent medical attention. Trapped in the desert: Joe has been stranded in the Gulf state after he developed an acute fear of flying . Joe has received his first round of treatment in Dubai for his anxiety which began five moths ago and his 63-year-old father hopes this will help get the terrified child back home. Desert boy Joe: The car giant Volkswagen had offered to chauffeur him back to Britain, but withdrew over an insurance problem . Joe’s flying phobia has already baffled doctors but they will be even more puzzled by his new terror of any form of transport. He has previously flown all over the world. 'All the disappointment and constant talk of getting him home has clearly upset him, and I don’t want him traumatised further,' said Tony. 'First the Saudis refused travel visas, which meant we couldn’t drive through the country and missed a cargo boat, then they changed their minds and granted the documents before Volkswagen offered to chauffeur drive us all the way home before pulling out at the last minute for security reasons. 'Joe’s in an emotional mess and needs help. Until then, we’ll have to remain here. And I’ll need to find work. It could now be weeks or months before we’re ready to try again to get him home.' His son's problems began after his father quit his job in Al Ain and needed to return to the UK. His mother Pauline, who is living at the family’s UK home faces the heartbreak of only seeing them on rare compassionate visits.. Car giant Volkswagen originally offered to chauffeur them back to Britain, but pulled out for insurance reasons, unable to guarantee their safety in strife ridden Egypt. Tony added: 'With all the discussions, dramas and changes of plans, Joe simply lost it, and won’t get in any form of transport.' Mum Pauline, 42, who has been married for 20 years, said: 'Joe’s a sensitive boy and we need to try and calm him down, and discover the root cause of his reluctance to return to England. 'Until then we will have to put our personal happiness on hold.' 'Joe has settled in the Gulf with all his friends. I won’t be able to see him or Tony until Christmas and while its going to be tough, I’ve got to put my son’s welfare first.” Thumbs up: Joe had hoped to travel with his father to Israel and then back to the UK, but he suffered a major panic attack .","Joe Thompson suffers panic attack as he tries to get home by car and ferry .

A British baby is battling a genetic condition so rare it is thought only 25 people in the world suffer from it. Ailsa Scobie, born in January, suffers from a disorder that makes her one in 280million. The syndrome has meant the girl, from Athelstaneford, East Lothian, has already spent half of her young life in the Royal Hospital For Sick Children in Edinburgh. Ailsa has an extra chromosome in her genetic structure, and is the only child in the UK to suffer from the condition. Fighter: Eight-month-old Aisla Scobie was born with a genetic condition - called Chromosome22q13.1 Duplication Syndrome - so rare that odds of having it are one in 280million. She is pictured with her mother Katrina, father Sam and sister Bethan . Doctors say her condition is so rare she is 'writing her own medical history'. She struggles to feed and needs help from a tube, and suffers from growth problems and heart defects. Her parents Katrina, 34, and Sam, 49, have a difficult time caring for her while also bringing up Ailsa's sister Bethan, 11. But friends and neighbours are rallying . round the family and are putting on a concert this weekend to raise . money for a charity which supports the family. Unique: Ailsa has an extra chromosome in her genetic structure, and is the only child in the UK to suffer from the condition . Mrs Scobie said: 'Two weeks after she was born we first found out there was a problem. Her heart wasn't strong enough to let her feed. 'She's been in hospital for three or four months, half of her life.' The mother-of-two said her first reaction on being told about the condition, which means Ailsa will probably have learning difficulties in the future, was 'disbelief'. She said: 'It's so incredibly rare, it's difficult not to know what we're facing. In the beginning we were completely on our own and no-one understood how we felt.' Children born with the condition - called Chromosome22q13.1 Duplication Syndrome - often suffer from learning difficulties and sometimes from heart defects. Ailsa's condition came to light after she was taken to hospital and doctors spotted two holes in her heart. The Scobies have been supported by chromosome disorder charity Unique, which puts families who have children with similar conditions in touch with each other. With no other sufferers in the UK they spoke to two families, one as far flung as Australia, who had been through the same ordeal. Mrs Scobie, who used to run a confectionery shop, said: 'Then we found out about this support group and they managed to put us in touch with a family who had a child with a condition that was very similar. 'To find out we weren't on our own was an amazing thing. Your friends are there for you but they can't understand how it feels. Other families with rare chromosome problems all rally together.' The family learned how the other families had coped with feeding tubes and the motor problems associated with the condition. One in 280million: Ailsa struggles to feed and needs help from a tube, and suffers from growth problems and heart defects . Mrs Scobie said: 'Just knowing there was someone else there reassured us. We thought ""this is something other kids have gone through"". 'So there's a wee bit of hope for the future. It's been tough to get through but it's made us a stronger family.' Despite her condition, Ailsa is a 'happy wee person', her mother said. Beverly Searle, CEO of Unique, said: 'It's difficult for medics because it's so rare you have nothing to go on. 'The child is writing their own medical history. Though it gives information for someone who might have the condition in the future.'* The fundraising concert for Unique takes place at 6pm on Saturday night in theSPACE, North Berwick.

Sean Kirk, 35, had to spring into action after his wife Learose, 30, realised baby Adele Cara was going to arrive before they reached the Bristol hospital. Mr Kirk, from Yate, was driving his wife the eight miles to the maternity ward at Southmead when Mrs Kirk told him they were going to run out of time - and he turned around to see the baby's head already visible. Dramatic story: Learose and Sean Kirk with baby Adele at a layby opposite a Royal Mail sorting house where Mr Kirk delivered their daughter . No time to plan: Mrs Kirk's fourth child Adele, pictured at two weeks old, was born within 20 minutes . He pulled into a layby next to the . Bristol Royal Mail sorting office and had to deliver his wife's baby on the spot. Bizarrely, the couple had watched BBC programme Midwives just minutes before they were caught up in their own delivery drama. Mr Kirk, an emergency services worker, said: 'We watched a programme about Midwifes on TV coming up to the labour and I was at the births of our three older children as well so I knew roughly what happened. 'It was just a stroke of luck that the baby was not breech or stuck, or she was not breathing or something. Desperate measures: The husband and wife had to stop beside the Royal Mail regional sorting office near Bristol because the baby was already crowning . 'With the other babies it took maybe 12 hours of labour but this happened within the space of 20 minutes and I was not expecting that at all. I thought I was in for the long haul. 'I had hoped that as we were only ten minutes away we would make it to the hospital but Learose said the baby was coming and I had a look and I could see the head. 'It was all quite surreal really.' Baby Adele arrived two days early, on August 9, weighing a very healthy 6lb and 12oz. Inspiration: The couple had just watched BBC TV drama Midwives . Mrs Kirk said: 'It was all rather shocking. Sean was driving rather fast because he was trying to get me to hospital in time when it suddenly dawned on me that I was going to have the baby where we were. 'We were nearly at the hospital when I told Sean, ""it’s coming, it’s coming"". 'We pulled up and by the time Sean had run to the other side of the car where I was sitting in the passenger seat, the baby’s head was coming out. 'There was no time to find the phone or anything. We had just watched Midwives on television and luckily nothing serious happened. It was just a really strange scenario.' Adele is the couple’s fourth child, after Aiden, five, Annabelle, three, and Aliyah, 19 months. The midwife team at the hospital leapt into action thinking Learose was about to give birth when the couple arrived. But, having realised they had missed the crucial moment, they allowed Mr Kirk to cut the umbilical cord. Mrs Kirk added: 'Sean had to point out to me where Adele was delivered when we were on the way home from the hospital because I had been in so much pain. 'He is so smitten by Adele and I think he does feel more of a special bond because he delivered her.

A father has spoken of his heartbreak after the last photos of his wife, who died from cancer the day after their wedding, were stolen by heartless thieves. Laura Pemberton, 29, died just 24 hours after walking down the aisle with her partner of nine years and father of her three children, 32-year-old Gareth Sumner. Ms Pemberton, from Merseyside, had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer just six weeks earlier. Heartbreaking tale: Gareth Sumner, with his and Laura Pemberton's children (from left) Isis, eight, Elliot, three, and Chloe, six. Right, Ms Pemberton with her son at her sister's wedding, shortly before her death . Two burglars broke into Mr Sumner’s home on Friday morning and stole computers containing pictures of the June 2010 nuptial, and a recording of Ms Pemberton singing to their three-year-old son Elliot. Mr Sumner awoke to hear sounds in his home, just north of Liverpool, and went downstairs to see two men in dark clothing running off with two laptops and four computer games consoles. The laptops contained precious pictures of Ms Pemberton and a Nintendo DSi which had a sound clip of her singing to then-baby son Elliot. Mr Sumner said: 'Elliot was only just one when his mum died so he never knew her properly. 'We’d kept this recording of her singing to him for when he was older so he could hear what she sounded like. 'It was his connection to his mum.' Final memories: The loving couple of nine years with their two daughters before the family were torn apart so early in the children's lives . The brave widower chased the two thieves down the street barefoot but lost them as they went into the woods. Son Elliot was in the house at the time of the burglary but daughters Isis, eight, and six-year-old Chloe were at a friend’s house. A witness told police that after the burglary they had seen a dark coloured large saloon, thought to have been a private hire taxi, stop at a junction where a passenger got out and collected a bag from behind a wall before getting back in. Bereaved Mr Sumner had been engaged to Ms Permberton for four years before they got married. Doctors urged the couple to fast-forward their plans because of her rapidly deteriorating health. The wedding day was arranged in just two weeks after her family made an appeal on local radio for help. Local dress shops, jewellers, florists, cakemakers and photographers offered their services for Ms Pemberton’s special day. Sorely missed: Mr Sumner dreads the thought that he will never again see the couple's precious photos of their wedding day, which was brought forward when doctors said Ms Pemberton had only six weeks to live . DC Andy Bason, from Merseyside Police Burglary team, said: 'I would like to hear from anyone who has any information about this burglary or who is offered any of this property for sale. 'I am particularly keen to talk to the taxi driver who was in the area at the time, or the passengers, and would urge them to come forward. 'This family has recently lost their wife and mother and the images contained on the computers cannot be replaced. 'This has completely devastated them and I would appeal directly to those responsible or people who know them to do the right thing. 'One of the games consoles taken, a white Nintendo DS owned by one of the children, also has recordings of her mother, which she listens to all the time. 'I would urge anyone who has any information that can help us to reunite her with this to contact the police.'","Callous thieves took computers containing precious photos and a games console with a recording of Laura Pemberton singing to her son .

Homeowners who were duped into buying expensive insurance cover for burst pipes, broken boilers and blocked drains could be entitled to a refund.

HomeServe boss Richard Harpin, who commutes to work by helicopter . It claims to offer peace of mind to anyone worried about losing their boiler or water supply in the dead  of winter. Insurance policies covering central heating start at £7.43 a month and are backed with a promise to send out engineers to fix any problems. The decision to halt sales of the policies followed complaints about aggressive phone-marketing tactics. The business faces allegations that customers were misled or bullied into taking out unnecessary or inadequate policies. Emergencies: The firm provides insurance cover for domestic problems like burst pipes and broken boilers . There are concerns that the sales scripts used by staff gave misleading information to potential customers. Online . forums on consumer websites carry tales of woe, including concerns that . the company uses clauses in its small print to avoid helping customers . in emergencies. The sale of financial products, such as insurance, is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FOS is aware of a number of complaints about Homeserve, while the FSA is now expected to launch an investigation. The initial internal investigation was triggered by customer complaints. Homeserve then appointed business analysts Deloitte to carry out an independent inquiry. As a result of the findings, the Homeserve telesales operation was suspended at the weekend to allow for around 500 staff to be retrained. Incoming calls, where potential customers contact the company, are due to resume today, but outward sales activity, or cold calls, will take longer to start again. Homeserve chief executive Richard Harpin said: ‘We are determined to ensure customers receive the  highest standards of service and we have therefore taken swift action  to address the issues identified by our review.’ Customers who feel they may have been mis-sold a Homeserve policy can complain to the company directly and seek a refund.

"By . Michael Seamark and Tim Shipman . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 22 March 2012 . Safely reunited with the son who helped free her, British hostage Judith Tebbutt yesterday described her despair after discovering Somali kidnappers had murdered her husband. The 56-year-old tourist was dramatically released after a ransom payment, reputedly around £600,000, ended her six month ordeal. Pirates had seized Mrs Tebbutt and her husband David from a luxury Kenyan beach lodge last September, shooting him dead and dragging her off in a speedboat. Freedom: Judith Tebbutt, the British woman kidnapped from a resort island on the Kenyan coast, has spoken of her relief that she has been freed after six months in captivity . Tragic: Mrs Tebbutt, a social worker, who is believed to be deaf and was wearing a double hearing aid, said 'Seven months is a long time and under the circumstances with my husband passing away...made it harder' Her joy at being reunited with only . child Oliver, 25, was tinged with sadness as Mrs Tebbutt revealed she . assumed her 58-year-old husband had been taken alive. She only learnt of . his death two weeks after her kidnapping. Speaking in Somalia before being flown to Kenya, she said: ‘I feel extremely sad. Very, very sad indeed. ‘He was a good man. That was very unfortunate. Really horrible. But you’ve just got to pick up the pieces…and move on. Long ordeal: Judith Tebbutt draped in a shawl and wearing flip flops in Africa yesterday after her release . Release: The cash was airdropped to pirates within the last three days and this morning she was immediately taken out of the Somalia by a plane to Nairobi . Saved: As she left Adado in Somalia, Mrs Tebbutt, told reporters she was glad to be safe after her traumatic ordeal and smiled . ‘I didn’t know he’d died until about . two weeks from my capture. I just assumed he was alive but then my son . told me he’d died…that was difficult. ‘And it must have been hard for my son . as well, very hard, and he’s been fantastic, he’s been absolutely . fantastic,’ she told the BBC. Last night, after arriving in Nairobi . from Somalia, she said: ‘I am of course hugely relieved to at last be . free, and overjoyed to be reunited with my son Ollie. This however is a . time when my joy at being safe again is overwhelmed by my immense grief, . shared by Ollie and the wider family, following David’s passing in . September last year. ‘My family and I now need to grieve properly,’ she added, in a statement issued by the British High Commission. First step: A plane carrying Judith Tebbutt takes off from Adado airport to Nairobi yesterday - her son Oliver, is expected to meet her in the city . Mrs Tebutt also spoke before she was released earlier. 'My condition is good as far as I know. My health is good,' she said . The family of Judith Tebbutt never gave up hope that she would be freed. As news of her release emerged, they could barely contain their relief. Her 90-year-old mother, Gladys Atkinson, said: ‘At the moment I just can’t believe it. I just can’t wait to see her.’ They had known nothing of her impending release. As far as they were aware Mrs Tebbutt’s son, Oliver, had flown to Kenya on Saturday to broker more talks aimed at securing her eventual release. Only after a flurry of phone calls from friends and family – and the dramatic footage of a healthy looking Mrs Tebbutt – could they dare to believe it was finally all over. Mrs Tebbutt’s brother Paul Atkinson, 45, who lives in Ulverston, Cumbria, said: ‘We’re ecstatic at the news, but at the same time we’re still grieving for the loss of Judith’s husband, our brother-in-law. We’re all still numb.’ As the vicar in her home town of Ulverston led a prayer vigil Mrs Tebbutt’s sister Carol McDougall, 51, said: ‘It has been a long six months. We have been told she is well. ‘But she has lost her husband. I found out when I was at school and the secretary told me it was on the news. I was ecstatic. ‘The last six months have been very worrying for Ollie, her son, and losing David who was such a lovely man. I always believed this day would come. Jude is very strong.’ The couple’s son flew out to Kenya last weekend to help end his mother’s ordeal. Speaking in Somalia shortly after . being freed yesterday, Mrs Tebbutt told ITV News: ‘I am just happy to be . released and I’m looking forward to seeing my son who successfully . secured my release. I don’t know how he did it, but he did. Which is . great.’ The Tebbutts were on a fortnight’s holiday when they were seized from the remote Kiwayu Safari Village. The gang killed Mr Tebbutt, finance . director at Faber & Faber, and dragged his wife along the beach and . on to a speedboat before heading north to Somalia. By coincidence, a farmhand, Ali Babitu . Kololo, 25, yesterday appeared in court charged with helping lead the . kidnappers to the Tebbutts’ beach cottage. He claims he did so at . gunpoint but was told by a magistrate he would be sentenced to death if . found guilty. His hearing was adjourned until next month. Mrs Tebbutt’s ordeal ended after the . ransom was dropped from the air to her kidnappers in the last three days . and arrangements made for her release. The first pictures of her, . dressed in flowing robe and headscarf, emerged yesterday morning. Looking thin but apparently cheerful, . she told ITV News, before her release and still in captivity: ‘My . condition is good, as far as I know. My health is good. I sleep very . well here. Although she was pictured smiling after her release, Mrs Tebbutt has been in isolation for six months and had to endure watching her husband, David, being killed by her captors . David Tebbutt was shot dead in September, but the couple's son Oliver, right, has worked has helped free his mother. She said: 'I am just happy to be released and I’m looking forward to seeing my son who successfully secured my release' ‘I have been ill three times . On each . occasion I have had medication almost immediately and it’s cleared up. I . feel fine. I have had absolutely no torture whatsoever.’ Mrs Tebbutt said she had been allowed . to listen to the BBC World Service, which had helped her through the . ordeal. Speaking after being freed, she added: ‘Seven months is a long . time and under the circumstances with my husband passing away.....made . it harder.’ The social worker said there had been ‘some very hard psychological moments...but I got through it. So I’m really relieved.’ Remote: The beachside cabin at the Kiwayu Safari Village where the Tebbutts were staying .

A successful businessman with a 'Jekyll and Hyde character' has been jailed after systematically abusing two girlfriends he met through Facebook. Keith Turner, 43, from York, physically and mentally abused the two women in a series of humiliating and frightening incidents which included him spitting in their faces, throwing one victim’s shredded clothes in the road and posting a fictional profile on an adult website so that men turned up at one victim’s home, expecting sexual favours. He even undid the seatbelt of one of his victims - both in their forties - while driving his Lamborghini and slammed on the brakes. The women finally took out harassment orders against Turner and only realised he had targeted them both when they met through a counselling website for the victims of domestic violence. Keith Turner, 43, from York, physically and mentally abused the two women in a series of humiliating incidents which included him spitting in their faces, throwing one victim's shredded clothes in the road (pictured outside court yesterday) The court heard how Turner had smashed one victim’s laptop and destroyed both of their phones. On other occasions, he drove in a frightening manner, terrifying his victim, and scratched the other’s car with his keys. He later apologised at the home of one of his victims, where he was viewing white supremacist websites. Turner purchased an ex-USSR gas mask on eBay, joined neo-Nazi website Combat 18 and showed one of the women pictures of swastika tattoos. Hull Crown Court heard Turner, the owner of VW Relics Ltd in East Yorkshire, became controlling and obsessively jealous about the victims’ former partners soon after starting to see the women, whom he met online through a shared interest in cars. The court heard how Turner had smashed one victim's laptop and destroyed both of their phones . Turner undid the seatbelt of one of his victims in his Lamborghini while driving and slammed on the brakes (file photo of car similar to Turner's) The court heard Turner would impress them with his motor . business, Lamborghini and boat moored at York. He would take them to the . river or outings to pubs and car shows at Donnington Park. But both women described his sudden . mood changes when they were near other men or when they would not reveal . their previous sexual encounters. Turner met both women through the social networking site . Turner was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to two counts of causing a person to fear violence by harassment. The court was told the first victim - a 44-year-old woman - was in a relationship with Turner for about ten months between November 2010 and August 2011. Judge Jeremy Baker QC said: 'As that . relationship developed, it’s apparent that you had a somewhat Jekyll and . Hyde character because soon thereafter, you subjected her to . distressing, damaging, socially isolating, humiliating and frankly . violent acts.' He began seeing a 46-year-old woman for two months from September 2011. Incidents inflicted on his first victim included: . Incidents inflicted on his second victim included: . Sentencing Turner, Judge Baker said the perpetrators of domestic violence often had 'two personae' - one seen by the outside world and another darker side only seen by their partners. He said: 'That’s clearly the situation in this case. You repeatedly apologised for your actions and went on to repeat the same or worse offending to these victims.' He noted that Turner had seven previous convictions including common assault, actual bodily harm, and battery. Steven Crossley, for Turner, said his client had asked him to apologise to the court and his victims for his behaviour. Judge Baker said: 'These matters involve some degree of physical violence. The victims have altered their lifestyles to avoid contact with yourself. They have been left feeling anxious. 'In my opinion, the case is so serious that it’s right that you are punished for this case by way of a term of immediate imprisonment.'","Keith Turner, 43, given 16-month prison sentence .

"By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 16:42 EST, 16 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 17 May 2012 . Illegal: Based in Sweden, The Pirate Bay is the world's largest BitTorrent site . An illegal file-sharing website has been taken off line after a cyber attack by a mystery hacker. The Pirate Bay, which enables people to download files, music and films without paying, was suddenly bombarded with internet traffic which overwhelmed its servers. The so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack left the site largely inaccessible for the last 24 hours, with only intermittent service in the UK. The Pirate Bay took to its Facebook page to confirm the attack, saying that it did not know who was behind it, although it ‘had its suspicions’. A number of powerful industries have already called for the site to be blocked, but it is unlikely online anarchic hacking group Anonymous were behind the onslaught. ‘There will be further attacks, but what's significant about this whole story is that people think that it is the Anonymous attacking a site which is typically a type of site that they defend,’ said Andre Stewart of Corero Network Security told the BBC. ‘It could be the record labels, or a government somewhere that has had enough of not being able to catch The Pirate Bay, it could be just one person who had rented some cloud power from Amazon and is sitting in a cafe, and is able to launch an attack.’ ’If they're losing money and seeing that the government is not being able to stop it, there's a real monetary value reason for them to try and bring it down,’ Mr Stewart added. In November the British Phonographic Industry, which represents music producer, called for The Pirate Bay to be blocked . Convicted: Peter Sunde, left, and Gottfrid Warg have both been sentenced to jail and a £2.4m fine for running The Pirate Bay . Pirate Bay defendant Fredrik Neij speaking at a demonstration in 2006. He has been sentenced to one year in jail for breaking Sweden'scopyright laws . The Pirate Bay, launched in 2003 by a group of friends from Sweden, allows users to search for and access copyrighted content including movies, games and TV shows. In 2009, the Swedish courts found the site's four founders guilty of helping people circumvent copyright controls. The ruling was upheld after an appeal in 2010 but the site continues to function. A message on The Pirate Bay's blog said the move was an attempt by the music business to 'squeeze' it out of the market. It advised users to 'circumvent the block' and campaign against the move. The message said: 'Write to your ISP and tell them to appeal the case. Write to your local MPs and tell them that this is not allowed. Make sure your voice is heard. 'Remember, we’re all the pirate bay, and we must stand united against the censorship from our opponents.' The Pirate Party UK, a spin-off from the political movement started in Sweden that backs copyright reform, said the latest move will 'not put any extra pennies into the pockets of artists'. 'Unfortunately, the move to order blocking on The Pirate Bay comes as no surprise,' party leader Loz Kaye said. Enemies: The Pirate Bay has seen powerful industries align against it by calling on internet service providers to block the site . 'The truth is that we are on a slippery slope towards internet censorship here in the United Kingdom.' The director of Big Brother Watch, Nick Pickles, said web-blocking was 'a crude tool' and would not stop 'determined users'. He said: 'The broader consequences risk damaging legitimate businesses and undermining cyber-security while further perpetuating the myth that this is an easy technological solution to a complex problem. 'Ultimately, the risk is that ISPs will be expected to monitor everything their customers do online to ensure they are not doing something they should not be. Indeed, it is almost inevitable certain groups will call for this when web blocking is exposed as the ineffective and easily-avoided instrument it is. 'As the calls for greater surveillance of our online activity intensify, the long-term risk is that the state will take on the function of deciding what we are allowed to see online.' Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: 'Blocking The Pirate Bay is pointless and dangerous. It will fuel calls for further, wider and even more drastic calls for internet censorship of many kinds, from pornography to extremism. 'Internet censorship is growing in scope and becoming easier. Yet it never has the effect desired. It simply turns criminals into heroes.'","Site brought down after being bombarded with internet traffic over the last 24 hours .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:11 EST, 17 May 2012 . A wealthy businesswoman who developed an 'irrational fear' of her pension running out, defrauded Marks and Spencer by producing bogus receipts on her PC. Kathleen Stepien, 57, had taken an early retirement with her husband from their family firm, lived in a £250,000 house and had other properties and savings. But she became so worried about becoming broke, she formulated an idea to make some illegal cash after she took some clothes back to the store and noticed the receipt wasn't marked by the cashier. Fraud: Kathleen Stepien, 57, raised suspicions at Marks and Spencer at the Trafford Centre, Manchester . Stepien would buy goods then make fake Marks and Spencer receipts on her home computer and return them for a higher refund. The hearing was told the scam went on for 18 months until police searched her home in Brittania near Bacup, Lancs. Officers recovered a computer, four blank till rolls, a printer which contained blank Marks and Spencer receipt roll and a memory stick. Prosecutor Stephen Parker said analysis of Stepien's computer and the memory stick revealed an 'array of bogus Marks and Spencer receipts.' At Burnley Crown Court, Stepien admitted fraud between January 2009 and January 2011, fraud on October 26, 2010 and possessing articles for use in fraud, on April 7, 2011. She was fined £2,000, with a £15 victim surcharge and must pay £500 costs. Hearing: At Burnley Crown Court, Stepien was fined £2,000, with a £15 victim surcharge and must pay £500 costs . Mr Parker said on October 26, 2010, a member of staff at Marks and Spencer at the Trafford Centre, Manchester, was working the CCTV camera and her attention was directed at the defendant by security staff. Stepien went to the checkout and was trying to get a refund for some trousers. The receipt was from a different store, the cashier had to ascertain its validity and it took some time. The defendant became 'rather jittery, 'snatched the receipt and left. A photo of her had been obtained from the CCTV footage. Bogus: Stepien would buy goods then make fake M&S receipts on her home computer and return them for a higher refund . The prosecutor said in April, 2011, Stepien was spotted at the Trafford Centre again, recognised, followed and detained after a checkout transaction. She was arrested. The £396 receipt she had produced in October was not genuine. Stepien was searched and six or seven Marks and Spencer receipts, also believed to be fake, were found in her purse. Her house was then searched. Mr Parker said it had not been possible to ascertain the extent of the defendant's fraud. She had no previous convictions. In mitigation defence lawyer Keir Monteith, for Stepien, suggested the fraud involved 'a few hundred pounds.' He said she was 'not a career criminal by any stretch of the imagination,'and had gone back to the same store. He continued: 'It really wasn't that well thought out, that well planned or that sophisticated.' Mr Monteith said: 'She clearly didn't need the money. She's clearly very well off, very comfortable indeed and continues to be so at this particular time.' The barrister added the shame of what Stepien had done would live with her until the day she died. He added : 'She is utterly ashamed of her behaviour. In fact, she says it's disgusting and that she has let everyone down. Her husband is devastated by it.' Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Maurice Greene, who had read references and psychological reports, said Stepien seemingly had no reason at all to commit the offences. He said: 'It's a very strange set of circumstances which is quite difficult to understand and explain. 'These offences were reasonably sophisticated and it appears the motivation was an irrational anxiety that you would run out of money and you were trying to plug possible gaps by obtaining relatively small amounts of money on a number of occasions.'","Kathleen Stepien lived in a £250,000 house and had other properties and savings .

A mother whose eyes were gouged out by her lover told yesterday of her determination to ‘get on with life’ for the sake of her children. Shane Jenkin subjected Tina Nash to a 12-hour attack in which he broke her jaw, throttled her until she was unconscious and blinded her. Miss Nash said she felt ‘nothing’ toward her attacker who was given an indeterminate sentence yesterday, which he will serve in a mental hospital. Scroll down for video . Moving forward: Tina Nash arrives at Truro Crown Court in Cornwall, where her former partner Shane Jenkin was jailed indefinitely for GBH . Thug: Jenkin strangled and blinded his then-girlfriend in a sickening 12-hour attack . The 32-year-old had already told of . her heartache at knowing she will never again see her two sons and said . losing her sight felt like being buried alive. Now she says she has turned a corner and is learning to deal with her devastating injuries. She is starting to feel her way around her house and arranging her wardrobe so she knows which clothes are kept where. ‘I just woke up and thought I have . got to get on with my life,’ she said. ‘That’s what I did, I got up, . sorted out my clothes and just got on with it. ‘I am trying to do everything, I am . having a good go. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me because I . don’t feel sorry for myself.I feel stronger. I am ready to take on new challenges. ‘I feel a lot more confident, definitely. I am getting the old me back. I don’t think I am brave. I am surviving. ‘You only get one life so I am not going to let him ruin it.’ She said her children did not treat her differently and she just wanted to make them proud. Jenkin, 33, did not attend court . yesterday to hear the judge hand down a sentence of a minimum of six . years less the one year he served awaiting trial. He attacked Miss Nash while she slept following a night out with friends near her home in Hayle, . Cornwall. Ignoring her desperate . pleas to call an ambulance, Jenkin kept her imprisoned for 12 hours and . throttled her into unconsciousness before blinding her. The night before the appalling – and . unexplained – attack, he had watched a horror film with Miss Nash that . featured a woman having her eyes gouged out. Jenkin, who is 6ft 4in, had . attacked Miss Nash before. Devastated: Tina Nash, pictured left speaking last month, and right before the assault, said she missed 'the things people take for granted' like seeing the sea and sky . Freedom: Tina Nash (centre) leaves Truro Crown Court with two police officers following Jenkin's sentencing . No more tears: Miss Nash listens as a police officer reads a statement on her behalf outside the court . The court heard he owned a book about . deranged killer Raoul Moat and had once told Miss Nash: ‘If I am going . down, I am going down for something worthwhile.’ Judge Christopher Clarke said Jenkin, . who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent, had committed a truly . terrible crime of extreme violence. ‘That violence has left Tina Nash permanently blind. She has lost the precious gift of sight,’ he told Truro Crown Court. ‘She will never again be able to see her family or her friends or the beautiful coast and countryside of this county. ‘For the people who can see the world . around them it is almost impossible to imagine having one’s sight being . removed by the brutal act of another human being. ‘It is almost to impossible to . imagine the despair and distress Miss Nash must feel at never being able . to watch her two sons growing up.’ Describing the assault last April, . Judge Clarke said that Jenkin ‘repeatedly held her tightly around the . neck and, as he continued to strangle her, she lost consciousness and . from time to time she hallucinated’. Suffering: Ms Nash is led into Truro Crown Court by a police officer last year, her damaged eyes covered by sunglasses . Beaten: Miss Nash before the horrific attack, in which her nose and jaw was broken and her sight destroyed . He added: ‘At some point during this . attack when she was unconscious, the defendant gouged out her eyes with . his fingers or thumbs.’ The judge said it could be ‘many, . many years’ before parole is granted and described Jenkin as ‘a very . dangerous man from which the public needs to be kept safe’. Since the attack last April, Miss . Nash has moved to be near her sisters, where she lives with her sons, . aged four and 14, and their dog. Asked about Jenkin after yesterday’s . sentencing hearing, she said: ‘To be honest I feel nothing towards him – . nothing – because that’s a feeling and I don’t want to have any . feelings towards him. So, no, I’m not going to waste my time. He never . existed.’ Urging other victims of domestic . abuse to seek help, she said: ‘Shane was not mentally ill when he . attacked me, he was not drunk or under the influence of drugs. ‘It was a silent prolonged attack. Shane knows what he did to me that night and he has to live with that . for the rest of his life. My life changed for ever that night and will . never be the same but I am now able to move on, start my treatment and . rebuild my life. Abusive relationship: Jenkin, left, had attacked his girlfriend, right, on numerous occasions - but she had always believed he would change and even helped him to get out of jail . ‘I have a future and want to provide a future for my kids and be a good mum. ‘I urge anyone out there suffering . domestic abuse to contact the police before it is too late. Don’t be . frightened or embarrassed.’ Miss Nash said last month that she . missed ‘the things which people take for granted the most, such as . seeing the sky and the sea’. She said she was left feeling ‘buried alive, claustrophobic and not in control of my life’ by the assault. ‘I actually look forward to going to sleep because in my dreams I have sight. It’s when I wake up that the truth hits home.’ Jenkin had been repeatedly banned . from his local pubs in Penzance for violence, and three months before he . blinded Miss Nash he was reportedly charged with breaching bail . following an assault charge. Vile: Shane Jenkin, 33, assaulted his girlfriend in a 'premeditated and vicious attack' Callous Shane Jenkin could turn like 'flicking a switch' and was on a five-year pub ban for violence. The 6ft 4in thug was banned from pubs several times but excluded again in 2010 after punching a policeman, a pubwatch chairman said. Jenkin, who was jailed today for blinding his then-girlfriend Tina Nash, struck fear into fellow drinkers who knew his volatile temper could erupt with little warning. One Penzance barman said Jenkin had previously tried to gouge out a man's eyes during a brawl. 'I and several others have had run-ins . with him and would say he is generally a nasty piece of work,' said the . barman, who asked not to be named. 'What he did to Tina he tried to do to . other people - I know someone else he had a fight with and tried to do . that to him but he was 6ft 4in and could defend himself. 'He could just turn and go from being nice and polite and jovial then bang, it was like flicking a switch. I saw it on several occasions.' 'I have seen him talking to people, having a laugh to stamping on them on the floor. 'There have been various violent crimes and he has been to jail but he always pulled the mental health card - he says he isn't responsible for his actions and has mental health issues. 'He once dragged someone outside, up the road, put a bench on his head and started jumping on it. 'He ended up with a fractured skull and brain damage and I think he did some prison time for that but played the diminished responsibility card and was out in about 10 months.

Furious sports fans hit out at the London Olympics ticket sales process once again yesterday, as event bosses were slammed for trying to flog some for as much as £2,012. Thousands were trying for their last chance to gain entrance to some of the most popular Olympic events as the latest tranche of tickets went on sale at 11am yesterday morning. But almost as soon as the tickets went on sale, hundreds were already taking to Twitter to broadcast their frustration at the online buying process. Wishful thinking? This artist's impression shows . how the 2012 Games should look in full swing, but LOCOG was facing the . prospect that some stadiums may not be full as the public tires of the ticket buying process . And the London Olympic organising committee (LOCOG) is also coming under pressure to explain its failure to shift 'prestige' tickets, on sale for prices ranging between £295 to £1,800. The tickets that went on sale yesterday, 'AA' tickets for the opening ceremony cost £2,012, and the cheapest available for that event were £995. Many were still unsold by 5pm. So far, 7million of the total 8.8million Olympic tickets have been shifted, and about half of the 2.45million Paralympic tickets, in a process that began last year. Left out: Former decathlete Daley Thompson has been unable to get any tickets for the games at all . LOCOG still has about 550,000 tickets to sell with just weeks to go to the start of the Games on July 27. A . large chunk of them are so-called contingency tickets which had been . held back while logistics such as TV camera positions were resolved. The committee has a further 1.25million soccer tickets to shift - about half the original number. Yesterday, as the latest tranche of tickets were made available at 11am, hundreds of people took to Twitter to vent their fury. Even Olympics legend Daley Thompson told how he had failed to get any tickets and had 'wasted 45 minutes' on the London 2012 website. Angry buyers told how they waited for the online system to tell them whether they had secured their chosen tickets only to be told that there were no more available. Former Olympic gold medal winning decathlete Thompson Tweeted: 'I bet I’m not alone in being unable to get any tickets on 2012 website wasted 45mins and I want them so badly' And Television and BBC radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford Tweeted: 'I’m trying to get some tickets for the Olympics but when I click ‘request tickets’ on the site, it just refreshes page and tells me nothing?' And Twitter used Neil Robertson wrote: 'Appear to have more chance of winning lottery tonight than getting Olympics tickets!' LBC presenter Anthony Davis said: 'I’m in the virtual queue for #Olympics tickets. 3 min wait to see if I’ve been successful. The official ticket website is a joke. 'Been trying to buy Olympic tickets for 35 mins. Nothing available for under £450 each apparently… gutted.' Deborah Roback wrote: 'What a rubbish system, impossible to find available tickets for any event.' And furious fans also yesterday hit out at the expensive 'prestige tickets' on offer. Paul Roberts, 40, from Essex, told The Sun: 'We were told it was going to be the Games for the people. But I didn’t realise they were talking about people with big wallets and cash to burn.' Premium: Tickets to see athletes like Jessica Ennis compete in athletics events are among the most expensive available . London 2012 organisers say the high prices help to subsidise the cheap tickets on offer to the public. Company Prestige Ticketing was given about 80,000 Olympics and Paralympics tickets to sell. A Prestige spokesman said: 'The income from these programmes provides a vital source of revenue that makes the Games more accessible. 'Tickets for the Opening Ceremony would not be available to the public at £20.12 if there were not tickets at £2,012 that subsidise the cheaper ones.' Experts believe LOCOG has done a good job, having already sold more than 90 percent of its tickets (excluding the football). It is on target to raise the £500million needed towards its £2billion budget. 'They have a few hundred thousand tickets which millions of people would like to buy, then they have several millions of tickets that nobody wants to buy,' said Stefan Szymanski of the University of Michigan. 'And they have a commitment to make every event a sell-out.' The lottery-style process adopted in the early rounds allowed it to get the best price for the tickets, he said. 'The problem is that the British public didn't seem to understand this,' he added. Alternatives, such as an auction, would have raised more revenue, but would have been resented even more by a British public that had already forked out £9.3 pounds towards getting the Games ready.","Tickets still on sale for prestige events as fans are put off by sky-high prices .

Victim: Police discovered Mohammed Taki's remains under the patio at the flat in leafy Fulham, west London, in February 2010 after receiving a tip-off . A flat owner made a deathbed confession to strangling a man whose skeleton remained buried under his patio for 12 years, an inquest heard today. Police discovered Mohammed Taki's remains . at the flat in leafy Fulham, west London, in February . 2010 after receiving a tip-off. The 53-year-old's body had been bound with tape and wrapped in a duvet cover before being buried under the concrete patio. At the time, flat owner Roy Heath, 52, was a terminally ill patient at the Trinity Hospice in Clapham, south London. Police interviewed him at the hospice and on . the fourth occasion 'he admitted he had in fact killed the man we . discovered under the concrete area. He named that man as Mr Taki', Detective Sergeant, Robert Upham, said. Mr Heath has since died. Following the tip-off, police began a search of the garden . using methods such as radar. They discovered the remains at the back of the house under a level of concrete. DS Upham told West London Coroner's Court: 'The concrete was lifted. The search team dug approximately a foot-and-a-half under the soil. 'The first we discovered was an area . of underlay which had been rolled. The underlay was exposed where we . found what appeared to be a duvet cover. Under the duvet cover were . several wrapped bags which covered several remains.' Mr Heath 'claimed he had strangled . Mohammed Taki', he added, but he died 13 days later and police were able . to follow up investigations with him. However, he was under the care of a . psychiatrist before his death and had anger management issues and a 'compulsion to blame other people for his own failures.' The inquest heard Mr Taki, who was born . in Iraq and is believed to have been unemployed when he died, had last . been seen on January 12, 1998, during a doctor's appointment. Upmarket: Police found Mr Taki's remains under the patio of the flat in Fulham, London, owned by Roy Heath, who then confessed to strangling Mr Taki in 1998 . It was discovered that he had three . sisters living in Baghdad and one in Syria, but officers were not able . to get enough DNA from them to forensically confirm the skeleton . belonged to Mr Taki. However, GP records showed he had . complained to his doctor of back pain and the forensic anthropologist . found evidence to fit this on the skeleton. Police also showed photographs of the . clothing found on the skeleton to a friend who had reported him . missing and 'when he was shown a picture of the hat, he burst into . tears. 'He was adamant that the hat we had shown him was that belonging . to Mr Taki', DS Upham said, and the clothing Mr Taki was said to have been wearing was similar to that found on the skeleton. Pathologist, Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, told . the inquest the body was in the foetal position and adhesive tape was . wrapped around his ankles. Due to the length of time the body had been left, he said, 'regrettably the cause of death is given as unascertained.' Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner . Alison Thompson, said: 'I think on account that there was an unlawful . burial, it raises the issue of suspicion and makes it more likely that . the cause of death is an unnatural one. 'From all the circumstances in which it was found, it is more likely to have been criminally mediated.' There was 'some reliability' to be . placed on what Mr Heath claimed had happened, she said, adding: 'All I . can say is I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this was . an unlawful killing.' At the time two people were arrested and bailed on suspicion of murder, but no charges were ever brought.","Police discovered skeleton of Mohammed Taki bound with tape after tip-off .

Canadian cannibal killer suspect Luka Magnotta faced his first court hearing as early as today after arriving in Montral last night under police escort. The porn star murder suspect is suspected of killing male lover Lin Jun and posting a video online that shows him having sex with the dismembered corpse. Bisexual Magnotta, 29, who is also suspected of chopping up the 33-year-old's body and eating parts of it, was flown to Montreal's Mirabel Airport, where he arrived under a heavy security presence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pleaded not guilty: Magnotta, 29, pleaded not guilty through his lawyer after arriving back in Montreal yesterday, where he was met with heavy security .

Magnotta (C) escorted by police upon arrival from Germany on June 18, . 2012 at Mirabel Airport outside Montreal on June 18, 2012 . A convoy of police vehicles with flashing lights rolled out to meet Magnotta at Mirabel airport just outside Montreal on Monday. Half a dozen men escorted him down the stairs of the plane and into a minivan. Armed guards stood by, while handcuffed Magnotta, who has also had his hair cut short, said nothing. Magnotta, 29, will appear in court via video conference Tuesday, Lafreniere said. Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews noted that Magnotta himself sped up the process by declining to contest his extradition. Martin Steltner, a spokesman for Berlin prosecutors, said Germany's federal government gave formal approval for the extradition a few days ago. Magnotta's court-appointed lawyer during the extradition proceedings, Evelyn Ascher, could not be reached late Monday. Gruesome: Magnotta, 29, is suspected of murdering his gay lover before having sex with his dismembered corpse . Magnotta was caught reading stories about himself at an Internet cafe in Berlin earlier this month after he spent a few days partying in Paris. Magnotta was arrested in Berlin two weeks ago after a massive international manhunt following the Montreal murder of Chinese student Jun. In a gruesome twist, the victim’s hands and feet were sent to members of Canada’s main political parties and two schools in Vancouver. Magnotta was extradited from Germany to Canada on Monday on charges including murder and abusing a corpse. Identified: Packages containing a human foot and . hand sent to two schools in Vancouver have been identified as belonging . to the gay lover and victim of Luka Rocco Magnotta, pictured . Multiples: Police said Luka had 70 Facebook accounts under different names . His extradition and pending court appearance came after his devastated ex-lover last night spoke of her horror at falling for him and said: 'He could have chopped me up too.' The transsexual, who goes by the name Barbie, said the porn star wooed her by taking her to see violent film Basic Instinct 2 — in which a victim is killed with an ice pick. Sickened Barbie, aged 30, said: 'When I heard Luka was suspected of killing a man I was disgusted and disturbed. I wish I had never met the monster. 'I felt ill that I could have dated a man who was said to have done something so horrific. Victim: Magnott's suspected victim, Jun Lin, whose body parts have now been confirmed as sent to various locations is pictured . 'I had panic attacks because he knew where I lived and I thought he could come for me. I forced myself to watch the murder video on the net. 'I thought, ""It could have been me. He could have chopped me up like that.""' Magnotta's original arrest warrant cited first-degree murder, committing an indignity to a dead body, publishing an obscene matter, mailing obscene matter and criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other members of Parliament. But Montreal police commander Ian Lafreniere said yesterday that number could change because investigators have yet to formally question Magnotta.","Porn star murder suspect arrives in Montreal under heavy security .

A ten-year-old boy head-butted a teacher unconscious and kicked her assistant so hard he broke her leg, a court heard yesterday. He went on a violent rampage after the teacher confiscated a coin he had been scraping across his desk during a lesson. CCTV captured the boy throwing a box across the room and upturning the teacher's desk. He then ran out of the design and technology lesson into the corridor where he started kicking and punching the walls. Bromley Magistrates' Court, Kent, where the boy pleaded guilty to assault and unlawful wounding before a youth court hearing . When the two women, in their 50s, tried to restrain him, he head-butted one and kicked the other in the leg. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat next to his mother at Bromley Youth Court yesterday and nodded a guilty plea to a charge of assault. When asked for a plea for unlawful wounding, he shrugged his shoulders and looked at his mother who nodded at him. Nisha Dutt, prosecuting, said the assistant 'felt a kick to her left knee and witnesses say there was a cracking noise'. Surgeons confirmed she had suffered a severe fracture and was likely to suffer from post-traumatic arthritis and require a knee replacement. The teacher, who has worked at the school for 12 years, was taken to hospital with facial injuries, and diagnosed with concussion. 'The only reason he has pleaded guilty is because he did hurt (his teachers), but they caused the situation.' - Pupil's mother .

Her mother and father finally learned about the termination when she told them after it had happened. In line with her wishes: Teachers gave a 15-year-old schoolgirl (not pictured) time off to have an abortion without telling her parents she was undergoing the procedure (file image) Last night family campaigners said the case showed how parents are increasingly being sidelined by the law. It is understood that the girl went to a hospital where it was confirmed she was pregnant. In line with her wishes, doctors did not tell her parents but notified the school in Salford, Greater Manchester, instead. Teachers discussed the termination with the girl, checking she was comfortable with her decision. They also gave her time off school and supported her when she went for the procedure. Under the law, teachers, doctors and nurses can offer sexual advice or treatment – including an abortion – to children without telling their parents as long as the child is considered mature enough to make the decision.However, they must ensure that every effort is made to encourage a young person to involve their parents in the decision. In the Salford case, it is believed the girl did not want her parents to know because she was embarrassed and ashamed. John Merry of Salford Council said: ‘There are very clear and stringent national guidelines for schools to follow in these situations.’ Protection: Teachers, doctors and nurses are allowed, by law, to offer sexual advice, including an abortion, to children without telling their parents as long as the child is considered mature enough to make the decision (file picture) But Michaela Aston of pro-life charity LIFE and a teacher for more than 25 years, said it was ‘high time to worry’ when schools get involved with abortions behind parents’ backs. She said: ‘When parents leave their children at the school door, they have an implicit trust that this institution will act in the best interest of their children without leaving them out of the equation. ‘Parents are informed and required to give written consent if their child takes a simple pill such as an aspirin at school. Why should a medical procedure that is much more serious be done in secret?’ Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said parents are becoming increasingly sidelined in the name of ‘the right of the child to confidentiality’. He said: ‘Parental responsibilities are being usurped by those whose interest in them is professional rather than personal. ‘They are not encouraging them to value and respect their parents and they are failing to recognise that young people generally want to conceal things when they are doing something that is not good for them.’","Salford school gave her time off to have termination .

Jamie Redknapp, the former England midfielder and Sportsmail columnist, yesterday revealed it is the first time he can remember the whole team singing the Anthem. Hodgson made the point that the country was celebrating Her Majesty The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee but he also wanted to see that display of unity on the pitch before matches here in Eastern Europe.

Fighter: Aimee Copeland, 24, has been upgraded to 'good' condition by doctors as her battle against the flesh-eating bacteria continues . A Georgia woman battling an extremely painful flesh-eating disease is showing definitive signs of improvement, as doctors have once again upgraded her condition. Hospital officials said Monday that Aimee Copeland's condition has improved from serious to good, meaning that her vital signs are stable and within normal limits. The 24-year-old woman developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, right foot and both hands have been amputated. Her father, Andy Copeland, said in a blog post Monday that she was able to leave her hospital room and get outdoors for the first time during her stay at Doctors Hospital in Augusta. Mr Copeland said he pushed his daughter around the outside of the hospital over the weekend. He wrote: 'Aimee got a huge dose of [daylight] yesterday. For the first time in 49 days, Aimee got up in a wheelchair and rolled out of her hospital room... Fresh scenery and close proximity to nature was all she needed.' While Mr Copeland admits that it hasn't been easy, he is amazed by her quick recovery and her positive spirit. He wrote: 'I was and I am in awe of my incredible daughter. She has embraced her new life as a challenge and an opportunity. Perhaps all this was preordained.' Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. In fact, her agony had become so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication. But now, as Miss Copeland's condition improves, she says she feel's 'blessed,' according to her father. On . June 17, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog: 'Over the past 48 hours, Aimee . has had the most difficult pain she’s experienced through her entire . ordeal.' Agony: Aimee Copeland had hoped to be treated with only holistic medicine but the extent of her injuries were too severe . Mr Copeland said the painkillers were . not enough to block his 24-year-old daughter's severe pain, which had . spread beyond her amputation sites. But today, she is only reporting pain in her abdominal area. Earlier this month, doctors upgraded . her condition to serious from critical after Miss Copeland fought back . from the brink of death. The . student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her . convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in . holistic medicine. Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father says he is amazed by his daughter's attitude as she progresses . Describing his daughter's phantom pains on the blog on June 6, Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain . is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there. 'I asked . her if she could describe the pain and she told me, ""It feels like I . have been carrying bags of rocks"". The . University of West Georgia student had to have her left leg amputated . at the hip, her right foot and both hands in order to save her life . after a cut to her leg became infected. Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) The bacteria that attacked Miss Copeland's wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said. Despite the painful skin grafts, the student has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own and no longer needs dialysis. Mr Copeland wrote that support for his daughter has come from all over the country, including celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and Ann Curry. Andy Copeland's blog has . been an inspiration to many all over the world who admire the strength . and courage of the 24-year-old and her family. Progress: Aimee Copeland's condition has now been changed from serious to good at the Georgia hospital . Miss Copeland has . improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and . well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up . for his brave daughter. She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read. Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Doctors at the local emergency room in . Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it . became infected within days.

The flawed computer programme that led to a week of chaos for millions of RBS customers was being supervised by an IT support team in India, it was revealed last night. Last February, RBS advertised for a series of key jobs, paying between £9,000 and £11,000 a year, in the Indian city of Hyderabad. That is way below what an equivalent worker would be paid in Britain. The banking giant was urgently . seeking computer graduates with several years' experience of using . CA-7, the programme which the bank uses to run its vast network of . transactions and accounts. No link: Hyderabad, India, where Natwest parent RBS employs IT support staff on a yearly wage of between £9,000 and £11,000 . The job advertisement said: ‘Looking . for candidates having 4-7 years of experience in Batch Administration . using CA-7 tool. Urgent requirement by RBS.’ But . last night technology website The Register claimed that this software . needed to be updated and overseen from India by staff who are employed . to work around the clock to solve any faults. But the fiasco has brought calls for the bank's bosses to be subject to a 'detailed investigation' from Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King said today. He said there need to be answers as to what went wrong and why it has taken so long to sort the issues out. His comments came as Royal Bank of Scotland said it was finally getting on top of the crisis after it successfully updated all but 1 per cent of NatWest and RBS account balances overnight. RBS Group has had less success sorting out the delays experienced by Ulster Bank customers, but it hopes to restore a full service for the start of next week. RBS . has been swift to deny that its controversial job out-sourcing . programme has been responsible for the fiasco. It merely says that the . ‘software error occurred on a UK-based piece of software’ but has . declined to say where the staff overseeing the software are based. It is a fact that the vast computer . servers are based in Britain. But insiders confirmed last night that . many of their support team are based in India. Useless: A woman passes an out of order NatWest . cashpoint in the town of Olney, Buckinghamshire. The IT fiasco at the bank has now . entered its seventh day, with many customers still unable to access their cash . Since being rescued by the taxpayer . RBS has shed about 30,000 jobs, including more than 20,000 UK-based . roles, and has outsourced work abroad. Some . of its IT support teams are now said to be based in India, even though . the under-fire banking group’s headquarters remain in Edinburgh. The buck stops here? RBS chief administrative . officer Ron Teerlink is the executive directly responsible for the . bank's IT systems . The Unite union questioned whether the ‘off-shoring’ job cuts had left the bank unable to cope after the software failure. Last night insiders said problems began on Tuesday night when CA-7 was updated. On a normal evening, this should allow all the cashpoint withdrawals, salary transfers and direct debits to be updated. The nightly update is the reason why internet banking transactions made by so many customers are not updated if they are made after a certain time of the day. But what appears to have happened is that crucial files were deleted. The error was spotted but – incredibly – was repeated on Wednesday and again on Thursday. It was only on Friday morning that staff realised the full scale of the crisis. Urgent calls to India followed and troubleshooters were drafted in. The problem was that every single transaction that was waiting in the queue had to be reprocessed in strict order of arrival, causing further delays over last weekend. RBS has consistently denied that the decision to relocate jobs to India has made any difference to its handling of the situation. But critics said that if the number of UK-based support staff had been run down, it would always run the risk of problems if there was a major fault. Last night Computer Associates, which owns CA-7, declined to comment on what had caused the problem. The fiasco is believed to be the longest and most widespread problem of its kind since the advent of computer banking. Which? said it raised questions about how robust systems were at other banks. Britain’s major banks have all faced criticism that they are reliant on constantly grafting software updates on to their complex computer systems rather than replacing the systems themselves. David Bannister, the editor of Banking Technology magazine, told Channel 4 News: ‘What should have been a minor glitch has led to a pretty disastrous cock-up.’ He questioned why a back-up system did not appear to have been in place to protect the bank against a software failure. The executive directly responsible for the bank’s IT systems is chief administrative officer Ron Teerlink. His pay and bonus are not disclosed because he does not sit on the main board, but he is understood to receive a six-figure package.","Natwest has shed 30,000 jobs since taxpayer rescue in 2007, including 20,000 UK positions, and has outsourced work overseas .

Tragedy: Michael Goodman (pictured) was allegedly pushed by his twin brother, fell against a doorknob and hit his head, dying instantly . A grieving mother has vowed to stand by her teenage son after he was charged with killing his identical twin brother in a tragic mistake. Lynette Goodman, 39, says her family life has been torn apart by what she claims was a 'terrible accident'. Shockingly, Lynette only moved to Spain six years ago to escape the drug riddled streets of Northampton and provide a safer environment for her sons. The mother-of four had been living the Spanish dream until she discovered her son Ryan, 19, had killed his twin brother Michael following a 'stupid argument'. The brothers rowed after their mother shouted at them over money that had gone missing from her purse. The twins, who lived with Lynette and younger twin brother and sister Owen and Shannon, both 10, blamed each other for stealing the money. The fight in February last year ended in tragedy when Ryan pushed Michael and he fell against a doorknob and hit his head, dying instantly. Seeing his brother had no pulse, Ryan dragged Michael’s body out of the family’s country villa, near Valencia, and hid it beneath undergrowth in a ditch just ten metres from their front door. Michael’s decomposed body was only found in April this year when a wild asparagus picker stumbled across the remains. A court in the nearby town of Xativa heard last week that DNA testing confirmed Michael’s identity. The trial is being held in Xativa, close to Valencia, in an area popular with British ex-pats . Lynette, who moved to Spain to live with her father, David, 62, from Blackthorn, Northampton, said she will now support Ryan 'every step of the way' as he faces the harsh Spanish legal system. She said: 'I love him and I will support him every step of the way. I have to, he’s my son. 'The whole thing has been a nightmare. It was going so well out here, the boys were doing well at school, they had the life of Riley, but now it has all gone so wrong, all because of a terrible, terrible accident. 'This was meant to be a fresh start for all of us. I’d had enough of Blackthorn. It was ‘Smackthorn’, there were drugs everywhere and I needed to get away, I didn’t want my kids to grow up around that. 'I lived two doors away from a drug . dealer. The children would be playing with syringes, injecting by . accident and having to go for AIDS tests. 'When my mum died, my dad moved to . Spain and we went with him to get away. It was going to be our new life . together in the sunshine. 'It wasn’t meant to turn out like this. 'It took them seven weeks after the body was found to confirm it was Michael. The twins attended school in the town of Vallada close to where the killing took place . 'Everything is so long-winded out here, it takes forever. We’re looking at another six or nine months before we get to the end of all this. 'It was a stupid argument. They were brothers, they argued. There’s nothing more to it than that. I can’t believe it has ended like this.' Appearing at court in the nearby town of Xativa last week, Ryan told the investigating judge that his brother’s death had been an accident and he was very sorry. He said: 'I loved my brother and had no intention of killing him' and added that he had hidden the body because he was 'very scared' of the consequences. The judge remanded him to the custody of youth criminal services because he had been 17-years-old when the crime was committed. He will spend six months in a juvenile detention centre while he awaits trial.The court heard Lynette had only reported her son missing three months after he vanished. It is believed Ryan had told the family his brother had returned to England and they did not raise the alarm as he was 'prone to disappear' for weeks at a time. When there was no sign of the missing teenager his mother made an appeal for help to find him on Facebook. Police questioned Ryan and his grandfather David, 62, several times about Michael’s disappearance, believing David was covering for his grandson, local reports said.","Lynette Goodman's son Ryan killed twin brother Michael following a 'stupid argument'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:59 EST, 10 July 2012 . A Silicon Valley home purchased by a wealthy Russian for $100million has now been valued at exactly half of what Yuri Milner paid. Mr Milner purchased the sprawling French chateau-style mansion last March as a pied-a-terre for times when he was away from his first home in Moscow. However, a recent valuation of the Los Altos Hills property by the Santa Clara County Assessor's Office found is was worth $50million less than what he paid. Whopping: At $100m, this huge mansion was the most expensive ever bought in Silicon Valley - and even at its new value of 50m it remains the most expensive mansion sold . How the other half lives: Joggers look up to the mansion in Los Altos Hills, California; the mansion's owner, Russian investor Yuri Milner, invests in companies like Facebook and Groupon . Sprawling: The house comprises 25,500-square-foot and sizeable grounds to boot . It means if Mr Milner wanted to sell . the home, which boasts 14 bathrooms, two dining rooms, indoor and . outdoor pool, ballroom, and maid’s quarters, it would likely only make . half of what he paid for it. However, Mr Milner's attorney said that the investor has 'no plans to sell' his property. Even at the new price the chateau is still the most expensive property in Los Altos Hills. The county assessor’s office searched locally and statewide to find comparable homes to do the valuation. They managed to find a 30,000-square-foot mansion, also in Los Altos Hills, that sold for $28.5million.  And Aaron Spelling’s 56,000-square-foot mansion, long considered the largest in the state, sold for $85million . David Ginsborg, deputy to the assessor, told the San Jose Business Journal that despite the drastic price cut, the mansion is still the ‘highest valued home’ in the country. Mr Milner will have to pay some $600,000 in property tax when the home sells. However, his spokesman confirmed he still owns the property and has no intention of selling. According to a 2011 Wall Street Journal article profiling the property, the mansion also includes a home theatre, tennis courts, and wine cellar, and has more than 25,000 square feet. William Hablinksi, who was an architect . working on the project, describes the property on his website as an interpretation of . the royal Chateau de Maisons and Anet. Amenities: Among the French chateau-style home's many features are a tennis court, indoor and outdoor pools, two kitchens, multiple wood-burning fireplaces, and a maid's quarters . Yuri Milner has made billions investing in companies like Facebook and Groupon . When Mr Milner bought the home in 2011, it was the biggest price tag ever paid in Santa Clara County, an area known for its high-priced luxury properties - and made headlines last year for being one of the most expensive properties sold within the U.S. The hilltop home, which includes its own car wash, was built in 2009 and has five bedrooms, nine baths and a tennis court. Mr . Milner’s primary residence is in Moscow, where he lives with his wife . and two daughters. But he is a frequent visitor to the high-tech enclave . in northern California. The 47-year-old Internet tycoon is a . former particle physics graduate student, and built up the Russian online company Mail.ru, which last year listed on the London stock exchange. The home was bought from another . tycoon, Fred Chan, founder of ESS Technology, who has reportedly decided . to stay living in Hawaii after building the Silicon Valley mansion. Mr Milner reportedly made the 2011 transaction through a limited liability company called La Paloma Property. ‘This . valley attracts money and lifestyle. We’re definitely seeing a little . surge,’ Michael Sibilia, president of the Santa Clara County Association . of Realtors told the San Jose Mercury News last year.","Russian tech investor Yuri Milner purchased Silicon Valley mansion for $100million in 2009 .

A terminally ill mother who lost custody of her children after she was diagnosed with breast cancer has died. Alaina Giordano, 38, passed away at her parents’ home with her son and daughter by her side after a judge agreed to let her spend her final weeks with them. Miss Giordano fought a high-profile legal battle with her estranged husband after a judge ruled that he should have custody of their children following her diagnosis with terminal breast cancer. Devoted mom: Alaina Giordano, 38, passed away at her parents' home with her son Bud, centre, and daughter Sofia, right, by her side after a judge agreed to let her spend her final weeks with them . Emergency motion: Alaina Giordano was reportedly given temporary custody of her children after an emergency motion was put before a family court judge . The children - Bud, six, and Sofia, 11 - moved 800 miles from Miss Giordano’s home in North Carolina to live with their father in Chicago last year. According to a post on Miss Giordano’s Facebook campaign page she passed away on Monday morning, but friends had waited until after the funeral on Friday to announce it publicly. Miss Giordano’s friend Peter Kaufmann wrote: ‘On the morning of Monday, June 25th, my dear friend Alaina, daughter, sister, loving mother and courageous example to thousands all over the world, ended her battle with stage 4 cancer. I resist using the word “succumbed” because Alaina has not lost this battle…and her death will not be in vain. Custody battle: Miss Giordano fought a high-profile legal battle with her estranged husband after a judge ruled that he should have custody of their children following her diagnosis with terminal breast cancer . ‘Thanks to all of you – her tireless supporters in the tens of thousands – who helped spread the word about her plight, who donated in any way they could, and who sent their prayers and wishes to her from afar – her family and close friends truly thank you for making her final year as tolerable as it could possibly be.’ The Facebook message said that Miss Giordano spent her final weeks at her family’s home in Pennsylvania. She was reportedly given temporary custody of her children after an emergency motion was put before a family court judge. High-profile: Miss Giordano made appearances on shows including The Today Show determined to keep her children but they moved to live with their father in August last year . Mr Kauffman wrote: ‘Throughout this entire struggle I want to emphasise how much I admired and respected Alaina’s dignity and perseverance. She never complained once about her circumstances and faced her mortality with unwavering bravery.’ The mother-of-two was first diagnosed with cancer in 2007, but her condition worsened as it spread to her bones. After the couple separated in January 2010, her husband Kane Snyder sought to gain full permanent custody of their children. A judge ruled in Mr Snyder’s favour after a psychiatrist recommended that they should live with him because of the ‘deteriorating condition of the mother’s health’. After the couple separated in January 2010, her husband Kane Snyder sought to gain full permanent custody of their children . A Facebook campaign in support of Miss Giordano was launched and she made appearances on shows including The Today Show, but following a number of appeals the children moved to live with their father in August last year. Miss Giordano called the verdict ‘shocking’ and said: ‘Anybody who knows me knows my children are my life. They are what give me strength.’ Court papers show that Miss Giordano and Mr Snyder both were arrested and spent a night in jail after a September 2009 fight, and both obtained and dropped restraining orders against each other. The ruling also detailed mutual allegations of mistreatment and infidelity, and said both parents 'place their children in the middle of their divorce and unnecessarily expose them to the conflict so the children are compelled to choose sides'. Mr Snyder has not spoken publicly, but a lawyer representing him last year said the case has been badly misconstrued in public.","Alaina Giordano fought a high-profile legal battle with her estranged husband for custody of their children .

Jeremy Lin, who helped turn around a miserable 2011-2012 Knicks season that resulted in the team becoming playoff competitors, will now pack his bags for Texas. The point guard will join the Houston Rockets after the Knicks announced late Tuesday night they would not match the Rockets' three-year, $25million offer for the restricted free agent. Scroll down for video . Winning streak: Lin was one of the Knicks' key players last season, averaging 14.6 points a game when he went up against some tough teams like the Los Angeles Lakers . It won't be the first time Lin has donned a Rockets jersey. He played with the team for a total of two preseason games last year before he was placed on waivers and later claimed by the Knicks. Like most athletes in similar situations, Lin took to Twitter to express his delight and to thank the New York fans. He posted: 'Extremely excited and honored to be a Houston Rocket again!!' 'Much love and thankfulness to the Knicks and New York for your support the past year...easily the best year of my life.' Back to Texas: Lin took to Twitter to express his enthusiasm about returning to the Rockets . Grateful: He also took the time to thank the Knicks and their fans who helped make him a New York hero . The 23-year-old point guard, undrafted out of Harvard, became an international phenomenon and the biggest story in sports during just one dazzling month in the Big Apple. But the Knicks ultimately decided that the Linsanity fan frenzy was too big for the team's wallet. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey celebrated the re-acquisition on Twitter, saying: 'Welcome to Houston (at)JLin7. We plan to hang on this time. You will love (hash)RedNation.' The Rockets waived Lin after two weeks in their training camp in December. Team owner Leslie Alexander said in a statement late Tuesday that the team was 'thrilled to have Jeremy back.' Back in red: Lin played in two preseason games with the Rockets before he was placed on waivers and scooped up by the Knicks . 'In his limited opportunity last season, Jeremy showed that he has all the skills to be a great player in this league for many years to come,' Alexander said. 'In addition to being a great passer, he is also exceptional at driving to the rim and finishing plays. He also showed a poise well beyond his years by making winning plays at the end of numerous games last season.' Alexander added: 'Jeremy is a winner on and off the court and we view him as an important part of our plan to build a championship contender.' The Knicks said they would match any offer to retain Lin, but the Rockets made it tough for New York to keep him by backloading their offer sheet with a $15 million salary in the third season. If the Knicks agreed to that deal, they would've faced a hefty luxury tax in 2014-15 because of other big contracts on their books - between $30-40 million. One sports consultant said the adjustment to the offer sheet was a stroke of genius by Morey. 'The Rockets deserve a lot of credit for the way they've gone about this,' said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based SportsCorp. 'It was extremely intelligent - with an assassin's touch.' But Houston made the bad move, initially, waiving Lin because it already had Goran Dragic and Kyle Lowry on the roster. The Knicks picked him up and gave him first real shot. He was briefly demoted to the developmental league, recalled and finally got his chance when coach Mike D'Antoni put him in with the Knicks floundering at 8-15. Lin scored a career-high 25 points in a 99-92 win over New Jersey Nets and 'Linsanity' was born. Lin had slept on teammate Landry Fields' couch the night before, still refusing to get his own place as he headed into that week, knowing the Knicks would have to decide whether to cut him or guarantee his contract for the rest of the season. Sensation: Lin helped to turn around what may have been an otherwise miserable season for the New York Knicks . But Lin proved more than just a one-hit wonder - he had 28 and 23 points in his first two NBA starts, and then scored a career-high 38 in a 92-85 victory over Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers. The stock price for Madison Square Garden Inc. surged on the production and popularity of the team's international star. Lin, the NBA's first American-born player of Taiwanese or Chinese descent, also made the Sports Illustrated cover in consecutive weeks, only the 12th athlete to hold that distinction since 1990. On Tuesday, Lin had more than 829,000 followers on Twitter. Star: The stock price for Madison Square Garden Inc. surged on the production and popularity of Lin, who became an international celebrity . The more opponents saw Lin, though, the more they seemed to figure him out as the season wore on. He went 1 for 11 with eight turnovers in a humbling, nationally televised loss in Miami and the Knicks dropped their first six games in March. D'Antoni resigned in mid-March and Lin hurt his left knee less than two weeks later. The Knicks revealed on April 1 that Lin needed surgery to repair a meniscus tear and would miss six weeks. The Knicks made the playoffs behind surging Carmelo Anthony, but bowed out to Miami in the first round. The Rockets, meanwhile, missed the postseason for the third straight year and have spent the offseason completely rebuilding their roster. Houston has been trying to put together a package of assets and draft picks to offer Orlando in exchange for disgruntled All-Star center Dwight Howard. In the process, the Rockets lost the unrestricted free agent Dragic to Phoenix, then traded Lowry to Toronto in exchange for a future first-round pick with lottery protection. With no true point guard left on the roster, the Rockets turned back to Lin. The Knicks showed their hand when they brought back Raymond Felton in a sign-and-trade deal with Portland - after signing Jason Kidd as a free agent. Houston, meanwhile, jumped at the chance to rekindle their popularity in China, where Yao Ming became a larger-than-life figure. Many Rockets landed lucrative shoe . contracts with Chinese companies on Yao's coattails and Rockets' games . drew massive television ratings there. Rising Star: Lin galvanized the struggling Knicks, launching a craze dubbed 'Linsanity' by New York's tabloids . David Schwab, who specializes in matching brands with celebrities as managing director at Octagon First Call, said that while Lin is an American success story, he'll reopen marketing in-roads for Houston during Yao's eight seasons (2002-11). 'Teams base their decisions on wins and losses, because wins and losses ultimately affect ticket sales, sponsorships,' Schwab said. 'I still think it's a win-loss decision, but I think, in their case, it's weighed more as a marketing decision. 'They've got more to gain right now, with a decade of Yao and companies they've done business with. They've got kind of the next frontier there.'

A man in the final stages of terminal cancer wrote his own obituary shortly before he died last week and used the opportunity to come clean about his past. Friends and family of Val Patterson, 59, learned on Sunday that the man they thought held a doctorate from the University of Utah only received the degree thanks to a paperwork mistake. Even more of a surprise was the revelation that the engineer had never even graduated. Humour: Val Patterson, 59, pictured with his wife Mary Jane, wrote his own obituary during the final stages of terminal cancer. He used it to confess to several misdeeds during his lifetime . Mr Patterson, from Salt Lake City, wrote: 'Also, I really am NOT a PhD. 'What happened was that the day I went to pay off my college student loan at the U of U, the girl working there put my receipt into the wrong stack, and two weeks later, a PhD diploma came in the mail. 'I didn't even graduate, I only had about three years of college credit. In fact, I never did even learn what the letters ""PhD"" even stood for. But he had an even bigger shock in store with the confession that he once stole a safe. He wrote: 'As it turns out, I AM the guy who stole the safe from the Motor View Drive Inn back in June 1971.' Back in the 1970s: Friends of Mr Patterson learned on Sunday that the man they thought held a doctorate only received the degree thanks to a paperwork mistake . He also seemed to have a problem with theme parks. He said: 'To Disneyland - you can now throw away that ""Banned for Life"" file you have on me, I'm not a problem anymore - and SeaWorld San Diego, too, if you read this.' The light-hearted obituary was published in the Salt Lake Tribune following his death from throat cancer on July 10. Mr Patterson began writing his own death notice in the first person last year, when it became clear that his medical condition was worsening. His widow, Mary Jane, told local station KSL-TV that the confessions are true. The following obituary was published online for the Salt Lake Tribune and on StarksFuneral.com. Below is an abridged version. I was born in Salt Lake City, March 27 1953. I died of throat cancer on July 10 2012... I had a lot of fun. It was an honour for me to be friends with some truly great people. I thank you. I've had great joy living and playing with my dog, my cats and my parrot. Mr Patterson's light-hearted obituary was published in the Salt Lake Tribune following his death from throat cancer on July 10 . But, the one special thing that made my spirit whole, is my long love and friendship with my remarkable wife, my beloved Mary Jane. I loved her more than I have words to express. Every moment spent with my Mary Jane was time spent wisely. Over time, I became one with her, inseparable, happy, fulfilled. I enjoyed one good life. Travelled to every place on Earth that I ever wanted to go. Had every job that I wanted to have. Learned all that I wanted to learn. Fixed everything I wanted to fix. Eaten everything I wanted to eat. My life motto was: 'Anything for a Laugh.' Now that I have gone to my reward, I have confessions and things I should now say. As it turns out, I AM the guy who stole the safe from the Motor View Drive Inn back in June, 1971. I could have left that unsaid, but I wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I really am NOT a PhD. What happened was that the day I went to pay off my college student loan at the U of U, the girl working there put my receipt into the wrong stack, and two weeks later, a PhD diploma came in the mail. I didn't even graduate, I only had about . three years of college credit. In fact, I never did even learn what the . letters 'PhD' even stood for. Mr Patterson's widow, Mary Jane, told local station KSL-TV that the confessions are true . For all of the Electronic Engineers I have worked with, I'm sorry, but you have to admit my designs always worked very well, and were well engineered, and I always made you laugh at work. Now to that really mean Park Ranger; after all, it was me that rolled those rocks into your geyser and ruined it. I did notice a few years later that you did get Old Faithful working again. To Disneyland - you can now throw away that 'Banned for Life' file you have on me, I'm not a problem anymore - and SeaWorld San Diego, too, if you read this. To the gang: We grew up in the very best time to grow up in the history of America. The best music, muscle cars, cheap gas, fun kegs, buying a car for 'a buck a year' - before Salt Lake got ruined by over population and Lake Powell was brand new. TV was boring back then, so we went outside and actually had lives. We always tried to have as much fun as possible without doing harm to anybody - we did a good job at that... My regret is that I felt invincible when young and smoked cigarettes when I knew they were bad for me. Now, to make it worse, I have robbed my beloved Mary Jane of a decade or more of the two of us growing old together and laughing at all the thousands of simple things that we have come to enjoy and fill our lives with such happy words and moments. My pain is enormous, but it pales in comparison to watching my wife feel my pain as she lovingly cares for and comforts me. I feel such the 'thief' now - for stealing so much from her - there is no pill I can take to erase that pain. If you knew me or not, dear reader, I am happy you got this far into my letter. I speak as a person who had a great life to look back on. My family is following my wishes that I not have a funeral or burial. If you knew me, remember me in your own way. If you want to live forever, then don't stop breathing, like I did. A celebration of life will be held on Sunday July 22 from 4pm to 6pm at Starks Funeral Parlor, 3651 South 900 East, Salt Lake City. Casual dress is encouraged.","Val Patterson, 59, died from throat cancer last week .

The head of G4S stunned MPs yesterday by insisting his company was entitled to a £57million management fee – despite admitting its handling of the Olympic security contract was a 'humiliating shambles'. Nick Buckles was accused of 'making it up as he went along' as he refused to back down on his claim that the private firm deserved to be paid for overseeing the fiasco. But the 51-year-old chief executive did admit he was sorry and 'deeply disappointed' after it failed to deliver on its £284million deal. Scroll down for video... G4S chief executive Nick Buckles, gives evidence on Olympic security staffing to the Home Affairs Select Committee at the House of Commons . 'Amateurish': G4S chief executive Nick Buckles (right) and his colleague Ian Horseman Sewell (left) are driven from the Commons Home Affairs Committee hearing, where MPs slammed their handling of Olympic security . Mr Buckles was forced to promise that . police and the military would be reimbursed for providing thousands of . troops and officers to plug the yawning security gap. During 90 minutes of often . excruciating evidence before the Home Affairs select committee, the G4S . boss said the cost of accommodation for servicemen would also be covered . and bonuses would be paid to military personnel if deemed appropriate. But even as he spoke there were claims . of another fiasco involving the company when just 30 security guards . turned up for work at the Olympic road race cycling venue of Box Hill, . Surrey, instead of the expected 300. And a whistle-blower claimed that . senior Games officials had agreed three months ago to downgrade the . vetting of candidates in a desperate attempt to boost recruiting as it . became clear that G4S was struggling to meet the numbers. Astonishingly, that decision meant . many of those safeguarding sensitive venues have a lower level of . security clearance than some guards on basic  duties away from the . Olympics, watching car parks and empty buildings. The timing raises disturbing questions . for both the organising committee Locog and the Government about . precisely when they were aware of the scale of G4S's recruitment . failings. Under pressure: Mr Buckles, photographed as he was driven away from the hearing, apologised for the security shambles . I'm staying: Nick Buckles told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that he wouldn't resign . Mr Buckles was under intense pressure . to quit his £830,000-a-year job after members of the select committee . ridiculed him and his company's performance. Yet although G4S shares have fallen 17 . per cent, wiping £700million from its market value, he maintained he is . the right man to lead the world's second-largest private-sector . employer. Senior security sources believe . however that it is a matter of when, not if, Mr Buckles will be forced . out but he will not go until after the Games, remaining as a potential . 'fall guy' if there is a major security failure. Mr Buckles repeatedly said the . company still intended to claim its £57million management fee for work . over the past two years, even though it cannot provide anywhere near the . number of guards it had originally promised. 'We've managed the contract and we've . had management on the ground for two years. We still expect to deliver a . significant number of staff to the Olympics.' Committee chairman Keith Vaz said his . stance was 'astonishing' and called on G4S to waive the fee and any . others associated with the contract. 'Shambles': Soldiers man a checkpoint at the Olympic village in Stratford, east London. MPs heard that G4S has only 4,200 staff ready to work at Games venues . The senior Labour MP repeatedly . invited Mr Buckles to consider his position and claimed that G4S's . Olympics performance had been 'unacceptable, incompetent and . amateurish'. Mr Buckles insisted: 'It's not about . me; it's about delivering the contract. I'm the right person to ensure . that happens ... clearly we regret signing the contract, but now we have . to get on and deliver it.' He said there are 4,200 G4S staff . working on the ground on the Olympics and the minimum the company will . deliver is 7,000 – 70 per cent of what they were expected to provide. Labour's David Winnick told the chief executive: 'It's a humiliating shambles, Mr Buckles.' 'I cannot disagree with you,' he . replied. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood said Mr Buckles's performance before . the MPs 'would lead quite a lot of people to despair'. Labour MP Bridget Phillipson told Mr Buckles she was left with the feeling that he was 'making it up as you go along'. Tory MP Michael Ellis added that the . public was 'sick of huge corporations like yours thinking they can get . away with everything'. Mr Buckles said he told Locog on July . 3 that his firm had experienced a shortfall in staff over the previous . weekend, in part due to its scheduling system not working properly. It was monitored daily at meetings . with Locog and the Home Office but it was not until an Olympics Security . Board meeting eight days later – chaired by Charles Farr, director . general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism – that the firm . said it was not going to meet its contract obligations. Mr Buckles refused to comment on whether Mr Farr should have referred the problems to ministers on July 3. He said it was a 'complete and utter . shock' when he was told on July 3, while on holiday in the U.S., that . there would be problems delivering the contract. He returned to the UK the same day, he . said. Mr Buckles conceded that he could not even guarantee how many . security guards would turn up on the first day of the Olympics. Olympic staff are now vetted only to . Baseline Personnel Security Standard, which employers use as a basic . measure to check the trustworthiness of staff. Debacle: Home Secretary Theresa May has appeared before MPs twice in the last week over the row . This entry-level check takes one or . two days to complete and includes a check for convictions on the Police . National Computer. Introduced in 2009, it is the basic level of . clearance for anyone who wants to work in a Government department. It was originally intended that . potential security staff would be checked to the 'industry standard' known as British Standard 7858, which can take up to five months. This involves contacting all previous employers over the past five years. Around 2,000 more servicemen and women . are on standby to protect the Olympics if G4S fails to provide enough . guards by the opening ceremony on July 27. Army, Royal Navy and RAF personnel . have been warned they could be asked at short notice to scrap their . summer holidays to plug any manpower gaps. Filling in: Members of the Armed Forces are shown around the site of the Olympic Park. More service personnel had to be drafted in after G4S failed to provide enough security guards . Shambles: Police officers were called to the main Olympic team hotel in Manchester after only 20 of the expected 58 G4S staff turned up . Crisis: A member of the RAF checks the identification details of two G4S security guards at an exit to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London .

A former Wren has been given a payout by the Ministry of Defence after claiming she suffered sexual discrimination in the Royal Navy. Chief Petty Officer Jacqueline Cartner, . 42, claimed she was passed over for promotion because she refused to . go to sea after rules were changed to allow women on warships. After two years of legal battles, CPO . Cartner, who served at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hants,  has now accepted a confidential payout and signed a gagging . order. The MoD's move has killed off the threat of a legal precedent being set which may have led to dozens more lawsuits costing taxpayers millions of pounds. CPO Cartner chose to retain non-seagoing status when the rules were changed to allow women on warships in 1993. Around 70 per cent of Wrens opted for this status and were assured at the time that it would not harm their promotion prospects. CPO Cartner, who was made an MBE in 2001, felt she was the best candidate for promotion to warrant officer when she went before a promotion board in 2008 as the only female candidate. But she did not get the job and took the navy to an employment tribunal. That ruled the navy discriminated against her on two grounds - directly because she was a woman and indirectly because she had non-seagoing status. The navy appealed against the ruling in December 2010 but lost the part of the appeal relating to discrimination against her non-seagoing status. It did, however, win the right for a re-hearing of evidence that CPO Cartner was directly discriminated against by members of the navy's promotions board solely because she was a woman. HMS Collingwood where Chief Petty Officer Jacqueline Cartner was denied promotion because of her non-seagoing status . Fearing a potential wave of litigation from other ex-wrens, the MoD spent £126,000 fighting the rulings, but the case has now been dropped. A Royal Navy spokeswoman said: 'We are pleased this long-running case has now been concluded by mutual agreement. 'It has been a challenging time for both the MoD and Ms Cartner who gave many years of loyal and high quality service. 'We do wish Ms Cartner and her family well for the future.' Ms Cartner was unable to comment because of the confidentiality order she signed. The navy said it will now review the case to see if 'appropriate lessons' can be learned. Former navy Wren and employment law expert Sue Ball said: 'This looks like a good result for the MoD. 'Litigation is always a risky and uncertain process and if the MoD had gone back to the tribunal again and it went against them it would have set a case law precedent that could have caused them a problem.'","Tribunal ruled she was discriminated against when going for promotion .

Jailed: Lottery winner Gavin Davies from Neath, South Wales, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for attacking his girlfriend . A lottery winner who was today jailed for beating up his girlfriend in one of his luxury cars blamed the attack on the 'strain' of becoming an overnight millionaire. Former professional cage-fighter Gavin Davies, 30, tried to strangle Daniah Hussain, 22, with a car seatbelt because of a row over a shopping trip just three months after winning a £1million jackpot. A court was told Davies blamed the 'sustained assault' on the stress of winning the lottery, moving into a new house and becoming a father. Motoring fan Davies bought three luxury cars since his win - including a Lamborghini LP560-4. Swansea Crown Court heard how Davies . and Miss Hussain were travelling in his 'everyday' car - an Audi - to go . on a luxury shopping trip to spend some of their winnings with . four-month-old baby son Jayden. But . the pair started arguing when Davies tried to back out of the family . shopping day because he had meetings with financial advisors to discuss . how to invest his fortune. Swansea . Crown Court heard Davies pulled over and tried to strangle Miss Hussain . with the Audi’s seatbelt, telling her: 'If you don’t shut up, I will . shut you up.' Prosecutor . James Jenkins said: 'They were bickering and arguing from the outset of . their journey. Davies pulled into a layby and told her to get out. But she refused because the baby was in the back. 'Davies loosened the seatbelt around her neck and started to strangle her with it. She froze in fear.' Former cage-fighter Davies, pictured with a Lamborghini similar to the one he later bought with his winnings, tried to strangle Daniah Hussain, 22, with a car sealtbelt . High life: Davies blamed his behaviour on the 'strain' of becoming an overnight millionaire, new father and moving house . The court heard Davies stopped his assault and the couple then carried on with their journey to a retail park - with Miss Hussain wrapping a blue baby blanket around her neck to hide the marks. Mr Jenkins said: 'Davies told her she could have anything she wanted.' But during the journey Davies attacked Miss Hussain again - 'repeatedly striking' her as she sat in the passenger seat. Mr Jenkins said: 'He punched her repeatedly, held her head with his hands and brought it down onto the steering wheel. 'He was striking her while he was driving and put his teeth around her nose. 'Miss Hussain said he was so angry his face was red and beads of sweat ran down his forehead.' Happier times: Speaking after his win in January, Davies said he planned to spend his 'money wisely' The court heard Davies drove past a police station at Neath, near Swansea, where Miss Hussain shouted for help. Davies was arrested later at his mother’s home after his girlfriend dialled 999 to report the attack. Mr Jenkins said she needed to have general anaesthetic for surgery to realign her nose. Davies blamed Miss Hussain’s 'hormones' and post natal depression for the row in April this year. He told police that he was trying to restrain her because her behaviour was endangering other road users. Frank . Phillips, defending, said: 'He blames his behaviour on the strain of . becoming a new father, winning the lottery and moving house. 'They were very unpleasant injuries but not of a serious nature.' Davies accepted he had repeatedly punched his girlfriend - but denied it was as many as 50 times nor that he had spat. Davies admitted causing actual bodily harm in April in the car assault. He also admitted a charge common assault in December - before the lotto win - when he 'repeatedly pushed her face into a settee'. He was jailed for 16 months. Miss Hussain has left the couple’s new home and is living at a secret address in the area. Swansea Crown Court heard Davies had previous convictions for motoring offences. Davies was revealed as the £1 million National Lottery raffle winner at a press conference in a plush Swansea hotel in January. He was pictured alongside a Lamborghini provide for the day by lottery operator Camelot. But he was soon seen driving around his hometown in his own Lamborghini and his new Audi. At Court: Judge Mr Justice Spencer told Davies at Swansea Crown court, pictured above, that he carried out a 'nasty and prolonged assault' on his vulnerable partner in front of their son . At the time of the win, Davies said: 'I want to look after my son and look after my family. I’m going to use the money wisely and invest. 'I won’t waste a penny. Time will tell, but hopefully, you will see me one day with £10 million. 'The Lamborghini is my fun out of the way. The rest of the money is to look after my family.' As well as being jailed for 16 months Davies, of Ammanford, near Swansea, was placed under a indefinite restraining order to keep away from Miss Hussain and her family. Judge Mr Justice Spencer, who described the incident as a 'sustained assault', told him: 'It was a nasty and prolonged assault on your vulnerable partner in front of your baby son. 'You were subject to unusual stress having just won the lottery and becoming a new father. 'But you were seeking to exercise control over her both physically and emotionally.'","Gavin Davies, 30, attacked his girlfriend Daniah Hussain, 22, just three months after winning £1m on the lottery .

Female beach volleyball players yesterday vowed that they would keep wearing their bikinis – despite admitting it was ‘upsetting’ that the sport was known only for skimpy outfits. Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin, who form part of Britain’s first ever Olympic beach volleyball team, said bikinis were still the best kit for the sport, despite rule changes which would allow them to cover up if they wished. ‘It’s perfect for our sport,’ Miss Mullin, 27, said. ‘We play in hot countries and I can’t imagine wearing anything else on the sand. I will still be wearing my bikini.’ Practical: Volleyball players Shauna Mullin and Zara Dampney will keep their revealing bikini outfits as they are 'perfect for the sport', but may be forced into long-sleeved top (right) and shorts if the weather turns . The players said their family and friends hated the fact that they were recognised only for wearing bikinis. ‘They find it really upsetting,’ Miss . Mullin said. ‘They say to me, “How can they still be talking about your . bikinis? Don’t they understand how hard you work?” ‘I try and tell them it will change . eventually. But yes, it does upset them.’  Miss Mullin said that . whenever the team played, most of the men who attended were there only . to see girls in bikinis. ‘It doesn’t really bother me, but I hope they go home with a different attitude once they see us play,’ she said.

"By . Associated Press and Thomas Durante . PUBLISHED: . 08:01 EST, 23 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:04 EST, 23 July 2012 . Penn State has been forced to surrender $60million in fines, serve a four-year ban on appearing in bowl games and must surrender all wins between 1998 and 2011 following months of turmoil resulting from the appalling Jerry Sandusky child sex scandal. The punishments against the football team by the NCAA stunned the PSU campus, where students could be seen in shock while watching the announcement on TV. The NCAA's actions also . include a five-year probation and a reduction of scholarships for the . next four, NCAA president Mark Emmert announced during a press . conference in Indianapolis. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Workers gutted the location of the Joe Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium on Sunday morning, the day before the NCAA sanctions were announced . Guilty: Penn State's storied football programme is now marred by decades of sexual abuse by former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted last month . Ed Ray, the chairman of the NCAA executive committee, called the Penn State scandal a 'stern wake up call for everyone involved in college sports.' The university’s storied football programme is now marred by decades of Sandusky's sexual abuse of young boys, some of which had occurred in Penn State facilities the like locker room showers. The NCAA said the $60million figure is equivalent . to the annual gross revenue of the football program. The money must be . paid into an endowment for external programs preventing child sexual . abuse or assisting victims and may not be used to fund such programs at . Penn State. Sadness: Some of those gathered to watch the NCAA announcement were stunned as the sanctions against Penn State were revealed . Response: Penn State students and others react as the NCAA sanctions were announced . 'Football will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing and protecting young people,' Mr Emmert said. He . added: 'All involved in intercollegiate athletics must be watchful that . programs and individuals do not overwhelm the values of higher . education. 'In the Penn State case, the results were perverse and . unconscionable.' Penn State will also be forced to give up 20 scholarships each year for four years. Earlier in the press conference, Mr Emmert said he had 'never seen anything as egregious' as the horrific crimes of Sandusky and the efforts of head coach Joe Paterno and others at the university - including former Penn State President Graham Spanier and athletic director Tim Curley - to hide it. Paterno's role in covering up the scandal was detailed in the report of former FBI director Louis Freeh, which was released this month. The NCAA decided . not to invoke its so-called 'death penalty,' a ban on competing in a . sport - a move it has made five times before. In surrendering all wins from 1998-2011, the NCAA undid 111 victories of Joe Paterno - who coached the team for nearly 50 years. Once the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history, Paterno will now be No. 5 on the list. Former Florida State coach Bobby . Bowden will now hold the top spot in the NCAA Division I record book . with 377 wins. Paterno will now be credited with 298 wins. In a statement released on Monday afternoon, the Paterno family said: 'The NCAA has become the latest party to accept the [Freeh] report as the final word on the Sandusky scandal. 'The sanctions announced by the NCAA today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best.' The scholarship reductions mean that Penn State's roster will be capped at 65 scholarship players within a couple of seasons. Enforcers: NCAA President Mark Emmert, right, gestures during a news conference as Ed Ray, NCAA Executive Committee chair and Oregon State University president, looks on at left . On edge: The potential for a historic NCAA penalty also is worrisome for a region where the economy is built at least partially on the strength and popularity of the football program . The normal scholarship limit for major college football programs is 85. Emmert said that Penn State signed a consent decree, accepting the NCAA's punishment and agreeing not to appeal its decision. Not long after the NCAA announcement, the Big Ten Conference - to which Penn State belongs - declared its own punishment against the school. The conference announced that the university will not be allowed to share in the $13million bowl revenue during its postseason ban. Instead, the Big Ten will donate the funds to charity. The NCAA penalty also is worrisome for a region where the economy is built at least partially on the strength and popularity of the football program . Concern: Penn State student Laura Lovins and others listen announcement of their school's punishment in the wake of a child sex scandal . Staying or going? Current Penn State football players, pictured on Monday at the university, have been given the option to transfer to other schools . Kayla Weaver, a Penn State senior and . member of the dance team called the Lionettes, said an NCAA death . penalty would not only make football players transfer, but it also would . force program changes for cheerleaders, dancers and band members, and . would hurt season-ticket holders. 'It could ruin everything that we've built here,' said Weaver, from Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. Added Derek Leonard, a 31-year-old university construction project coordinator who grew up in the area: 'It's going to kill our town.' Sandusky was convicted last month of using his high-profile position with Penn State football to rape and molest young boys and is currently awaiting sentencing. He faces up to 500 years in prison. Removal: The Paterno statue was surrounded by a fence and a tarp before it was taken down by construction workers on Sunday . Team in turmoil: The punitive measures against Penn State will likely impact the team severely in the years ahead . Under Paterno, the team was built into a national power under the slogan of 'success with honour.' But that honour ended with disgrace for Paterno, who was fired in November after nearly 50 years of coaching. He died of lung cancer in January. As part of the NCAA sanctions against the Penn State football program, the university is forced to give up each of the victories it earned between 1998-2011. For former head coach Joe Paterno, who was fired in November and died in January, 111 of his wins have now been undone. That drops Paterno's win total down to 298, dropping him down from No. 1 to No. 5 on the list of winningest Division I Football Bowl Subdivision coaches. Retired Florida State coach Bobby Bowden now takes Paterno's place. Yesterday, the university tore down a statue of Paterno that stood outside Beaver Stadium. Yesterday, . workers lifted a massive statue of Paterno off its base and used . a forklift to move it into Beaver Stadium early on Sunday morning. As the statue was removed, 100 to 150 students who had gathered around chanted: 'We are Penn State.' The university announced that it was going to take down the monument in the wake of an investigative report that found the late coach and three other top Penn State administrators concealed sex abuse claims against retired assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Paterno coached the team for 46 years before he was fired last year at the height of the Sandusky case. The statue turned into a target for Paterno’s critics after former FBI Director Louis Freeh alleged a cover-up by Paterno and others that allowed Sandusky to continue molesting boys. Police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue. In a statement on Sunday morning, the Paterno reacted to the removal of the statue, saying: 'Tearing down the statue of Joe Paterno does not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State Community. We believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth.' Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach . Reaction: Some students and State College residents could not contain their emotions as they saw Beaver Stadium without the statue . The family also chided the media for what they called one-sided reporting on a document that Paterno is unable to defend himself against. 'The Freeh report, though it has been accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the Sandusky scandal, is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that.' Penn State President Rod Erickson said Paterno's name will remain on the campus library because it 'symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the Paterno family has made to Penn State University.' Farewell: Workers are seen carting away the covered statue of ex-Penn State football coach Joe Paterno on Sunday morning . Bill O'Brien, who was hired to replace Paterno, now faces the task of building the team with severe limitations, and trying to keep current players from fleeing to other schools, which the NCAA says they are free to do. Star players such as tailback Silas Redd and linebacker Gerald Hodges are now essentially free agents. O'Brien said: 'I knew when I accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead.

Footage is set to be released of OJ Simpson as he tried to restart his career with a promotional tour of nightclubs and concerts following his acquittal of his ex-wife Nicole Brown's murder. The film, called The Unpromotable, is cut from 70 hours of footage taken by his one-time promoter while they toured the U.S. in 2001. It was put together by Norman Pardo, 51, who took on the task of trying to change the public perception of the former football hero following the sensational trial in 1995. Reinvention: OJ Simpson poses with fans at a hip-hop concert in Estero, Florida in 2001 after he was acquitted of ex-wife Nicole Brown's murder . Campaign: Simpson with his promoter Norman Pardo in 2001. Pardo has made a film about their time working together called The Unpromotable . Simpson walked free after being found not guilty of murdering Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles in 1994. Simpson is currently in jail after he was convicted in 2008 of charges including kidnapping and armed robbery following an incident in a Las Vegas casino hotel room with two memorabilia dealers. The NFL Hall of Famer, 64, was sentenced in December 2008 and faces up to 33 years behind bars. Talking about his film project, Pardo told the New York Daily News: 'It’s him with girls all over him in clubs. It doesn’t show him in a great light, (but) in both lights. I do show what it’s like to work with him.' Justice: OJ Simpson was jailed in 2008 in Las Vegas on kidnapping and armed robbery charges . Mystery: OJ Simpson with his wife Nicole. Her murder has never been solved after her ex-husband was acquitted . Pardo toured 35 states with Simpson who he said was in complete denial as to how the public viewed him. The promoter added that he was sent death threats after taking on Simpson as a client. The film will not be released until after the presidential elections in November. Simpson has reportedly ordered that its opening be postponed because the movie has racial undertones and he doesn't want to affect President Obama's chances. In June 1994, Simpson's ex-wife Nicole was found stabbed multiple times in the head and neck outside her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Her friend Ronald Goldman was also fatally stabbed. In 1995, Simpson was tried on two counts of murder to which he pleaded not guilty. The trial, for which Simpson had hired a powerful defense team led by Johnnie Cochran, ended with Simpson being found not guilty. The 'trial of the century' as it was dubbed was watched live on TV by more than half of Americans. At a later civil trial in 1997, a judgement was awarded against Simpson for the wrongful deaths of Brown and Goldman and he was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.","Film called The Unpromotable made with footage from 2001 .

Moody's took the first step toward stripping Germany of its coveted AAA credit rating yesterday by cutting the outlook for Europe's largest and most pivotal economy to 'negative.' The FTSE came under pressure as the ratings agency lowered Germany's credit outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' in a stark warning that no one is immune to the eurozone problems. A similar move was announced for fellow AAA ranked economies, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Downgraded: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Moody's has downgraded Germany's coveted AAA credit rating to 'negative' and a similar move was announced for the Netherlands and Luxembourg . Moody's said all three nations faced . risks from Greece leaving the eurozone and from the need to stump up . cash for potential bailouts for Spain and Italy. Last night, the German government downplayed the decision with the finance ministry noting in a statement it had kept Germany's AAA credit rating the highest . possible. The impact of the move reverberated around the London markets this morning when the FTSE 100 Index fell 12.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,521.54 points but it has since appeared to stabilise in early trading. Yesterday, it slumped by 2.1 per cent after a pounding which wiped £30 billion . from its value amid concerns over Spain and Greece. Bad news: Credit ratings were downgraded for fellow AAA ranked economies, the Netherlands and Luxembourg . The German government said the risks cited . by Moody's weren't new and were largely based on a short-term . assessment. It said Germany 'remains in a very solid economic and . financial situation.' The . ministry said it had 'taken note of Moody's opinion' while stating the . 'estimate' put the focus 'on short-term risks, while stability prospects . in the long term are not mentioned.' 'The eurozone has initiated a series of measures which should lead to the durable stabilising of the zone,' the ministry said. 'Germany itself is in a solid economic and financial situation,' it insisted in a statement. Moody's rationale for the downgrade appeared to hinge on a likely deepening of the crisis, which appeared to be reaching a fresh denouement Monday as Spanish borrowing costs soared and Greek reforms were on the rocks. 'The level of uncertainty about the outlook for the euro area, and the potential impact of plausible scenarios on member states, are no longer consistent with stable outlooks,' Moody's said. Even if Greece survives, the agency warned that richer nations would likely shoulder greater burdens in future. 'The continued deterioration in Spain and Italy's macroeconomic and funding environment has increased the risk that they will require some kind of external support.' That would send the eurozone crisis to a different level, it said. 'Spain's economy and government bond market is around double the combined size of those of Greece, Portugal and Ireland,' Moody's said referring to the three already bailed-out eurozone nations. While Berlin has, until now, been largely unscathed by the crisis -- borrowing at below zero percent interest -- it has been at the very center of Europe's political storm. Downplayed: The Reichstag building, seat of the German lower house of parliament Bundestag. The German government insisted last night that its economy remains 'in a very solid financial and economic situation' The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly been frequently criticized for its austerity-first approach and for not getting ahead of the crisis. Moody's reiterated those concerns, . pointing to a 'reactive and gradualist policy response' by European . leaders as cause of concern. Germany, . which is reluctant to have its taxpayers on the hook for profligate . spending in southern Europe said it would 'do all it can with its . partners to overcome the European debt crisis as quickly as possible.' Moody's also announced that Finland's AAA rating and outlook were unchanged. It came after a turbulent day for . the single currency bloc which yesterday saw the yield on 10-year Spanish bond . hit euro-era highs of 7.5 per cent as it became increasingly likely that the . country would need an EU bailout.

A grandmother received a terrifying letter from Joseph Harry Brown, posing as another prisoner, which threatened to rape her grandchildren unless she sent him £50. (Posed by model) This letter was one of many unpleasant threats made by 41-year-old Brown, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP). He had committed a series of offences since being refused parole - just some of the 113 offences on Brown's criminal record, which include arson assault and robbery. Brown once took another prisoner hostage by tying him up, assaulting him and setting fire to his cell. He set fire to another cell after being transferred to Preston Prison.Brown, of no fixed abode, admitted the charges of false imprisonment, making threats to kill, assault by beating, blackmail and two charges of arson. These charges took place between January and March this year.Brown did not attempt to defend the charges against him.

'He accepts he committed these offences and knows he faces a lengthy sentence.' Judge Michael Cartlidge handed Brown another IPP and said the prisoner would not be considered for parole until he has served another seven-and-a-half years in jail. He said: 'It seems you think your life is hopeless after your parole was refused. 'That is a tragedy in itself. 'It also seems you are determined to spend the rest of your life in prison.

Levi Aron, the 'butcher of Brooklyn', is expected to plead guilty next week after he admitted to the murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky who was abducted last July. The deal on the table means that 36-year-old Aron will be sentenced to 40 years to life and never be released. Aron, is accused of . smothering and dismembering Leiby after snatching him in a Hasidic neighborhood of Brooklyn on July 11, 2011. The eight-year-old had been walking home alone for the first time, when he got lost and stopped to ask Aron for directions. Jailed for life: Levi Aron, 36, accepted a plea deal for the kidnap, murder and dismemberment of Leiby Kletzky last July . Under the deal, Aron would enter a guilty plea to murder, receiving up to life in prison, plus another 15 years for kidnap. He is due back in the Supreme Court of Brooklyn on August 9. Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has been speaking on behalf of the Kletzky family, told the New York Daily News: 'The family has to live with this for the rest of their lives. They want to bring this to a conclusion. Brutal killing: Leiby Kletzky, 8, was walking home alone for the first time last July when he was snatched from the street . 'The idea of having a trial was not something that they wanted to go through. They want to make sure that there is justice.' However Mr Hikind added that until the deal was officially announced, there was the possibility that a trial could go ahead if Aron changed his mind. There was no comment from Aron's defense lawyers on the expected plea deal. Last July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from a yeshiva - religious day camp - and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help. It was the first time the child had been allowed to walk home alone. He was supposed to walk just seven blocks to . meet his mother but missed a turn. Aron, . a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home where they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said. Leiby remained there the next day when Aron went to work - and a frantic search was taking place in the community for the lost boy. It is then believed that Aron smothered the boy and dismembered his body. The confessed killer told detectives his victim put up a struggle and that afterwards he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for what he did’. Heavy matters: Levi Aron, the confessed killer of an 8-year-old Hasidic boy, has gained a significant amount of weight while in jail at Rikers .

Though Yankees player Derek Jeter's love life typically places him in the gossip columns, on Thursday it seemed that the baseball star's personal issues had taken a bizarre twist - thanks to unknown web hackers. The Facebook page for Jeter's team posted a surprising announcement that the famed shortstop would be benched for the rest of the season because of a sex change operation. 'We regret to inform our fans that Derek Jeter will miss the rest of the season with sexual reassignment surgery,' the post began. Not on the bench: Derek Jeter was the subject of a Facebook hacking on Thursday . Fictitious announcement: The hacked post was live around 4pm on Thursday on the Yankees official Facebook page . As if the announcement did not immediately ring true to fans, the second line was sure to catch their attention as it alleged that Jeter would honor a Yankee great in doing so. 'He promises to come back stronger than ever in 2013 as Minnie Mantlez,' the post read, referring to the legendary center fielder Mickey Mantle. The New York Daily News explained that while the team spokesmen have not made any statements about the hacking, they are not the ones responsible for the site. The official Facebook pages for all professional baseball teams are managed by MLB Advanced Media. 'For a brief moment today, a few MLB Club Facebook accounts were hacked and inappropriate material was briefly on display from those Clubs' pages on Facebook,' the company's statement read. 'MLB Advanced Media oversees these Facebook pages on behalf of the Clubs and regrets this occurrence.' Political postings: Nine different baseball teams had their Facebook pages hacked, including the President's favorite Chicago White Sox . Picking sides: The White Sox prankster favored Romney (left) over Obama (right) Jeter was not the only target of the hacker, as the Facebook pages of the San Francisco Giants, Washington Redskins, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Atlanta Braves, and both the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox also had inappropriate postings on Thursday. For the Chicago teams, hackers turned their attentions to high-profile supporters. The Cubs page said bluntly 'F*** Bill Murray', a reference to the Holywood star who is one of the perenially struggling team's most famous fans. The posting on the Sox page turned political, as Deadspin reported that it read 'Everyone knows President Obama is a die hard ChiSox Fan. Unfortunately, we're voting for Romney. #MuslimPresident'. Offensive: The Padres posting singled out the handicapped fans of the baseball team . Dangerous: The youngsters planning to attend Thursday's Marlins game had hopes dashed that they would be able to take home rescued fighting pitbulls . The Miami Marlins' hacked post promised that children who planned to attend tonight's games would be awarded a 'free rescued fighting Pitbull courtesy of the Dade County Animal Rescue League'. While the hacking may have shattered the hopes of many children, the posting for the San Diego Padres offended many of their audience members by saying that handicapped individuals were 'STRONGLY DISCOURAGED' from attending their games.

The country currently has four medals - two golds in men's weightlifting, one in women's judo and a bronze in women's weightlifting. However there is likely to be some upset for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - as currently in fourth place is South Korea. Sporting prowess: Kim Un Guk celebrates his world record and winning gold in the 62kg weightlifting. North Korea is currently fifth in the Olympic medal table . Currently at the top of the Olympics medal table is China, followed by the U.S. and then France. Some of the medal winners have heaped praise on Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un for their success. Kim Un Guk, who set an Olympic record and took gold in the 62kg weightlifting, said: 'I won first place because the shining supreme commander Kim Jong-Un gave me power and courage.' North Korea's state media has gone into overdrive over the nation's unexpected success, publishing a glut of stories on the Central News Agency. One report from Pyongyang said: 'Some evil-minded foreign media asserted that the DPRK would . take only one silver medal but our sportspersons refuted such assertions . with good results. Emotional display: North Korea's An Kum Ae cries as she celebrates her gold medal victory in judo (left) as a victorious Yun Chol Om of DPR Korea take gold in men's 56kg weightlifting . 'The hostile forces had better try hard to get a correct understanding of the DPRK.' Good sport: North Korea's winning athletes thanked 'shining supreme commander' Kim Jong-Un for instilling them with power and courage . One dampener to the triumph came today however after the U.S. women's soccer team beat North Korea 1-0. Embracing . the Olympic spirit and leaving aside political differences, both teams . played ping-pong together at their hotel ahead of the match. U.S. player Shannon Boxx said: 'We were in the same hotel as them and the . girls were great... We played ping-pong and stuff like that.' The Americans won the match thanks to a 25th-minute goal from striker Abby Wambach. After the game Wambach also commented on the political tension between the two countries, saying: 'The beautiful part about what we're doing and it being the Olympics is we don't have to worry about that. 'This is where we can put our differences aside, go out on the pitch and play for glory and that's what we're here for.' The North Koreans' feelings were harder to gauge. The players left the stadium without talking to journalists and coach Sin Ui Gun responded cautiously to questions, speaking through an interpreter. Sin said: 'We are all thinking that against USA we shouldn't lose, we should win.' Pressed by a reporter on whether it was more disappointing to lose against the United States than against other teams, the coach nodded gravely but said nothing. Last week, the North Korea women's soccer team walked off the pitch before a match because giant screens accidentally displayed the flag of South Korea. However today's match got off to a smooth start. Domination: United States' Abby Wambach scores against North Korea during the match on Tuesday . The north of England was the scene of North Korea's greatest sporting triumph abroad, during the 1966 World Cup, when the men's soccer team knocked out favorites Italy in one of the greatest upsets ever. But history was not repeated on Tuesday as the American team, the defending Olympic champions, dominated. North Korean athletes have won a total of 47 Olympic medals since the country began appearing at the Games in 1964. In Beijing in 2008, the country's total haul was six medals - two gold, one silver and three bronze. North Korea's women footballers walked off in protest before their match with Colombia last week when the flag of bitter rivals South Korea was mistakenly shown on the big screen in Scotland's Hampden Park. The North Koreans were only persuaded to play the match an hour later once the foul-up had been rectified. North Korea went on to win the warm-up match 2-0, but coach Gun Sin Ui stressed the gravity of the incident and said he planned to take up the matter with Games organisers Locog and FIFA. Gaffe: The South Korean Flag is shown next to a North Korea player before the match against Colombia which had to be delayed after the North Koreans refused to play . Mr Ui said: 'The national flag difference is a big problem. Our team was not going to participate unless the problem was solved properly. 'Unfortunately it took some time later for the broadcast to be done again properly and we made the decision to go on with the match.' North and South Korea are neighbours but have a far from harmonious relationship. The countries were formally established . as separate entities in 1948, and the Korean War began in 1950. The . animosity continues today and the two countries share the world's most . heavily fortified border. Anger: North Korean official Son Kwang Ho (second right) points furiously after the flag of arch-rivals South Korea is shown next to his players' faces by mistake . Hampden Park organisers had no input in the video, which introduced North Korea's side by showing a South Korean player and flag, according to BBC Scotland. It has since emerged that the blunder has been blamed on an Olympic official who sent the big screen video package introducing players from London to Hampden. Locog has refused to name the person responsible, but the official in question has since offered their resignation, according to the Telegraph. Games organisers have issued an apology over the incident, while Prime Minster David Cameron said was an 'honest mistake'.

The U.S. Secretary of State was due to depart from the southern African state when the insects sparked panic among her detail. Mrs Clinton ran for cover and boarded her jet before flying out of Kamuzu International Airport in the capital, Lilongwe, to Johannesburg, South Africa. On arrival: A girl hands flowers to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as she arrives at Lilongwe Kamuzu International Airport in Malawi. Six hours later she was attacked by a swarm of bees . It brought a swift end to her historic six-and-half hour diplomatic mission, which is part of a whistlestop 11-day African tour. According to eye witnesses, scores of . both Malawians and Americans including security agents scampered in . different directions to take cover. 'There was a slight panic as . the bees winged across the airport. People could be seen running away to . keep cover as the Secretary of State swiftly boarded her plane to avoid . any stings,' a witness told the Nyasa Times. A State Department official didn't respond to an immediate inquiry about the accounts. Mrs Clinton undertook three engagements in Malawi which . included holding bilateral talks with President Joyce Banda at the State . House. She also congratulated Banda, one of only two female . heads of state in Africa, for pulling her impoverished country back from . the economic brink after a political crisis.

An elementary school teacher named as a person of interest in the abduction of a boy in 1989 has said the police investigation violates his rights. Dan Rassier, 56, has written to state officials to complain about how police have treated him and his family, along with criticizing how the investigation has been handled into the disappearance of Jacob Wetterling more than two decades ago. Jacob was 11 when he was abducted on October . 22, 1989, by a masked gunman at the end of Rassier's driveway in St . Joseph, 80 miles from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The boy has never been found. Scroll down for video . Scrutiny: Dan Rassier, 56, complained that police have harassed him for two decades over a missing boy who disappeared at the end of his driveway in St Joseph, Minnesota . Rassier was home alone at the . time. He has been questioned multiple times but his name didn't come . out publicly until 2010, when authorities searched his family farm over . two-day period. He still lives at the property with his elderly parents who he says have been put under a massive strain by the continual spotlight. Investigators have examined tens of . thousands of leads but there have been no arrests in the case that drew . national attention and led to changes in sex offender registration laws. This is the first time Rassier, an elementary school music teacher, has put his complaints in writing. When asked why he did so after all this time, he said: 'They are just going to keep me kind of on this lifeline dangling there forever, and I want that to stop.' Forensic tests on items taken from the 2010 search have yielded no evidence linking them to the crime but . investigators were still testing some items. Rassier, who says he is innocent, has not been cleared. In the letter, which was sent to 14 . departments and agencies, he wrote: 'Is it considered legal for law . enforcement to give the public the perception I am guilty of something . when I'm not? Never found: Jacob Wetterling, 11, disappeared in 1989 in rural Minnesota but no arrests have ever been made in the case . 'To destroy our family's name the way they did because they had a ""Hunch!"" is in itself, a serious crime. Nothing can make it right now. 'The damage has been done. But to leave the whole thing open to speculation and open to the public's imagination is just wrong!' In his letter, Rassier also . complained that authorities have not returned his property or listened . to details he is offering about what he witnessed the night Jacob was . taken. Like any unsolved crime, Jacob Wetterling and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth. Letter of Dan Rassier . Stearns County . Sheriff John Sanner is among a handful of people named in the letter. The sheriff . said that he hadn't seen it but couldn't comment regardless because the . investigation into the boy's abduction is still active. Sanner . said authorities have put a tremendous amount of resources into solving . the case, and added: 'I won't be happy until we resolve the case. I'm . not satisfied until that happens.' Authorities have not elaborated on what prompted them to search Rassier's family farm two years ago, saying only that they had probable cause. Rassier said he mailed the letter on Wednesday to 14 different agencies or state officials, including the Department of Public Safety, the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training, the Board on Judicial Standards, as well as the Stearns County administrator and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, Representative Michele Bachmann and Governor Mark Dayton. The Associated Press reached out to all 14 people to whom Rassier sent the letter. As of Thursday, no one confirmed that the letter had been received. Rassier said if nothing else comes of the complaints he's lodging, at least he spoke out about what he perceived to be problems with the investigation. He wrote: 'Like any unsolved crime, Jacob Wetterling and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth.' Jacob's mother Patty Wetterling said the family was out of town and hadn't seen Rassier's letter. She declined to comment.","Dan Rassier, 56, wrote to 14 state officials including Michele Bachmann and Governor Mark Dayton saying his family name has been destroyed .

An Oregon school bus driver has won the right to fly a Confederate Flag emblazoned with the word 'redneck' from his truck  as he drives to work - after a court ruled school administrators who banned it were violating the Constitution's First Amendment. Kenneth Webber, 28, filed a freedom-of-speech suit against Oregon's Jackson County School District 4, and reportedly won the first round of legal sallies when a federal magistrate  recommended on Thursday the case proceed to trial. 'The law governing Webber's First Amendment rights is clearly established,' Magistrate Judge Mark Clarke reportedly concluded. 'The display of a flag is an act of symbolic expression protected under the First Amendment.' Kenneth Webber proudly displays the Confederate flag emblazoned with the word ""Redneck'' that got him fired from an Oregon school district . A second federal judge - who will potentially preside over Webber v. First Student, Inc. at trial - must now decide whether to accept Clarke's recommendation and schedule the matter for a courtroom proceeding, The Christian Science Monitor reported. As for Webber, he defiantly declared to The Associated Press, 'My flag will fly. No one here is gonna tell me what I can and can't believe in.' The imbroglio began in February 2011 when district Superintendent Ben Bergreen first noticed the iconic Confederate battle flag prominently hoisted atop the CB antenna protruding heavenward from Webber’s pick-up truck. The maker of the flag had emblazoned the word, 'Redneck' across its breadth. Webber reportedly said his father had made a birthday gift of it to him in 2009. 'My flag will fly. No one here is gonna tell me what I can and can't believe in.' Webber, who resides in Medford, is an affable, portly sort and married father of four, who had driven for First Student, Inc., a contracted bus provider to the K-to-12 school district in Jackson County, for the previous four years. Specifically, Webber drove a kindergarten bus for Talent Elementary School. He attends nearby Rogue Community College and harbors hopes of one day getting a degree in juvenile corrections. On one of his ample arms, he sports an American flag and the words '100 per cent American.' On his other, beefy limb, a second tattoo features tears bleeding into a Confederate flag along the words 'Pure Redneck.' 'I believe in God and know he'll get us through this,' he reportedly said last year. After noticing the flag, Superintendent Bergreen ordered First Student, Inc. bosses to force Webber to surrender it, or else park in a public spot somewhere off school grounds. The district owns the bus yard where Webber had been parking his personal vehicle, and leases it to First Student, Inc. Like the classic characters on the hit T.V. show, The Dukes of Hazzard, Webber claims he is a tried-and-true 'Red Neck' 'The fact is, our district is about 37 per cent minority students,' Bergreen told the AP in 2011. 'It's fairly common knowledge that the Confederate battle flag is perceived by folks as a racist or negative symbol. The Southern Poverty Law Center said more than 500 extremist groups use it as one of their symbols.'We have a policy,' he added. 'It's about displaying symbols on school property that were racist, or had (the) potential to be seen as racist.' But Webber complained that the nearest public spot was one mile's walk to the bus yard, and so he refused.  Supervisors first suspended him for his intransigence; then fired him over it. Webber feels the issue is one of principle. Born in Riverside, Calif., Webber regaled an AP reporter about how his family moved around the country as his father was transferred from Air Force base to Air Force base, until they settled in Southern Oregon when he was 11. Like Webber's beloved pick-up truck, The Dukes' favored mode of transportation, The General Lee, also sported a huge Confederate flag . As children, he and friends considered themselves 'backyard rednecks.' They hunted, fished, roamed the mountains, and drove ATVs in the mud. He dropped out of high school before tackling corrections in college. Webber said flying the flag had nothing to do with racism, extremist groups or politics. 'When you've got the word 'Redneck' going straight across (the flag), it takes away that whole thing (about racism),' Webber said. 'It's just about standing up for what you . believe in. This is one thing I'm doing. It ain't coming down.' Magistrate Clarke said in his ruling that he found no evidence the flag had disrupted school operations, or that any of the district's students had even laid eyes on Webber's flag while it flew atop his parked truck in the bus yard. 'When you've got the word 'Redneck' going straight across (the flag), it takes away that whole thing (about racism). It's just about standing up for what you . believe in. This is one thing I'm doing. It ain't coming down.' 'The U.S. Supreme Court has held that it is ‘a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment... that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds (it) offensive or disagreeable,’' said John Whitehead, whose Rutherford Institute is representing Webber in his legal plight, to the AP. 'Ken Webber’s case is a clear example of what happens when free speech and political correctness collide.' 'I work for what I have,' Webber said.  'I support my family. It's just who I am. I'm a redneck. It's a way of life.'","School bus driver Kenneth Webber dismissed for refusing to stow Confederate flag from personal vehicle .

"By . Phil Vinter . PUBLISHED: . 08:16 EST, 6 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:02 EST, 6 August 2012 . An anti-circumcision group is holding a string of vociferous street protests in Canada to try and get the controversial procedure outlawed. The Candian Foreskin Awareness Project claims to be the country's 'feistiest' pro-foreskin advocacy group. On its website it states its aim as being to give the human right of all children—male, female and intersex—to 'grow up with intact genitals'. Over the weekend demonstrations were staged across the city of Vancouver in British Colombia as campaigners stepped up their efforts to change the law. Vocal protests took place outside a circumcision clinic and beside the College of Physicians and Surgeons and on Saturday night, there was an educational seminar extolling the virtues of foreskin. Passionate: Glen Callender speaks at a rally for the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project. He tells supporters: 'I'm here today because I love my foreskin. Why do I love my foreskin? Because it is the most enjoyable part of my entire body' In a video of one of the rally's group leader Glen Callender tells placard-waving supporters: 'I'm here today because I love my foreskin. Why do I love my foreskin? Because it is the most enjoyable part of my entire body. Later in an interview Mr Callender added: 'What our group is trying to do is extend the rights that girls already have - to be protected against any mutilation until they are 18 to boys and intersex kids.' The protests coincided with Vancouver’s Pride parade, and on Sunday a pants-optional Foreskin Pride contingent marched in the main parade. The events finished with a demonstration at Sunset Beach of which kind of fruit can be picked up with an uncircumcised penis - the answer being grapes. Issue: A court in Cologne, Germany, took the . decision to outlaw circumcision on young boys . However, the banning of circumcision has its detractors Vancouver surgeon Dr Neil Pollock - whose clinic was targeted by protestors -  specialises in the procedure says he advocates it on medical grounds. He says circumcision reduces the risks of urinary tract and penile infections and the risk of some sexually transmitted diseases and penile cancer. The issue has received significant . publicity over recent months after a court in Cologne, Germany, took the . decision to outlaw circumcision on young boys because it can cause . 'illegal bodily harm'. The step triggered an angry backlash . among both Jewish and Islamic groups in the country which both advocate . the procedure, a ritual in both religions. Notably the Central Council of Jews . in Germany, a body politicians and the judiciary try to placate as often . as possible given the history of the Holocaust was enraged by the . decision. Although only a local ruling, it may set a legal precedent that courts in the other 15 states of Germany would be obliged to follow. Therefore the fight to reverse it could, ultimately, lead all the way to the Federal Constitutional Court, Germany's highest. However, while many mainstream German citizens are in agreement with the court ruling and believe it should be halted. One survey last year showed 60 percent of Germans equating circumcision with genital mutilation. Controversial: A mohel, left, prepares to carry . out a circumcision on a baby boy as prayers are read during a . traditional Jewish ceremony (file picture) Dieter Graumann, president of the Central Council, said the verdict was 'an unprecedented and dramatic intervention in religious communities' right to self-determination. Last month the issue of circumcision hit the headlines in New York after an extreme Jewish circumcision practice in which the blood of a baby's cut penis is sucked by a religious leader was been condemned after the deaths of two infants. The 'metzitzah b'peh' performed by ultra Orthodox Jews sees the eight-day old baby have a traditional circumcision but the 'mohel' then places his mouth around the wound and sucks up the blood. But the practice - intended to prevent infection - has sparked controversy in recent years after the death of two infants and the contraction of herpes in at least 11 others between November 2000 and December 2011. Heath chiefs in New York are now pushing through regulation forcing anybody wishing to have the procedure carried out on their babies to sign a consent waiver. But some Orthodox Jews have complained about the measures claiming that they infringe on their 'religious freedom'.","String of protests taking over weekend in Vancouver .

Pervert James Manchand, 48, used a small voice-activated camera to make covert videos of women . A father-of-two targeted women in city centre shops and used a small voice-activated camera to make secret upskirt videos of them. James Manchand, 48, who just hours before had been at a sex offenders course for an almost identical crime, was caught after suspicious security guards at Manchester's Market Street Boots  realised he was following women around their store. The guards, who had at first thought he was a shoplifter, kept watching him as he left the store and went to the nearby Marks & Spencer. When police were called, Manchand, of Blackrod, Bolton, became agitated and was arrested, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard. Officers searched unemployed Manchand and found a small camera which had been strapped to his shoe under his laces. Prosecutor Kerry Benn told the magistrates: 'He had been videoing women without their knowledge under their skirts.' Ms Benn said detectives viewed the footage and realised that his victims appeared not to know what was going on. Manchand was caught . out just before 5pm on June 22. Only hours earlier he had started the . sex offenders course run by probation officers as part . of his sentence for the near identical crime committed in 2010. When he was interviewed by police, Manchand admitted his crime but insisted it was a ‘blip in my rehabilitation’. Pleading not to be jailed, Manchand told magistrates: 'I just wanted to say how deeply remorseful I am for my actions. 'I am truly sorry to the victims, my partner and everybody else I have let down. 'It goes without saying this type of behaviour will not happen again in the future.' Handing Manchand a 26-week suspended prison sentence, chairman of the bench Ron Beattie told the defendant: 'This is a second similar offence. Manchand was caught after suspicious security guards at Manchester's Market Street Boots realised he was following shoppers around their store (file photo) 'This was clearly pre-planned in that you purchased a specialist camera. 'We believe this matter crosses the custody threshold. 'However, we believe the public would be better served by you completing the present course you are on, therefore we are going to suspend this sentence for two years.' Manchand, who admitted one count of outraging public decency, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid work as part of a two-year community order. The magistrates also gave him an indefinite sex offending prevention order and placed him on the sex offenders’ register for the next five years. James Street, defending, suggested his client experienced an ‘adrenaline rush’ while committing his crimes because of the fear of getting caught rather than for sexual gratification. Mr Street said his client had since ‘done well’ on the probation course for sex offenders, adding: 'He has fully co-operated with the programme and he tells me he’s one of the most active members.'","James Manchand given 26-week suspended sentence .

Phillips Idowu's fitness and whereabouts had fascinated fans and frustrated coaches since the start of the Games and his early exit will raise questions about his decision to reject Team GB guidance in the build-up. Today he pulled off his headband in disgust as he walked away from the pit, having finished two places outside the top 12. Scroll down for video . Great Britain's Phillips Idowu competing in the qualification round for the men's triple jump today . Idowu reacts with disappointment after failing to qualify for the final of the triple jump this morning . Idowu looks up at the leaderboard in agony as his jump isn't good enough to qualify for the final . The triple jumper had insisted he spent the last few weeks in his home city of London ""as planned months ago"". But UK Athletics head coach Charles . van Commenee said he was perplexed that Idowu had turned his back on UKA . and his own coach Aston Moore, who had only received a brief text . before Idowu cut off contact. The Beijing silver medallist struggled to make an impact, failing to qualify as he slipped to 14th place. Despite strong support from the home crowd, he looked out of sorts on all three of his jumps. Needing 17.10m to qualify automatically, Idowu could only manage a best of 16.53m from his three attempts . Idowu was nicknamed the 'Invisible Man' after doubts about his fitness led to his absence from Team GB's training camps . Idowu ripped his headband off in frustration after his third jump of 16.53m meant he was out of the competition . He appeared annoyed at his 16.47m first jump - short of the 17.10m needed to qualify automatically for Thursday's final. His second ended in a no jump and he managed only a marginal improvement on his third jump, measuring 16.53m. The 33-year-old world champion has . competed just three times in 2012 but, if fit and on form, had been seen . as a gold medal contender. He missed out on gold in Beijing by 5cm. Idowu spoke afterwards on the uncertainty about his preparation: 'I had been traveling from Birmingham to London to see my coach. After withdrawing from Crystal Palace I was back up in Birmingham and had a problem in my hip going down to my knee. 'I started a couple of training sessions in Birmingham and had to pull up in a running session. I made the decision to come back down to London and with the work over that week was better to stay in the UK. Warming up and training I had to make sue someone was there to work with me. 'I had some great sprint and technical sessions but a full approach is a different kettle of fish. The timing wasn't there. The hop and step was there but I just couldn't get my final phase.' He added: 'To be honest I have been lucky over the last four or five years and have competed at my best at the championships and being able to do that I've been able to come away with at least silver. 'I'm not at my best and I was hoping I would still produce something but it wasn't to be. 'I felt ok. I managed to get out and see my physio before today's competition so went in pain free and I felt that I could have possibly qualified automatically. 'I knew I would be rusty because it's been a while, conditions were difficult because of the wind and I knew that would be a factor but that wasn't me out there today. I've competed for 12 years and I can't remember a time I've performed that badly.' Idowu was cheered loudly by a capacity 80,000 crowd at the Olympic Stadium as he took part in the triple jump . But the pain in his expression betrayed intense disappointment at his efforts . Talking about his injury problems, Idowu said: 'I'm guessing I will need surgery at the end of this season. I'll call it a day and wrap up the season. I wanted to battle for gold but now I'll go home and reassess and go home and try not to be down about my performance. 'It's over and there's nothing I can do. The crowd have been great I'm upset that I let them down. All year I've been tagged as a medal favourite and I haven't got the chance to go out there and do it. 'I'm not sure what. I had a problem with my right leg and I can't say specifically.' He also issued a parting shot, saying he receives no funding from UK Athletics: 'I am not lottery funded. I have not been lottery funded for at least three years. I pay for my own medical, I pay for my own physio and I will pay for my own surgery. 'There is no association between me and UKAA, if you can find a form that I have signed that says I received money from UKAA then hold me accountable but over the last three years I have been out there and won world titles, world silver medals, Olympic silver medals and I have done that out of my own pocket.'

'She is a very gentle and loving girl with not an ounce of meanness in . her.' It is a violation of state law to keep a wild animal indoors as a pet.

Former astronaut Neil Armstrong - the first man to set foot on the moon - is recovering from heart-bypass surgery, according to a Nasa statement. Armstrong, who turned 82 on Sunday, underwent surgery on Tuesday to relieve blocked coronary arteries. NBC news quoted his wife Carol Armstrong as saying he is 'doing great'. On the mend: Former astronaut Neil Armstrong, pictured here with President Barack Obama in 2009, underwent heart-bypass surgery to correct blocked arteries . Nasa administrator Charles Bolden called Armstrong a 'true American hero' and wished him a quick recovery. In a statement Mr Bolden said: 'Neil's . pioneering spirit will surely serve him well in this challenging time . and the entire Nasa family is holding the Armstrong family in our . thoughts and prayers.' Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin, who accompanied Armstrong on his 'moonwalk' - and whose portrait on the lunar surface (taken by Armstrong) is one of the most iconic images of human endeavour - also wished his old mission commander well on Twitter. He tweeted: 'Sending my best wishes for a speedy . recovery - we agreed to make it to the 50th Apollo Anniv in 2019.' Armstrong and Aldrin were joined in the Apollo mission by Michael Collins, who became the first person to orbit the moon alone until his colleagues returned from the surface. As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Pioneers: This picture taken in May 1969 shows, left to right, Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin - the crew of the historic Apollo 11 mission . One small step: A rare image of Armstrong on the moon, left, his foot leaving a distinctive print in the lunar dust. After his 'moonwalk', a tired but clearly delighted Armstrong beams for the camera . After piloting the lunar module Eagle . down to the surface from the command module, he climbed down the stairs . onto the dusty surface and delivered one of the most quotable quotes in . human history: 'That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.' Both . Armstrong and Nasa insist that the quote was not preplanned or . rehearsed - Armstrong says it came from a train of thought he had . developed after the launch from earth and the six hours on the lunar surface . before his historic Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). Ever since the moon landing, academics and enthusiasts have argued over the missing 'a' in the quote. Armstrong can be heard to say 'That's one small step for man...' when he should have said 'That's one small step for a man...'. Dangerous training: Armstrong piloting a lunar landing simulator ahead of his Apollo mission. A year before the moon landing, Armstrong was nearly killed in a simulator accident and had to eject to safety . The main event: Armstrong and Aldrin place the U.S. flag at their Apollo 11 landing site on July 20, 1969. Armstrong's announcement as he was stepping down the ladder is one of the world's most quotable quotes . Without the 'a' the quote is contradictory - a small step for man, a giant leap for man. While Armstrong insists he did say . the 'a' - and supporters suggest that poor telecommunications technology . meant that the important utterance was lost in transmission - others . say Armstrong simply made a mistake while being overwhelmed by his . situation. Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins successfully returned to earth safely following eight days in space. Before he became an astronaut, Armstrong was . in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. He joined the Nasa . Astronaut Corps in 1962 and his first spaceflight was the Nasa Gemini 8 . mission in 1966. His second and last spaceflight was as the mission commander of Apollo 11. It could have been very different, after Armstrong was almost killed in 1968 when his lunar lander simulator - a clunky rocket-propelled vehicle designed to mimic moon langing conditions in the earth's gravity - malfunctioned. Iconic image: Despite the most famous portrait from the surface of the moon being of Aldrin, it was taken by Armstrong - adding photography to his already impressive CV . He was forced to eject and his parachute descent almost landed him in the middle of the simulator's fiery wreckage. During the launch phase of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong's heart was recorded at beating at 110 beats per minute. After leaving the space agency, he . taught at the University of Cincinnati in his home state of Ohio. But it . wasn't the last time Armstrong would be connected to space flight. He was twice appointed to Nasa . accident investigation teams: first, as a panel expert investigation the . ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission in 1970; second, as vice-chairman of . the commission investigating the tragic Challenger Space Shuttle . disaster in 1986. in 1991 he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing in Aspen, Colorado.

A cash-strapped council that flies its employees around the world is splashing out on business class flights instead of economy to make sure they are well rested. An official report, which has been signed off by Sunderland City Council, claims the extra comfort is needed so staff can perform their duties effectively. The rule applies to any flight longer than eight hours as the council said it has a 'duty of care' to employees and elected members. Despite the report stating economy tickets should be purchased for flights of less than five hours, if the Mayor is part of the trip then travellers are upgraded to business class. Flights: Sunderland City Council, pictured, say that staff will be upgraded on certain longer flights because they have a 'duty of care' The revelation comes as The TaxPayers’ Alliance expose that Sunderland City Council spent more than £210,000 on flights from 2009 to 2012. Of this, £62,000 was spent on flights as part of its Friendship Agreement with Washington DC, £6,168 was spent flying staff to South Africa as part of its bid to become a World Cup host city. Sunderland City Council also spent over £10,000 on two trips to South Africa to attend a Commonwealth Local Government forum good practice scheme project and £8,465 on flights to China for business development. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TPA, branded the 'jet setting across the globe' as 'barmy' and called twinning visits “self-indulgent” and unnecessary in the age of video conferencing. Earlier this year, the council was criticised after spending £4,500 to fly Councillor Harry Trueman, then deputy leader, to South Africa to attend a two-day economic conference. Expensive: The council has spent more than £210,000 in the last three years on flights . If he had flown in economy class the flights would only have cost about £750. People from the city say the money should be better spent. Andrew Woods said: 'The council should not be allowed to get away with that.' The 40-year-old added: 'We are in a recession and the money they are using for business class flights could go elsewhere on services that would be of long-term use.' Louise Hiles, also 40, said: 'I think it’s a disgrace as those seats will cost a fortune, but it’s the council and they are never going to change. 'The money should be spent on public services like care homes and making more jobs for people.' Tim Archer, 49, added: 'That’s not fair, what is wrong with a standard class flight? 'The amount of money they would save by just doing that could be put into schools and roads instead of wasting our money.' Ex-council worker Fred Collum, 77, said: 'I worked for the council for 34 years and I disagree with the way they spend. 'The council don’t do their job and never have done. They would have meetings but nothing would come from it. 'They don’t seem to be interested in Sunderland and don’t have aspirations for the area.' Councillor Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland City Council, said: 'More than 17,000 people here are employed by foreign companies and we have seen millions of pounds invested here from overseas. 'As an example, in the financial year 2011/12, the creation of more than 2,000 new jobs was announced by overseas-owned companies in the city, bringing £700million of capital investment into Sunderland. 'The city council continues to attract foreign investment and promote our goods and services abroad. 'As part of this work, and in the light of the economic climate, the council has been reviewing its policy and guidelines on foreign travel and already implemented a number of the changes.

Two new videos reveal the terrifying moments during and after a gunfight between police and a 'deeply troubled' Texas gun collector. One of the videos was recorded by neighbor Rigo Cisneros, a former Army combat medic whose skills honed in Afghanistan were needed at home when he rushed over to dying police constable Brian Bachmann and tried to save him. Thomas Alton . Caffall, 35, turned a weapon on Mr Bachmann, a 41-year-old married father of two, . when the officer arrived at his house near Texas A&M University to . serve him with eviction papers. Chris Northcliff, 43, a bystander caught in the crossfire, was also killed. Four others, including three officers, were wounded. Caffall later died. Scroll down for videos . Drama: Two officers run up to the house where Thomas Caffall shot a police constable before being wounded himself . Good Samaritan: Neighbor Rigo Cisneros shot this video while he was waiting for permission to run over to the officer who was fatally wounded . Shooter: College Station divorcee Thomas Alton Caffall, 35, was 'deeply troubled', according to his mother Linda Weaver . The first video shows little, but reveals the piercing ring of several volleys of gunshots in the quiet suburban neighborhood of College Station, Texas. The wail of sirens can be heard as the neighbor leads his wife away from the street and into the cover of their house. The second video, recorded by Mr Ciseros, shows the grainy image of several officers running up to the house after Caffall was shot and disarmed. 'Do not move! Do not move! If you move, you are dead!' screams and officer as he approaches Caffall. 'Do not move! Do not move!' Mr Cisneros, who emerged from his house when the gunfire started, can be heard asked a police officer if he can help. 'You got an ambulance here yet? I’m a medic,' he volunteers. 'C'mon ... every minute. He's been down for like 20 minutes,' he pleads with the officers, who is keeping him at bay. The video ends with Mr Cisneros running toward the violent scene. He told the New York Times that when he arrived at Mr Bachmann's side, it was already too late. He was not responsive and there was no pulse. There was a gaping wound in the officer's chest. 'I heard gurgling sounds,' he said. . When medics arrived to help Mr Bachmann, police directed Mr Cisneros to help the shooter. He said he saw bullet wounds in Caffall's thigh, foot and armpit. It was the wound in his abdomen, which showed signs of internal bleeding, that likely proved fatal, the former medic told the Los Angeles Times. He was badly injured, but Caffall was alert enough to give Mr Cisernos a message. Arsenal: Three people, including a police constable, were shot dead and three others have been injured after Caffall opened fire near Texas A&M University on Monday afternoon. One of Caffall's weapons is pictured . Loss: Police constable Brian Bachmann, 41, has been shot dead by a gunman near Texas A&M University. He is pictured right with his family . Killed: Bachmann was the elected constable for Precinct 1 in Brazos County. He was killed in the shooting on Monday, as was civilian Chris Northcliff, 43 . 'Could you please tell the person I shot I’m sorry,' he asked of Mr Cisernos. On Tuesday, a lawyer for Caffall's family said the divorcee was mentally ill, but would not elaborate on his condition. 'He wasn't the same kid that he used to be, let's just say that,' W Tyler Moore said. 'He was sweet, very bright, good sense of humor, just a good kid, a sweet kid. I've known him since he was 4 years old.' The day of the tragedy, Caffall's mother said her son had been having emotional problems. 'He's been very deeply troubled,' Caffall's mother Linda Weaver told the Huffington Post. She said that her son had been having mental health 'difficulties' in the past few years. 'The minute I saw the TV I knew it was him,' she said. 'I've been that worried about him. 'We are just devastated.' Victim: An investigator uncovers a body at the scene where a gunman opened fire on a police officer serving an eviction notice near the Texas A&M University on Monday . Scene: The gunman was also shot dead when police officers swooped on the scene and found Bachmann shot . Mrs Weaver was having trouble coming to terms with the tragedy. 'If you're going to commit suicide, why take all these other people with you?' Caffall's sister Courtney Clark said the family was 'distraught'. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy,' she said. 'We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused.' Caffall's stepfather Richard Weaver described the 35-year-old as a 'ticking time bomb.' 'He was crazy as hell,' Mr Weaver said to Click2Houston. 'At one point, we were afraid that he was going to come up here and do something to his mother and me.' He said that Caffall had quit his job nine months ago and said he would never work for anybody ever again. Anger: Bachmann attended the home of the shooter in College Station to serve him with eviction papers . Shock: A woman reacts outside of the College Station Medical Center, where five victims were brought .

Passing motorists who saw smoke billowing from a stand of pine trees . along southern Mississippi's Interstate 10 rescued a woman and her disabled . sister trapped inside a wrecked, burning sport utility vehicle. Fifteen to 20 motorists, including a photographer for The . Associated Press, came to the aid of the women on Thursday afternoon in Hancock . County. Photographer Gerald Herbert said the rescuers pulled the . disabled woman from the wreck first, but getting the driver out was . difficult. Scroll down for video . Fire: Motorists battle a blaze while the driver, Giovanna Demonte, was trapped inside her 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer on a Mississippi highway . Panic: Passers-by rescued the driver's disabled sister from the backseat but had to pry open the car's jammed door. The trapped driver screamed in fear while they frantically worked . 'No one had fire extinguishers,' Herbert said. 'We were all . sure she was going to perish. The sounds of her screams and the sight of the . fire inching closer to her, that was the most horrible and helpless feeling I've . ever felt in my life.'

Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Ben Seibert identified . the driver as Giovanna Demonte, 36, of Picayune, Miss. He said she was airlifted . in stable condition to Gulfport Memorial Hospital. 'She had serious head trauma. Anytime that happens, injuries are considered life-threatening,' he said. Escape: Good Samaritans on a Mississippi highway freed the trapped driver and pulled the woman to safety . Seibert said Demonte was traveling eastbound on I-10, just . past the Louisiana-Mississippi line, about 11:30 a.m. when she went off the . road, overcorrected, and crossed the median. The passenger side of her 2002 . Chevrolet Trailblazer then crashed into a tree. Police said the driver's sister, Felicidad Demonte, 39, of . Slidell, Louisiana, was in the back seat and suffered minor injuries. Petty Officer Melissa Estes, who's based at the Naval base . in Gulfport, Mississippi but is from Annapolis, Maryland, said she came upon the scene after . picking up her mother from the airport in New Orleans. 'I noticed the smoke,' she recalled. 'I saw only one person . so I stopped and ran down there to help. Others also stopped and a couple of . guys broke the windows to the back passenger seat and were able to pull the girl . out and her wheelchair. We got her to the road safely. The woman kept screaming . `My baby! My baby!' I really thought the car was going to blow up.' Comfort: Motorists stopped and offered comfort to the driver after her terrifying ordeal . Injured and shaken: The driver was airlifted in stable condition to a nearby hospital, she had serious head trauma . Zach Miller, of Hurley, Mississippi, said the entrapped driver was . screaming at the top of her lungs. 'I kept telling her, `We won't leave you here to burn.

Herbert said a man in a pickup truck tried to pull the car . out of the valley where it landed and a cement truck eventually joined the . rescue effort and began spraying water on the vehicle, keeping the flames at . bay. Others used crowbars to help pry open the car's jammed door and the Good . Samaritans finally were able to pull the woman to safety. Relief: A firefigher comforts Felicidad Demonte, 39, who was rescued from the backseat of her sister's burning car. She suffered minor injuries . 'She was so blessed that mixer had a water hose,' said . Harold Catha Jr., also of Hurley, who helped with the effort. 'I know that saved . her life.' Catha said he used his fire extinguisher to help put out . flames that were licking at the SUV's front tires. 'But the flames would abate . for a second or two, but then blaze back,' he said. 'The mixer was able to put . water inside the vehicle when the flames were trying to get to her. While the . water was being poured on her and the fire, they were able to pull the car up . out of the woods and get her out. It all took maybe 10 to 12 minutes but it felt . a whole lot longer.'

The world's foremost euthanasia clinic, Dignitas, is to sue the Swiss police after their officers tried to revive a terminally ill woman who fell asleep during an assisted suicide. Police stopped the procedure near Zurich after the patient lost consciousness after only consuming half the drugs meant to kill her, and therefore officers assumed that her suicide attempt had failed. The unnamed woman was meant to finish the lethal cocktail of barbiturates and police say their rules state that if a patient is still alive two hours after taking the drugs they will call an ambulance. 'Abduction': Dignitas claim the woman was illegally taken from their clinic near Zurich, pictured, and want the Swiss police prosecuted . Following the intervention the woman in her 60s, who was suffering from a genetic disease and weighed . only five stone, was rushed to hospital were she later died. Under Swiss law, a state official - . usually a police officer - must be present to monitor proceedings when . an assisted suicide is being conducted. And Dignitas now want the police to be prosecuted for 'interfering in a legal assisted suicide' and 'abducting a patient' during the incident on August 2. Suicide: Patients at the clinic consume a cocktail of barbiturates dissolved in a drink to kill them, pictured at a different assisted suicide, but on this occasion the woman fell asleep before finishing it . 'Because of the woman's weight she had already taken enough of the drug to die,' a Dignitas spokesman said. 'The police acted in a random and provocative way against the wishes of . the woman's closest family, who were at her bedside the whole time.' The woman was first given a drug in a glass of water to prevent vomiting, then 30 minutes later she began drinking a lethal dose of barbiturates dissolved in fruit juice. In almost all other cases at Dignitas, the patient finishes the glass then begins to feel drowsy with ten minutes before moving from anaesthetised unconsciousness to coma then dying of respiratory arrest. But in this case, the 67-year-old woman only managed to finish half the glass before she fell asleep, and the lower dose of the fatal drug meant she took longer to die, Dignitas said. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the controversial Dignitas . clinic has attracted scores of patients from the UK, where helping . someone to die is a criminal offence that can lead to a murder charge. A minister for the Swiss government's public affairs department said today an independent inquiry would be launched into the matter. But the police are standing firm and say their actions were the right ones. 'The suicide procedure had clearly failed because she was not dead after two hours,' a spokesman for the Zurich prosecutor's office. 'Police acted to avert any suffering that might have ensued on the patient's behalf.'","The woman in her sixties dropped off halfway through taking the lethal cocktail of drugs mixed to kill her .

The deaths have sparked outrage, the . families of those who died want answers, and there are new questions . about this global network of rehab centers. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with around 150 patients. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin.

His autopsy report lists his cause and manner of death as 'undetermined' and 'unknown' The program tries its best to hide its affiliation with Scientology, which licenses Narconon centers through its division called ABLE, the Association for Better Living and Education. Famous Scientologists Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley have praised the program - with Cruise calling it: 'The authority on getting people off drugs' and Travolta saying: 'Compared with other rehabs, we are the best'. But the three recent deaths of Stacy, Hillary Holton, 21, of Carrolton, Texas, and Gabriel Graves, 32, of Owasso, Oklahoma, have attracted lot of negative publicity. Last month, the inquiry into the July 19 death of Stacy was expanded to include the April death of Hillary and the October death of Gabriel. The state district attorney has asked the sheriff’s department to deepen its investigation into the center. Stacy Murphy's father, Robert Murphy, said his daughter would have been grateful that 'law enforcement will continue to give full diligence in the investigation of her death'. The CEO of Narconon Arrowhead: Gary Smith said that due to privacy laws, he cannot comment on the deaths, but said he and his staff are devastated by the loss of young lives. He told NBC: 'We put our faith in this place. Then I got a phone call that morning from her mother to tell me, ""She's dead"", and I'm like ""WHAT?""' The CEO of Narconon Arrowhead, Gary .

Stacy and Hillary's autopsy and toxicology reports are pending. Gabriel's autopsy report lists his . cause and manner of death as 'undetermined' and 'unknown'. A man who wanted to be known only as Rick S. spoke to the Village Voice about Stacy Murphy's death. He was a patient at the same time as the 20-year-old, who had been there for approximately six weeks before she died. Stacy was allowed out on day release from the center, despite not meeting the criteria. When she returned on July 18, the staff noticed she was high and tested positive for opiates. The 20-year-old was sent to the 'withdrawal unit' of the facility and it was there that her . condition became grave, according to Rick. He claimed the drugs that might have saved Stacy's life were either not available or that no one there at the 'unit' knew how to administer them. Answers: Stacy Murphy's parents said they are holding Narconon accountable for their daughter's death and await the outcome of the investigation . Celebrity Scientologist: Kirstie Ally is the official spokesperson for Narconon . He said: 'My understanding is that everyone there is pretty much a . former patient. You . really can't expect them to be able to diagnose a drug overdose.' The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with around 150 patients. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin.

But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm its efficacy. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees are anything between $12,000 and $20,000. Rick said he checked himself into Narconon two months ago to dry out with no idea that it was connected to Scientology. He paid an upfront fee of $13,000 and after an initial withdrawal period including sauna treatments and high doses of vitamins, he was put on a strange 'training program'. Rick told Village Voice: 'Within the first hour of that, I realized this was Scientology. But I thought, I might as well give it my best shot. But what they try to get you to do is insane.' He claims he was talking to ashtrays before long. Tom Cruise is known to have done some of his early Scientology training by talking to . ashtrays and beverage bottles, part of Hubbard's approach that is . supposed to increase a person's communication skills. Rick claimed that none of the patients received any counseling about their addictions, what caused them to fall victim to drugs or alcohol and how to prevent it in the future. Instead, the patients sat in a sauna for five hours . a day while taking massive doses of Niacin and other vitamins. Rick got kicked out of the facility shortly after Stacy's death because he was talking to police and the media about 'how upside down the place is'. Narconon International declined request for an interview, but in statements said it has served 'tens of thousands of people' and 'three out of four Narconon graduates are able to live stable, drug-free lives'.

In an astonishing legal move, the 47-year-old employed a team of lawyers to issue warnings and threats about possible court action.

Challenge: Match is full of pictures of public figures on the beach every week, but Ms Trierweiler objected to other publications capturing a swim she enjoyed with her president boyfriend earlier this month . Match is full of pictures of public . figures on the beach every week, but Ms Trierweiler objected to other . publications capturing a swim she enjoyed with her president boyfriend . earlier this month. Criticism: Ms Trierweiler is a staff writer for glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match. The publication printed photos of former First Lady Carla Bruni in her bikini while pregnant on holiday with Nicolas Sarkozy . 'She didn't like the pictures so wanted them banned,' said a Paris legal source close to the case. 'Faxes were sent to editors, with lawyers threatening all kinds of measures for non-compliance.' At the time many believed that . Francois Hollande, 58, had staged the 'shorts and bikini' photo-shoot to . prove that was still 'very much in love' with his controversial . girlfriend. Waiting . photographers were astonished to see the portly couple splashing around . on a beach close to the palatial Fort Bregancon, on the French Riviera. The . couple have been trying to play down speculation that Mr Hollande had . threatened to dump his live-in lover after she tried to wreck his . ex-girlfriend's political career. Ms . Trierweiler tweeted her support for a candidate standing in . parliamentary elections against Segolene Royal, the mother of the . president's four children. Ms Royal went on to lose the election, widely blaming Ms Trierweiler for stabbing her in the back. The . scandal led Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault to tell Ms Trierweiler . that she should 'know her place', while Mr Hollande's eldest son, Thomas . Hollande, said the tweet had destroyed his father's 'Mr Normal' image. Elysee Palace sources also said the President was furious with his girlfriend, who is nicknamed Valerie 'Rottweiler'. Mr Hollande and Ms Royal lived together for more than 30 years before he left her for Ms Trierweiler in 2005. Bitter battle: Ms Trierweiler (left) controversially sent a tweet to a candidate standing against the President's ex-lover Segolene Royal (right) Ms Trierweiler later indicated that she regretted the tweet - saying she would 'count to 10' before sending another - but never actually apologised to Ms Royal - prompting speculation that Mr Hollande would leave her. The beach photo shoot appeared on the front page of a number of Paris magazines, including VSD, which later carried an editorial confirmed Ms Trierweiler's legal 'intervention'. All the publications affected, including Voici, have pledged to fight any attempts by Ms Trierweiler to muzzle the media.

In 2003, Saddam Hussein was the world's most wanted man, but in the face of the full force of the U.S. army his fiercely loyal former driver offered to help the toppled dictator. It is claimed that Alaa Namiq's links with the brutal leader started in 1959 with Saddam being born in a village just to the north of Mr Namiq's home of Dawr in central northern Iraq. U.S. soldiers correctly concluded that . Saddam would return to the base of his power in the tribe lands where he . had grown up, but identifying his exact whereabouts still took time. Saddam's last stand: The 'Ace of Spades' is finally captured by U.S. troops in December 2003 after hiding in a hole dug by Alaa Namiq . In tones that oscillate between boastful and reserved, Mr Namiq has spoken for the first time about the assistance he gave to Saddam in the wake of the allied invasion. 'He came here and asked us for help and I said yes. He said, 'You might be captured and tortured,' 'But in our Arab tribal tradition, and by Islamic law, when someone needs help, we help him,' Mr Namiq was reported as saying in The Washington Post. Mr Namiq then dug a hole - a tiny underground bunker - in a dirt patch on his farm where Saddam hid out before he was captured in December 2003. With the help of his brother, Qais, and other members of his family, Saddam also moved among various safe houses in the area. While he must have known that his ultimate demise was inevitable, according to Namiq the 'Ace of Spades' did what he could to evade his pursuers. Hiding place: U.S. soldiers stand by the small hole in the village of Dwar near Tikrit where Saddam stayed for many months successfully evading capture . Declining the use of a mobile phone because he knew soldiers would be listening for his voice, Mr Namiq says Saddam instead passed his time writing prose and poetry, but that these scribblings were seized by forces when he was captured. Mr Namiq says he helped to arrange secret trips to the farm for Saddam's only visitors - his sons Uday and Qusay. The former farmer, who now runs a restaurant with four of his brothers, also went to great lengths to conceal the location where Saddam recorded fiery speeches encouraging his supporters to fight on against the Allied forces. Mr Namiq says he once drove 10 miles to the city of Samarra to record natural sounds by a river in a bid to put Saddam's hunters off the scent. After Saddam was captured, Mr Namiq . was held at the notorious Abu Ghraib jail where he says he was . questioned daily about the possible whereabouts of weapons of mass . destruction. He says he was . tortured at times, being hooded and beaten and bitten by guard dogs and . was kept in the dark 24 hours a day. Rock music was blasted into his . cell and buckets of water were thrown in there to keep it constantly . wet.

Lucky: Terrified motorist Kate Kirby thought she was being carjacked when two men ran up to her vehicle screaming at her to get out, but they turned out to be Good Samaritans who saved her life . A teacher who feared she was being carjacked was ordered out of her car by two good samaritans men just seconds before her BMW exploded. Deputy headteacher Kate Kirby had failed to notice smoke rising from the wheel arch as she pulled up at a set of traffic lights in Gloucester. But luckily two passing male motorists spotted the danger and frantically banged on her windows and ordered her out the car. Convinced she was about to be mugged, Kate made a dash from the vehicle only to realised her ‘attackers’,  Darren and Kevin, were actually her saviours. She would now like to track them down. 'If they hadn’t have told me to get out I would have carried on driving and then who knows what might have happened, I don’t want to think about it,' the 29-year-old said. 'I was so frightened because they shouted so loud. 'I just didn’t understand. If it was not for them I would have carried on driving.' Mrs Kirby had been driving father-in-law Martin, 62, to Gloucester Royal Hospital in Gloucester for a routine endoscopy when the drama unfolded. The pair had only been driving for a short while when the two men drew up next to them and began frantically screaming at them to get out the car. Bemused Kate stared blankly at them trying to work out what to do before she instinctively pulled the car into the kerb as the men began to shout again. They frantically climbed out of the car and it was then that they spotted the smoke rising from the wheel arch and bonnet. 'I was at the traffic lights and these two men started screaming at me to get out of the car,' she said. 'I stared at them and they told me to get out of the car now. I pulled the car in but I couldn’t get my seatbelt off quick enough, I was just fumbling around. 'When I did get out the car they told me to stand back. Inferno: This is the deputy head's car just after the men got her and her father in law out of it as it burst into flames . 'Then I saw the front of my car, the paint work was bubbling and the engine was going mad and making a noise. I don’t know how I didn’t see it. Relieved: Mrs Kirby can't believe she walked away from the incident and would like to thank the men who rescued her . 'I was a mess when I spotted it though, I was crying and panicking and hyper-ventillating like a child does when they’re crying so much, it was awful.' Her father in-law added: 'I thought we were going to be mugged, it was only when we pulled up we saw the smoke.' The two men apologised afterwards for making Kate cry and once they had made sure she was safely in another car, out of the pouring rain, began directing traffic away until emergency services arrived. The cause of the blaze is unknown but the intense heat caused the road surface to melt. Fire crews extinguished the blaze within 30 seconds and an ambulance crew treated Kate for shock. The 10-year-old BMW 3 Series is now in a scrap yard and Kate is not sure when she will buy her next car. 'I just keep thinking about what would have happened if they hadn’t have been there, I would have kept on driving and then I don’t know,' the deputy head said. 'I can’t thank these two men enough, I’ve managed to get one of their mobile numbers but they’re not answering which is a shame. 'They have restored my faith in human nature by stopping to help and then offering me a coat and to sit in their car so I could get out of the rain. 'Sadly, I don’t know the full names of the other Good Samaritans, only that the girl was called Faye, but they were so helpful. I can’t thank them enough.'","Kate Kirby pulled up to some traffic lights and the two men started banging on the windows and telling her, and her father-in-law, to get out .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:47 EST, 17 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:01 EST, 17 August 2012 . The U.S. military trainers handed the new recruit, Mohammad Ismail, his AK-47 to . defend his remote Afghan village. He turned around and immediately used it, . spraying the Americans with bullets and killing two - the latest of nine U.S. service personnel gunned down in two weeks by their supposed Afghan allies. The shooting in western Farah province was not the only such . attack Friday. Hours later a few provinces away in Kandahar, an Afghan soldier . wounded two more coalition servicemen. One turncoat attack per month raised eyebrows last year. One . per week caused concern earlier this year. But when Afghan forces turn their . guns on international trainers twice in a day - as they now have two weeks in a . row - it's hard to argue there's not something going on. The question is, what . is it? Infiltration: Inside attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan have risen from 11 in 2011 to 29 so far in 2012 . The U.S.-led alliance says it's too soon to tell what's . behind the rash of insider attacks. The most likely explanations: Either the . Taliban are increasingly infiltrating the Afghan police and army, or relations . between Afghan and American forces are turning toxic - or both. 'There's no positive spin on this,' said Andrew Exum, an . analyst with the Washington-based Center for a New American Security who has . advised the top U.S. generals in Kabul. He said the number of Afghan insider . attacks has risen beyond what can be explained as isolated incidents. That's bad news for the U.S. exit strategy for Afghanistan, . which has seen Washington spend more than $20 billion on training and equipping . a nearly 340,000-member Afghan security force on the assumption that it would . eventually be strong enough to fight the Taliban on its own. The coalition has downplayed the insider attacks as . anomalies and mostly a result of personal grievances, even as their numbers . soared from 11 last year to 29 so far in 2012. The alliance says only about 10 . per cent of the attacks were related to infiltration by the Taliban insurgency. But that analysis was done before the latest furious spate of seven attacks in . 11 days, a frequency that suggests some type of coordination. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta . called the recent attacks 'sporadic' and not a long-term trend . 'Whether or not these specific events turn out to be . insurgent-initiated... we're just going to have to do the investigations and . figure that out,' said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led . coalition. The problem has become so pronounced in the Afghan war that . all U.S. forces there are now being instructed to carry loaded weapons - even on . base - as a precaution against insider attacks, a U.S. official said Friday in . Washington. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because policy forbids . discussing military procedures. Some historians are hard-pressed to find precedent for this . in previous wars. 'I have never heard of anything in Vietnam comparable to . what we have recently experienced in Afghanistan,' said James McAllister, a . political science professor at Williams College in Massachusetts who has written . extensively about the Vietnam War. A British military expert on colonial wars, . Martin Windrow, said the level of these types of attacks were 'almost unheard . of' in any conflict he'd studied. Exum said the insider attacks have 'tremendous strategic . impact' beyond the 36 coalition forces killed this year because they damage . morale among international troops and further weaken support for the war in the . U.S. and other NATO nations training Afghan soldiers and police to take over . security nationwide by 2014. What's unclear, he added, is how much influence the Taliban . actually have in organizing the increasing numbers of attacks. Discord: Afghan security personnel said in a May 2011 Army survey . they found U.S. troops . 'extremely arrogant, . bullying and unwilling to . listen' The insurgents have been happy to take credit. The Taliban's . supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, boasted Thursday that the insurgents 'have . cleverly infiltrated into the ranks of the enemy' and were killing a rising . number of U.S.-led coalition forces. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told The Associated Press in . an interview this week that the attacks may reflect the Taliban's use of . unconventional tactics against a coalition force it cannot defeat on the . battlefield. He added that U.S. military commanders say such attacks still . remain 'sporadic' and not a long-term trend. 'The enemy is infiltrating because . they see it's very easy' Friday's deadly shooting in Farah, at least by the accounts . of local Afghan officials, seemed unlikely to be a personal dispute. Mohammad . Ismail, a man in his 30s, had joined the Afghan Local Police just five days . earlier. He opened fire during an inauguration ceremony attended by American and . Afghan forces in Kinisk village, Farah provincial police chief Agha Noor Kemtoz . said. 'As soon as they gave the weapon to Ismail to begin . training, he took the gun and opened fire toward the U.S. soldiers,' Kemtoz . said. The police chief added that he had warned U.S. forces organizing and . training the community not to move too fast to recruit in the village, which he . said is heavily influenced by the Taliban. Vulnerable: Afghan military analyst Amrullah Amman says the Taliban is infiltrating Afghan security forces 'because they see it's very easy' Afghan military analyst Amrullah Amman has no doubt that . Taliban infiltration of Afghan security forces is rising. He said that despite . new methods of screening, it's simple to forge documents and invent references . in Afghanistan. 'The gate is wide open. The enemy is infiltrating because . they see it's very easy,' Amman said. But the turncoat attacks may also reflect growing mistrust . and resentment among Afghans working with international forces. Afghan soldiers interviewed by the AP earlier this year . offered their own explanations: The Afghans feel disrespected, the soldiers . said. They complained of getting inferior equipment and condescending treatment . by Americans. In May 2011, a U.S. Army team led by a behavioral scientist . compiled a survey that indicated many Afghan security personnel found U.S. troops 'extremely arrogant, bullying and unwilling to listen to their . advice.' 'I think infiltration is easier to address, actually,' Exum . said. 'I think the worse thing is, if your entire strategy going forward from . the next three or four years depends on partnering with Afghan forces, then if . relations have already devolved to this degree, you're really worried.' The U.N. Security Council late Friday strongly condemned . coordinated terrorist attacks in various parts of the country on Tuesday and . Wednesday and reiterated its serious concern 'at threats posed by the Taliban, . al-Qaida and illegal armed groups to the local population, national security . forces, international military and international assistance efforts in . Afghanistan.'","The U.S. military has spent more than $20 billion on training and equipping a nearly 340,000-member Afghan security force .

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 10:00 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:55 EST, 20 August 2012 . A grieving son says he was forced to smash his mother’s headstone to pieces with a sledgehammer after being ordered to remove it by the church. Mark Doe, 39, and his family rushed to install the headstone on his mother Shirley’s grave in Pulborough, Sussex before Christmas. But Mr Doe said the church told him the design was too lavish because it featured three roses instead of the single one agreed, and because its finish was too shiny. In a meeting held between the Doe family and the Diocese of Chichester last Tuesday it was decided that the stone should be removed from the graveyard at St Mary’s Church in Pulborough by 4pm the following day. Cruel blow: Mark Doe, 39, felt obliged to destroy his mother's headstone . In pieces: The family were devastated to have to remove Shirley Doe's headstone after the design and finish were criticised by the church . The rarely used Church of England court is able to make decisions on such matters - so Mr Doe was obliged to obey. The father of two said he could not remove the steel brackets holding the stone in place and so was forced to take a sledgehammer to the stone, or risk breaking the law. Mr Doe, who owns a skip hire firm, said: ‘My parents have lived in Pulborough for 40 years and I think they have been treated with a lack of respect. ‘My Dad can’t even go up there any more, he is so upset. ‘As a son the last thing you want to do is be smashing up your mother’s headstone, it’s very upsetting.’ Mr Doe says he agreed on the headstone with Father Paul Welch of St Mary’s before purchasing it from a catalogue. 'Too many flowers': Mr Doe, 39, was told the headstone was too shiny and should only have one rose - even though he obeyed the rules on size . He said the headstone is exactly the size discussed, only with two extra stone roses at the top. He added: ‘They didn’t even wait for us to have a replacement ready. It feels like they didn’t care about the family's feelings. ‘There are lots of different types of headstones in the graveyard, some are black, which they aren’t supposed to be, but they haven’t been pulled down.’ Mr Doe said the original headstone cost £2,200 and he will have to pay the same again for a replacement - but added that it was ‘not about the money’. The original headstone was put up on December 21 last year after Mr Doe lost his mother in September. Father Paul Welch of St Mary’s Church directed all enquires to the Diocese of Chichester. A spokesperson for the Diocese said: 'The diocese of Chichester cannot comment on the ongoing proceedings until they are resolved.'","Mark Doe had only agreed on one rose with the priest - but chose a design that featured three .

A packed courtroom at the murder trial of a man accused of shooting dead his wife and children were shown horrific crime scene photographs as the first witness took the stand. Christopher Vaughn, of Oswego, Illinois, . is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife and three . children on June 14, 2007. He allegedly murdered his family so he could move to a remote area of Canada and live alone. He is accused of parking the van on a . road near Channahon -  40 miles southwest of Chicago - and shooting his . wife Kimberly and their children - Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11, and . eight-year-old Blake. Tragedy: Christopher and Kimberly Vaughn with their children (from left) Cassandra, Blake and Abigayle at Mrs Vaughn's graduation ceremony in Chicago . Husband and wife: Christopher Vaughn, left, was arrested five years ago . in the shooting deaths of his wife Kimberly, right, and three children . Officer Steve Weiss of the Channahon . Police Department was in court Monday as the trial began. He described finding the Vaughn family SUV with the bodies as prosecutors . displayed graphic images. Paramedic Ryan Jandura told the court . later on Monday that the accused's daughter Abigayle was found still . clutching a stuffed animal and a copy of Harry Potter. Different story: Vaughn said that his wife shot him before killing the children and committing suicide . Vaughn, wearing white shirt and dark pants with a tan jacket, showed little emotion as the images were showed to the court and refused to look at them. Members of the jury, of eight men and four women, looked visibly upset with one man wiping his eyes. Vaughn's defense team objected . several times saying that the images were left on display too long in . front of the jury. Attorney George Lenard also tried to prevent happy . pictures of the family being shown, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. According to the newspaper, Kimberly Vaughn's mother took the stand to describe the moment she knew her daughter and grandchildren had been killed. Susan Phillips told the courtroom that she saw the family's car on a TV news report and could make out her daughter's body lying in the front seat. Assistant State's Attorney Debbie Mills said  Vaughn wanted to get rid of his family so that he could move to a remote part of Canada. She told the jury that he had visited Canada a month before his family were killed to make plans. The prosecution characterized Vaughn as an 'eccentric dreamer' who spent thousands of dollars at gentlemen's clubs, according to the Chicago Tribune. Vaughn, 37, was arrested at a funeral home in suburban St Louis hours before a memorial service for his wife and children. He pleaded not guilty and insists the killings were at the hands of his wife. 'It's a case of murder-suicide,' said . Vaughn's defence attorney, George Lenard. 'Christopher Vaughn is not . responsible for the deaths.' Victims: Christopher Vaughn is accused of killing his wife and three children - (from left) Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11, Blake, eight . Murder or suicide? Christopher Vaughn's said his wife was the one who fired the fatal shots before killing herself . The trial is expected to last four to six weeks. The Vaughn deaths made headlines in . 2007 partly because the family recently had been featured in a Chicago . Sun-Times real estate article. They had moved from Washington state to the Chicago area and bought a spacious home. The article was accompanied by a . photo of the couple sitting at a dining table, their three smiling . children standing behind them. After Christopher Vaughn's arrest, prosecutors had vowed to seek the death penalty, which Illinois abolished last year. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Chuck . Pelkie, a spokesman for the Will County State's Attorney's office, . declined to discuss specifics of prosecutors' approach to the case . before trial. 'It's a case that the office is ready and eager to move forward with,' he said. 'It's been a long time.' Evidence may include a magazine article . that court records say police found at Vaughn's home about staging crime . scenes and 'making the death appear to be a suicide.' On trial: Christopher Vaughn faces life in prison if he is found guilty of the murders of his wife and three young children five years ago . Court records also revealed that Vaughn . spent time at a shooting range the night before the deaths and fired at . targets with a gun that police later found near Kimberly Vaughn in the . car. Legal proceedings also revealed that Christopher Vaughn was the beneficiary of his wife's $1million life insurance policy. In 2009, her family filed a wrongful death suit to keep him from claiming any assets. Among those could testify are an exotic dancer who Vaughn visited days before the killings. Prosecutors have said that Vaughn had lied to her about his identity and talked of the future. Vaughn's defence is expected to delve into Kimberly Vaughn's life and health, and likely will include that she was taking an anti-seizure drug at the time of her death that federal health officials have said can increase the risk of suicidal behavior. Vaughn, a computer security consultant, told police in 2007 that his wife shot him in the leg before killing the children and committing suicide. Vaughn had superficial gunshot wounds to the leg and arm. Court records show the children were each shot twice and Kimberly Vaughn was shot once under the chin. According to Christopher Vaughn's account, the family had been headed on a trip and Vaughn said that he had stopped to secure luggage on the roof of the vehicle. His wife allegedly started shooting shortly after that and he told police he fled the scene to escape.Vaughn has been held without bond in Will County. His defense lawyer said: 'He's ready for trial, he's been waiting for a long time.'","Christopher Vaughn accused of shooting dead his family by side of the road in Channahon, Illinois .

Painful: Captain Griffiths' father Brigadier Mike Griffiths talked emotionally about the death of his son . A Brigadier in the British Army has described receiving the 'dreaded knock on the door' to learn his soldier son being had been fatally wounded in Afghanistan. Brig Mike Griffiths, the most senior serving officer to lose a child in the 11-year war, spoke of the heartbreaking moment ahead of a BBC3 documentary showing the young captain's final hours on the frontline. The programme, Our War, will tonight broadcast harrowing scenes of two UK soldiers being severely injured while fighting insurgents in Helmand Province. The uncensored footage was captured on . the helmet cameras of comrades during a daring three-day operation, . codenamed Hornet's Nest, when troops were sent deep into enemy . territory. Captain Andrew Griffiths, 25, and . Kingsman Darren Deady, 22 - both from Arnhem Company, 2nd Battalion Duke . of Lancaster's Regiment - suffered terrible injuries on the mission. Both were flown home to the Queen . Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but tragically died within weeks - . Capt Griffiths on September 5, 2010, and Kingsman Deady just five days . later - with their families at their bedsides. In the programme, rarely-seen footage . shows Capt Griffiths, a highly-respected young officer on his second . tour of Afghanistan, a few moments before he stepped on a improvised . explosive device (IED) that was buried in a disused mud-walled compound. Since his son's death, Brig Griffiths . has used his personal experience of grief to train and advise casualty . notification officers whose job it is to break the news of deaths and . injuries to Army families. The 55-year-old, who commanded British . forces in Afghanistan and has seen men killed in action, said: 'We . spoke to him on the Saturday as he was preparing to go out. Scroll down to watch video . Difficult to watch: Andrew Griffiths, left, and Darren Deady, right, are . shown in the Our War documentary moments before and after they are fatally injured . 'Andrew said ""We're going on another . big one, and this could be really hard"". He couldn't say any more, and . he only told that to me. He wouldn't have told it to his mum.' The next day, Capt Griffiths stepped . on the deadly device in the Taliban stronghold of Nahr-e Saraj. Brig . Griffith's boss went to their house to inform them of his injuries. Brig Griffiths, the Army's Director . Personnel Services, said: 'I was on leave when it happened. Sue, my . wife, was about to go to work, and she was at the door when the doorbell . rang at 7.30. The door opened, and I looked over the stairs and I . realised immediately what it was. 'You could see by the grim face that this wasn't good news. A normal day in the life of a family - and then it got shattered.' He now emphasises to casualty . notification officers the importance of their role and how vital it is . to support grieving families. 'When a soldier is injured or, . tragically, has died, their families need this rock around which they . can cling in order to allow them either to grieve - and grieve properly - . and to understand,' he said. 'Or if they're wounded and making a recovery, to support them in that period because that's just as important.' Poignant: This photo captured Captain Griffiths just moments before he walked onto the mine that would eventually kill him . Brig Griffiths said the family missed . the young man every day: 'I don't think the grief will ever go away. I . think if he had survived his wounds, by now he'd have probably been . running around challenging himself, because that's what he was like, and . that's what so many of these young men are like. 'I think you learn to cope with time. But you have waves of black grief, when I think it's extremely difficult to be positive. 'We are very lucky - we have three . other children and they keep you going. And I am very lucky to have a . wife who supports me as I support her. You never forget. I don't think . there is a waking hour where I don't think and feel sad, but I know . that's what everyone who goes through a loss does. 'The one thing we find most difficult . is that we got Andrew back for 12 days. Broken and battered as he was, . if he'd lived - with the support we would have given him - he would have . had a great life.' The BBC was given fresh access to . thousands of hours of footage shot by British soldiers in Helmand, . showing some of the fiercest fighting, for the award-winning three-part . series. The images, show by the soldiers themselves, capture the chaos of war. They are not censored by the MoD. Proud moment: Brigadier Mike Griffiths pictured awarding his son Capt Andrew Griffiths with a tour of Afghanistan medal . In the film, Sergeant Mark Wilson . described the incident that injured Capt Griffiths. He said: 'I remember . screaming for the boss. I was screaming boss that high that it sounded . like a baby screaming. 'At first we didn’t realise that . anything was wrong with him, I was shouting to him, I said ""Boss are you . alright?"", he was going ""Yeah, I'm over here, I’m over here."" 'It was then we realised that he was missing his lower part of his leg.' At the time of his death, numerous colleagues left heartfelt tributes to Captain Griffiths. Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd, Commanding Officer of 2 LANCS, said: 'Captain Andy Griffiths - or 'Griff' as my officers knew him - was an officer with courage, charm, values, humility and above all else a sense of fun. He played as hard as he fought in battle. 'He was a man who loved his regiment and respected his men and all reciprocated. He will never be forgotten because none of our close regimental family will ever be able to forget him.' Witness: Sergeant Mark Wilson describes in the documentary the moment Captain Andrew Griffiths was injured . Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd added: 'His humility was his trademark when in uniform and the respect from his Lions - particularly his young Kingsmen - was genuinely the most impressive I have seen in a young officer in my twenty-four years in the infantry. 'In twelve months of deployments to central Helmand I have never seen so many soldiers requesting that their tributes be included as words that will follow my own. 'For myself it has been difficult to write my own words without fighting back a tear, I know that is also the case with my soldiers. 'A brother officer and a member of our very strong family regiment since he was a boy. 'In our regiment we have the unique honour of being 'Lions of England'. In our regiment Lions are led by Lions. Captain Andy Griffiths was one of our finest Lions. A leader of Lions, a Lion of a man.' Earlier in the documentary, one . shocking video being screened for the first time showed Kingsman Deady, . from Bolton, after he was shot through the chest. The tragic soldier, described by his . colleagues as having 'the heart of a lion', is seen lying on the floor . asking medics to 'hurry up' as they frantically try nine times to insert . a drip . Injured: Kingsman Darren Deady lies injured on the floor in Afghanistan as fellow soldier attempt to insert a drip . Footage then showed a terrifying helicopter evacuation in a sandstorm. Tragically Kingsman Deady later died on September 10 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Darren Deady, 22, left school at 16 . to join the Army and at the time of his death his family asked his . bravery was not forgotten. In a family statement, they said: 'At this moment we are experiencing the hardest times of our life. 'Darren was proud to do a job that he . loved and most of all believed in, his little brother once turned round . to him and asked him: ""why do you fight?"" and Darren simply replied; . ""To make a difference"",' they said. Colonel Boyd laid praise on Kingsmen . Deady saying he had an 'irrepressible and infectious sense of humour' and his courage would always be remembered. 'He was always the first to volunteer . for everything, to carry the heaviest load or to be first in the patrol . to clear a path for his mates,' he said. 'He loved his job and his Regiment, he loved serving with his fellow Lions in Arnhem Company.' Unique insight: The documentary will show footage, captured by the soldiers themselves, that have never before been seen by the public (stock image) Shortly after his death, commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd, Commanding Officer of 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said: 'Kingsman Darren Deady was a tiny man with the heart of a lion. 'His irrepressible and infectious sense of humour made this small man a huge character within Arnhem Company, where his courage and selflessness will always be remembered. 'He was always the first to volunteer for everything, to carry the heaviest load or to be first in the patrol to clear a path for his mates. 'No-one in my battalion was as good or as accurate with an underslung grenade launcher; he fired it time and again on two separate tours to protect the team he was ferociously loyal to. A team player, a man with a huge heart and a man with bags of humour in the face of adversity.'
