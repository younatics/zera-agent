"The daughter of a man killed when an NYPD officer  restrained him with an outlawed chokehold  is staging a 'die in' on the spot where her father was slain in a bid to cast a spotlight on police brutality. Erica Garner's father, Eric, a 43-year-old black man, died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him  in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, after arresting him for selling bootleg cigarettes on the street. She has performed the protest - in which she lies across the sidewalk using a megaphone to incite passers by to join her - twice a week since her father's death. Will not be moved: Erica Garner has been performing the protest - in which she lies across the sidewalk using a megaphone to incite passers by to join her - twice a week since her father's death on July 17 . 'Die in': She said she has performed the protest every Tuesday and Thursday for almost five months in bid to cast a spotlight on police brutality . Support: Her protests inspired dozens of New Yorkers to join her by lying down on the spot where he died . 'I feel the love and energy from around the world, but on Staten Island it's been emotionless,' the 24-year-old told the Daily News after Thursday's demonstration in front of a beauty supply store where officers confrontedMr Garner. 'I felt his spirit when I was walking down to the spot,' she added. 'I've been doing this every Tuesday and Thursday since my father's death. I do it without cameras there. I do it with cameras there, and I'm going to keep doing it.' On December 3, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict white police officer Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six. The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street. Tragic: Eric Garner (left), a 43-year-old black man, died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, after arresting him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street (right) 'I can't breathe': His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo was not indicted . In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.' They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital. His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo escaped indictment. It comes a day after it was revealed the NYPD has begun its own investigation over whether Pantaleo broke departmental rules when he arrested Garner for illegally selling cigarettes on the street, according to DNA Info. In amateur video taken of the arrest, Pantaleo appeared to put Garner in a chokehold before forcing him to the ground holding him down while he was being cuffed. Chokeholds - the controversial technique of subduing suspects by restricting their breathing - are banned by the NYPD, though Pantaleo denies using one on Garner, despite video evidence that has been widely interpreted otherwise. Fury: Chokeholds are banned by the NYPD, though Pantaleo denies using one on Garner - despite video evidence that has been widely interpreted otherwise (pictured: Erica Garner during a protest) The medical examiner found that Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and 350lbs, died of a heart attack resulting from compression of neck and of chest and 'prone positioning during physical restraint by police'. However, his asthma, obesity and other health problems were also blamed for his death. Investigators with the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau questioned Pantaleo for two hours on Monday, according to DNA Info. 'He pretty much told the same story he did to the grand jury, his actions, his thoughts, during the Garner encounter,' a police source told the news site. The 29-year-old cop has been pulled off the streets and stripped of his badge and gun pending the outcome of the investigation. He still works at the NYPD on desk duty. He has apologised to Garner's family, saying he felt 'very bad' about his death and sent his condolences. However, Garner's widow, Esaw, rejected the apology, telling a press conference on December 3: 'Hell no! The time for remorse would have been when my husband was yelling to breathe. 'No, I don't accept his apology. No, I could care less about his condolences. 'He's still working. He's still getting a paycheck. He's still feeding his kids, when my husband is six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids now.' The investigation will likely take weeks, or even months, to conclude.","Garner died on July 17 after officer Daniel Pantaleo arrested him in street .

"Stunned motorists slammed on their brakes when a high voltage power cable snapped and landed on a passing motorcyclist - causing him to instantly burst into flames. The incident happened on a main road running through Wuning county in southern China's Jiangxi province when the biker Shaiming Liang, 33, was hit on the head by the falling cable. His body instantly burst into flames and then the bike exploded, killing him in the process.

'The smoke was coming from the man, if was as if pouring out from his body and then he burst into flames. I'll never forget the sight...it's burned into my memory.' After the main electricity pylon running along the road was eventually switched off, firemen were able remove Mr Shaiming's body from the burned wreck of his vehicle.

"Glyn Ricardo Ballard, 50, was jailed for 12 years for a string of historic child sex attacks . A former children's train driver at Longleat Safari Park has been jailed for 12 years for a string of historic child sex attacks. Glyn Ricardo Ballard, 50, sexually assaulted and threatened two daughters of someone he knew in the early 1980s when the eldest sister was just 10 years old, a court heard. More than 20 years later he raped a 15-year-old girl before taking up a job at the Wiltshire safari park, where he worked on a children's ride until last year. He left before he was arrested . Ballard sexually assaulted the sisters in 1982 and raped the 15-year-old girl between May 2004 and January 2005. His victims told Winchester Crown Court that the abuse had haunted them and one said she had tried to kill herself. Just months after the rape of the 15-year-old, Ballard got a job driving Longleat Safari Park's Jungle Express train, a position he held from 2005 until 2013. Prosecuting, Philip Warren read out the victim's impact statements. One said: 'Being sexually abused as a child has caused me problems throughout life. 'I have had depression and counselling, and at the worst point I tried to commit suicide.' Another read: 'Being raped has affected my ability to make friends and relationships. I do not trust anyone and put barriers up. 'It also causes me problems if someone gets too close to me physically, or touches me, and I freeze and it brings back memories of what happened.' Defending Ballard, Fern Russell said the defendant was a teenager when the first sexual assaults happened, adding: 'He has not offended in any form for ten years.' Ballard, who was a train driver at Longleat Safari Park (pictured) until last year, sexually assaulted two sisters, when the eldest was just 10 years old, during the 1980s . Just months after raping a 15-year-old girl, Ballard got a job driving Longleat Safari Park's (pictured) Jungle Express train, which he held until last year. All the offences took place before he worked at Longleat . Ballard, of Warminster, Wiltshire, was found guilty of rape, seven counts of incident assault, one sexual assault on a girl under 16, and having sex with a minor. Judge Guy Boney QC said Ballard, who came into contact with children on a daily basis, was a danger to young girls. Jailing Ballard, the judge said: 'The bottom line is you know no boundaries where sex is concerned, apart from your own gratification. '[He was] a skilful liar and knew no boundaries. There was no doubt that he posed a risk to young girls.' Detective Constable Dave Topp of Wiltshire Poice said: 'We are satisfied with the result and we hope it will encourage other victims to come forward regardless of when offences were committed against them.'","Glyn Ricardo Ballard jailed for 12 years for historic child sex attacks .

"More the remains of more than 160 migrants who died crossing the U.S. border have been found in an unmarked mass grave in South Texas. Bodies at Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias were found in shopping bags, trash bags or no bags at all. Skulls were dumped in bio-hazard bags and buried separately from the rest of the remains. Some bodies were piled on top of each other, other even found in the same bag. One set of remains was found wrapped in a kitchen garbage bag stuffed in a a plastic shopping bag that said 'Dignity' - a slogan from a funeral home. The remains are believed to be migrants who died in the brush after illegally making the dangerous trek across the U.S.-Mexico border 80 miles south of Falfurrias. Most were found in states of decay by local sheriff's deputies. Many of the remains were found under . simple markers bearing the name of local funeral home Funeraria del . Angel Howard-Williams.

Puzzle: Many of the bodies were buried together in bags and piled on top of each other, making it difficult to determine how many people were buried there . Disgraceful: A human skull and clothing that were discovered by the U.S. Border Patrol while on patrol at a ranch near Falfurrias, Texas are set aside for the members of the Brooks County Sheriffís department to collected during their investigation into the death . The funeral home and its corporate owners in Houston, Service Corporation International, refused to confirm whether Howard-Williams was responsible for the burials. Bishop Emeritus René Gracida of the Diocese of Corpus Christi told the Caller-Times that the burials were 'truly anti-civilized' and 'barbaric.' Immigrant advocates are furious. Eddie Canales told the newspaper that even in death, the immigrants were denied the proper respect. 'I think it’s very hard for people to connect in the fact that these were human beings,' he said. 'It just goes to the language, to the words, and words mean a lot: ""All these were illegals.""' Now, the Texas Rangers have launched an investigation into the burials and a state representative has said the discovery could result in criminal charges. 'It’s an . absolute disgrace and disrespectful,' State Representative Terry . Canales, who represents the district which Falfurrias is a part of, told . Fox News. 'No matter what side of the borders they are from, these are human beings. 'It’s no excuse to disrespect someone in the way these bodies were.' Canales . has filed a request to be given access to Brooks County's financial . records to see the amount of funds spent on burying the 162 bodies . exhumed so far, he told the network. The bodies are believed to be migrants who died during the dangerous illegal border crossing between the United States and Mexico . Awful: Three sets of remains wait to be picked up after they were exhumed last week by members of the Baylor University forensic team at the Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias, Texas . Untimely deaths: A forensic anthropology team from Baylor University place the remains of unidentified immigrants exhumed from a cemetery on May 21, 2013 in Falfurrias, Texas . 'Without question there was some sort of fraudulent act,' he insisted. The Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement Monday saying investigators from the Texas Rangers have also become involved in an investigation into improprieties. 'The Texas Rangers discussed the situation with Brooks County officials today,' an official said. 'Another meeting is scheduled tomorrow in Austin with a variety of local and state officials to determine the proper course of action.' The . discovery was initially made two weeks ago by Baylor University . anthropologist Lori Baker and Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist at . the University of Indianapolis, and their students. The . group was working as part of a multi-year effort to identify immigrants . who have died in the area near the U.S.-Mexico border. They exhumed 110 unidentified people from the cemetery in 2013. This summer, researchers have performed 52 exhumations, but because some remains were stored together, further study will be needed to determine exactly how many bodies have been recovered, Baker said. Proper burial: The bodies will be examined and cross-checked with DNA sent from Mexico and Central American countries, with the goal of reuniting the remains with families . Unclaimed bodies: Teams from Baylor University and the University of Indianapolis are exhuming the bodies of more than 50 immigrants who died, mostly from heat exhaustion, while crossing illegally from Mexico into the United States .

Brooks . and Jim Hogg county officials said they pay the funeral home to handle . bodies recovered in the remote parts of South Texas, an area that's . often deadly for immigrants from Mexico and Central America who set out . on foot through ranchlands amid sweltering temperatures to avoid a . nearby U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint. More . than 300 people died crossing through Brooks County alone between 2011 . to 2013 - representing more than 50 per cent of the deaths in Texas' sprawling Rio Grande Valley. Brooks County Chief Deputy Benny Martinez said the funeral home charges $450 to handle each body. County Judge Raul Ramirez said it been handling such remains for at least 16 years. Chief Sheriff's Deputy Lorenzo Benavides in neighboring Jim Hogg County says the practice has been going there as long as he can remember, at least 22 years. A message left Saturday at Howard-Williams was not immediately returned. The funeral home referred the newspapers' questions to its parent company, Houston-based Service Corporation International. Texas Democratic state Rep. Terry Canales said Sunday, June 22, 2014, that the graves should be secured by state police until a criminal investigation can be completed .

McDunn . said the funeral home has 'certain records related to these burials, . but this does not amount to confirmation that Howard-Williams was . involved in depositing the remains in the manner the researchers . described.' The funeral home would not give the newspaper access to those records. Still, Latham called the discovery appalling. Baker said bodies that were not already skeletonized before burial were found in varying states of decomposition. 'To me it's just as shocking as the mass grave that you would picture in your head, and it's just as disrespectful,' Latham told the Caller Times.","Researchers have discovered a mass grave they believe contains the bodies of immigrants who died crossing the border .

"The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven. Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.' The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine. Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square . The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls. Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.' The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society. The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries. Pet owners will welcome the Pope's remarks that their beloved dogs, cats, horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven . Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China. The exiled Tibetan leader  requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China. The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope. But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'. The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife. Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth . But it is perhaps  unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals. It's not the first time  Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy. The leader is seen as more liberal than his predecessors and his lenient positions on homosexuality and unwed couples have caused a stir in the conservative members of the church.","Leader of the Catholic Church said 'all of God's creatures' can go to heaven .

"A grandfather has been praised for his heroic actions after he overpowered a masked, gun-wielding thug who was raiding his 94-year-old neighbour's home. Bernard Ryan, 68, put a glass to the wall after hearing cries from the elderly woman, and overheard her telling him there was no more money in the house. Realising she was in danger, the retired joiner rushed from his home and wrestled career criminal Phillip Gaskell to the floor, ignoring the pistol being brandished in his face - and the trigger pulled. A judge praised Mr Ryan's heroic actions after jailing Gaskell, 48, for 12 years at Leeds Crown Court. Hero: Bernard Ryan (left) rushed to his elderly neighbour's aid after overhearing the robbery. He overpowered thief Phillip Gaskell (right) - despite being threatened with a gun - and held the criminal until officers arrived . Mr Ryan said: 'I didn't really have time to think about what I was doing, I just did it. 'I just thought, how dare anyone do that? How could somebody be so low?' The court heard how heard the victim was at home with her carer, Jannae Bezundenhoug, on October 30, when Gaskell, wearing a balaclava, knocked on the door. Christopher Moran, prosecuting, said he forced his way in and told Miss Bezundenhoug 'shut up or you're going to die' when she started screaming. As he demanded cash, Miss Bezundenhoug ran to the elderly woman and hugged her, but Gaskell ordered them into the living room and pushed the elderly woman to the floor. He rifled through her belongings before telling her: 'If you haven't got any cash get me your jewellery.' The court heard the carer tried to put Gaskell in a headlock and stuck her fingers in his eye. Mr Moran said Gaskell told her: 'That's the biggest mistake you're going to make for the rest of your life.' Sentenced: Gaskell was jailed for 12 years at Leeds Crown Court (pictured) after he forced his way into the home of a 94-year-old woman. The court heard that the pensioner no longer felt safe at home . But help was at hand when retired joiner Mr Ryan, who was at home with his wife Marlene, heard shouting coming from next door. Concerned for his neighbour, Mr Ryan dashed out of his home and went round to his neighbour's home - where he was immediately confronted by Gaskell, who pointed the gun at him. He said: 'It sounds silly, but we put a glass to the wall to try to work out what was being said. 'It worked - we could hear them shouting 'there's no more money in the house'.' 'I didn't have a second to be frightened. 'His big mistake was pulling the trigger, because then it was obvious it wasn't real. We got each other in a kind of bear hug and were wrestling and rolling around. 'I'm much bigger than him and I managed to get him into the bedroom and pin him down. He starting saying he had asthma and was going to have an attack.' The elderly woman then grabbed a hammer and started hitting Gaskell with it. Police arrived within minutes and took him away. The court heard the pensioner no longer felt safe at home, while the carer was too terrified to return to look after her. Gaskell, who has several robbery convictions, admitted two offences of attempted robbery and possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear. Judge Christopher Batty commended Mr Ryan and Miss Bezundenhoug as he sentenced 'dangerous' Gaskell, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, to 12 years with an extended period of five years on licence. Praising Mr Ryan, the judge said: 'Your behaviour on that day was incredibly brave. Your fearless determination not only prevented more serious emotional trauma for both these ladies but brought this man to book.' He awarded £250 from public funds to Mr Ryan and Miss Bezundenhoug in recognition of their bravery. Following the sentence, Mr Ryan said: 'I'm not normally the sort of person who would see something kicking off and automatically jump in, but I'd like to think I'd do the same again.'

The Grinch who stole Christmas cash: Thief caught on CCTV taking money which was going to be spent on children's Christmas party . A career criminal, nicknamed 'the Grinch,' was behind bars after being caught on CCTV stealing money  raised for a children's Christmas party. Andrew Woodrup, 35, snatched more than £300 collected by a community centre  to fund the celebration and buy each child a small gift. Heartbroken volunteers, who discovered the theft, feared they would have to cancel the annual event at Burnley Wood Community Centre in Burnley, Lancashire, for up to 50 children. Woodrup, who has clocked up more than 100 previous offences, had only just been released from prison when he carried out the raid on November 26. The CCTV footage shows him prowling around the centre before helping himself to two money boxes in the main office. Andrew Woodrup,35, was starting a 26 week prison sentence for stealing more than £300 raised by a community centre in Burnley, Lancashire, to fund a children's Christmas party. He was caught after being recognised from the CCTV footage . Jobless Woodrup, who started breaking into houses at 13 and was hooked on drugs by 15,  was jailed for 26 weeks at Pennine Magistrates Court after admitting theft. Magistrates' heard that he was identified through CCTV footage and footprints that were left at the scene. When he was arrested  he initially claimed not to remember committing the offence, before later owning up. He has now written an apology to the centre and claims he wants to repay the stolen money. Mark Williams, defending, said Woodrup of Burnley, had lost his methadone prescription and lapsed back into taking heroin. Speaking after the sentence, centre volunteer Karen Heseltine, 48, said: 'Anybody who steals is bad enough, but to steal from your own community and the local children is absolutely disgusting. 'He is like the Grinch who came in and stole Christmas from the kids.' Thanks to an urgent appeal the community have managed to raise enough money for the party to go ahead as planned.","Thieves targeted the lights in the garden of Julia's House in Poole, Dorset .

"The abused flight attendant who was attacked and berated by an airline executive when he failed to serve her nuts in a bowl on a flight from New York to South Korea is sharing his story. Screaming Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at the airline and daughter of the airline's chairman, angrily demanded the removal of the crew member, Park Chang-jin, from the flight when he gave her macadamia nuts in a bag. She then forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal at New York's JFK Airport to kick the junior flight attendant off the plane. Now, Chang-jin has revealed that several officials from Korean Air asked him to deny the incident ever happened. Scroll down for video . Cho Hyun-ah, a senior vice-president at Korean Air, apologised for delaying a plane leaving New York's JFK Airport over the way she was served nuts . Korean Air Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure from when Cho lost her temper at the unidentified worker after they broke protocol and placed the a bag of macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, instead of putting them in a bowl . Cho demanded that the attendant bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered pilots to turn the plane around so he could get off the flight . 'People who haven't experienced will not understand that feeling of being insulted and shamed,' Chang-jin told a South Korean television station on Friday. He said after being berated by  Hyun-ah, he and a fellow flight attendant actually dropped to their knees in front of the woman begging for forgiveness, this as she 'poked the back of his hand with a corner of the flight manual book several times.' Because she is the daughter of the chairman, he says he had no choice but to follow her orders, returning the plane and deboarding, taking a separate flight home. When he got home however, 'five to six officials from Korean Air came to visit his home every day and asked him to give a false account to authorities of what happened.' What's more, they 'asked him to tell investigators that Cho did not use abusive language and that he voluntarily got off the plane.' Clad in a long black coat, with her head bowed in shame Hyun-ah told reporters in an almost inaudible, trembling voice on Friday that she was 'sorry' about the December 5 incident. 'I sincerely apologize.' she said, gloomy-faced, adding that she will 'apologize sincerely' at a meeting with the victimized crew member. Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behavior 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he didn't raise her better. He added that his eldest would resign from her executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air. Korean Air Lines had earlier excused her behavior even as it apologized for inconveniencing passengers. It said it was 'natural' for Cho to fault crew's ignorance of procedures . Flight 86 was already on the runway for its departure when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class. Furious that he had not followed protocol and presented them in a dish she screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him to get off the flight. 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times at the time. Cho's father, the chairman of Korean Air called his daughter foolish and said he regretted not raising her better: Cho Yang-ho also the public for forgiveness. Transport ministry officials are now checking whether she violated aviation safety law . Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant, delaying the flight by around 20 minutes. Her entitled actions caused an uproar in her home country and abroad. South Korean media called the 40-year-old a princess and while others branded her an embarrassment to her country. Earlier this week, Cho resigned as Korean Air's head of cabin service but retained other executive roles at the airline and its affiliated companies. In a separate probe, prosecutors searched the headquarters of Korean Air Lines on Thursday after a civil society group laid a complaint about Cho's behavior on the plane. Korean Air Lines had earlier excused her behavior even as it apologized for inconveniencing passengers.

"Australia's largest native title claim covering much of the Cape York peninsula in Queensland's far north has been lodged in the Federal Court in Brisbane. The claim covers 14.6 million hectares of land, a larger area than all of England, taking in all of the areas of the Cape not already under native title as well as some inland waters. The Cape York Land Council lodged the claim on Thursday on behalf of nine traditional owners. If finalised - a process expected to take several years - it will mean that all significant activity, including mining and development, will require consent from traditional owners. A landscape near Lakefield, Cape York, which is part of the largest native title claim in Australian history lodged in the Federal Court in Brisbane on Thursday . The claim covers 14.6 million hectares of land, a larger area than all of England, taking in all of the areas of the Cape not already under native title as well as some inland waters . 'This means the traditional owners of the Cape will be the real masters of development and use of their lands,' Cape York Land Council chair Richie Ah Mat said in a statement. Indigenous people will be able to reconnect with country as well as grow the local economy, reducing welfare dependency, he says. Mr Ah Mat says individual groups will still have a say over their land. Olkola elder Mike Ross, one of the claimants, says it will allow Aboriginal people to make decisions over their ancestral lands. 'Coupled with the transfer of freehold, this native title claim makes our historic ties to the land clear,' he said, adding that the region was under pressure from miners and other interest groups.

Mr Lockley, from NSW in Australia, pleaded not guilty to interfering with a crew member in October, arguing he was trying to get into the toilet and was confused because he was having a panic attack.

Mr Lockley was taken into custody by a full squad of Indonesian police and army officers .

She also accepted that he was suffering from an undetermined medical condition. Lockley said he 'definitely had a panic attack'. He told reporters outside court, 'I am very relieved ... I never tried to get in anywhere, it was a big misunderstanding. 'It's been a lot of stress for myself and my family. We're all very, very happy.

"The edges are scuffed and some of the scarlet leather is peeling. But the lock and key still work beautifully, the inside is immaculate and you cannot fail to feel the hand of history the moment you grab the handle. For there, inscribed in gold on the front, is the name: ‘The Rt Hon Winston S Churchill, MP’. And next week, it could be yours. Scroll down for video . Balancing act: Winston Churchill amuses his daughter Mary in 1943. Mary died last year aged 91 . How on earth do you value the Despatch Box of a man who is regularly voted the greatest politician/Briton/leader of all time? How, for that matter, do you value his paintings — or the tiny silver spoons which his pet budgerigars used to play with on the dining room table? These questions will be answered next week when the greatest single collection of Churchillian memorabilia comes under the hammer in a historic sale expected to pull in everyone from international art dealers to the car-boot sale crowd. This delightful hotch-potch of treasures — what curators call ‘Churchilliana’ — contains some lots priced as low as £15 and others heading for £1 million. Because quite apart from being the man who led Britain through her darkest hour and on to victory, Churchill was also a genuinely accomplished artist. The sale follows the death, earlier this year, of his youngest child, Mary Soames, at 91. Commander of a wartime ack-ack battery, she went on to become her father’s aide-de-camp and the diligent custodian of his memory for the best part of half a century. A Toby jug featuring Winston Churchill is displayed at Sotheby's, in London . She was also a distinguished public figure in her own right, as an author, chairman of the National Theatre and chatelaine of Government House in Rhodesia (where her late husband, Lord Soames, was the last governor). Only three non-royal women in history have been admitted to the Order of the Garter and Lady Soames was one of them. With the sale of her West London home, her worldly goods are now being dispersed. Some items, including 38 of her father’s paintings, have been left to the nation for display at Chartwell, the family home now maintained by the National Trust. Other pieces have been distributed among Lady Soames’s five children and their families. But the remainder — ranging from a £15 stainless steel bell and a perfectly ordinary £200 sofa to some of Churchill’s finest canvases — will be sold at Sotheby’s on Wednesday in this grandest of house clearances.

The War Cabinet Jug by Comyms & Son 1942 (left) and a portrait of Winston Churchill by Sir Oswald Birley 1950 . Given the eclectic nature of the sale, the auctioneers are calling it, simply, Daughter Of History. The art world will be watching works like Winston’s The Goldfish Pool At Chartwell, a Churchillian homage to the French Impressionists and widely regarded as one of his greatest paintings for its rich tones, depth and bold, sensuous brush-strokes. Churchill certainly thought so himself, picking it out for a special mention in his 1948 book, Painting As A Pastime. ‘He adored Chartwell — and he was the only one allowed to feed the goldfish. Anything from Chartwell is extremely personal,’ explains Sotheby’s Head of Modern Art, Frances Christie, who has put an estimate of £400,000 to £600,000 on the work, though it could go for considerably more. In 2007, Sotheby’s sold another Chartwell scene to a private collector for £1 million. Among the 15 oil paintings in this sale, there is one of Chartwell’s walled garden, which Churchill built himself, some of Blenheim Palace, his grandfather’s ancestral seat, and a dazzling vision of the harbour at Cannes. Put together, the whole 256-lot show is conservatively valued at around £5 million.

Winston Churchill's 75th birthday present (left) and a signed photograph of Franklin Roosevelt . But my gaze instantly lands on that battered Despatch Box. It’s neither the one he had as Chancellor nor as Prime Minister, but those are both national treasures on permanent public display. This one, engraved with his earlier Cabinet title, ‘Secretary of State For The Colonies’, is the only one the rest of us might ever own. I imagine it will exceed its catalogue estimate — £5,000-£7,000. There will surely be a few politicians chasing this thing. Just last year, MPs were ordered to desist from the superstitious habit of touching ‘Churchill’s foot’ before a major speech as Sir Winston’s statue in the Members’ Lobby was starting to deteriorate. You certainly wouldn’t need to bother rubbing his shoes if you had his Despatch Box. Just stick a copy of your speech in there to cook for a few minutes and — hey presto! — out pops an oratorical masterpiece. Another box with a history is the 1930 yew and ivory-mounted cigar humidor from Asprey (estimated price: £1,500). Lady Soames, it turns out, not only inherited her father’s love of cigars, puffing away long into old age, but also competed with him. ‘I have vivid memories of my mother and Grandpapa seeing who could get the longest tail on the end of their cigar before it fell off,’ recalls Emma Soames, Churchill’s granddaughter. A sales tag is displayed on an item in the upcoming Daughter of History sale at Sotheby's . Birthday card signed from Toby to Winston (left.) Toby was the 'clever' budgie at Chartwell. His grandchildren made this as a birthday present. Right, the silver Racing Pony Trophy Cup won by Mary in 1940 . Emma also recalls the ever-expanding menagerie at Chartwell. ‘Once something arrived, it stayed,’ she laughs. A particular favourite was a budgerigar called Toby who would be brought out of his cage after lunch and encouraged to walk up and down the table and grab the spoons out of the salt cellars with his beak. ‘I was three when I first saw this and was absolutely riveted. Grandpapa was much amused by it all.’ In 1960, the grandchildren even produced a montage purporting to be a birthday card from this multi-talented bird. ‘From Toby Churchill To Winston, November 30, 1960’ it says beneath some pretty bird scenes. Ostensibly valued at £40, it will surely go for substantially more. Churchill was even more fond of his cats. To this day, in accordance with his wishes, there is a marmalade cat called Jock on the Chartwell payroll. Named after Churchill’s private secretary, Jock Colville, the current incumbent is Jock VI. But this sale offers touching reminders of Jock’s predecessor — Tango. Churchill was besotted with Tango — or ‘Mr Cat’ as he called him. In her book, A Daughter’s Tale, Mary Soames noted: ‘He became the apple of my father’s eye. He had the cream from a saucer (sitting on a chair or on the table).’ When ‘Mr Cat’ was run over by a car in 1942, in the same week as the fall of Tobruk, the PM’s staff were instructed not to tell him until there was better news from the battlefront to soften the blow. A workman finishes recreating Winston Churchill's room, filled with his posssessions at Sotheby's, in London . A regular visitor to Chartwell was the distinguished artist, Sir William Nicholson, who first turned up in 1933 to paint a portrait of Winston and his wife, Clementine, and became a family friend. He would also enjoy sketching ‘Mr Cat’ and then sent the family the results. Several such portraits of Tango are in the sale, accompanied by inscriptions such as: ‘My love to your cat, please. WN.’ Apart from being a prolific painter, Churchill must have been the subject of more paintings than any other 20th century politician. Of all of them, Mary Soames’s favourite was Sir Oswald Birley’s 1950 portrait of Winston in one his trademark ‘siren’ boiler suits. Bids will start at the £100,000 mark. There are plenty of books here, too. Churchill’s literary prowess rubbed off on Mary who would write several tomes herself, including an award-winning biography of her mother. The sale includes a bound volume of Churchill’s early wartime speeches signed: ‘Mary, from Papa March 1941.’ It is expected to fetch upwards of £3,500. Given the eclectic nature of the sale, the auctioneers are calling it, simply, Daughter Of History. For those on a tighter budget, there is a first edition of the 48-page Eagle comic strip — bound in red leather — called The Happy Warrior: The Life Of Sir Winston Churchill (starting price: £500). And in among it all is a delightful reminder that even the greatest leaders can leave the most important issues to the last minute. It would seem that on Clementine’s 70th birthday, in 1955, Churchill failed to get a card. Instead, we find a piece of Downing Street stationery hastily inscribed: ‘With many happy returns from W.’ Underneath it, however, is a little drawing of a pig, Clementine’s nickname for her husband. It must have gone down well for, rather than ending up in the bin, it ended up in a frame, along with the envelope. Bids will start at £2,000. This no ordinary auction. Tomorrow, Sotheby’s will assemble historians, members of the family and Churchillian actor Edward Fox, plus his own daughter, actress Emilia Fox, for a day of readings and reminiscences about the special bond between Winston and his doting daughter. As Britain prepares to mark next month’s 50th anniversary of Churchill’s state funeral, it is a reminder that the spell which the old boy managed to cast over his country remains as strong as ever.","Greatest collection of Churchillian memorabilia to go on sale at Sotheby's .

"A Myanmar court has denied a New Zealand bar manager bail after he was arrested for allegedly insulting Bhuddism in Facebook marketing for his nightspot in the capital Yangon. Philip Blackwood, general manager of the newly opened VGastro tapas bar and nightclub, posted a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police on Wednesday, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. 'They were trying to promote the bar. Buddha grabs people's interest... however, Buddhists cannot accept it,' a police official told reporters. The trio appeared in court on Thursday and were remanded in custody until the next hearing on December 18, when they will face two charges of breaching the country's Religion Act. New Zealand national Philip Blackwood, center, is escorted by Myanmar police officers following a court appearance in Yangon, Myanmar. Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested for allegedly insulting Buddhism after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's facebook page . According to the Act, anyone who attempts to insult, destroy or damage any religion can be punished by a maximum of two years in jail, with another two-year penalty for those who try to insult religion through the written word. 'It is a no-bail offence,' Judge Ye Lwin said. 'We will give you the right of defence on December 18.' Around 30 monks and 20 ordinary citizens gathered at the court on Thursday. 'The whole public was insulted by the posting of the improper Buddha photograph,' a monk called Thusita from the Burmese Patriot Monks Union told reporters. 'We will wait and see what action the authorities take. We will do what we need to, if the authorities do not take action,' he added.

VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . The image was quickly removed from the Facebook page and replaced by an apology from VGastro Management expressing 'sincere regret' for having offended 'the citizens of this wonderful city.' 'Our ignorance is embarrassing for us,' read the statement. But the apology attracted a slew of angry comments from Burmese social media users including one which decried the bar management as 'utterly unprofessional and culturally insensitive.' V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks ago. swiftly deleted the insulting image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . The arrests come as Myanmar grapples with a growing Buddhist nationalist movement, spearheaded by extremist monks who have urged boycotts of Muslim shops and proposed a raft of laws to restrict religious freedoms. Their rise has accompanied several bouts of religious violence between Muslims and Buddhists. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","A New Zealand man has been arrested in Myanmar for allegedly insulting Buddhism in Facebook advertising for the Yangon bar he managed .

"Singer songwriter Viktoria Modesta, who will feature in an advertising spot paid for by Channel 4 during Sunday night's X Factor final . Channel 4 is to blow £200,000 on an advertising spot during the X Factor final which will feature a disabled singer as an alternative to 'painfully dull and manufactured' pop music. The promotional ad will be screened on ITV on Sunday night in front of an expected 10million viewers, who will be tuning in to see which of the three finalists will be crowned the winner. It will show singer and model Viktoria Modesta, who wears a prosthetic leg, in the video for her Lady Gaga-style song Prototype. The ad is being funded by Channel 4, who say they have given the singer the opportunity to showcase her latest song during the final as there are no other stars in the music industry with prosthetics. Latvian-born Miss Modesta, who describes herself as a singer-songwriter, took the radical decision at the age of 20 to undergo a below the knee amputation to her left-leg to ease her mobility following an injury during birth. The 26-year-old, who says she has been approached by X Factor but turned them down, said: 'For a long time, pop culture closed its doors on me as an amputee and alternative artist. 'I think people have always found it hard to know what to think or feel about an amputee who wasn't trying to be an Olympian. 'In sports, ‘overcoming' a disability makes you a hero, but in pop there is no place for these feelings. I have never felt comfortable thinking of myself as disabled and this has inspired me to actively challenge old-fashioned views and create a platform in mainstream pop-culture, with other artists, where I have always known I belonged.' The singer also took part in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Paralympic Games and says the song Prototype shines a light on stigma, questions normal ideas of sex and beauty and celebrates being different. An edited version of the song's video will be shown during an X Factor ad break and features Miss Modesta sitting on a throne before it shows a young girl pulling the leg off her doll after watching a cartoon version of the singer. It also shows her dancing around in elaborate outfits and being interrogated by soldiers. The ad is also part of Channel 4's Born Risky initiative, which also ran the 'Superhumans' campaign during the 2012 London Paralympics. The ad will show an edited version of Miss Modesta's video to her song Prototype, which she says shines a light on the stigma surrounding disability. Channel 4 say the ad is aimed at showing how 'painfully dull' and 'manufactured' pop music is today . John Allison, joint head of 4Creative, said: 'We wanted to build on the legacy of the Paralympics work so we asked ourselves, ""Why are there no disabled pop artists?""' 'Pop stars these days are painfully dull and manufactured. Viktoria embodies our governmental remit of championing alternative voices and establishing new talent.' While Dan Brooke from Channel 4 added: 'Channel 4 was born to be different: to offer alternative perspectives and to take creative risks, especially with new talent. The ad will be shown on Sunday night during the X Factor final, which will see Andrea Faustini, Ben Haenow and Fleur East compete to become champion . 'In a world of homogenised pop, Viktoria is those values in a nutshell. We are honoured to help her develop her career and change attitudes to disability in the process.' Although Channel 4 is a publicly-owned broadcaster, it does not receive any public cash and is funded by its commercial activity, such as advertising. They have a remit to be innovative, experimental and distinctive.","Channel 4 has paid for the ad to be shown during Sunday's X Factor final .

"Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted spending £10,000 a time on portraits of politicians was 'chicken feed' The huge bill for taxpayer-funded portraits of politicians has been dismissed as 'chicken feed' by a wealthy Tory MP. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the committee which commissions paintings, photographs and sculptures of MPs and peers, said the average £10,000 for each artwork was just a fraction of the overall cost of running Parliament. He claimed many politicians are too 'shy and retiring' to sit for a portrait, but after a backlash against the £250,000 cost of portraits of the likes of Tony Blair, John Bercow and Diane Abbott, he admitted 'some are better than others'. The . spending spree since 1995 included £11,750 for an apparently topless painting of Labour’s . Diane Abbott – the same amount as was spent on a full-sized statue of . Baroness Thatcher. Other . works include an £11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary Margaret . Beckett, a £10,000 portrait of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan . Smith, an £8,000 painting of Kenneth Clarke and a £4,000 oil painting of . Foreign Secretary William Hague. Labour left-wingers Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner had portraits commissioned which cost £2,000 and £2,180 respectively. The . bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since . 1995 and approved by the Speakers’ Advisory Committee on Works of Art. Today Mr Rees-Mogg, a former investment banker, sparked outrage as he defended the spending. 'I’m all for saving money, saving money right, left and centre, but this is chicken feed,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It’s about £10,000 a year on administrative costs of the House of Commons of £200m. It hardly even ranks as chicken feed.' But Labour MP Stephen Pound hit back: 'He must have some very well fed chickens! 'For a man who has his own personal portrait gallery, I suppose he has a different perspective. But to described that as chickenfeed shows someone who is more than a little out-of-touch,' he told the Evening Standard. The huge sums were signed-off by the little-known committee of MPs which each year asks some of the . country’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues. This striking portrait of Diane Abbott was produced by artist tuart Pearson Wright in 2004 . Former Tory PM Sir John Major and Labour's Tony Blair have both been captured on canvas by Parliament - paid for by the taxpayer . Jacob Rees-Mogg is widely regarded as the poshest man in politics. He cracks jokes in Latin, mixes quotes from Shakespeare's Henry V and children's TV show Bagpuss and once casually dropped the word ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ into a debate on the pay of EU staff. The 44-year-old son of late Times editor Lord William Rees-Mogg was elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010. He read the Financial Times at the age of eight, and at 11 turned a £50 inheritance into £3,5000 on the stock market. He once boasted that he would be ‘a millionaire at 20, a multi-millionaire at 40 and Prime Minister at 70, when I’ve made enough money to be able to afford to waste some on politics’. He is observed with trashy US soap Dallas. Speaking in March last year he said the people he’d most like to meet are: ‘Margaret Thatcher, the Queen, Geoffrey Boycott and Larry Hagman, in that order.’ But he is perhaps better known for once campaigning with his Nanny in a Bentley when standing for election in Fife in 1997. Except he denies it was a Bentley: 'Oh, no. That was wrong. Well, the Nanny bit is right. Of course she came canvassing; she’s part of the family after all — she’s been with us 47 years. 'But we took my mother’s Mercedes Estate. I don’t think a Bentley’s a suitable campaigning car. As much as anything it was the petrol consumption: six miles to the gallon,' he said last year. But Mr Rees-Mogg insisted many senior politicians were reluctant to be the subject of artworks. 'You may be surprised to know that quite a number of people we think should be painted are very shy and retiring about it. 'You’d . think politicians would be desperate to be immortalised for history, . but actually we’re a more diffident lot than you might have thought.' Some . of the paintings have been mocked for their quality, including a . portrait of Mr Blair with an over-large head and a striking image of . Miss Abbott which is almost unreconisable. Mr Rees-Mogg accepted the works vary in quality: 'As . with all portrait painting, some are going to be better than others, . but some are really very wonderful pieces of work when they are finally . produced and will remain in the Houses of Parliament, perhaps, for a . thousand years. And so it is an important part of our history.' He added that the selection of some subjects was 'almost automatic' including former prime ministers, Commons Speakers and people 'who are the first to do things', including Miss Abbott, the first black woman elected to Parliament. But far . from recording only those who reach high office, it has also ordered . works featuring left-wing firebrand Dennis Skinner, photographs of SNP . MP Pete Wishart and a series of pictures have been taken of the . committee themselves. The . House of Commons insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in . recent years, but the details reveal the scale of the spending from . records dating back to 1995. And some MPs have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost. Three paintings commissioned to mark . the 2001 election feature Mr Blair and his opponents, Tory leader . William Hague and Lib Dem Charles Kennedy. The piece cost £6,000. Mr Blair later for a separate portrait by Phil Hale, which was criticised for showing the Labour PM with an over-large head. A . painting of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith came cost . £10,000, £8,000 for Minister Without Portfolio Kenneth Clarke and £4,000 . for Foreign Secretary William Hague. The . bill for Labour's Diane Abbott’s striking – apparently topless – . portrait came to £11, - the same amount as was spent on a full-sized . statue of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. A . painting of long-serving backbencher Dennis Skinner cost £2,180 while . Labour's Tony Benn and former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown both . cost £2,000 and another of the party's former leaders, Sir Menzies . Campbell, cost £10,346. A life-size statue of Margaret Thatcher, which stands in the Member's Lobby of Parliament, cost the same as the Diane Abbott portrait . Trio: In 2001 the three main party leaders were painted to mark the general election by Jonathan Yeo, including (left to right) Labour's Tony Blair, Lib Dem Charles Kennedy and Tory William Hague . Grandee: Tory former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who is now a minister without portfolio, was painted by James Lloyd in 2007 . Jonathan . Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘While the . public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded . the honour of a painting or bust in Parliament, it would certainly seem . that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to . identifying subjects. ‘Regularly . splashing out four or five-figure sums for these portraits has the . whiff of an expensive vanity project, for which unwitting taxpayers are . footing the bill. ‘When . photographs are so much cheaper than paintings, politicians need to . think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their . friends on canvas, or even in bronze.’ A . portrait of Commons Speaker John Bercow cost £22,000 to commission, . with an extra £15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with . other paintings in the Speaker's House. Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has been feature three times, in a £1,500 portrait in 1997, an £8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £9,000 bronze bust in 2000.

Commons Speaker John Bercow spent £22,000 on the painting (left) and another £15,000 on a frame including the creation of a coat of arms (right) The costs were revealed by a Freedom of Information request by the Evening Standard. Decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, a cross-party group that is currently chaired by Labour's Frank Doran. From 1995 to 2000 just three MPs were chosen to be featured in a portrait, at an average cost of £3,375. But from 2000-05, 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £7,180. Between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £9,300 each. A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Parliamentary Art Collection at the House of Commons records those who have made a significant contribution to UK political life over the centuries and in each parliament the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection. ‘In recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn. This is part of the House's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014-15.’","Jacob Rees-Mogg defends portraits costing £10,000 each .

"Admiral Lord West said he was sure there was the 'odd case' where agents knew about torture . British spies may have been aware of torture carried out by the CIA, a former security minister admitted last night. In the most frank official acceptance yet of potential complicity, Lord West of Spithead accepted there may have been the ‘odd case’ where UK agents knew of mistreatment and may even have been in the building when it happened. His comments heaped pressure on David Cameron to order a full judicial inquiry into Britain’s awareness of the barbaric interrogation techniques practised by American agents and exposed by this week’s incendiary US Senate report. Lord West, who was security minister between 2007 and 2010, told the BBC: ‘Looking back historically, if you are an agent embedded in some foreign country and this was going on, it was quite difficult for them to extricate themselves even though they weren’t implementing that torture. ‘So I’m sure there may be the odd case where an agent was aware what the Americans were doing, but that has now been sealed off because they are very clear now what the position is.’ Campaigners said his comments proved the need for a full judicial inquiry to get to the truth about Britain’s involvement in torture. They said the promised probe by MPs on the Commons intelligence and security committee would not be able to get to the facts. John McTernan, a former senior adviser to Tony Blair, said: ‘If the US can come clean, why can’t we? If this is not done, then a suspicion hangs over our security services. We have a right to know. ‘But the traditional UK parliamentary scrutiny is inadequate – the intelligence and security committee is not up to it. Having failed to rise to the occasion after the Snowden leaks and the question of GCHQ’s role in monitoring citizens, the ISC surely has no credibility in looking into this. ‘Britain does have a process for investigating issues like this – it’s a Royal Commission.’ Tom Davies of Amnesty said: ‘We need to know precisely what was done in our name. The British public is tired of being fobbed off with lies, half-truths and inadequate investigations. ‘Nothing short of an independent, judge-led inquiry will draw a line under this shameful chapter. ‘The UK is acting like it’s afraid to turn over the rock for fear of what it will find underneath.’ The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  report said 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times . There is already chaos in Whitehall over the extent of ministerial contact with the Senate committee and growing fears that the Government lobbied to keep Britain out of the report. It contained no mention of any of the UK security and intelligence agencies when it was published, despite Britain’s close cooperation with the US in counter-terrorism. But it has emerged that British officials met the committee before publication. This led to claims that passages relating to Britain’s role in torture could have been redacted from the report for political reasons. Yesterday the Mail published details of how Home Secretary Theresa May was among the politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the Senate intelligence committee. But last night the Foreign Office issued an extraordinary correction to the information it had released earlier, stating that Mrs May had not met them. It said: ‘Due to a clerical error, which we very much regret, the FCO’s FOI response of 1 August on contacts with the US Senate select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the Home Secretary in July 2011. CIA Director John Brennan defended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques in a press conference in Langley, Virginia . 'That was a mistake: her planned visit in July 2011 did not take place and was postponed until September 2011. On that reinstated visit in September 2011, she did not meet the committee.’ Officials admitted they could not confirm last night whether she may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years. Mrs May will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on Monday when she is due to appear before MPs on the Commons home affairs committee. And yesterday it emerged that Dianne Feinstein, who led the Senate investigation, could also come to the UK to answer questions on Britain’s role. The judicial inquiry promised by Mr Cameron into Britain’s involvement in torture and headed by Sir Peter Gibson was ditched in favour of the ISC investigation. Downing Street says a full judicial inquiry could happen if the committee failed to answer all the questions. Former CIA Robert Woolsey said he would use the method of waterboarding again, if it meant saving ‘thousands of American lives’. During an interview with BBC Radio 4 Today, he added: ‘Would I waterboard again Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the 9/11 killings and beheader of over 40 people? ‘Would I waterboard him if I could have a good chance of saving thousands of Americans or, for that matter, other allied individuals? Yes.’ Al Qaeda's top British terrorist was captured after CIA spies tortured former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, it was claimed today. Crucial information provided by Mr Begg while he was being held helped identify 'dirty bomber' Dhiren Barot who was plotting terror attacks on London, according to the long-awaited publication of a report into CIA torture programmes in the wake of 9/11. The report claims that drawings by Mr Begg – who claims to have been beaten and deprived of sleep in Guantanamo Bay – helped lead British security services to Barot, who had gone to ground in London. Former Guantanamo Bay Detainee Moazzam Begg (left) rejected claims he provided information which helped track down Al Qaeda terrorist Dhiren Barot (right) in 2004 . Barot – also known as 'Issa al-Britani' or 'al-Hindi' – was tracked down in 2004 before being found guilty two years later of planning to detonate a dirty bomb and launch an attack on the Tube. The revelation will prove highly controversial as it appears to contradict the findings of the Senate's intelligence committee report which found that the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques' did not yield information crucial in stopping terror attacks. It even stated specifically that torture techniques – including waterboarding, rectal feeding and sleep deprivation – at Guantanamo were not central to Barot's arrest, or any other significant breakthrough. The report criticises the CIA for making 'inaccurate' representations that 'enhanced interrogation' was effective and necessary in producing 'otherwise unavailable intelligence'. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where Mr Begg was sent after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002 . The Government asked for information to be kept out of the US Senate report detailing the scale of torture in CIA prisons, it emerged last night. After initially insisting that no representations were made to keep secret evidence about British complicity in CIA interrogation programmes, Downing Street yesterday changed its story. Asked on Wednesday about requested redactions, David Cameron’s official spokesman said there had been ‘none whatsoever, to my knowledge’. But yesterday his deputy said: ‘My understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was UK involvement in any alleged torture or rendition. 'But I think there was a conversation with the agencies and their US counterparts on the executive summary. ‘Any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report.’ It said Barot's arrest 'resulted from the investigative activities of UK government authorities.' But the report also described how Mr Begg not only suggested where Barot – an old acquaintance – might be found in London, but provided a sketch good enough to identify him, according to report footnotes revealed in the Independent today. One reference in the report states: 'While still in Pakistani custody, Begg provided reporting on UK-based extremists in the context of terrorist training camps, including information on an individual who would play a key role in 'Issa's' identification and capture.' In October 2003, CIA officers wrote: 'Our latest information, based on [foreign partner reporting] and a detainee's assessment [Moazzam Begg in US military custody], is that Issa is believed to currently be located in Wembley, a suburb of London.' According to the CIA document, Begg's 'description and resulting sketch of UK contact Issa al-Hindi' – whose true identity was then unknown – 'was compared to a still shot of an unidentified man taken from a surveillance video of UK extremists.' The comparison 'revealed that the man in the video probably [was] the elusive Issa al-Hindi.' Just months later, in August 2004, Barot was arrested. Mr Begg has also reacted furiously to the claim. In a letter to The Independent last night, lawyers for Mr Begg rejected any suggestion that he 'volunteered or co-operated in the provision of information to any intelligence service'. They added: 'Insofar as he was tortured and under extreme and unlawful continuing duress for three-and-a-half years in Bagram and Guantanamo he, as every other individual subject to such treatment, cannot be regarded in any proper sense of the words to have 'given or provided information' voluntarily.' Mr Begg was arrested in Pakistan in 2002, and was held at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay. He was among former detainees who received an out-of-court payment over claims British officials were complicit in his torture. Mr Begg was arrested again this year – accused of attending a terrorism training camp in Syria. But the charges were dropped in October after it emerged MI5 knew of his activities.","Lord West accepted there may be the 'odd case' where agents were aware .

"The husband in Britain’s biggest ever divorce case should receive the lion’s share of the £870million fortune at stake because he is a financial genius, a judge ruled yesterday. Sir Chris Hohn, son of a Jamaican motor mechanic, will take more than half a billion pounds from the wreck of his marriage due to his extraordinary achievements as an ‘activist investor’. His City coups were worth billions and included a profit of more than £600million from the takeover that led to the collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, as well as a £100million profit from last year’s botched privatisation of Royal Mail. Sir Chris Hohn, the husband in Britain’s biggest ever divorce case should receive the lion’s share of the £870million fortune at stake because he is a financial genius, a judge ruled yesterday; his wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn, right, has been awarded £330million, but is likely to appeal the decision . Sir Chris’s wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn is likely to appeal against the decision by Mrs Justice Roberts to deny her an equal share of the couple’s vast wealth. Mrs Cooper-Hohn, who has been awarded £330million, raised their four children and ran the charitable foundations into which her husband poured most of the money made. The judge said, however, that he had also played a major role in managing the charities and that the couple would have no fortune to divide without him. ‘There are various definitions of the word genius but all seem to suggest that, in order to qualify for this sobriquet, a person must have some exceptional natural capacity or intellectual or creative power or other natural ability which finds reflection in the exercise of an exceptional skill in a particular area of activity,’ Mrs Justice Roberts said. ‘Applying that definition to this husband, I take the view he qualifies as a financial genius in his particular field of financial investment. If he does not, who could?’ The judge said Sir Chris was a 'financial genius in his particular field of financial investment. If he does not, who could?’ The High Court settlement, the largest dealt with by the London courts, is likely to influence future divorces of wealthy couples when a husband or wife thinks they can claim a greater share due to their special talents. Sir Chris, 48, came to Britain with his family as a young child. He went to state school, and took a first-class business degree at Southampton University. He worked for an accountancy firm and then took another degree at Harvard. His wife, who is 49, grew up in Chicago and met her husband at Harvard in 1994. The couple, who had homes in London, Connecticut and Jamaica together worth around £17million, began their fight over the fortune when their marriage broke down in 2012. Jane Keir, a partner in law firm Kingsley Napley, said the judgment ‘opens the door for divorce lawyers to argue for bespoke divorce solutions which protect genius wealth.’","Sir Chris Hohn will take home more than half a billion pounds from divorce .

"Casualty departments were forced to close their doors to ambulances nearly 100 times last month as they failed to cope with soaring patient numbers, alarming figures show. In total, around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside A&E units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year. In the worst cases they were turned away altogether. Scroll down for video . In total, around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside A&E units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year . And last week, more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record – separate statistics reveal. Experts warned that the ‘bleak’ figures were indicative of a ‘crisis’ in the NHS and showed the system was ‘cracking under extreme pressure.’ And they say the situation could worsen over the next month. NHS chiefs finally released the data indicating how hospitals are coping with the pressures of winter five weeks later than planned yesterday. They show the situation is far worse compared with this time last year. Waiting times data is normally released on a weekly basis from the start of November. But NHS England said that it was being held back while they ‘reviewed’ the information – prompting concerns they were trying to delay bad news. The 95 occasions that overstretched casualty units had to divert ambulances to other hospitals is almost double the 48 in the same period last year. A total of 6,968 operations had to be cancelled – 367 which were urgent – and 33 patients waited on trolleys in corridors for more than 12 hours. Several hospital trusts are now on ‘black alert’ – whereby GPs are urged not to send in patients – and senior NHS managers in some areas of the country have admitted the situation is the worst in living memory. Last week, more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record . The figures show A&E units are already under considerable pressure even though winter is barely under way. The crisis is partly due to bed-blocking, where elderly patients stay in hospital despite being fit for discharge because of a lack of care for them at home. In addition, record numbers of patients are visiting A&E because they are unable to get an appointment with their GP. Separate weekly data shows that 35,373 patients waited more than four hours in A&E – the Government’s target – a record number since data was first published in November 2010. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association’s council which represents senior doctors, said: ‘These figures point to a system cracking under extreme pressure, leading to unacceptable delays in care. ‘While the NHS is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months, this year it’s experienced a spring, summer and autumn crisis as well, leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we hit winter.’ Last month the Government announced that A&E units would get an extra £700million to avert a winter crisis, a sum that senior doctors described as little more than a ‘sticking plaster’. Dame Barbara Hakin, NHS England’s National Director of Commissioning Operations blamed the crisis on soaring numbers arriving in A&E and having to be admitted on to hospital wards. There were 436,229 attendances last week – up nearly 30,000 on the average typically seen for this time of year. Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Last year’s winter pressures on hospitals and A&E never went away – our health service is now running at capacity all year round, and a bad winter could spell disaster. ‘Staff are working incredibly hard to care for record numbers of patients, but the system is failing both staff and patients.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the figures should be a ‘wake-up call’.","Casualty departments closed doors to ambulances 100 times last month .

"Three Indiana police officers who bought a homeless man a bus ticket to Virginia say 'it was the right thing to do' after he told them he was trying to get home for the holidays. Warrick County Sheriff's deputies Jim Altmeyer and Adam Silva and State Master Trooper John Puskas bought the ticket for 49-year-old Jeff Stanley this week after he told them he had no money but wanted to get home. Puskas said after Stanley told them he had been walking through southwestern Indiana while trying to get home in time for the holidays, 'the three of us determined it was the right thing to do' to pool their money and buy the ticket, which he said cost about $180. Journey home: Jeff Stanley will travel home from Boonville bus station to see his dad in Richmond, Virginia . 'We all pitched in our resources and got him the bus ticket. Deputy Silva, on the way to the bus station, also bought him breakfast,' Puskas told the Evansville Courier & Press. Puskas said the officers viewed their act as a fulfillment of their pledge to protect and serve. Stanley's father, 77-year-old Wendell Stanley of the Richmond, Virginia, area, said it's been two years since he's seen his son. 'I hope he stays longer than just the holidays,' he said.","Warwick County Sheriff's deputies, Jim Altmeyer and Adam Silva and State Master Trooper John Puskas bought the ticket for 49-year-old Jeff Stanley ."
"Water companies were yesterday ordered to slash bills – but will still end up charging households more because of inflation. Regulator Ofwat told suppliers to reduce average customer bills by 5 per cent by 2020, a £20 drop from £396 to £376. In a new five-year plan, they must also invest £44billion to help stem water leaks by 370million litres a day and curb the hours homes are left without water because of repair works. Water companies were today ordered to cut bills by an average of 5 per cent by 2020 - but only after inflation . But customers are set to end up paying more because firms can increase bills annually in line with RPI (Retail Price Index) inflation – currently 2.3 per cent. Many homes will see bills of more than £400 for the first time next year. By 2020, assuming the same inflation rate, they could be £420. It will be a particular blow for older customers on a limited income since state benefits and many occupational pensions only rise in line with CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation which is a much lower 1.3 per cent. In a bid to support the worst off, Ofwat is to ensure companies offer social tariffs to an extra million households. These deals offer discounts of up to 25 per cent off regular water bills. A key factor behind Ofwat’s demand for lower bills has been the cheaper cost of borrowing for water companies to fund their infrastructure projects. Cathryn Ross, Ofwat chief executive, said: ‘With bills held down by 5 per cent and service driven up over the next five years, customers will get more and pay less.' Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, said: ‘We are bringing down bills so customers can expect value for money, while investors can earn a fair return. ‘Companies will need to stretch themselves to deliver much more with the same level of funding as in previous years.’ Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, said: 'We are bringing down bills so customers can expect value for money' Northumbrian customers however will see the smallest change in their bills, dropping 1 per cent to £382 . Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said he was broadly pleased that customers could expect decreases in bills without compromising services. However, he warned the range of deals pegging prices to inflation could still result in bills increasing for many customers. He said: ‘It’s been the best process for the customer than any price review since privatisation.’ However, he added: ‘Ofwat has been generous to the sector over several previous reviews.’","Regulator Ofwat says average bills will fall by £20 from £396 to £376 .

"Islamic State militants are employing identical torture methods used by the Syrian government they have vowed to overthrow. Prisons taken over by the Islamic extremists are now doling out the same brutal practices on their victims, which Assad's forces used to punish rebels like them for decades. Victims of ISIS claim they are now using well-known punishments like 'the tyre', the 'flying carpet' and the 'German chair'. Activists in Raqqa revealed how they were tortured using a method known as the 'shabeh', which roughly translates to  'ghost' in Arabic. It involves tying the victims' arms behind their backs using handcuffs - which are then used to hoist the body into the air, putting extreme pressure on the shoulder sockets. Hazm al-Hussein, who was tortured by an Islamic State leader once imprisoned by the regime, said: 'All you think about is the pain. Scroll down for video . Invasion: Islamic State have near-total control over the city of Raqqa (pictured), where those trying to relay images of their suffering to the outside world, are arrested and tortured . Enemy: It's thought Islamic State are copying the torture methods used by President Bashar al-Assad's (pictured) regime - who they've vowed to overthrow . Execution: Earlier this week, Islamic State threw a man off a building after accusing him of homosexuality . 'You can't think about anything else. You just have to be patient. If you get angry, they will just take your head off. You know they want to do it.' Jimmy Shahinan was given the 'shabeh' every four days for four months until his arms dislodged from their sockets. The ghost: The hands are tied behind their back with handcuffs, which are then used to suspend their bodies in the air. The German chair: Victims are strapped to a chair whose back is adjusted abruptly at will to cause extreme spinal damage. The flying carpet: Victims are strapped down to a hinged board. The ends are then brought towards each other to bend the spine. The tyre: Victims are placed inside a large tyre - rendering them immobile - before they're mercilessly beaten . According to Richard Spencer, reporting for the Telegraph in Gaziantep, it took four months for the feeling in his hands to return. The repercussions of the same torture still haunt a man simply known as 'Samir'. He twitches uncontrollably as a result, and hopes to obtain a visa so he can travel to the West for medical treatment. In Raqqa and elsewhere, Amnesty has claimed that torture in Islamic State prisons is reaching 'chilling levels'. Mr Shahinan was also punished with the 'German chair', where his body was strapped to a chair, whose back was adjusted at will to inflict extreme pain on the spine. He said: 'They hanged me upside down in an upturned chair. 'They came and did this every day for four days. This is a traditional way to torture people in Syria. They leave you there hanging for anything from two to 12 hours.' Amnesty International reports suggest the 'shabeh' has been carried out in the country for years, if not decades. Earlier this year, Islamic State fanatics left another man, Hazm-al-Hussein, hanging from his wrists for three days. Two years prior, the same man was arrested by the Syrian government who tortured him using a method called 'the tyre'. He was put inside the rim of a large tyre, rendering him immobile, before he was physically beaten. Torture: Both Islamic State militants and Assad's regime are accused of using methods of punishment known as 'the ghost', the 'German chair' and 'the tyre' Regime cruelty: A police photographer who defected from Assad's regime, earlier this year revealed graphic evidence 55,000 deaths in state-run prison cells since the start of the uprising. Inhumane: Amnesty international claim that torture in Islamic State prisons has reached 'chilling levels' The cruelty of Syrian prisons has been well documented for years - long before the revolution inspired by the so-called Arab Spring. Now, Samir claims they have made 'an art for out of torture. In another known as the ""flying carpet"", victims are strapped down to a board, and the ends brought towards each other to beind their spines.

"They were reportedly forced to undertake 'jiggle tests' to determine their fitness levels, warm up in a frigid storeroom that smelled of gasoline and put up with leering men at their calendar-release party. Now, a former Buffalo Bills cheerleader has told of her nightmare ordeal as part of the NFL squad. Alyssa U, who was initially 'thrilled' to become a 'Buffalo Jills' cheerleader, claims she was forced to endure degrading treatment and was 'treated like a piece of meat' by her supervisors. She says she was ordered to pay $650 for her uniform, attend 'humiliating' events that left her open to groping and sexual comments and adhere to a strict set of rules dictating how she should live her life. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Alyssa U (pictured), who was initially 'thrilled' to become a Buffalo Bills cheerleader, claims she was forced to endure degrading treatment and was 'treated like a piece of meat' by her team supervisors . And despite her and her teammates' hard work, the 23-year-old claims they were paid a pittance, earning money from just a few small tips and occasional appearance fees. Alyssa, who does not wish to disclose her full surname, reportedly made only $420 for more than 800 hours of work, while her teammate, Maria, earned just $105. 'People really thought we had it good, that we were paid well and had this luxurious lifestyle,' Alyssa told the New York Times. 'Seriously? I ended up feeling like a piece of meat.' Speaking of her decision to leave the squad and never again return, she added: 'It came down to this: What self-worth do I have? I am 100 percent happy with myself without this.' In May, Alyssa, Maria and three other cheerleaders sued the Bills - a team that each year makes revenue in excess of $200 million - alleging flagrant violations of state minimum wage laws. They claim they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by Stejon Productions, which manages the Jills and failed to compensate them for hundreds of hours of work in 2012 and 2013. Cheerleaders: As a Buffalo Jill (pictured), Alyssa says she was ordered to pay $650 for her uniform, attend events that left her open to groping and adhere to a strict set of rules dictating how she should live her life . Lawsuit: In May, Alyssa (far right), her teammate Maria (pictured, center, with their lawyer, Sean Cooney, left) and three other cheerleaders sued the Buffalo Bills, alleging flagrant violations of state minimum wage laws . 'We had always dreamed since we were little girls of becoming Buffalo Jills cheerleaders and unfortunately it was anything but a good experience,' Alyssa told WIVB. '[They made us do] everything from standing in front of us with a clipboard and having us do a jiggle test to see what parts of our body were jiggling and if that was something she saw, then you weren’t performing at all.' In addition to 'jiggle tests', Jills cheerleaders were also reportedly forced to cover their own travel expenses during team appearances, and purchase and resell 50-75 swimsuits calendars. Once, they were required to attend a 'Men Show' at a casino, where they were leered at and grabbed by punters, while a  calendar release party started at midnight at another casino, it is said. 1. When several of the same utensils are offered, start with the outermost utensil and use one for each course. In a formal setting, the silverware will be removed with the dish, leaving you with a clean slate. 2. When cutting meat. Never cut the full piece of meat all at once. Cut as you go, American style (cut and switch fork to right hand to eat) or European style (keeping fork in left hand to eat) eating is acceptable. 6. Soupspoon. Dip the spoon into the soup, moving it away from the body, until it is about two-thirds full, then sip the liquid, without slurping, from the side of the spoon without inserting the whole spoon into the mouth. This prevents soup from being spilled onto your clothes. 16. Never talk with food in your mouth. If asked a question while chewing, simply hold up your index finger to imply ""one moment"" and then speak after you swallow. 25. Never debate politics, religion or any other sensitive issues while dining. Degrading: In addition to 'jiggle tests', Jills cheerleaders (pictured) were also reportedly forced to cover their own travel expenses during team appearances, and purchase and resell 50-75 swimsuits calendars . And at a charity golf tournament, they were apparently auctioned off and made to sit on the winners' laps. They were also made to don bikinis to do backflips and climb into a dunk tank, it is alleged. In both their personal and cheerleading lives, the women were reportedly subjected to a shocking and 'onerous set of rules dictating how the women could walk, talk, dress, speak and behave'. The handbook, that reads like it's from an Edwardian finishing school for girls, advises  cheerleaders on how to wash their bodies - including their private parts - and what kind of tampons to use. It instructs: 'When menstruating, use a product that (sic) right for your menstrual flow... A tampon too big can irritate and develop fungus. Angry: Speaking of her decision to leave the squad and never again return,  Alyssa (pictured) said: 'It came down to this: What self-worth do I have?' 'A product left in too long can cause bacteria or fungus build up. Products can be changed at least every 4 hours. Except when sleeping, they can be left in for the night.' It details everything about being a Buffalo Jill, from what sort of nail polish is appropriate and how to wear your hair - in well-managed curls, but not ringlets - to how to sip soup at a formal dinner. Speaking in the officer of her and Alyssa's lawyer, Sean Cooney, Maria, who is an accountant, said she 'busted her butt' to make it on to the Buffalo Jills. When she did, she was 'thrilled', she said. But she added that it quickly became apparent that their supervisors would monitor their every move. In addition to the strict rules, their contractor reportedly ordered them to visit a sponsor who was a plastic surgeon and offered a small discount if they opted for breast augmentation. 'If you complained, you were told: ""This is a privilege. Deal with it!"",' Alyssa said. Speaking to the New York Times, Stejon Productions claimed the cheerleading side was a front operation, saying: 'The Bills control everything, from the moves to the uniforms to the dances.' Meanwhile, face with a lawsuit, the Bills disbanded the Jills for the 2014 season. In an affidavit, National Football League commissioner, Roger Goodell, said he had 'no knowledge' of the Jills' selection, training and pay practices. The cheerleaders' civil action, which was filed in state Supreme Court, seeks unspecified back pay and legal fees. No trial date has yet been set. The case continues. 7. ALWAYS shower after a work out and change undergarments. 11. Intimate area's: Never use a deodorant or chemically enhanced product. Simple, non-deodorant soap will help maintain the right PH balance. 12. When menstruating, use a product that right for your menstrual flow. A tampon too big can irritate and develop fungus. A product left in too long can cause bacteria or fungus build up. Products can be changed at least every 4 hours. Except when sleeping, they can be left in for the night. 16. Wash your feet daily ! This will help control foot odor & keep fungus from developing in toenails. Cotton socks also help with odor. Nylons and nylon socks create sweaty feet which creates odor.","Alyssa U, 23, says she was 'treated like a piece of meat' by supervisors .

"Questions: Jessica Chambers, 19, was found with burns on 98 per cent of her body on Saturday night . Police have admitted they are no closer to finding a suspect one week after 19-year-old Jessica Chambers was burned alive in a rural road in Mississippi. The devastating news comes as Chambers' family and friends gather for her funeral. Chambers was doused with gasoline and set on fire last Saturday night. She was found barely alive by passers-by and died in hospital later that evening, with burns to 98 per cent of her body. At a press conference on Thursday, District Attorney John Champion said they have spoken to 'many, many' people  but still feel like there is still a lot they do not know. In an emotional appeal ahead of her funeral, Jessica's father Ben Chambers said of the killer: 'They just don’t realize how they’ve messed up people’s lives. You know, they took something from me that God give me that can’t nobody replace.' Friends of Jessica's who attended the wake wore t-shirts branded with the phrase 'Justice for Jessica'. 'Anybody with any type of information on Jessica to come forward please,' friend Heather Parker said via WREG. The US Marshals Service has announced $11,000 will be handed to the person that can offer crucial information. 'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done it,' he said. 'We feel like somebody out there has heard something.' Speaking with Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale, they said there were some rumors circulating that were not true, including that Chambers was still on fire when she was found. But it has emerged that the killer apparently got into the car before setting it alight. The teenager also had a large gash on her head. To piece together the last few hours of her life, investigators continue to pore over surveillance footage from a gas station where she was seen 90 minutes before her death. They are also looking at her cell phone, which was left behind at the scene. 'We're leaving no stone unturned at this point,' Champion added. 'This is an absolute horrendous case... This situation is about as bad as it comes.' Remembering: Mourners wrote personal messages on banners after the service and ahead of a candlelit vigil . Grief: Two people hold each other as they make their way into the chapel for Jessica's service . Tributes: Friends and relatives wrote messages and tributes to Jessica on her casket on Saturday . Mourning: Tearful guests paid their respects to the 19-year-old as police struggle to solve her murder . Memories: Her family compiled a tribute book filled with pictures of Jessica throughout her life . The gas station surveillance footage shows her climbing out of her car, walking across the forecourt and stopping to wave at a friend, before walking off camera. She then returns to the store to pay. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel, who served the teenager, told the Associated Press that Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . Scene: The gas station and convenience store Jessica visited before she was found severely burned along the side of a nearby road. The cashier claims Jessica told him she was 'going somewhere' Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, ""Why are you putting so much gas?"" She said, ""I'm going somewhere"",' Fadhel said. Authorities have not commented on the claims. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. When she left, she headed south on Highway 51, he said. About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the burned young woman. She was not covered in flames, as previously reported, authorities said at the press conference. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . Crime scene: Yellow crime scene tape marks the location where the 19-year-old  was found severely burned. Authorities are working to piece together the last hours of her life in efforts to catch who set her on fire . Grisly discovery: The teenager was barely conscious when first responders arrived to her car, which was on this bank, and she managed to whisper something - but authorities have not revealed what she said . She whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that the final words may help find her killer, WMC reported. 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Peter Odom, an attorney who has prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Plea: District Attorney John Champion pleaded for information as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday . Tragic: Two years before Jessica's death, her older brother Ben (right) was killed in a car crash . Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, but they have said her appearance - pajama trousers and her hair in a bun - suggests she did not attend the party. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, pictured right, has also appealed for any information in her death . 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

"It is not just emails like those of studio head Amy Pascal that are being leaked as a result of the recent Sony hack, but also scripts, as the upcoming screenplay for the latest Bond film, Spectre, has found its way online. And while the first two acts of the film, starring Daniel Craig in his fourth outing as the iconic 007, are praised by executives inside Sony, the ending seems to be riddled with problems and in need of a serious rewrite. This as the film has already begun filming, with a staggering budget of $300million which was revealed in emails that were leaked earlier this week. Scroll down for video . The gang's all here: Plot and character details have been leaked along with the script for the new Bond film Spectre . Returning players: Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, Daniel Craig and Ralph Fiennes (above) will reprise their roles from Skyfall in the new film . Ladies night: Harris will be joined by two new female actors, Monica Belluci (left) and Léa Seydoux (right) As has already been widely noted, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear will all reprise their roles from the recent Skyfall, with Monica Belluci, Christoph Waltz, David Bautista and Léa Seydoux joining the cast of the film, which will be directed by Sam Mendes. Set to be released on November 6, 2015, the movie will film in London, Mexico City, Rome and Tangier and Erfoud in Morocco. Also included are such Austrian towns as Obertilliach, Lake Altaussee and Sölden, centering around Bond's quest to uncover a sinister organisation after receiving a cryptic message from his past. And now, as a result of this leak, it is known exactly what will happen and what characters the new actors will be playing. Exposed: Studio head Amy Pascal (above) has been the biggest victim of the hack, with hundreds of her email exchanges leaked . WARNING: SPOILERS! Not surprisingly, new addition Waltz will play the film's villain, Heinrich Stockmann, who also uses the alias Franz Oberhauser according to the script, which was seen by Defamer. Stockman is revealed to be on of Bond's foster brothers, as well as the head of a terrorist group called Spectre, hence the film's title. As the villain is wont to do in most Bond films, he captures and tortures the secret agent, before Bond creates some sort of distraction or incident that forces the villain to travel  to London. Bond eventually kills him there, though many studio executives are not a fan of how this happens. One script note reads; 'ALSO, THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF A PLOT TWIST RATHER THAN A SERIES OF WATERY CHASES WITH GUNS. THIS IS BLOFELD AFTER ALL. WHAT DOES HE HAVE UP HIS SLEEVE?' Baddie: As had been speculated, Christoph Waltz (above with Craig) will play the film's villain . Complicated role: Newcome Andrew Scott (above) will also have a very pivotal, and interesting, role . The Blofeld reference is interesting as many had speculated that Waltz would be playing a descendant of Ernst Stavro Blofeld or a member of his family, the most famous of all the Bond villains who appeared in six films: From Russia with Love, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever and For Your Eyes Only. In those films he is the head of a criminal organization known as Spectre. Threre will also be another villain, and a duplicitous one at that, In Andrew Scott, who will play the head of MI-5, but secretly be working with Waltz's character. Love interest: Seydoux will play Bond's love interest in the film . As for the women, Seydoux will be the man love interest, though their relationship seems to be problematic in the script. Jonathan Glickman, the president of MGM's film division, writes that 'the relationship with Madeline is terrific.' But Hannah Minghella, co-president of production at Columbia, semms to disagree, saying; 'If this is the movie that resolves the last three films then the emotional significance of that idea for Bond seems only lightly served at best. He finds the Vesper tape but never watches it.' She then adds; 'He appears to fall in love again for the first time since Vesper but there's no real emotional vulnerability there - why this girl? Why now? When he leaves with her at the end of the movie and throws his gun in the river has he gone for good or is this just a well earned vacation as is so often the ending of a Bond film.' Extended cameo: Belluci will appear in just one scene of the film it appears . Belucci meanwhile seems to be in and out, playing a woman seduced by Bond to give up information after he kills her husband. As for rumors that the film would star a lesbian character, they too seem to be true, with the character named Irma and the actor playing her still unknown.","The script for the upcoming James Bond film Spectre has been leaked in the Sony hack .

"A South Texas beauty spa owner has been sentenced to three years in prison for illegally injecting liquid silicone into clients at her salon, a practice that led to the death of one woman. Federal prosecutors said in a statement on Friday that 38-year-old Elva Navarro of Hidalgo injected at least 30 women and falsely told them she was trained and certified to provide the injections. They say one woman died in October 2013 after receiving an injection at Navarro's spa in McAllen. Another client became sick and was hospitalized in 2012.

Killer:navarro, pictured here in court on Friday, was sentenced to three years behind bars and is guilty of killing a woman in October by injecting her with liquid silicone . Use of the liquid silicone is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Navarro pleaded guilty in June to one count of receiving through interstate commerce an adulterated device with the intent to defraud or deceive. Breitbart.com reports that Navarro was caught after a female customer complained of pain following injections from Navarro. The woman who was hoping to a beauty treatment spent 17 days at a hospital, recovering from damage caused by injections that cost her $750, reported the Harlingen Morning Star. The hospitalized woman had been injected with 'liquid silicone' and as a result, had to undergo several corrective surgeries, reports Fox. The McAllen Monitor reports that Navarro has a rich criminal history. In November 2013 Navarro was arrested for practicing medicine without a license and in 2012 she was arrested for allegedly kidnapping a student and holding her ransom.

"Today is the busiest day for buying Christmas trees, with between six and eight million sold every year . Between six and eight million Christmas trees are sold in Britain every year — and today is the busiest day for buying them. But how many of us know which type of fir will best suit our needs or even that there are distinct types? Here Steve Guy, the national Christmas tree expert at Dobbies Garden Centres, explains how to choose, cherish and care for your perfect tree ... 1. CHOOSE CAREFULLY . There are four main types sold in the UK and each has different merits. The Nordmann fir has a glossy green colour and big needles which are lovely and soft, making it suitable for those with young children. It’s more expensive than the Norway spruce, which has that classic rich, fresh Christmas fragrance and a very structured pyramid shape. These are inexpensive but their needles are sharper and tend to fall off, and its sap is very sticky — it won’t mess up your house, but you’ll get it on your hands while lugging it home, so watch your clothing. The two less popular options are the Fraser fir and the Noble fir. The Fraser has a blue-green colour and is a narrower tree, so ideal if you have less space. It has dense foliage, so not ideal for bauble lovers, but lovely if you just want tinsel and lights. The Noble fir is thick stemmed, which can make it a struggle if you’re using a tree stand, but it has better spaced foliage. 2. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR . With a Christmas tree, price does tend to indicate quality. The more expensive ones are more likely to have been hand-trimmed before being cut down or dug up, so are in a good shape. Judge by looking carefully before you buy — trees are like cats and dogs, you can tell if they’re healthy by the sheen of their coat. Ideally, the tree should be a shiny, glossy green. I recommend taking the tree by the trunk and tapping it on the ground. Evergreens lose needles all year round, but if too many fall off you might want to reconsider. 3. BEWARE THE TAG . Although tree size goes up in feet, sellers are allowed 15 cm (6 in) either side — so a 6 ft tree (the most popular height) could be a little taller or shorter. This means it’s vital to know both the exact height of the room you’re putting it in — especially if you want one which grazes the ceiling — and to measure the tree, too. Remember the tree stand will add up to 15 cm. All is not lost if you get the height wrong, though. Just trim the trunk and take off some lower branches. Scroll down for video . It is vital to look at the tree's shape out of the netting, in case it's uneven - so don't buy ready-wrapped trees . 4. WATCH THE WRAPPING . A ready-wrapped tree might seem helpful — but don’t buy these. It’s vital to look at the tree’s shape out of the netting, in case it’s wider than you want or an uneven shape. Without seeing it unwrapped, you don’t know what you’re getting. Any respectable seller will unwrap and rewrap the tree for no extra charge. Wear gardening gloves to handle it and be careful of the tip, which can be damaged easily. Make sure any tree is wrapped before you take it home. 5. TREAT IT LIKE CUT FLOWERS . Once home, cut 2 cm or 3 cm from the stump straight across using a handsaw. It’s easier than you think, and helps the tree take up moisture, like trimming cut flowers. Then place it in a tree stand that holds water and generously water the tree every day. It can drink two litres daily, depending on room temperature. Unlike cut flowers, don’t add sugar. If you want a live tree to plant afterwards, choose a pot-grown version as these have a better chance of living, since the roots are whole. All Christmas trees are grown from seeds not cuttings. Vitally, whichever type you buy, do not unwrap the tree until it’s secure, otherwise you’ll be fighting branches and foliage. Then leave it to stand for 24 hours before decorating so the branches settle down. If you want a live tree to plant afterwards, choose a pot-grown version as these have a better chance of living . 6. KEEP IT COOL . Putting a tree close to a stove or radiator will dry it out. A Nordmann fir will lose its sheen and a Norway spruce will lose its needles. Obviously, keep well away from candles, as it can easily catch fire. 7. AFTER CHRISTMAS . Many councils will collect trees for you or you can take it to a recycling centre. Alternatively, chop it up and use as a rich scented mulch for the garden. They don’t make good firewood; their sap will take a year to dry out properly. If you have bought a pot-grown tree, plant it at the back of the garden, as they grow extremely high.","Today is expected to be the busiest day for buying Christmas trees .

"It’s a point of contention when thousands of Christmas markets pop up across Europe every holiday season – which one is the greatest of them all? A poll of nearly 72,000 people has tried to bring an end to the conflict – naming the festive market in Strasbourg, France as Europe’s best. With so much competition one of the most surprising inclusions on the top ten list may be Manchester, which placed ninth behind traditional favourites in Germany, Austria and France, but finished ahead of London. Europe's best: Strasbourg's Christmas market topped a vote held by a Brussels-based tourism group . Source: European Best Destinations . Billed by some as ‘the capital of Christmas’, Strasbourg’s market is one of the oldest in Europe, with the first being held in 1570. Today, organisers say it attracts two million locals and tourists every year. It topped the list in a vote held by Brussels-based tourism organisation European Best Destinations, and it was followed by Aachen in Germany, Vienna, Nuremberg and Lille. Rounding out the top ten were Dresden, Brussels, Cologne, Manchester and Prague. London was one of the options in the vote, which drew ballots from more than 80 countries, but it failed to crack the top ten. In an online poll, voters said they chose Manchester's market because it is traditional and modern and it ‘goes beyond the borders of the UK’. Councillor Pat Karney told the Manchester Evening News: ‘We’ve said it for years and now it’s official. 'Once again Manchester has been named the best Christmas market in the UK and one of the best in Europe and the world.' Manchester's Christmas market placed ninth, beating London as voters chose from 15 cities . The Christmas market in Aachen, German came in second on the list, followed by Vienna and Nuremberg . Mr Karney added: ‘We have welcomed visitors from across the world who have travelled to the city just to see the Christmas markets – but of course, once they are here, they fall in love with Manchester too.’ Open until December 21, Manchester’s Christmas market attracted an estimated 200,000 people on its opening weekend. So far visitors have taken home nearly 100,000 mulled wine mugs and consumed tens of thousands of bratwurst sausages.","Nearly 72,000 people voted in poll held by European Best Destinations .

"Controversial designer Tom Ford has sparked fury by launching a range of penis necklaces - just in time for Christmas. The phallic pendants - which resemble the shape of a cross - come in gold or silver and are available with small, medium and large charms. Intended as the perfect holiday gifts for kinky fashionistas, size apparently doesn't matter as they are all priced $790. But the latest offering from the designer provoked outrage on Twitter from users who said the necklaces were 'unbelievably offensive' to Christians and branded Ford 'sick' for combining a phallic image with a religious symbol. Tom Ford caused controversy after launching a range of phallic pendants, priced $790, in time for Christmas . Susan Swift wrote: 'Just in time for Christmas, a way to say ""screw Christ,"" the savior of the world. This is sick. Just sick.' Kevlyn Hall added: 'How dare you use a phallic symbol in the Christian cross! You insulting piece of trash! HOW DARE YOU!' One user said on Twitter: 'This is unbelievably offensive to me. Is he insane?' And another user said the designer could 'rot in hell', adding: 'What is wrong with people these days?' The designer has had fashion ads banned in the past for appearing too raunchy, including an advert in 2007 for a men's fragrance that featured a bottle of perfume between a model's open thighs. In 2003, a controversial campaign for Gucci which featured the fashion house's iconic G shaved into a model's pubic hair, was also banned and condemned for being vulgar and degrading.

"The undercover cop who pulled a gun on anti-police protesters in Oakland, California, was justified in doing so after a gang of 50 targeted his partner, a witness claims. The officer, who has not been named, was marching with the demonstrators on Wednesday night when the mob is said to have turned on him and his colleague. After pulling out a baton and identifying himself as police, his partner was hit on the head and tackled to the ground - prompting the officer to point a pistol at the crowd. Despite a flurry of outrage from crowds and on Twitter, photographer Michael Short said the reaction was natural in the face of the 'threatening' crowds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Undercover: This (center, in brown) is the undercover cop marching with anti-police protesters and his partner (right, in the green cap) moments before the mob of 50 turned on them and hit his partner in the head . Turned on them: The crowds started shouting 'they're cops!' and advanced on the officers, witnesses said . Reaction: After being hit on the head and tackled, the officer's partner slammed a protester to the ground . Pulled his gun: The officer then pointed his gun at the protesters in a move that has sparked outrage . Short, 38, who freelances for the San Francisco Chronicle, told NBC News: 'It was an appropriate response. 'I would have been scared if I saw my partner get knocked to the ground. 'He was justified. I felt threatened by the protesters, too.' KTVU reported that demonstrators screamed at the undercover officers during the march 'Hey, they're undercover, they're cops!' The officers' faces were masked at the time, the affiliate station reported. The shouting continued when the officers tried leaving, KTVU reported. An undercover officer shoved a demonstrator to the side, before the demonstrator shoved him, the affiliate station reported. The man was reportedly handcuffed and brought down on the ground. The other officer brandished his weapon after demonstrators started to surround the two men, KTVU reported. About 20 uniformed officers were quickly on the scene and detained one man. Demonstrators broke windows and looted stores and that there was one arrest for assaulting an officer in the latest U.S. protest over police violence. Oakland and neighboring Berkeley have seen nightly demonstrations since the weekend in response to decisions by two grand juries not to charge white police officers in the killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. 'Justified': A photographer at the march said the move appeared justified in the wake of threats from the mob . Arrest: The partner, who kept his mask on, can then be seen arresting one of the protesters . Tense: About 20 uniformed officers were quickly on the scene and detained one man . On Wednesday night, about 150 protesters, a smaller crowd than on previous evenings, left the campus of University of California-Berkeley and demonstrated without incident before marching south into Oakland, the city of Oakland said in a statement. By that point, the protesters' numbers had dwindled to about 50 people, the statement said, some of whom broke windows at a T-Mobile store and a Chase bank. Looting also was reported in an area of small businesses at a downtown intersection, it said. A spokesman for the Oakland Police Department said only that it had responded to a request for assistance 'made by an outside agency,' and referred all inquiries about the incident to the California Highway Patrol. Lt. Chris Bolton with the Oakland Police Department tweeted early Thursday morning 'The #OaklandProtest pictured man isn't an OPD officer & not an OPD arrest. OPD 1st responded to scene on report from other agency. 1/1.' '2/2 That outside agency has been notified to provide details and address concerns re #OaklandProtest concerns.' Arrest: A spokesman for the Oakland Police Department said that it had responded to a request for assistance 'made by an outside agency,' and referred all inquiries about the incident to the California Highway Patrol . Before the incident, demonstrators reportedly screamed at the officers 'Hey, they're undercover, they're cops!' He later tweeted, 'Last night #OaklandPolice responded to a request for help during a California Highway Patrol arrest at Bay & Harrison St. (1/2)' '2/2 #OaklandPolice PIO is referring all inquiries regarding this incident to the California Highway Patrol.' Bolton answered a Twitter user's query, and said 'Yes, it was a CHP arrest conducted by CHP officers.' CHP media officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Twitter user Dave Id also published a series of tweets online about the incident early Thursday morning. 'March definitely OOO-VER!' he wrote. 'But I got better info from direct eyewitnesses on undercover incident... #Oakland #BerkeleyProtests.' He also said 'Tall 6'8"" undercover and shorter 5'8"" undercover with mask on were confronted in dark part of 27th street. Tall cop pulled out baton...' Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner,  leads a march of people protesting the Staten Island, New York grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in July . A third tweet from Id alleged 'Tall cop quickly threw baton on ground and then pulled out gun, holding it sideways all gangster. Someone then clocked the masked cop...' He also claimed that 'Masked undercover wasn't beaten badly as I first heard from witness further away, but hit straight in face and knocked down...' The City of Oakland said in a statement one arrest was made overnight after an officer was assaulted, but it was not immediately clear whether that was same incident witnessed by the Reuters photographer. Two subway stations in downtown Oakland were shut down for a time late on Wednesday due to the protest, city officials said. On previous evenings this week in the Bay Area, riot police have fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse demonstrators, some of whom have thrown stones at the officers. The protests are part of nationwide actions by activists amid turmoil over the policing of black communities.","A photographer witnessed an undercover police officer pointing his pistol at protesters after he and his partner were attacked .

"A man suspected of being behind a pro-Isis Twitter account has been arrested by Indian police just days after the company executive was exposed by Channel Four. Mehdi Masroor Biswas, 24, was arrested by police this morning at his home in Belgaluru after they discovered the man's true identity.

Police Commissioner M N Reddi said: 'He was particularly close to the English-speaking terrorists of ISIS and became a source of incitement and information for the new recruits trying to join ISIS/ISIL.' However, the man's father said: 'My son is not linked to any jihadi group.' India has the world's third-largest Muslim population, yet police believe that only four Indians have flown to the Middle East for jihad, one of whom was arrested upon his return to India. Officials say it is hard to track the number of sympathisers of the Islamic State's ideology as there is no central figure or recruiting authority. Mehdi told Channel 4 in an interview this week that he would have liked to join the Islamic State but for his family who were dependent on him. He regularly shared jokes, funny images and talked about superhero movies on his Facebook page, posting pictures of pizza dinners with friends and Hawaiian parties at work, the British channel said. Biswas' Twitter account had 17,000 followers and was viewed by more than two million people a month. A Channel Four investigation described the account as a 'leading conduit of information between jihadis, supporters, and recruits'.

He now leads a global research program on whale sharks, as he aims to take effective action to protect the largest known extant fish species. 'They are so huge, but they're completely harmless to people,' he said, explaining how misunderstood the creatures are. 'They have so many different behaviours, I find them totally fascinating. I'll never get tired of photographing them.' Pierce dives with whale sharks in the hope of discovering a way to preserve the gigantic sea creature and the small population of pups . According to Pierce, there are only about thirty whale shark pups in the world. The babies, which are less than a metre long, have never been seen in the wild . In the incredible images below, two whale sharks are set free by divers Chris Rohner and Clare Prebble. The 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish became tangled in nets off Mafia Island in Tanzania.

The amazing images show divers Chris Rohner and Clare Prebble helping free the tangled pair - which then swim alongside them to say thanks . While not a lot if known about the species, such as where the females or adults live, Pierce believes these questions need to be answered as soon as possible. 'These gentle, placid giants are globally threatened by overfishing, accidental catches, and ship strikes. There's a good chance that the species won't survive if we don't actively help them,' he said. His work in preserving whale sharks has lead him to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world and while Australia's famous Great Barrier Reef makes an appearance in his list of top five places to dive in the world, he admits that the Galapagos Islands are unrivalled when it comes to nature. The mammoth whale sharks, who swam into the nets, looked like they were being chocked by the fisherman's net as they desperately tried to get out . There were two sharks in the net - one 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish -  during the dive, which took place in November . The divers came to the aid of the  whale sharks who had become tangled in the gigantic fishing nets . Eventually, the whale sharks were set free and followed the divers to thank them. The whole thing was caught on camera by Simon Pierce . 'The top places I have dived are the Galapagos Islands, southern Mozambique, the outer Great Barrier Reef, South Africa and Tanzania,' he said. 'I love big animals - sharks, sea turtles, whales - and these places all have plenty of wildlife.' 'I visited the Galapagos Islands for the first time this year. I had wanted to go there my whole life, but the reality still exceeded my imagination. 'I saw gigantic, pregnant whale sharks swimming through schools of hundreds of hammerhead sharks, dived with the marine iguanas and giant ocean sunfish, watched orca hunting and that's aside from all the fascinating life on land. It's a once in a lifetime trip, but I definitely plan to go back.' he said.

"To all of those closest to him and, indeed, those who thought they knew him best, Grant Trebilco was the happy-go-lucky, 'nothing gets me down' surfer dude. But that 'could not have been further from the truth'. Three years ago, as bipolar consumed his life, the now 33-year-old found himself at his lowest ebb. He no longer cared for the beautiful eastern Sydney beaches he'd called home since moving across the ditch from New Zealand. 'Mate, all I know is that I tried to run away from it and one day, I'm not exactly sure how I got there either, but I was sitting alone in a hotel room in Mexico and in a very dark place,' he admitted. 'I was stuck there just thinking about ways of ending it, I was manic and had lost all sense of everything and decided to walk in front of a car. In the end, I never did that. 'Instead, I called my brother ... and you know that conversation probably changed my life.' Surfing away the blues. Grant Trebilco has come up with a novel way of trying to beat Bipolar, the same disorder he shares with his father . The family connection to this story doesn't end there. Grant returned home to Maunganui in the Bay of Plenty to discuss his mental health issues with his father, only to find out that 64-year-old Bruce Trebilco had, just like his son, been diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years earlier. 'Again, no one knew but apparently he had it from a very young age'. His personal and private battle has led to him starting Fluro Friday, helping surfers of all abilities realise how catching one wave can improve your mood. The Fluro Fridays are most definitely a family affair with Grant's mum Alison and his dad Bruce among those joining the fun and frivolity to help raise awareness . Bipolar symptoms vary but those with the disorder can experience periods of over-excitement and recklessness, as well as suffering low self-esteem, feeling helpless and being depressed. 'I went from being the life of the party to being completely down and depressed and often found myself behaving in a totally irrational, risky manner,' Grant admitted. Surfers of all shapes and sizes come out to play to send a very serious message on 'Fluro Fridays' 'I knew there was a problem one day when I stopped midway through my speech at an event, I broke down and just walked out. I sought help but was actually misdiagnosed as suffering depression. 'Ultimately I spent 10 days in hospital and they found out what the real cause was.' Bipolar will affect up to 460,000 Australians at some point in their life and those afflicted with the disorder tend to have a higher rate of relationship problems, accidental injuries and, in the worst cases, suicide. Significantly, more than half of all sufferers will turn to drugs or alcohol at an outlet. 'I was working for a tequila company at the time - in hindsight probably not a good combination for someone with bipolar, was it?' There are no rules on 'Fluro Fridays' wherever they are held, all Grant wants is to 'put a smile on your face' After a close friend confided in Grant, that he too was bipolar, 'I just decided one day to just throw on a suit and tie and hit the water and when my mate Sam (Schumacher) joined me a couple of weeks later we decided to call it our board meeting. From there it just took off'. The so-called 'board meetings' morphed into 'Fluro Fridays' and Grant and friends went on to establish Onewave, a not-for-profit surf group whose main focus is to raise awareness of mental health matters. 'It's a simple recipe really - saltwater, surfing, good mates and of course some crazy coloured get-ups - the more colourful, the better,' he said. 'We have a saying that one wave is all it takes, to get you smiling and to give you hope. 'And if it gets just one more person talking about their problems, then we've succeeded.' At sunrise each Friday, dozens of surfers don the fluro colours at Sydney beaches like Bondi, Manly and Wanda and further north, including Avoca and Merewether. 'Fluro Fridays' fever has taken off internationally too; including beaches in Bali, Thailand, Fiji, New Zealand, Hawaii, Spain and Mexico. Grant Trebilco says it doesn't matter if you're a surfer, footy player or office worker 'sometimes it's okay not to be okay'","Both Grant Trebilco and his dad Bruce suffer bipolar disorder .

"James Ward, a traveller who appeared on 'My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding' who has been jailed after crashing into a car while drink-driving . A traveller who appeared on the Channel 4 show 'My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding' has been jailed after he flipped his BMW sports car while drunkenly driving around in a revenge mission to find his son's killers. James Ward flipped the car on to its roof after ploughing into another vehicle when he got behind the wheel while drunk, uninsured and disqualified from driving. Northampton Crown Court heard how Ward was injured in a violent clash while travelling around looking to avenge his son Thomas' murder, who was killed last April. Police were called when he was spotted drenched in blood at Watford Gap service station. Officers then followed him for a short distance before watching him lose control of his car just before junction 15 of the M1 near Northampton on the A45 roundabout. He crashed into another vehicle, causing serious injuries to a woman and child who were inside the car, who had to be airlifted to hospital. At a previous hearing, the 40-year-old pleaded guilty to four charges of causing serious injury, driving while disqualified, driving with excess alcohol and driving with no insurance. Today Ward from Leighton Buzzard, Bedforshire was jailed for 13 months. Sentencing, Judge Rupert Mayo said it was a 'ghastly accident' after Ward failed to heed the police warnings to stop his vehicle. Jeremy Janes, prosecuting, said the woman was left covered in glass and concerned for the welfare of her child. Mr Janes said: 'The woman suffered a laceration of a cornea which has left her with permanent blurred vision and also suffered cuts to her head and abdomen. 'She and her three-year-old son, who was not physically injured, had suffered psychological distress since the crash. 'She has . only just been able to start driving again and she has taken her son to a . counsellor as he had become very anxious after the crash.' Ward had been driving around on a revenge mission to find the killers of his son Thomas, pictured, who was murdered five days after the birth of his daughter . The . court heard that police officers had indicated for Ward to stop his . vehicle, shortly before the crash, when he was parked at the Watford Gap . services. However, Ward sped away from the police car and crashed his BMW on the M1 roundabout at the next junction. When they finally found him officers saw his car contained empty beer cans. He was also found to be over the drink drive limit as he gave officers a blood alcohol reading of 102 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  The legal limit is 80 microgrammes. Defending John Carmichael said: 'My client feels real grief and remorse for what he has done. 'He told me he will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life.' In April last year, Ward's son Thomas, 20, was murdered on the steps of his own caravan five days after the birth of his daughter Lily. The A45 roundabout near the junction 15 of the M1, where Ward lost control of his BMW . His funeral was shown on a My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding spin-off about christenings in October and Ward was seen mourning his son at his graveside. In a Crimewatch appeal, police said they want to trace Thomas’s second cousin John Boy Ward, 32, and his wife Joleen, 21, in connection with the murder. So far no arrests have been made. But on May 25, Ward was told the suspects in his son’s killing were hiding in Coventry. After driving to find them he ended up in an altercation and received 'significant' injuries as result. Ward was sentenced to 12 months in jail for dangerous driving and one month, to be served consecutively, from driving whilst disqualified. He was also banned from driving for three years.","James Ward flipped his BMW while drunkenly driving on a revenge mission .

"Alastair Cook’s leadership of England’s one-day team was looking increasingly hard to justify after his latest batting failure paved the way for yet another series defeat. The sixth game against Sri Lanka had been billed as a resurgent England’s chance to set up the pleasant surprise of a decider in Colombo on Tuesday. Instead, Cook fell to the third ball of their run chase, leg-before for a single to the off-spin of Sachithra Senanayake, then watched as his team-mates slumped to 202 all out and a crushing 90-run loss. Eoin Morgan fell to a first-ball duck as England lost against Sri Lanka in the sixth one-day international . Alastair Cook had yet another day to forget as England captain as they lost the ODI series . England now trail Sri Lanka 4-2, and have lost five of their last six bilateral series. Cook’s average out here is 17. Earlier, the England captain put down the simplest of catches at mid-off to reprieve Kumar Sangakkara on 41. Sangakkara is not a man given to spurning second chances: already in red-hot form, he went on to a match-winning, run-a-ball 112, his 20th one-day century. This was not a good day for the credibility of English cricket. And it strained further when Cook spoke of his determination to stay in the job. ‘It’s tough,’ he said. ‘I’m not scoring the runs I’d like. It’s not a great place to be as a captain. Cook made just one as England lost an early wicket in pursuit of 293 in Pallekele . Kumar Sangakkara scored a stunning century on Saturday as Sri Lanka wrapped up the series . Joe Root was again one of the only men to stand up and be counted, scoring another fifty . ‘I’m a better player than I’m showing at the moment, and I’ve just got to keep going. I’m hitting the ball quite nicely in the nets.’ Asked whether he would still lead England at the World Cup, he answered simply: ‘Yes.’ But there was a more equivocal response from coach Peter Moores. Asked on Sky Sports to confirm Cook would indeed lead his side out against Australia at Melbourne on February 14, Moores said: ‘As with everything we will sit down and review it at the end of the series.’ It was not a ringing endorsement. Cook has now scored 87 runs in five innings in this series at a strike-rate — 67 — that belongs to an era when one-day openers still regarded their job as taking the shine off the new ball. Root was eventually bowled by Suranga Lakmal as England's chances of victory dissipated quickly . It had looked good for England at one stage as Steven Finn celebrates the wicket of Angelo Mathews . Now, one-dayers are viewed by almost every team as elongated games of Twenty20.There have been 44 sixes in this series by 16 different batsmen; Cook is not among them. The counter-argument is that he is not supposed to be a rope-clearer, but an accumulator who allows the strokemakers to bat around him. The counter-argument has fallen flat, too. England’s reply had its moments. Moeen Ali carved 34 off 32 balls and Root made an enterprising 55. Woakes’s 45-ball 41 underlined his all-round credentials. But James Taylor suffered his first failure since returning to England colours, Ravi Bopara wasted another opportunity after pleading for a promotion to No 5, and Eoin Morgan fell first ball. England had been profligate with the ball too. After steady opening bursts from Steven Finn and Chris Woakes, Sri Lanka pulled away during a second-wicket stand of 153 in 30 overs between Sangakkara and Dilshan. James Tredwell was as tidy as ever, but Chris Jordan reverted to the scruffiness that marred his performances at the start of the series, and eight wides took England’s series tally to 65. Cook lamented: ‘This is a good reality-check. We have to stay tight as a team.’ There are many who feel he should already have played his final game in a one-day shirt.","Alastair Cook dropped Kumar Sangakkara and then made just one .

"A 22-year-old man has been arrested following a 'gang-related' high school shooting in Oregon that left three students injured and a 16-year-old girl in a critical condition. The unnamed gunman, who is believed to have gang ties, reportedly gunned down the students at a street corner outside Rosemary Anderson High School in Portland at noon on Friday. He then allegedly fled the scene by car, but was stopped by police at North Interstate Avenue and Going Street at around 1.30am on Saturday. A handgun was found in his vehicle. Taylor Michelle Zimmers remains critically injured in hospital following the shooting, while 20-year-old David Jackson-Liday and 17-year-old La'Braye Franklin are said to be in a fair condition. A fourth victim, Olyvia Batson, also 17, was treated at the scene after a bullet grazed her foot. Scroll down for videos .

Scene: A 22-year-old male suspect has been arrested following the 'gang-related' shooting at noon on Friday . Speaking to The Oregonian, student Sierra Smith said she saw one of the male victims being helped by a teacher inside the alternative high school, describing the scene as 'scary'. 'He was laying on the ground. He had blood coming out of his stomach,' the 17-year-old said. Another student, Oliviann Danley, 16, told the newspaper she saw a boy run into the school and shout, 'Oh my God, did I just get shot?' Emergency services were scrambled to Rosemary Anderson High - an alternative institution for dropouts and other at-risk or homeless students - within minutes of the shooting. The attack is believed to have occurred following a dispute. The assailant and two other people fled, while the wounded students went to the school for help, a police spokesman said. In a statement on Friday night, Sargent Pete Simpson, of Portland Police, 'There was some kind of dispute between the shooter and some people.

Police gang investigators 'feel comfortable saying this is a gang-related shooting based on some of the people involved,' Mr Simpson added. He said the shooter is believed to have gang ties, but declined to say whether any victims might. Following the shooting, parents were quickly summoned to the school to collect their children, while a nearby high school and community college were put on lockdown. After authorities tracked down the suspect in the early hours of Saturday, officers were dispatched to search the man's an apartment, about five blocks east of the shooting. Shock: Following the shooting, the man then allegedly fled the scene by car, but was stopped by police at North Interstate Avenue and Going Street at around 1.30am on Saturday. A handgun was found in his vehicle .

Police will release the suspect's name and charges after he is booked into Multnomah County Jail. The victims are students at the high school or in affiliated job training programs, the force said. On Friday night, Portland Mayor, Charlie Hales, wrote on Facebook: 'My heart goes out to students and staff at Rosemary Anderson High School, which today experienced a terrible tragedy. 'It was heartwarming to see the community wrap its arms around victims' friends and families. I know we'll all be holding our loved ones a little closer tonight. Go home and hug your kids.' According to Rosemary Anderson High's website, 190 students annually are enrolled at the north Portland location. The school also has a second location in Gresham.

Above, students and relatives speak on their phones . Paying tribute: On Friday night, Portland Mayor, Charlie Hales, wrote on Facebook: 'My heart goes out to students and staff at Rosemary Anderson High School, which today experienced a terrible tragedy' Gang violence in Portland is not a new phenomenon. Some of the violence occurs between rival gangs, but bystanders have also been hurt. 'We've made a lot of progress in addressing the gang problem, but we haven't eradicated it,' Mr Hales said in a statement on Friday. 'Today's really a sad reminder that it's still with us.' Over the summer, Portland police have apparently seen a spike in gang crime - a problem they have complained they do not have adequate resources to address. Fighting for life: Taylor, pictured in a Facebook photo, remains critically injured in hospital . Recent violence includes a man killed in a drive-by-shooting and another shot dead in a separate shooting. A five-year-old boy also was shot in the leg while playing at an apartment complex. A Multnomah County report on gang activity released in June said crime in the county that includes Portland actually decreased from 2005 to 2012. As inner-city Portland gentrifies, the report said, criminal activity is shifting from northern neighborhoods to areas farther east, including the city of Gresham. The north Portland neighborhood where the shooting occurred exemplifies the trend. Before Friday, the place once known for gangs had not had a shooting with injuries in nearly four years. 'It brings up a lot of old wounds,' Mr Simpson said. Dani Gonzales, 64, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, said it generally safe but there has always been some gang activity. 'Kids just get silly and get crazy ideas. I don't know what goes on in their heads,' Mr Gonzales said. There was another school shooting in the Portland area in June, but it was not gang-related. A freshman killed another boy in a locker room, and a bullet grazed a teacher before the shooter went into a bathroom and died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said. The attack came just two days before the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults in Newton, Connecticut. Police are investigating the latest shooting. Leaving: Ralena Gaska (left) and mother, Deinda (right), leave Rosemary Anderson High School on Friday .

The roadside bomb attack killed both Afghan and U.S. soldiers who were on board the NATO bus on Friday. Pictured: A separate bus attack which killed Afghan soldiers in Kabul today . Three other attacks in Kabul killed at least 19 people, including a senior court official who was gunned down by Taliban insurgents . A huge fissure was created in the road by the roadside blast which is said to have caused numerous injuries. The soldiers' deaths took the total number of international troops to die in Afghanistan this year to 65, of which 50 were Americans. Some 3,500 foreign forces, including at least 2,210 American soldiers, have been killed since the war began in 2001. The Bagram attack comes two days after the U.S. closed a prison on the airfield that held foreign detainees and is where two prisoners were killed during torture in 2002. It also follows the release of a Senate report condemning the CIA for its use of torture on suspected terrorists at detention centres around the world. At least 19 people were killed in three attacks across Kabul today, as well as yesterday's NATO bus attack. Major General Afzal Aman, chief of operations at Kabul's Defence Ministry, said six Afghan soldiers died when a suicide bomber attacked another bus taking them home. A black column of smoke lingered over the city after the explosion, which destroyed the bus and injured 18 people.

"A former SAS soldier who survived weeks of torture at the hands of Iraqi interrogators believes it can be used to prevent terrorists attacks. Andy McNab believes security services have a 'moral responsibility' to torture suspects if innocent lives hang in the balance. A report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by CIA agents against Al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of the September 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence. But the soldier-turned-author says torture can yield vital information if used properly - and will be used by authorities in the future to prevent terrorist attacks. Scroll down for video . Defence: SAS soldier-turned-author Andy McNab (right) says torturing suspects, such as those held in Guantanamo Bay following the September 11 attacks (left), is warranted if it saves lives . Immoral: A US Senate report concluded that torture techniques used by the CIA on Al Qaeda suspects (pictured, file photo) did not produce 'useful information' Evidence: A report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by CIA agents against Al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of the September 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence. Protest: Human rights activists in Washington DC demonstrate 'water-boarding' on a volunteer (file photo) The former British Army sergeant told The Times he 'wouldn't think twice' about 'inflicting pain' on someone if he thought it could prevent an atrocity such as the 2005 London bombings. He said: 'I would deem it a moral responsibility to interrogate, to physically torture him to get the information out. 'Torture is a really blunt instrument but it is an instrument that if it used right can yield results. 'There will always be legislation to make sure that we don't do it, but we will do it... We could moan about tactical interrogation or we could moan about 24-28 people getting blown up on a Tube. It's a tough call.' Andy McNab was stripped of his clothing, beaten and held in isolation for three weeks in Baghdad. He and three of his colleagues were then whipped until they bled Iraqi forces pressed a red-hot spoon into their open wounds . The back molars on the left side of his jaw were extracted using pliers. He was taken to another detention centre in Abu Ghraib where he was beaten for another three weeks . His comments follow calls for a judge-led inquiry into British involvement in CIA torture, following a US Senate Report which claimed 'abhorrent' interrogation techniques were used by US agents. CIA Director, John Brennan, admitted some agents had used 'unauthorised methods', but insists they gained some valuable information through techniques such as 'water-boarding' - which was used to save lives. McNab, which is a pseudonym he coined after 20 years of military service, says there are a number of 'quick, harmful, painful techniques' which can be used to effectively extract information from a captive. He conceded that he only supported the use of torture immediately after a suspect was captured rather than months later, when the information they possessed would be 'out of date'. Tortured: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (pictured), who's believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks, was water-boarded 183 times . Justified: The director of the CIA, John Brennan (pictured), defended the US spy agency's use of torture - saying the information gained through punishment saved lives . The former special forces officer was himself tortured by Iraqi forces, after being captured on covert mission during the first Gulf War in January 1991. He and three of his colleagues were taken to an interrogation centre in Baghdad where they were stripped of their clothing, beaten and held in isolation for over three weeks. Each of the men were whipped until they bled - their wounds then sealed with a red-hot metal spoon. At one point, McNab, now 54, says his molars were forcibly removed with pliers. He was eventually transferred to another prison in Abu Ghraib where he was beaten for another three weeks. Despite the unimaginable pain he was subjected to, McNab maintains that torture is 'a weapon misunderstood by those who were not inflicting or being subjected to it. He said: 'At the moment there is this moral revulsion at what has gone on. 'However, if there was real time information that did actually save lives, we would be looking at it in a different way.'","Torture can be used to prevent terrorist attacks says former SAS sergeant .

"After upsetting the odds one week, it’s always good to back it up the following one — and Stoke managed that yesterday as they escaped south London with a point. Crystal Palace aren’t in the class of Arsenal, who Stoke beat last Saturday, but they defended stoutly, worked as a unit and forced Mark Hughes’s side into areas they did not wish to be.

In Bolasie, Neil Warnock has an individual who could be the difference between Palace and the rest of the sides towards the bottom of the division. The barometer for Stoke is not how they fare against the likes of the Gunners in the Britannia Stadium but on awkward trips such as this. They passed the test, just. ‘We have to be reasonably pleased with an away point,’ Hughes said. ‘Last week was fantastic, but credit to Palace, they asked questions of us. The pitch wasn’t great and we would like to have produced more.’ Bolasie shone brightly, coping well with the hype around him. McArthur drew another smart save from Begovic with a curling effort from outside the box as he produced a display more reminiscent of his Wigan days under Roberto Martinez. ‘It was good for McArthur to get a goal — we need more from other areas. He complements the set-up and helps Yannick,’ Warnock said. Martin Kelly runs over to celebrate with McArthur, Bolasie, Zaha and Ledley after his side go in the lead . McArthur is congratulated by Palace captain Mile Jedinak after scoring the opening goal of the match . Bolasie was the one to catch the eye. The 25-year-old admits he needs to be more productive — chiefly to chip in with extra goals — but his manager was delighted with his directness and his final ball here. Bolasie’s crosses are certainly hitting the mark on a more regular basis. He should be off to the Africa Cup of Nations next month with Congo and Palace are sure to miss him. For now, there are games to be won and Bolasie is the man to secure results. Warnock isn’t worried about suitors in next month’s transfer window. ‘It doesn’t matter how much anyone offers us,’ he said. ‘He won’t be going anywhere in January.’ It didn’t take him long to make a telling contribution. After 11 minutes, he sauntered down the left and flighted a cross for James McArthur to flick home. The unusually quiet Selhurst Park crowd rose from their slumber, but only briefly. Stoke were level just over a minute later. Jon Walters wasn’t picked up and his blocked effort found its way to the inexplicably unmarked Peter Crouch — standing to attention at the back post — who did the rest. The gangly striker might have won it with only moments remaining but couldn’t get enough power into his volley. Warnock’s side enjoyed the best of it, Stoke seemingly out of sorts and incapable of dealing with Bolasie’s pace and trickery. McArthur had the taste for more, stinging Asmir Begovic’s palms after a clever reverse pass from the left winger, while Wilfried Zaha’s low shot almost crept inside a post.

"Federal agents believe drug cartels have moved into Colorado and are using the recent legalization of marijuana within the state as a front to make money illegally. Drug cartels – both from Columbia and Mexico – have suffered major revenue losses following the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado on January 1. The Feds believe the gangs will now turn to the legal businesses in the state to find ways of making up for the shortfall in their profits. Federal agents believe Colorado's legal marijuana business will become a target for drug cartels who've lost money as a result of the change in the law . ‘Our intelligence tells us, and all indications are (drug cartels) are going to move in if they haven't already,’ Tom Gorman, director of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, told USA Today. In 2012 the Mexican Competitiveness Institute issued a report saying that Mexico’s cartels would lose as much as $1.425 billion if Colorado legalized marijuana. The organization also predicted that drug trafficking revenues would fall 20 to 30 percent, and the Sinaloa cartel, which would be the most affected, would lose up to 50 percent. Faced with such losses, the violent cartels could force their way in as black market wholesalers or simply rob pot dispensaries, which take only cash and have not been able to establish accounts with banks because of lenders' fears of violating federal laws. In Mexico the power of the drug cartels has created a sense of lawlessness and an increase in vigilantism, which U.S. drug officials don't think will be the case in Colorado . Agents are already gathering evidence and widespread raids take place last November targeting more than a dozen dispensaries, warehouses, homes and grow operations in the state. Since 2005 before medical marijuana was legal in Colorado, pot smuggling busts have increased 407 percent, according to a report from the Rocky Mountain drug trafficking task force, which is connected to the White House National Office of Drug Control Policy. Most of the pot was being smuggled primarily to Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas and Wisconsin, the report said. Marijuana often is sold for twice as much on the black market in states where it is not legal. ‘You have a very desirable product with 48 other states that are potential customers. My God! What a market that is,’ said Gorman. Drug cartels - both from Columbia and Mexico - have suffered major revenue losses following the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado on January 1 . Any drug cartel activity in Colorado creates huge potential problems for police and citizens, he said.‘(Cartels are) treacherous and they have no sense of morality,’ Gorman said. Drug-related violence has killed tens of thousands of people in Mexico in the past decade, but Gorman said we won't see that level of violence. Cartels will keep a lower profile in Colorado to avoid drawing attention to their activities.","Federal agents believe drug cartels are using the recent legalization of marijuana in Colorado as a front to make money illegally .

"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has said it would be absurd and facile to ban interrogators from torturing terror suspects. His controversial declaration comes amid outrage over a Senate report into CIA torture tactics, which found no life-saving information was extracted using brute force. Speaking to a Swiss radio station, Scalia, 78, said American and European liberals who say such tactics may never be used are being self-righteous. He said: 'Listen, I think it's very facile for people to say, ""Oh, torture is terrible"". You posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in Los Angeles and will kill millions of people. 'Facile': Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said it would be simplistic to rule out torture of terror suspects . 'You think it's an easy question? You think it's clear that you cannot use extreme measures to get that information out of that person?' Scalia also said that while there are U.S. laws against torture, nothing in the Constitution appears to prohibit harsh treatment of suspected terrorists. 'I don't know what article of the Constitution that would contravene,' he said. The 30-minute interview touched on a range of topics, including the financing of political campaigns, the death penalty and gay marriage, about which Scalia said he should not comment because it is likely the court soon will have the issue before it. Asked about money and U.S. elections, Scalia scoffed that 'women may pay more each year to buy cosmetics' than is spent on local, state and federal elections combined. His comments about interrogation techniques echoed remarks he also has made to foreign audiences. In 2008, he used the example of the hidden bomb. 'It seems to me you have to say, as unlikely as that is, it would be absurd to say you couldn't, I don't know, stick something under the fingernail, smack him in the face. It would be absurd to say you couldn't do that,' he said. A year earlier, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported that Scalia invoked fictional TV counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer using torture to get terrorism suspects to reveal information that could help authorities foil an imminent attack. 'Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer? I don't think so,' he said. 'So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes. And ought we believe in these absolutes.' Scalia is the latest to weigh in on the controversy. This week, a former SAS soldier who survived weeks of torture at the hands of Iraqi interrogators said the tactics can be used to prevent terrorists attacks. Andy McNab believes security services have a 'moral responsibility' to torture suspects if innocent lives hang in the balance. The soldier-turned-author says torture can yield vital information if used properly - and will be used by authorities in the future to prevent terrorist attacks. Defence: SAS soldier-turned-author Andy McNab (right) says torturing suspects, such as those held in Guantanamo Bay following the September 11 attacks (left), is warranted if it saves lives . Immoral: A US Senate report concluded that torture techniques used by the CIA on Al Qaeda suspects (pictured, file photo) did not produce 'useful information' Evidence: A report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by CIA agents against Al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of the September 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence. Protest: Human rights activists in Washington DC demonstrate 'water-boarding' on a volunteer (file photo) The former British Army sergeant told The Times he 'wouldn't think twice' about 'inflicting pain' on someone if he thought it could prevent an atrocity such as the 2005 London bombings. He said: 'I would deem it a moral responsibility to interrogate, to physically torture him to get the information out. 'Torture is a really blunt instrument but it is an instrument that if it used right can yield results. 'There will always be legislation to make sure that we don't do it, but we will do it... We could moan about tactical interrogation or we could moan about 24-28 people getting blown up on a Tube. It's a tough call.' CIA Director, John Brennan, admitted some agents had used 'unauthorised methods', but insists they gained some valuable information through techniques such as 'water-boarding' - which was used to save lives. McNab, which is a pseudonym he coined after 20 years of military service, says there are a number of 'quick, harmful, painful techniques' which can be used to effectively extract information from a captive. He conceded that he only supported the use of torture immediately after a suspect was captured rather than months later, when the information they possessed would be 'out of date'. Tortured: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (pictured), who's believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks, was water-boarded 183 times . Justified: The director of the CIA, John Brennan (pictured), defended the US spy agency's use of torture - saying the information gained through punishment saved lives . The former special forces officer was himself tortured by Iraqi forces, after being captured on covert mission during the first Gulf War in January 1991. He and three of his colleagues were taken to an interrogation centre in Baghdad where they were stripped of their clothing, beaten and held in isolation for over three weeks. Each of the men were whipped until they bled - their wounds then sealed with a red-hot metal spoon. At one point, McNab, now 54, says his molars were forcibly removed with pliers. He was eventually transferred to another prison in Abu Ghraib where he was beaten for another three weeks. Despite the unimaginable pain he was subjected to, McNab maintains that torture is 'a weapon misunderstood by those who were not inflicting or being subjected to it. He said: 'At the moment there is this moral revulsion at what has gone on. 'However, if there was real time information that did actually save lives, we would be looking at it in a different way.'","Antonin Scalia, 78, said  nothing in the Constitution bans torture .

"As Louis van Gaal gears up for his first taste of arguably the biggest match in English football this weekend, he can rest safely in the knowledge that his record in ‘Clasicos’ is outstanding.

"Michael Schumacher's sponsors Navyboot and Jet Set have severed all commercial ties with the Formula One legend almost a year after his skiing accident in December 2013. The seven-time champion will lose about £4million a year by being dropped by the fashion firms less than a month after former racing driver Philippe Streiff announced Schumacher was 'paralysed, wheelchair-bound and unable to speak'. A spokesman for Phillipe Gaydoul, owner of Navyboot and Jet Set, confirmed the decision to end the 45-year-old coma victim's lucrative contract. Phillipe Gaydoul (left), owner of Navyboot and Jet Set, has cut ties with F1 legend Michael Schumacher (right) The contract with Navyboot and Jet Set reportedly paid Schumacher about £4million a year . Michael Schumacher's sponsors Navyboot and Jet Set have severed all commercial ties with the F1 legend . It comes after German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with him. It is not yet clear which other companies have severed their links with Schumacher, though Mercedes and wealth management firm DVAG have promised to stand by the F1 star. 'It is not easy for Schumacher's sponsors: paying out millions of Swiss francs per year and receiving nothing back since the crash,' said Swiss news website Bluewin. 'But must they separate in this situation from the Formula 1 legend? It is a balancing act: on the one hand, the sponsors must pursue economic objectives, which point towards for a parting. 'On the other hand it will not be well received in public if you are turning your back on Schumacher at this difficult time.' German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with the Formula One star . Schumacher is currently being cared for by a team of specialists in a state-of-the-art medical suite built inside his £35m mansion near Lake Geneva. He was on holiday with family and friends in French Alps ski resort Meribel when he fell and his head struck a rock. Schumacher was airlifted after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specialises in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and was placed in an artificial coma, before being operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. It was announced in January that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm revealed  he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment.

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr has named May 2 as the date for his shotgun wedding with Manny Pacquiao. Speculation that the richest fight in boxing history is close to being made has been rife since the Pacman put on an impressive performance to defeat Chris Algieri in Macau two weeks ago. Now Mayweather, put under pressure by one of his promotion companies' events, said: 'Will I fight Pacquiao? Absolutely.' Floyd Mayweather's has confirmed that he will fight with Manny Pacquiao in 2015 . Pacquiao (right) called out Mayweather to fight him after beating Chris Algieri in November . Mayweather says Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum has been preventing the fight from happening . When asked if it would be his next fight he replied: 'absolutely.' Pressed as to when that would be he confirmed the expected date for his next appearance, saying: 'May 2, absolutely'. The undefeated holder of the mythical title of the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world went on: 'The public want this fight. I want it. the only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on.' Mayweather admitted for the first time that negotiations are underway 'behind the scenes', adding: 'I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on. 'Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field. 'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.' The news comes as a blow for Amir Khan (left) who takes on Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday . For the man who calls himself Money, most of the discussions centre around the split of the biggest purse of all time. It is estimated that the fight will gross a minimum $300million. Pacquiao has agreed to take the thin end of the 60-40 split, although there are suggestions that Mayweather may demand an even higher percentage if an agreement is to be finalised. If Arum can pioneer pay-per-view in his new market, China, the revenue could rise to so far as to make this a billion dollar fight. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas as usual. But Arum has been proposing the erection of a pop-up stadium in the famous Strip with a 50,000 capacity, more than double that of any existing arena in Sin City. If Mayweather is indeed signalling the advent of the biggest fight of all time it will come as a disappointment for our own Amir Khan, who is hoping that an outstanding performance as well as victory here in Vegas this very Saturday night over Devon Alexander would seal his own long-awaited super-fight with Mayweather.

Malignaggi believes Khan will also be the biggest threat to Floyd Mayweather, should he get to take him on . ‘It’s a solid fight between two top welterweights,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘Amir has gone through something of an evolution since losing to Danny Garcia. He hasn’t changed his style but he’s a bit more intelligent. ‘At first he didn’t look so impressive and even I was starting to wonder if he was finished but in the last fight he showed a brand new psychological confidence. He still has all the ability technically but now he’s mentally in a good zone and it shows in his boxing. ‘The guys who box don’t have success against Amir but guys who punch wild and are not scared to punch with him do and in those cases he’s been caught. People like Breidis Prescott and Danny Garcia and even Marcos Maidana at times gave Amir a ton of trouble. ‘Ultimately, to box Amir is a very difficult thing to do because he knows how to win rounds. Devon is a very good boxer but I’m not sure he’ll be handle Amir’s style.’ Khan will hope that victory will propel him into a clash with Mayweather, although the pound-for-pound king has his sights on Manny Pacquiao.

I’m hearing that they’re really pushing to make it but if Amir puts in a great performance, he’ll take a lot of attention away from Pacquiao and make a big statement. ‘I do feel in my heart that Amir is more of a threat to Floyd and he is the greatest risk to Mayweasther’s undefeated record. ‘I know some people don’t agree with that because of the fanfare Pacquiao has but this is not a popularity contest. Styles win fights and I believe Amir has a style that will give Mayweather a lot more trouble than Pacquiao. ‘If the Pacquiao fight doesn’t come off and Amir comes through against Devon, he deserves a shot at Mayweather.’ Paulie Malignaggi will be attending the ‘Vegas Fight Night Comes To Manchester Event’ along with many other top names from the boxing, sport and entertainment world on January 31 at Event City.

"Steve McClaren endured another unhappy return to the Riverside as Middlesbrough leapfrogged Derby in the Championship. Not since the halcyon days under McClaren, highlighted by a League Cup win and UEFA Cup final appearance, have Boro fans had so much to feel optimistic about. And Aitor Karanka's men came out on top thanks to a stellar performance from former County loanee Patrick Bamford, who scored eight times in 21 appearances during a spell at Pride Park last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Middlesborough 2-0 Derby . A Patrick Bamford opener (pictured) and a Grant Leadbitter penalty condemned Derby County to defeat . Middlesbrough's Bamford and Co celebrate after going 1-0 up in the first half against Derby County . Derby came into the game as Championship leaders but left the Riverside with nothing . Leadbitter's penalty put Boro 2-0 up against Derby on Saturday and moved them top ahead of 3pm kickoffs . Derby manager Steve McClaren was the only boss on the touchline but left with nothing after losing 2-0 .

Bookings: Hendrick, Bryson, Forsyth . Sent off: Shotton (62) Referee: Roger East (Wiltshire) Having set Boro on their way in the sixth minute, the Chelsea man - whose deal runs until the new year - won a second-half penalty that Grant Leadbitter converted. Down to 10 men after Ryan Shotton had been dismissed in the build-up to the spot-kick, Derby could not find a response as McClaren lost on Teesside for the second successive campaign. That left his former club looking down on the rest of the league, at least for a few hours, with Ipswich or Bournemouth both able to replace them with victory in their respective 3pm kick-offs. Middlesbrough enjoyed a flying start as they took the lead through Bamford. After finding space with some clever movement, the striker was left with the simple task of diverting Adam Reach's clever pull-back in off the post for a sixth goal in seven games. Derby looked rattled as their usually-crisp passing game faltered. And they would have fallen further behind but for a stunning double-save by Lee Grant. Having denied Bamford following a Leadbitter through-ball, the goalkeeper produced a stunning one-handed stop on the stretch to turn Jelle Vossen's follow-up effort over the crossbar. Middlesbrough made a strong case for their promotion chase to the Premier League with the 2-0 victory . Derby had a bad day at the office against Boro as the home side claimed three points on Saturday . Undeterred, Boro continued to push forward, with Adam Reach hitting a 20-yard strike narrowly over crossbar. The one-way traffic did not relent for the remainder of the half, although Derby were nearly gifted a leveller. Dimi Konstantopoulos' poor clearance flew straight to Johnny Russell, who fed Jeff Hendrick. However, the midfielder's weak effort gave the goalkeeper an easy opportunity to atone. McClaren made a double change at the interval in an attempt to spark a reversal of fortunes, Jordon Ibe and Leon Best replacing Simon Dawkins and Omar Mascarell. Middlesbrough remained in the ascendancy, though, with Grant brilliantly keeping out a Leadbitter free-kick that had just evaded Daniel Ayala. Boro were not made to pay for their misses, Shotton bringing down Bamford in the area following Vossen's superb pass - allowing Leadbitter to hammer home from the spot. The ever-dangerous Bamford twice stung the hands of Grant afterwards, yet it mattered little as Middlesbrough took the points - albeit with the help of a superb Konstantopoulos save that stopped Craig Bryson setting up a tense finale.

How Frank Lampard scored his opener... click here for more from our Match Zone . Lampard is a phenomenon, and not just because that is now six goals in his short time at The Etihad. More staggering is the fact that a midfielder now stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the finest striker we have seen in the Barclays Premier League, Lampard’s 175 goals putting him level with Thierry Henry and fourth only to Alan Shearer, Andy Cole and Wayne Rooney. Here at the King Power Stadium he proved himself every inch the predator he has long been, timing his arrival perfectly to meet Samir Nasri’s pass with a delightful close-range 40th minute finish. Tired after their efforts in Rome in midweek and weakened by the loss of Edin Dzeko to injury during the pre-match warm-up, City were struggling to attack a spirited Leicester side with any real conviction. But Nasri showed great skill and composure with a dribble into the box before delivering the ball to perfection to an unmarked Lampard. Nigel Pearson would been annoyed with his defenders. Hell he might even have cursed. But it was an intelligent piece of attacking football from two terrific players.

Manchester City goalkeeper  Hart pictured early on during the Premier League match on Saturday against Leicester . Heaven knows how they respond over in New York. Presumably with a bit of a groan together with the realisation that they might have to be patient if they ever want to see Lampard marshalling their midfield. About as patient as Leicester supporters might have to be before they see their team win again. Not since that remarkable 5-3 defeat of Manchester United back in September has it happened, defeat here extending a miserable run to just two points from a possible 33. A run that increases the pressure on a beleaguered Pearson. They actually played well in spells, starting so impressively – Riyad Mahrez was excellent - the statisticians began to wonder if Leciester might be about to beat the English champions for the first time since 1972; when Keith Weller’s hat-trick conquered Bill Shankly’s Liverpool. But such romanticism again gave way to realism, and with yet another reminder of the size of the task facing this club to remain in the top flight. This was a good day to play City. They might have been strengthened by the return of Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Yaya Toure but Dzeko’s injury in the warm-up forced Pellegrini to employ a relative novice in attack and the loss of Kompany to injury before the end presented further problems. It was certainly a difficult day for 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo, making his first Premier League start as a replacement for Dzeko. The setback for City certainly seemed to give Leicester some much needed confidence, because they started brightly here. Jamie Vardy proved a handful for Manchester United when they were beaten here earlier this season and his pace left City’s back four looking stretched at times too. Eliaquim Mangala, impressive here, did particularly well to deny the rapidly advancing Leicester forward with a perfectly executed block. Leicester can be too cavalier. It probably explains why only QPR had conceded more goals than them in the top flight this season coming into this game. But their early ambition was admirable, with Kompany forced to be at his physical, combative best to deal with Jeffrey Schlupp at one stage. David Silva was back fit for Manchester City, though they remain without striker Sergio Aguero who suffered knee ligament damage .

Lampard acknowledges manager Pellegrini as he goes off in the second half after giving them the lead at the King Power Stadium . Esteban Cambiasso went dangerously close with a free-kick, which was all the more worrying for Pellegrini when his forwards were struggling to impose themselves anything like as effectively. It was Leicester displaying the energy and determination. Leicester who could sense weakness in their opponents. Fatigue in the wake of their midweek efforts in Rome was clearly a factor, and perhaps explained why two players not involved in that stunning Champions League triumph finally mustered a response for the visitors. A neat ball from David Silva was met with a decent shot from Yaya Toure. Sadly for City it was superseded by the save from Ben Hamer, in goal for the injured Kasper Schmeichel. There was nothing Hamer could do, however, about Lampard’s 40th minute goal; a goal that owed much to the fine attacking play of Samir Nasri but still demanded a calm, clever finish. Vincent Kompany down injured in what could be a serious blow to Manchester City . Kompany applauds fans are he walks off injured during the Premier League match on Saturday . Kompany was forced off with an injury during the second half against Leicester . After the break and Leicester remained determined, even if the sight of Pearson barking instructions from his position in the stand to his staff down on the bench suggested he was less than happy. Probably with a lack of composure in that all-important final third. Pellegrini, meanwhile, began to make changes. Shortly before the hour Lampard walked off to a chorus of ‘super Frankie Lampard’ from the visiting fans – they seem to have adopted the song as well as the player – but the loss of Kompany to what looked like a hamstring problem would have been more worrying for City’s manager. It provided further inspiration for Leicester, City now without their captain; their defensive rock.

"If this is what a dry spell looks like then Jose Mourinho can probably rest easy, but he should not get too comfortable. There will be harder days ahead, especially if his side produce many more performances like this one. Not that it was dreadful. How could it be when they won 2-0 and did not face a single shot on goal? But that’s not to say it was impressive. They led through Eden Hazard inside six minutes and after 10 minutes Hull had lost Michael Dawson to injury. It was not until the 67th minute, when Diego Costa scored their second goal after Tom Huddlestone was shown a red card for a dreadful tackle, that they looked comfortable.

Even then there was a lingering ‘what if’, one that was posed so passionately by Steve Bruce when he weighed up Chris Foy’s odd decision not to book Gary Cahill for diving in the second half. Having already been shown a yellow card in the opening period, the England centre-half was extremely lucky not to be dismissed for his tumble when it was still 11 v 11 and 1-0 to Chelsea. But a win is a win, as they say. Mourinho certainly wasn’t trumpeting it as anything else, saying: ‘I have to agree - we have had many special performances this season and in this we just had moments. Not for 90 minutes.’ This was the sort of day where Mourinho had only pragmatic thoughts. When asked why he was snubbed for the manager of the month award, he said: ‘I promise you that what I tell you is true - I don't care. But there is something that is not right because, in four years in the Premier League, I've won the manager of the month twice. So, for sure, they don't like me. But I don't care. I just want my team to win.’ Petr Cech flaps at a cross as the Chelsea keeper makes his first Premier League start of the season .

Brazilian midfielder Oscar (centre) congratulates Hazard after providing the assist for his goal . Hull's  Nikica Jelevic and Tom Huddlestone wanted more serious punishment for the foul while Cahill stayed down after the collision . That much they achieved, sweeping away in the process some of the doubting looks that came their way after the club’s recent struggles in the north-east, either side of a win against Tottenham. Not that four points from three games ought to constitute a crisis when set against Hull’s run of nine games without a win. But there are worries for Mourinho, namely what happens when Cesc Fabregas is not available. His ban for this game was somewhat offset by the return of Nemanja Matic, a wonderfully significant cog in this machine. But John Obi Mikel made up the numbers next to Matic in front of the defence and the combination simply is not as creative or fluent as when Matic and Fabregas play together. The tempo is evidently not the same when they are separated. Perhaps that is why Diego Costa was often so subdued when this was still a match between equal numbers. He had not scored in his previous four appearances and barely made a dent on Hull’s defence in the first half. Often, the supply line just was not functioning. With due credit to Hull, they steadied themselves well after a dreadful start littered with misfortune. They were behind after only six minutes and had good cause to appeal for a foul in the build-up to Hazard’s headed opener. Mikel had won possession in the middle of the pitch, but replays showed he took more than a bit of Sone Aluko’s foot in the process. No whistle came, Matic spread the play to Oscar on the left and his excellent cross found Hazard. His header meant eight goals this season for a man closing in on a £200,000 a week contract.

Then, in return, he said he'd come back fresh. He came back with that happiness in his legs.’ Dawson then left the pitch after injuring his hamstring and what was already a tough fixture looked far harder. Somehow, the walloping never happened; Hazard’s goal was the only shot on target in the half. The second half was fairly even until the second of two refereeing incidents. First, Cahill escaped a booking for diving after a David Meyler challenge – he had already been booked for a bad foul on Sone Aluko - and then Tom Huddlestone was sent off for an awful tackle on Filipe Luis after an hour. Within seven minutes Chelsea were two up.

"Liverpool, you have been warned. Prepare for an uncomfortable evening on the south coast on Wednesday. You would have forgiven Bournemouth for being a little preoccupied by their upcoming Capital One Cup quarter-final glamour tie. Not one bit of it. With five goals and five different goalscorers, they surged to the Championship summit and confirmed what we already suspected. The midweek trip here to take on old pal Eddie Howe will be far from easy for Brendan Rodgers and his mis-firing Reds. Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie (centre) celebrates scoring during the Championship match on Saturday . Ritchie put Bournemouth 1-0 up against Cardiff after just one minute on Saturday . Harry Arter (right) celebrates making it 2-0 as the Championship game saw a flurry of goals .

Subs not used: Da Silva, Ecuele Manga,  Adeyemi, Ralls, Moore . Bookings: NONE . Goals: Jones (45), Morrison (48, 78) Referee: James Adcock (Nottinghamshire) Attendance: 10,440 (1,357 away) They are a superb attacking force with goals coming from everywhere. Matt Ritchie, Harry Arter, Marc Pugh, Yann Kermorgant and Callum Wilson all scored here in a splendid advert for Championship football. That Cardiff kept it so close for so long was testament to their fighting spirit - goals from Kenwyne Jones and two towering headers from Sean Morrison made things interesting - but in the end they were deservedly beaten. It is an indication of Bournemouth's belief they can challenge for Premier League promotion that all mentions of Wednesday night's big match were banned. The Cup was for another day. Howe didn't give it a mention in his programme notes, nor did captain Tommy Elphick. With Middlesbrough beating Derby County 2-0 at lunchtime, the Cherries knew they could finish the afternoon on top of the table and, despite the lure of Liverpool's visit, Howe didn't rest any players. Russell Slade also sent out an unchanged team but to the displeasure of the travelling hordes from the Welsh capital, they were dressed in all-white. 'Are we Swansea in disguise?' was one of the more printable chants directed at owner Vincent Tan. Wearing the colours of your bitter rival aside, their mood had been soured just 38 seconds in. From the game's first attack, Bournemouth led when Callum Wilson darted down the left and played across a ball that fell perfectly for the onrushing Ritchie to drill into the bottom corner. It was his third in four games. 'We score when we want,' crowed the jubilant home support. And very early, too, it would seem. Cardiff City's Kenwyne Jones (right) scores his side's first goal of the game to make the score 2-1 . Jones runs back to the half way line after scoring for Cardiff on Saturday . The hosts set the early tempo, with Charlie Daniels a willing runner from left-back in support of the creative players. Likewise Simon Francis on the right and his cross was deftly taken down by Pugh, whose shot was struck into the ground and bounced kindly for David Marshall. Cardiff's form has undoubtedly improved since Slade replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but they still suffer from some travel sickness. It took them a good 20 minutes to get going, the lightweight Kim Bo-Kyung particularly liable to give the ball away. Craig Noone showed some intent with a head-down charge towards the box but his effort flew high and wide. The brawny Jones showed good strength inside the danger zone but Elphick bravely slid in to snuff out his shot. Two minutes before the break and Bournemouth doubled their lead with the best move of the first-half. Arter's fine pass out to the left found Daniels and his centre was touched on by Brett Pitman to Pugh. Marshall came out and forced him wide but Pugh retained the ball, turned and found Arter, who'd ghosted into the box to fire into the bottom corner. Then, their heads giddy with the prospect of going top, Bournemouth switched off and were punished. A long ball from the back wasn't dealt with by Steve Cook, who slipped and allowed Adam Le Fondre to sprint clear. His cut-back was perfect for Jones, who finished from all of six yards out. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe shouts his instructions during the high-scoring Championship game . Cardiff City manager Russell Slade looks on during the Championship game at Bournemouth . Seconds later and it was Cardiff's turn to switch off as Arter teed up Pugh to unleash a superb dipping shot that looped over Marshall and into the net, his sixth goal of the campaign. Slade reshuffled a little at the break, replacing the ineffective Bo-Kyung with Kadeem Harris and the rewards were also instant as Cardiff again cut the deficit. Peter Whittingham delivered the ball in from the left and Morrison soared above the Bournemouth defence to direct a thumping header past Artur Boruc into the bottom corner. Then a moment of controversy as Bournemouth claimed Marshall handled outside the box after rushing out to stop Wilson reaching a cross. Referee James Adcock - and his assistant when consulted - sided with the goalkeeper. The game was suddenly on a knife-edge and Ritchie, who always carried a threat for Bournemouth, flashed a 20-yard hit wide just before the hour following another neat passing move. Cardiff's David Marshall fails to stop a shot from Bournemouth's Marc Pugh during the Championship match . Bournemouth's Pugh (right) is congratulated by Brett Pitman (left) after scoring one of five for his team . Then, a moment of magic from Kermorgant restored the two-goal cushion. Pugh was fouled by Matt Connolly just outside the box and the Frenchman, who had replaced Pitman, curled a beautiful free-kick into the top corner. Surely the contest was all over this time? No. Back came Cardiff once more and once again it was Morrison leaping above the Bournemouth defence to sneak a header in at the back post, again from a Whittingham cross. The home side came again and Ritchie had a goal ruled out for offside after Arter's shot had been pushed out to him by Marshall. Still Cardiff wouldn't give up and substitute Tom Adeyemi attempted an audacious flick that went over Boruc's goal. Then, with two minutes left, the knockout blow. Ritchie slipped the ball through to Wilson and the in-form striker kept running past defenders and then the goalkeeper until nobody stood in his way, rolling the ball into an unguarded net.

"A sorority girl at the University of Maryland is facing outrage after she posed for a photo with a racist birthday cake made of alcohol bottles that reads, 's*** a n**** d***' on her 21st birthday.

'I didn’t know it was okay for white people to say n**** now? Who knew?' As soon as the University heard about the backlash surrounding the photo, The University of Maryland Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life posted a response to their Twitter and said, 'We are aware of an insensitive post from a community member and are addressing it with the chapter as it does not align with our Greek values.' Hitting back: Upon hearing about the racist Instagram photo the University of Maryland's Greek life organization made it clear they were not linked to the post . Taking responsibility: The Delta Gamma sorority chapter in Maryland took to Facebook to label the photo and comment inappropriate and not in line with their beliefs . The sorority posted on their Facebook saying, 'We have become aware of an unacceptable Instagram post by a member of our chapter.

"Support for the UK Independence Party has reached a record 19 per cent, while both Labour and Conservatives are losing ground, it has emerged. Despite a week of controversy, in which UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Edinburgh and was locked in a pub by angry protestors, public backing for the party has never been higher. The UK Independence Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him were the ‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda. However, poll results do not reflect the crowds who just this week shouted 'racist scumbag' and 'scum' at the leader, who has begun to pose a real threat as a major political party. Nigel Farage outside the Canon's Gait Pub, Edinburgh on Thursday. The UKIP leader retreated from protestors but will be in a more buoyant mood following latest poll figures . Farage has no need to hold recruitment signs (pic right) as his party enjoys an unprecedented surge in support. He appeared on last Sunday's Andrew Marr in a discussion about an EU referendum and his party's supporters . Farage's popularity was not mirrored in Edinburgh, where he said 'Scottish nationalists are Fascist scum' According to research, support for . Labour was down three points to 35 per cent, the Conservatives were down . one to 29 per cent and the Liberal Democrats were unchanged on 8 per . cent. The . party - which has had a gaffe-ridden few weeks - has managed to appeal . to the public so much so that there has been a four per cent jump in . support in the last month. The ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday gives Ukip the highest share recorded by any pollster. Since . their shock win in an Eastleigh-by-election in February, UKIP . representatives have produced a series of embarrassing moments for the . party. UKIP Councillor Eric Kitson, 59, resigned after posting racist cartoons and messages on Facebook. One . included a picture of a nuclear weapon exploding emblazoned with the . message: 'Some cancers need to be treated with radiation, Islam is one . of them'. He also shared an . image of a Muslim being roasted over a pile of burning Korans, as well . as several anti-Semitic outbursts linking the Rothschild banking dynasty . to Adolf Hitler. In one comment he said in reference to Muslim women: 'Hang um all first then ask questions later.' The . councillor from Stourport, Worcestershire, apologised to residents and . party colleagues for his 'stupid' actions but he denied being racist. Alex . Wood, a UKIP candidate for Blackmore Vale in Somerset, was suspended . from the party last month after being caught on camera apparently making . a Nazi salute, bringing further scandal to the party. Comments saying that Africans ‘lived in mud huts’ and ‘kill each other’ also appeared under his name on the Facebook page. It . also emerged that John Sullivan, a UKIP candidate in Gloucestershire, . is alleged to have made the homophobic comments on Facebook. He is said to have claimed that regular exercise 'prevents' children from 'becoming' gay. He . also suggested the Victorian method of physical exercise 'released . tension and thus avoided homosexuality', but it was unclear whether . these are Mr Sullivan's views or whether he was just talking about . Victorian attitudes to sport and homosexuality. Results show that the UKIP leader's image is appealing to the public. Tory council leader Keith Mitchell said Mr Farage 'uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives' Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and PM David Cameron have had seen their support dwindle at the hands of UKIP . The threat that UKIP now poses was acknowledged by Tory council leader Keith Mitchell, who said David Cameron needs to behave more like Nigel Farage to reverse Ukip's rise. Mr Mitchell accounted for the huge rise in popularity for the Right-wing party, who are believed to be chipping away at the Tory's traditional supporters. He said: ‘I am afraid the UKIP leader has a style and a manner of speaking that connects with ordinary mortals much better than professional politicians.’ ‘He is unafraid to be filmed with a pint of beer and a cigarette in his hand when all of our media training tells us to eschew either image. ‘He also uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives.’ His warning came as figures revealed . UKIP enjoyed a 51 per cent surge in members during the past 12 months, . with many of them defecting from the Conservative Party. According . to the study 46% of Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a . referendum now, compared with 24% who would stay in. With . the issue of an EU referendum as the current hot topic, strategists are . blaming Labour’s own lack of clarity on Europe on the public's . disillusionment with the leadership. Privately, Labour insiders are warning of a ‘crisis of legitimacy’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next general election. But if some powers were returned to the UK from Brussels 43% would vote to remain in the EU, with just 24% determined to see Britain leave. The poll found just 26% said David Cameron was a good Prime Minister, a record low in ComRes studies, while 31% believed Ed Miliband was performing well as Labour leader, a new high. The survey revealed that 57% of voters believed Mr Cameron's party was more divided over Europe than it was under Sir John Major, with 14% disagreeing. But there was some comfort for the Prime Minister, with 49% of voters saying the offer of a European referendum would be important to them at the next general election, with 27% disagreeing. And 32% believed Mr Cameron would make the best prime minister of the party leaders, with 24% opting for Mr Miliband.

"Kieran Richardson was once carried shoulder-high by West Bromwich Albion fans at the Hawthorns following his part in a great escape against relegation. Ten seasons on, his red card here brought cheer to those same supporters and ultimately provided Alan Irvine with a victory that keeps his job safe. Richardson was sent off midway through the first half to hand the hosts a golden opportunity that they duly polished when Craig Gardner, a Villa academy graduate, drove home 18 minutes from the end.

For some time it looked as though West Brom’s lack of guile would cost them and the question loomed of whether a goalless draw against ten men would be seen as more damaging than a loss on equal terms in the eyes of chairman Jeremy Peace. That needs no answer now. Villa’s five-match unbeaten run is ended and West Brom have a first win since November 1. ‘Relief is one of the emotions,’ admitted Irvine. ‘I think everyone assumes it will be easy versus 10 men. But I didn’t think it was a foregone conclusion we’d score.’ Before kick-off, Irvine was aware of the importance of this fixture, both locally and for him professionally. So his selection told a story. Once again top scorer Saido Berahino was left on the bench. Instead Brown Ideye came in for the injured Victor Anichebe and Silvestre Varela was handed his first start for the club.

Gardner (centre) tries to muscle his way through Carlos Sanchez (left) and Cleverley as they battle for possession . The Portugal international was a positive presence throughout. Early on he skipped past Alan Hutton and crossed for Ideye, who was unable to get his head to the ball. That would prove a familiar sight: the Nigeria striker, West Brom’s £9million record signing, failing to connect with any clinical effect to the crosses that peppered the Villa box. The moment that shaped this match came in the 22nd minute. Richardson allowed the ball to run away from him and, as so often happens, dived to rectify his mistake. Trouble was Stephane Sessegnon had nipped in and the lunge was late and high. As Sessegnon lay on the floor, referee Mike Dean composed his thoughts, before producing the red card. Villa’s players staged a protest of sorts – ‘Are you mad?’ Richardson could be seen mouthing – but they seemed to accept the inevitable reduction to ten men. ‘In the modern day game if you raise your studs I can see why the ref gave him the card,’ said Lambert. ‘His enthusiasm to win the ball back probably got him sent off.’ The rest of the half was a case of West Brom controlling possession but failing to create clear openings – until five minutes before the interval. Sebastien Pocognoli beat Hutton and pulled the ball back to Sessegnon. Guzan blocked the shot, which lacked direction. Lambert sent on Fabian Delph at half-time for his first game in two months following a dislocated shoulder. Boldly, Gabby Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke stayed up front.

Varela had a volley blocked by Hutton, before sending another chance over. Then he crossed for Ideye, who shot well over. Berahino got his introduction in the 70th minute and his impact was instant. He sent over a devilish cross that Guzan failed to clear, Sessegnon hit Ideye with his shot and Gardner arrived to thunder the ball in. With 11 minutes to go Ron Vlaar and Andreas Weimann came on as Villa went three at the back. Benteke very nearly found an equaliser with a smart flick from Ciaran Clark’s pass and should have done better than fire wide when Agbonalhor set him up on the edge of the area in added time.

"Brendan Rodgers has brushed off scrutiny on his position by insisting he is the best man to lead Liverpool forward. Rodgers has come under fire since his side were dumped out of the Champions League, with former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol claiming he 'would be sacked' if results don't improve. It has been possibly the hardest week of an increasingly difficult season and Rodgers has been in contact with the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, following the 1-1 draw with Basle. Brendan Rodgers (centre) is stony-faced as he shakes hands with the fourth official after draw with Basle . Despite pressure on his position, Rodgers says he is the best man to lead Liverpool going forward . He admitted FSG are disappointed with how the campaign has gone but Rodgers has faith he can spark a revival, starting on Sunday at Old Trafford against Manchester United. Rodgers said: 'I think the message for me is clear, I don't think there would be anyone better to do the job here. Seven months ago we nearly won the title unexpectedly, I had time to work with players and above expectation and took them beyond where the club has been. 'This has been a difficult start with new players, less coaching time, young players, virtually starting again. I don't think there is anybody equipped better to deal with that . Rodgers instructs Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling as the Reds bow out of the Champions League . Rodgers gestures at training on Friday as Liverpool prepare to take on Manchester United on Sunday . 'I have been here for the last two and a half years and experienced what this club is about and seeing what we get from the players whenever we are at our best. 'It comes with the territory [criticism and people calling for a new manager] when you don't win games, football is very short term. The same people maybe six or seven months ago, I couldn't do anything wrong. Listen, command is lonely . 'That is the way football works. You have to accept that as a manager and fight even harder to bring success and something that in this period has ensured I will do for sure.' Rodgers says the influx of new players, including Mario Balotelli (back centre) and Alberto Moreno (right), has been like 'starting over again' after Liverpool narrowly missed out on last season's Premier League title . Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, has accepted an FA charge over posting an alleged anti-Semitic image on social media. Balotelli had until 6pm on Monday to respond to the FA after they found he had breached social media rules. Balotelli has not requested a personal hearing but has submitted written mitigation. There is no time scale on when the case will be concluded.

"The woman at the forefront of the design of Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts - the most expensive in sporting history - has detailed the process behind them ahead of the 28-year-old's world title bout against Devon Alexander on Saturday night. Earlier this week it was revealed that Khan would be wearing the unique piece of clothing, worth around £30,000, when fighting against Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Sophie Whittam, designer of the shorts and creator of Fight Label, spoke in detail about the thinking behind the development of the shorts. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Amir Khan reveal that he will donate his fight shorts to charity . The 28-year-old will wear shorts worth an estimated £20,000-£30,000 for the fight with the American . The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband . Sophie Whittam speaks to Sportsmail about the thinking behind Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts . 'We weren't originally planning to do the 24 carat gold shorts, but then we had a very exciting opportunity with a new company called 24KT,' she told Sportsmail. 'They have a thousand exclusive members who can order any kind of clothing they wish, which can then be customised with 24 carat gold. 'Amir is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts. 'The outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim, and then the lining is 100 per cent silk, so you have to combine all those materials  through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together. 'But I want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it. Whittam, designer and creator of Fight Label,  spoke passionately about the process behind the shorts . Whittam and Khan pose for a photo together at an event ahead of the latter's world title fight on Saturday . The banner for Khan and Alexander's fight hanging on the side of the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas . 'We started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper. 'It's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts. 'It's been a really exciting process working with Amir. At Fight Label I want to create people's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear. When you look good you feel good, and then you fight better too. 'Whether or not we had the material from 24KT we still strive to make unusual, unique fabrics and there's so many more different styles and trends to explore  - that's why I'm in this business.' Khan beat American Luis Collazo in his last fight, which was also in Las Vegas, back in May this year . The Briton doesn't seem to have indulged in any birthday cake on Tuesday, when he turned 28 . Khan talks to journalists, including Sportsmail's Jeff Powell, ahead of his upcoming fight . Despite her latest accomplishments Whittam is not standing still, and is already thinking of fresh plans for the future when she returns to the UK after this weekend's fight, admitting she'd relish the opportunity to work with Floyd Mayweather. She added: 'Because of the rate we're rapidly expanding the immediate plan is to hire more staff when we get back. 'I'd love to do a pair for Floyd (Mayweather), as I think we could go really flamboyant, after judging by what he's worn at his previous fights at the MGM. 'So one day it'd be nice for Fight Label to be up there in and amongst the Mayweather fame.'","Sophie Whittam is the designer behind Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts .

"South Africa and the United States are expected to pose the greatest threats to Ireland's £100million bid to host Rugby World Cup 2023. The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) has confirmed an all-Ireland bid to stage the world contest in nine years' time. The Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government are underpinning the joint bid to secure rugby's global showpiece.

The executives are joined  by Ireland players including Robbie Henshaw (left) and Paddy Jackson (second left) Robinson (right) and  McGuiness (left) pose with Irish Prime Minister Edna Kenny to support the 2023 bid . Chief executive Philip Browne said the IRFU and two Irish governments will expect to commit £100million to underwrite the possibility of staging the tournament. 'It has been out there that South Africa has stated an interest, Italy has bid in the past and stated an interest again, while Argentina has stated interest too, and also the USA,' said Browne. 'We are under no illusions it's going to be competitive and we have to put our best foot forward. 'At this stage we haven't had to tender documents, we won't get those for another 12 months or more. 'For the Japan World Cup the guarantee tournament fee which has to be paid to Rugby World Cup is £96million. 'One assumes we are going to have to pay at least that, probably more.' Governing body World Rugby will not officially launch the bidding process for Rugby World Cup 2023 host status until next year, and have not even finalised a timeline for applications. Ireland are the first nation to launch a bid for the 2023 tournament, but must now await further instruction from World Rugby on when to make any official tender. World Rugby expects the 2023 hosts to be selected in 2017, leaving Ireland quick off the mark in acclaiming their intentions. 'This is an exciting announcement that further underscores the enormous prestige, appeal and benefits of hosting Rugby World Cup for both unions and governments alike,' said a World Rugby spokesman in response to Ireland confirming their intentions so quickly. Ireland's Ian Madigan (centre) celebrates 26-23 win over Australia in November at the Aviva Stadium . McGuiness holds out a green rugby ball signifying Ireland's bid for the 2023 World Cup . The Aviva Stadium in Dublin would be one of the venues to host the World Cup in 2023 . Ireland's bid will be for sole staging of the tournament, and will not include any help from the likes of the Welsh or Scottish Rugby Union. Dublin's Aviva Stadium, Ulster's Kingspan ground at Ravenhill and Limerick's Thomond Park will form the centrepiece venues. Ireland's bid will also draw upon a host of Gaelic football stadia, with the 82,300-capacity Croke Park in Dublin at the forefront of that collaboration. Political administrations in Ireland's north and south have given the bid the green light after a 10-month preliminary assessment exercise. Irish premier Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Stormont's First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness joined IRFU boss Browne to announce the bid in Armagh on Friday. England will host next year's World Cup before the tournament descends on Japan in 2019, with World Rugby making good on long-held promises to grow the game beyond traditional heartlands. South Africa staged one of the most memorable tournaments in 1995, the hosts holding off New Zealand to claim glory under the jubilant and politically-poignant scenes of Nelson Mandela proudly sporting a Springboks shirt. New Zealand held the inaugural 1987 tournament, repeating hosting duties in 2011, while England will become the second nation to claim the honour twice, with 2015 following 1991. World Rugby could well aim to send the 2023 tournament back to a traditional rugby hotbed, after the 2019 shift to Japan: and that would leave South Africa strong contenders. The rugby-mad nation received a huge infrastructure boost for the FIFA football World Cup staged in 2010, so would argue much of the preparation work is already in place. Rugby's rapid rise in America was cemented by New Zealand's decision to face the US Eagles at Chicago's Soldier Field en route to their November European tour.","The Irish Rugby Football Union will bid for the 2023 World Cup .

"The business tycoon who owns the insurance website Compare the Market has raked in £220million after the successful advertising campaign featuring Aleksandr the meerkat. South African entrepreneur Douw Steyn, 59, who set up the website in Britain, has used some of his fortune to buy a 10-bedroom mansion for £62million in one of London’s most expensive and exclusive streets just a stone throw from Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Steyn owes much of his success and . wealth to the fictional chief meerkat Aleksandr Orlov, who talks in a . bizarre fake Russian accent and has made his ‘Simpiles’ catchphrase a . national phenomenon. Meerkat moolah: Douw Steyn was ranked 170, with a £600million fortune . The popular advertising campaign featuring the loveable creatures began in 2009. The catchphrase 'Simples' has now become so familiar it was included in Collins English Dictionary in 2010. When the meerkats first hit our screens three years ago, the businessman was worth £200million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List and as the campaign grew his income soared. In 2010 he was worth £320million, then £360million last year. And now his wealth stands at an estimated £420million. Making money is Simples: Alexandre the Meerkat from Compare The Market.com ad has been a huge success since its launch in 2009 . The cuddly meerkat is such a hit in the UK that it has more than 55,000 followers on Twitter and over 800,000 people have liked his Facebook page which keeps followers amused with jokey updates. His personal fortune may have benefited, but so has his company. The Compare the Market comparison site is an offshoot of BGL, which was launched by Mr Steyn in Peterborough, in 1992 as an insurance firm. And since the Meerkat campaign started the company’s value has more than doubled from £43million in 2008 to £88million. And BGL is employing 2,400 people at its Cambridgeshire HQ plus offices in Sunderland and Coventry. The Meerkats , which are a member of the ­mongoose family, have also given a shot in the arm to the advertising industry  because other firms have tried to copy the campaign’s success. More than an ad: Chief meerkat Aleksandr Orlov has been made into a cuddly toy . Mr Steyn, who stepped down as BGL non-executive chairman in February, is said to divide his time between London and South Africa, where he has business interests that include the five star Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg and a game reserve. Former South African president Nelson Mandela is understood to be one of his close friends and his new London mansion used to belong to billionaire Wall Street investment banker Bruce Wasserstein, who died in October 2009. Documents lodged with the Land Registry show the property was bought this year for £62.75million. Meanwhile the success of  Aleksandr has been so huge that he has featured in more than a dozen TV adverts, often accompanied by his long-suffering sidekick Sergei. Success story: The man behind comparethemarket.com, with its ubiqutious meerkat adverts, featured in the list . Spin-off characters were launched and the meerkats have achieved the feat of taking on a life of their own beyond the commercials that spawned them. Much like ITV Digital’s Monkey and Levi’s Flat Eric, Aleksandr is an advertising icon who has been made into a cuddly toy. Customers who book insurance through comparethemarket.com get one free. Aleksandr’s ­autobiography A Simples Life: The Life And Times of Aleksadr Orlov had more orders before publication than the life stories of Tony Blair, Cheryl Cole, Russell Brand or Dannii Minogue. Wealthy neighbour: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich lives in a £70m mansion near to Douw Steyn . The book tells the story of his ­ancestors’ journey from the Kalahari to Moscow and dwells on his love of cravats.Six more books called Meerkat Tales followed. Earlier this year he topped a TolunaQuick poll for the best insurance and comparison advertising characters ­– beating the Churchill dog and Gio Compario the Go-compare opera singer.","Meerkats help Douw Steyn increase his personal fortune to £420m .

"A woman who was attacked byb a pit bull owned by Kim Richards has filed a lawsuit against the reality star. Kay Rozario says she was at the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star's home last March when Kingsley, her adopted pit bull, attacked her without being provoked. The lawsuit names both Richards and Evolution Film & Tape, the company the produces the Real Housewives series, as defendants, and comes just days after it was revealed that Richards had given up the dog. Scroll down for video . Bad news: Kim Richards is being sued by a family friend who was attacked by her dog Kingsley (above) last March . Bad timing: This all comes just days after Kim's sister revealed in an interview that she had given up the dog . Rozario described the incident in detail in an interview with the New York Daily News. 'Kim was lying on the bed talking, and all of a sudden out of nowhere, the dog starts biting me,' she said. 'I'm trying to pull back, but the dog has hold of me with its teeth. I fall backwards onto floor with blood spurting everywhere. There was blood all over the place.' Paramedics eventually came to the house to treat Rozario and take her to a local hospital, though she claims Richards asked her not to call 911 and to keep the incident 'hush-hush.' Rozario, who needed stitches following the attack, says she was happy to keep quiet about the attack, until she learned that Richards had no plans to get rid of the animal. 'I'm 80 years old, I'm lucky I didn't die in that room,' she said. 'When I fell backward onto the floor, I could have bashed my head in.'

"Chelsea got back to winning ways in the Premier League thanks to strikes from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa. Jose Mourinho's men also maintained their unbeaten record at Stamford Bridge as they ground out a scrappy win over a Hull outfit that were forced to play the last 30 minutes of the game with 10 men after Tom Huddlestone's dismissal for a knee-high lunge on Filipe Luis. Sportsmail rates the players' performances at Turf Moor . Diego Costa (centre) is mobbed his his team-mates after scoring his side's second goal at Stamford Bridge . CHELSEA . Petr Cech- 7 . Desperate to show he can still compete at the highest level and looked comfortable throughout the game in his first league start of the season. Branislav Ivanovic- 7.5 . Never really tested and looked more dangerous with his bursting runs down the right hand side. Almost got his name on the scoresheet with a powerful shot which flew just over the bar. Gary Cahill - 6 . Relieved to see Chris Foy only pull out a yellow card following his late challenge on Sone Aluko in the first half which the Hull players were furious with. Caused another stir early in the second half when he appeared to dive inside the box and was lucky to stay on the field. Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill (left) was lucky to just see yellow for his challenge on Hull's Sone Aluko . John Terry - 8 . Always looked in control against Nikica Jelavic and showed once again why he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League with another commanding display. Jose Mourinho will be praying he can stay fit to keep his side at the top of the table. Filipe Luis - 7 . Fortunate to escape a serious injury following Huddlestone's nasty challenge in the second half which led to his dismissal. Never put a foot wrong and will be hoping to keep his place in the team. Mikel - 7 . With Cesc Fabregas serving a suspension, Mikel had a chance to show Mourinho why he should be a first-team regular and forged a good partnership with Matic at the heart of the midfield. Nemanja Matic - 8 . Has been one of Chelsea's best players this season and showed once again why he is so influential for the west London club with a powerful performance and broke up a lot of Hull's attacking play. Chelsea midfielder Willian collapses under the challenge of Hull defender Curtis Davies . Willian - 7.5 . The Brazilian forward infuriated the Hull dugout when he dived following a challenge with Curtis Davies and received an immediate yellow card from Chris Foy. Was taken off midway through the second half. Oscar - 8 . Showed his intelligence once again to pick out a wonder cross which fell perfectly for Hazard to open the scoring. Eden Hazard - 9 . He might not be the tallest in the Chelsea team but the talented forward showed his aerial skills by planting the perfect header past Allan McGregor for the opening goal and produced a piece of magic to set up the second goal for Costa. Star performer for the home side. Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor can only look on as Eden Hazard (left) nets the opener for Chelsea . Diego Costa - 8 . The Spanish forward ended his short goal drought after going four games without a goal with the crucial second. It was a shame that his performance was marred by a needless dive under a challenge from Tom Huddlestone which earned him a yellow card. Subs: Schwarzer, Zouma, Ramires (for Mikel 82), Drogba (for Oscar 78), Schurrle (for Willian 80), Remy, Azpilicueta . Scorers: Hazard 7, Costa 68 . Booked: Cahill, Willian, Costa . HULL CITY . Allan McGregor - 7 . Could do nothing to prevent goals from Hazard and Costa and always knew he was going to face a difficult afternoon against the league leaders. James Chester - 6 . Lucky not to give away a penalty in the second half when his arm appeared to strike a cross from Willian but referee Chris Hoy failed to award a spot kick. Always had a major task on his hand trying to keep the Chelsea forwards at bay. Hull City's James Chester (left) puts in a strong challenge on Chelsea forward Oscar . Michael Dawson - 6 . Nightmare return for Dawson to London who only lasted nine minutes after picking up an early injury and was replaced by Alex Bruce after just ten minutes. Curtis Davies - 6 . The afternoon was always going to be more difficult when he lost his defensive partner Dawson so early in the game and failed to recover. Could do nothing to stop the Chelsea goals and did his best to keep the scoreline to just two goals. Ahmed Elmohamady - 5 . Disappointing display from Elmohamady who failed to cause any kinds of problems for the Chelsea defence and was always restricted with his attacking play as he tried to keep the likes of Willian and Hazard at bay. Ahmed Elmohamady (right) put in a disappointing display for Hull at Stamford Bridge . Jake Livermore - 6 . Blew a golden chance to get his side back into the game at the start of the second half when he drilled a low shot which flew inches past the post. Tom Huddlestone - 4 . Did his team no favours when he was shown a red card in the second half for a high tackle on Filipe Luis. After being booked earlier in the game you wonder why he produced a studs up challenge on the Chelsea full-back. David Meyler - 5 . Received a needless booking in the first half when he stuck out his arm to try and turn the ball home from a Hull corner even though the cross was past him. Had to be on his guard for the rest of the game which probably affected his performance. Tom  Huddlestone (right) leaves the field after his sending off for a reckless challenge on Felipe Luis . Andrew Robertson - 6 . Frustrating afternoon for the Hull defender who did his best to keep Oscar at bay but found things even harder when his team were reduced to ten-men. Nikica Jelavic - 5 . Steve Bruce would have been hoping to see Jelavic have more impact on the game but he failed to cause any problems at all for Terry and Cahill and was taken off in the second half. Needs to show a lot more in the coming weeks. Sone Aluko - 5 . Just like Jelavic, Aluko did nothing to trouble the Chelsea defence and was also substituted. Must fear for his place in the starting line-up. Nikica Jelavic (right) had a quiet afternoon and failed to cause Cahill (left) and John Terry any problems .

"An Arizona couple falsely accused of taking pornographic pictures of their three young daughters are suing Walmart in a bid to win damages after an horrific ordeal which they claim robbed them of precious time with their kids and cost them $75,000 in legal fees. In 2008, Lisa and Anthony 'A.J.' Demaree took their three young daughters – then aged five, four and 18 months - on a trip to San Diego. On returning home they took 144 photographs, mostly from their recent trip, to their local Walmart in Peoria, Arizona to have them developed. Lisa and Anthony Demaree were falsely accused of taking pornographic pictures of their three young daughters . The couple were reported to child protective services after a Walmart employee was concerned that some of the images being developed might be child pornography . What happened next was the start of a nightmare for the Demarees. A Walmart employee, unhappy over the content of several bath time pictures, contacted bosses with concerns that they may have been images of child pornography. Instead of receiving a batch of happy memories of a fun family outing, the couple were reported to the police and their children were placed into the care of the Arizona Child Protective Services Agency. ‘It was a nightmare, it was unbelievable. I was in so much disbelief. I started to hyperventilate,’ Lisa Demaree told ABC News at the time. The Demarees released some of the photos which a Walmart employee though might have been child pornography . It was a month before the girls were returned to their parents, after a Maricopa County Superior Court judge ruled the photographs were in fact harmless and a medical exam revealed no signs of sexual abuse. The family was reunited but the damage had been done. The couple’s named went on a central registry of sex offenders, while Lisa was suspended from her job at a local school for a year while the investigation was under way. The couple also had to spent $75,000 on legal bills. ‘We’ve missed a year of our children’s lives as far as memories go,’ Demaree told ABC News. ‘As crazy as it may seem, what you may think are the most beautiful innocent pictures of your children may be seen as something completely different and completely perverted.’ The family is suing both Walmart and the city of Peoria, Arizona where they live . In 2009, the couple sued the city of Peoria and the State Attorney General’s office for defamation. They also sued Walmart for failing to tell them that they had an ‘unsuitable print policy’ and could turn over photos to law enforcement without the customer’s knowledge. The couple lost the initial hearing after a federal judge sided with Walmart, ruling that employees in Arizona cannot be held liable for reporting suspected child pornography. However the Demarees appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and on March 6 the court held a hearing before three judges. 'The most beautiful innocent pictures of your children may be seen as something completely different and completely perverted,' said Lisa Demaree . The family’s lawyer has argued that Walmart committed fraud by not disclosing to customers that employees would look at their photographs and was also negligent because ‘untrained clerks’ were given the authority to make assumptions about the content of the pictures and report them to police. Lawyers for Walmart argued that under Arizona statute employees who report child abuse without malice are immune from prosecution and there was no indication of malice in this case. The Demarees are currently awaiting a verdict from the appeals court on the case against the city and Walmart.

"Frank Lampard led Manchester City's charge against his former club Chelsea at the top of the table after netting the winning goal in the reigning champion's 1-0 defeat of Leicester. Despite a show of support from the stands, Nigel Pearson's dismal run continued - the Foxes have not won a Premier League game since upsetting Manchester United in September and remain bottom of the table. Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein was at the King Power Stadium to run the rule over both sets of teams... Frank Lampard is congratulated by his team-mates after opening the scoring for Manchester City . A section of Leicester fans show their support for their under-fire manager Nigel Pearson . Yaya Toure (centre) was the reigning champion's outstanding player at the King Power Stadium . LEICESTER (4-1-4-1) Ben Hamer 6.5 – Given the task of filling the gloves of injured Kasper Schmeichel and responded well, good on crosses and showed good judgement to keep out an attempted lob by Silva. Danny Simpson 5.5 – Stuck to his guns but found it difficult to keep up with the pace at which the likes of Silva and Nasri would move the ball. Lucky not to be booked early with a late challenge . Marcin Wasilewski 5.5 – Had built himself up to face the powerhouse Dzeko, instead came up against the quicksilver Pozo after the Bosnian was injured in the warm-up. Handled him well. Stand-in keeper Ben Hamer (centre) watches as the ball passes him for City's opening goal . Wes Morgan 6 – Had a great battle with Yaya Toure and gave as good as he got. Distribution wasn't the best but he did what he needed to, defend, apart from that one moment when Lampard got clear . Esteban Cambiasso 6.5 – Not surprisingly wasn't overawed by the occasion, having played big World Cup games for Argentina. Protected the Leicester back-four and came so close to scoring with a free-kick . Riyad Mahrez 6 – The Algerian has pace to burn which is why Nigel Pearson wanted him to hug the touchline and run. Run he did and impressively so but nothing came from it. Argentine veteran Esteban Cambiasso (right) fights an aerial duel with Yaya Toure . Andy King 5.5 – Found it hard to get to grips of central midfield with Manchester City's powerhouses Yaya Toure and Fernando. Leicester need to get him creating for the rest of the season . Danny Drinkwater 5.5 – Like King, found it hard to get a foothold in midfield and wasn't at his best from the rare set piece opportunities that went the way of the home side . Jeffrey Schlupp 6.5 – You could see why manager Nigel Pearson wanted him to exploit his pace. Showed the defenders a clean pair of heels on more than one occasion but didn't utilise it . Liecester forward Riyad Mahrez shields the ball from Lampard as the hosts battle to end their slump . Jamie Vardy 6 – Scored a great goal in the famous 5-3 win against Manchester United and should have scored after sprinting past Mangala. But he didn't convert and was later taken off. Substitutions: . Ulloa (for Schlupp 64) 5.5 – Didn't see enough of the ball to make an impact . Powell (for Vardy 73) 5.5 – Not made a great impact in his loan spell from Manchester United . Knockaert (for Drinkwater 79) Unused subs: Smith (Gk), Hammond, James, Moore . Manager: Nigel Pearson – 6.5 . Foxes striker Jamie Vardy (centre) looks to get a shot away under pressure from Eliaquim Mangala . MANCHESTER CITY . Joe Hart 6 – Seems to have grown in confidence this season with a new long-term deal on the table. His presence alone calmed a shaky defence though he was nearly caught out by Cambiasso's curler . Bacary Sagna 6 – Replaced Pablo Zabaleta and had some uncomortable moments as Schlupp hit his strides. But Pellegrini will be happy how the former Arsenal right-back stuck to his task . Vincent Kompany 6.5 – Looked bulky and not a surprise maybe when he pulled up with a hamstring on his return from a calf injury. But while on the pitch, you can't underestimate his influence on the team, When Leicester got in behind the defence early on, he was the one to cover and make the key interceptions to keep the game at 0-0, . England No 1 Joe Hart (left) dives to keep out a free-kick from Esteban Cambiasso . Eliaquim Mangala 6 – His strength is his strength, the way he out-muscled Vardy in front of goal hinted at a £32m defender. Unforunately, there are other flaws and he was turned more than once. While his communication with keeper Hart needs improvement. Gael Clichy 6 – The injury to Kolarov has given Clichy a sustained run in the team and it has helped his consistency. As probably Manchester City's quickest defender, this was his kind of game . Yaya Toure 7 – Missed the Roma game through suspension and the freshness helped him become one of the key players. Tested Hamer early on with a stinging shot and a menace all over the pitch. An attacking threat without deserting his defensive station - although unfortunate that his worst touch, a wayward shot, struck a supporter. Spanish playmaker is unfortunate with a lob after retuirning to the starting line-up after a spell out injured . Fernando 6.5 – This was the type of game Pellegrini signed him for, a tricky away match at a highly-motivated team at the bottom. Fernando got stuck in as you'd expect but he'll have to watch the number of free-kicks he gives away in important areas. Samir Nasri 6.5 – In a rich vein of form at the moment and timing his passes to perfection. His slide-rule cross for Lampard was an invitation for the former England midfielder to tap in. Frank Lampard 6.5 - Entrusted with the pivotal No 10 role at the age of 36. Had spells where he did little, but nobody else could have found space in the six-yard box like him to score the opener . Samir Nasri (left) continued his impressive recent run of form with an influential midfield performance . David Silva 6 – The little Spanish wizard was welcomed back for the first time since a knee injuring and found his rhythm of passing almost immediately. Narrowly misjudged an attempted lob over Hamer . Jose Angel Pozo 5.5 – Called up just before kick off when Edin Dzeko was injured in the warm up. At 18 he's a talent but the truth is this level is just too intense and competitive for him right now . Substitutes: . Milner (for Lampard 59) 6.5 – Becoming one of Pellegrini's heroes this season. Slotted in on the left-hand side of midfield for this game and got in some dangerous crosses . Lampard wheels away to celebrate his first-half goal after being set up by Nasri . Navas (for Pozo 74) 5.5 – Manchester City were more interested in defending for the final 11 minutes . Demichelis (for Kompany 77) Manager: Manuel Pellegrini 7 . Referee:  Jonathan Moss 6.5 .

"The FBI has warned U.S. businesses to be on the alert for a sophisticated Iranian hacking operation whose targets include defense contractors, energy firms and educational institutions, a confidential agency document reveals. The operation is the same as one flagged last week by cyber security firm Cylance Inc as targeting critical infrastructure organizations worldwide, cyber security experts said. Cylance has said it uncovered more than 50 victims from what it dubbed Operation Cleaver, in 16 countries, including the United States. Warning: The FBI has compiled a confidential report on the IP addresses in Iran that could attack the U.S. The FBI's confidential 'Flash' report, seen by Reuters on Friday, provides technical details about malicious software and techniques used in the attacks, along with advice on thwarting the hackers. It asked businesses to contact the FBI if they believed they were victims. Cylance Chief Executive Stuart McClure said the FBI warning suggested that the Iranian hacking campaign may have been larger than its own research revealed. 'It underscores Iran's determination and fixation on large-scale compromise of critical infrastructure,' he said. The FBI's technical document said the hackers typically launch their attacks from two IP addresses that are in Iran, but did not attribute the attacks to the Tehran government. Cylance has said it believes Iran's government is behind the campaign, a claim Iran has vehemently denied. An FBI official did not provide further details, but said the agency routinely provides private industry with advisories to help it fend off cyber threats. The Pentagon and National Security Agency had no immediate comment. Tehran has been substantially increasing investment in its cyber capabilities since 2010, when its nuclear program was hit by the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been launched by the United States and Israel. Building evidence: It comes after a report found the same Iranian addresses have attacked 50 countries . Cyber security professionals who investigate cyber attacks said that they are seeing evidence that Iran's investment is paying off. 'They are good and have a lot of talent in the country,' said Dave Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSEC LLC. 'They are definitely a serious threat, no question.' Iranian hackers are increasingly being blamed for sophisticated cyberattacks. Bloomberg Businessweek on Thursday reported that Iranian hacker activists were responsible for a devastating February 2014 attack on casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp, which crippled thousands of servers by wiping them with destructive malware. It said the hackers sought to punish Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson for comments he made about detonating a nuclear bomb in Iran.","Confidential safety document warns businesses to watch out for hack .

"Fitness coach Raymond Verheijen has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal's training methods after Aaron Ramsey was the latest player to be plagued by the club's injury curse. The 23-year-old was taken off at half-time in the Champions League against Galatasaray on Tuesday - his third game in a week - after tweaking a hamstring, which rule him out for at least three to four weeks. The Wales international's absence comes as a further blow to manager Arsene Wenger, who will also be without Jack Wilshere in central midfield for several months. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: Aaron Ramsey injury is a blow . Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey tweaked his hamstring in their 4-1 win at Galatasaray on Tuesday . Ramsey is the latest midfield injury for Arsenal, who will be without Jack Wilshere for several months . Fitness coach Raymond Verheijen tweeted several times on Friday to condemn Arsenal's training methods . And Verheijen, who in the past has condemned the Gunners for 'incompetent periodisation and injury prevention', is adamant their crippling injury list is due to their own training pitfalls. 'Sad to read the news about yet another muscle injury for Aaron Ramsey. His injury record at Arsenal is simply shocking for such young player,' he tweeted on Friday. The Dutchman was quick to stick the boot in on the club's treatment of fellow compatriot Robin van Persie during his time at the Emirates, before his move to Manchester United too. Van Persie swapped north London for Manchester two seasons ago and Verheijen believes that the 31-year-old has been 'damaged' by Arsenal in what was an injury-plagued eight years at the club. 'RVP is only 31 yrs but more & more starts to look like an old man on pitch because of all damage done to his body during his Arsenal period,' he later tweeted. Verheijen believes Manchester United striker Robin van Persie (below) was 'damaged' at Arsenal . 'The same career threatening process takes place at Arsenal with Ramsey, [Theo] Walcott, Wilkshire [sic] & [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain who are structurally injured. 'Players who are injured season after season develop all kind of weak links inside the body so a vicious injury cycle develops during career. 'Thankfully, [Cesc] Fabregas was able to escape Arsenal after a few years so the amateurs in London did not get the chance to also destroy his body.' Arsenal host Newcastle in the Premier League evening kick-off on Saturday. Verheijen thinks that Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas would be injury-plagued if he was still at Arsenal .","Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey could be out for up to a month due to injury .

'He [Wenger] never had confidence in me,' Gervinho told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'As a child I dreamed of playing for Arsenal, because I loved them. 'Now I hate them for the way Wenger treated me.

"Prince Harry has split from his girlfriend Cressida Bonas only a month after she attended an official engagement with him for the first time. The couple had embraced in front of cameras, prompting speculation they might be about to get engaged. But their two-year relationship is said to have become strained in recent weeks, with a report in US magazine People suggesting Miss Bonas had become too ‘needy’ for the royal. That was strongly denied by sources close to the couple who confirmed their separation to the Daily Mail last night. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry and his ex girlfriend Cressida Bonas. He was spotted soaking up the Miami nightlife on Wednesday night - just hours after their split was confirmed . Amicable: It is claimed Cressida (pictured right) was not ready to be a royal bride. Prince Harry (left) turns 30 this year and is at a different stage in life to his 25-year-old former girlfriend . The couple were introduced by Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie, who is also a close friend of aspiring actress Miss Bonas . There has been no official confirmation on the split from the palace or from Miss Bonas . A friend insisted that the split was ‘very much an amicable one’ and that they had parted as friends. ‘Unfortunately . it is true, they have split up. But this suggestion that the prince . supposedly “dumped” Cressida because she was “too needy” is so wide of . the mark,’ they said. ‘It is . a very amicable split and they are still very much the best of friends. They have just decided to go their separate ways.’ The . source said that Miss Bonas, 25, was keen to ‘focus on her career’. She . recently graduated from the Laban school of dance and is currently . working for a marketing company in Soho while deciding what to do next. ‘Cressida . has decided she wants to focus on her career and Harry is really keen . that she is allowed to get on with her life,’ the friend said. ‘He . is furious at this suggestion that the split was in any way because she . was relying too much on him. Cressida is one of the most independent . people he knows.’ Harry and . Prince William are believed to be heading to Tennessee this weekend to . attend the wedding of their close friend Guy Pelly. Pelly, who organised . William’s stag do, is marrying American-born Lizzy Wilson and has . reportedly asked the princes to act as ushers.

Prince Harry talks to veteran Jonathon Le Galloudec on a rowing machine during a visit to the Help For Heroes gym . Another . source close to Cressida said last night: ‘Cressie is only 25 and . pretty young for her age at that. Prince Harry will be 30 this year and . is at a different stage in his life. He is incredibly fond of Cressie . and understands that she wants to do something with her life and with . her career before she considers settling down. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if they got back together in a few months time.’ Still, . the split has come as a surprise, not least because Miss Bonas was seen . going into Kensington Palace hand in hand with the prince only last . week. Harry and Miss Bonas, . who met in summer 2012 after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, have . been more willing to appear in public together in recent months after a . coy start to their relationship. In March they were spotted at Twickenham watching England defeat Wales at rugby. Two . days earlier they had attended their first official engagement . together, a charity event at Wembley Arena at which Harry was the star . speaker.

The couple were introduced by Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie, who is also a close friend of aspiring actress Miss Bonas . Royal sources quashed speculation of an imminent engagement after the couple were seen embracing at the event. But friends of Miss Bonas suggested that her wealthy family had held a summit to discuss the possibility of a royal wedding. One . report last night claimed the couple had simply ‘paused for a . breather’, raising the possibility that they could get back together. This would mirror the relationship of William and Kate, who split . briefly in 2007. It had been . thought that Harry was preparing to settle down following his turbulent . seven-year relationship with Zimbabwe-born Chelsy Davy that ended in . 2011. On Tuesday Harry was . reportedly seen on a night out with his friends James Haskell, the . England rugby star, stockbroker Adam Bidwell, and Viscount Erleigh at a . Mayfair club.

"Girls born to members of the Royal Family are to be given equal rights with boys in the succession to the throne as centuries-old rules were overturned today. As the historic changes to the monarchy were agreed, the Queen, at the Commonwealth summit in Perth, Australia, hailed the power of women to change the world. The reforms mean the if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child is a girl, she will take precedence over any younger brothers in the order of succession. Reform: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first born child will inherit the thrown after David Cameron struck a deal with Commonwealth leaders to end the rule that the first-born male takes the thrown . Good evening your majesty: The Queen receives David Cameron at a banquet as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) Royal arrival: The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh rrive for the CHOGM banquet, which was held at the Pan Pacific Perth Hotel . The 16 Commonwealth 'realms', including the UK, . Canada and Australia, also agreed to scrap outdated laws which ban anyone in the line of succession from marrying a Roman Catholic. The changes were announced by Prime Minister David . Cameron at the Commonwealth Heads of Government . Meeting in Perth. As politicians unanimously agreed the dramatic reform to royal succession laws dating back more than 300 years, the Queen said the untapped potential of women and girls should be set free. Speaking at the opening of the summit of the 53 Commonwealth countries, she said: 'The theme this year is Women As Agents of Change. 'It reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women to play their full part. 'We must continue to strive in our . own countries and across the Commonwealth together to promote . that theme in a lasting way beyond this year.' Her comments will be taken as a sign that the Queen approves of the reform. The Prime Minister struck the deal to scrap male primogeniture by thrashing out an . agreement with Commonwealth leaders. Mr Cameron said the historic rules were 'at odds with the modern countries that we have become'. Announcing the proposed changes, he . said: 'Put simply, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a . little girl, that girl would one day be our queen.' Yet it is still likely to be many years before another female monarch takes to the throne. The Royal Family already has two generations of kings-in-waiting and the Queen is celebrating her Diamond Jubilee next year and in good health. Her own mother, the Queen Mother, lived to 101. Heir apparent the Prince of Wales is next in line and then there is William, who has still to fulfil his regal duties before any child of his takes over. Even then, William and Kate might have a son, meaning the nation would wait even longer to see the first royal daughter to benefit from the rule change. Girl power: The Queen today hailed the the power of women to change the world as a deal was struck to let first-born daughters take the throne . Most European monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands  and Luxembourg. Now only Spain, Liechtenstein and Monaco are left with the old system. The ancient rules of royal succession have handed men the balance of power for hundreds of years. If the new rules had been in force in . 1509 Margaret Tudor would have taken the throne instead of Henry VIII. That could have meant the Reformation would never have taken place and . Elizabeth I would never have been Queen. If the practice had been changed as . recently as the last century, Britain could have had two Queen Victorias . back to back. Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal would have acceded . to the throne in 1901 instead of King Edward VII. When she died just a few months later, . her son Kaiser Wilhelm II would have ascended the throne – something . which could have prevented the First World War. The Queen of England now would have been the completely unknown Princess Marie Cecile of Prussia. The Queen and Julia Gillard, the Australian prime minister arrive for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth this morning where she spoke about equality . Mr Cameron stepped in amid fears that . there could be a constitutional crisis if William and Kate had a . first-born daughter and then a son. The deal was agreed today in Perth during a meeting of . the Queen’s Realms – the 16 countries including the UK which share the . Queen as their head of state. Mr Cameron, who hosted the meeting, . had earlier said: ‘These rules are outdated and need to change. The idea . that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, . simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable any more. 'Nor does it make any sense that a . potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic. The thinking behind these rules is wrong. That’s why people have been . talking about changing them for some time. We need to get on and do it.’ Keynote address: The Queen makes the opening speech for the Commonwealth summit as leaders of member countries look on . Heads of government stand during the opening ceremony of the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting . The removal of the barrier to the heir to the throne marrying a Catholic does not affect the position . of the Anglican Church as the established Church. The Queen and future . monarchs will be Anglicans and Supreme Governor of the Church of . England. The change will also do away with an . ancient and unused rule that means all descendants of George II are . supposed to require the consent of the monarch to marry. The deal will take the form of a short . communiqué signed by the Realms committing to ‘amending the rules on . succession to their respective Crowns’ and making clear that they ‘wish . unanimously to advise the Queen of their views to seek her agreement’. In order to change the rules the . Government will introduce legislation to change the 1701 Act of . Settlement, the Bill of Rights 1688, the Coronation Oath Act 1688 and . the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Downing Street has said changes would be drafted in such a way that any children of Prince William and his wife were included, but for current members of the Royal Family, there is not expected to be any difference. Any new law is not expected to be retrospective - the Princess Royal would still be placed below her two younger brothers, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex. For some, the changes do not go far enough. Republic, which campaigns for a directly-elected ceremonial head of state, said they still failed the 'equality test'. Graham Smith, campaign manager for Republic, said: 'In practice, it simply means that the eldest child of one family is preferred over all others. 'Inequality is therefore further entrenched in the system.' Franz, Duke of Bavaria, could have ended up on the British throne had laws been different . Had an 18th Century law not been passed by Parliament, Britain's monarchy throughout the past 300 years would have had a very different cast of characters. For starters, rather than becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the world, our present Queen would have spent her life as a minor princess in some German backwater. And instead of pledging allegiance to Elizabeth II, loyal British subjects would now be singing God Save Our Gracious King to... Francis II of Bavaria. The 1701 Act Of Settlement passed the crown to Electress Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant descendants - and banned all Roman Catholics from ever ascending the throne. That law - and the centuries-old practice of male primogeniture, in which a male child automatically leapfrogs over his older sisters - has largely dictated who became King or Queen of Britain for centuries. But according to historian Ian Lloyd writing in the Sunday Times, had these ancient laws not been adopted, Francis II would now be ruling Brittania. Franz, Duke of Bavaria, is a distant cousin of the Queen and head of the House of Wittelsbach, Bavaria's ruling family. He is the senior co-heir-general of King Charles I and therefore regarded as the rightful heir to the House of Stuart, which ruled England from 1567 to 1707. From birth Franz was recognised by the Jacobites as a Prince of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Prince of Cornwall and Rothesay. The Duke's great-grandfather was the last king of Bavaria before being deposed at the end of World War One in 1918. During World War Two, the Dukes' family condemned the Nazi regime and fled to Hungary.  When Hitler's stormtroopers marched into Budapest in 1944, the Royal Family was arrested and detained in a number of concentration camps. Following liberation in 1945, Franz, studied business management at the University of Munich. Now 78, he still lives in an apartment in the city and is a keen collector of modern art.","300-year rule scrapped as first-born, whatever gender, will take the throne .

"West Ham have been a revelation this season but there is one player who has been at the heart of it all. Alex Song is now the club’s main man and he has the rest of the team dancing to his tune. Signing Song on loan was one of the most astute transfers of the summer. Plenty of Arsenal fans will be looking at him and asking: ‘Why isn’t he doing that job in our midfield?’ They have a point. Sam Allardyce saw a good opportunity and grabbed it. West Ham midfielder Alex Song is now stronger and more disciplined . After my final season at Arsenal I was invited back by the club to act as a mentor and was there when Song arrived. He was only 17 but he went straight into training with the first-team group. Along with Abou Diaby, he was earmarked as a potential successor to Patrick Vieira. Song’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work and Arsene Wenger is one of the best at developing young players. The focus with Song was always passing. Wenger likes midfielders to open up their body and receive the ball on the half-turn, giving them the chance to glance over their shoulder before receiving the ball to feet. Song’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work at Arsenal . Along with Abou Diaby, Song was earmarked as a potential successor to Patrick Vieira (right) I watched Song work to improve for hours with Boro Primorac, Wenger’s right-hand man and a real technician. He’d do extra drills between two backboards, passing the ball to himself and learning to open up his body. If you can keep a good body shape in midfield you can open up the whole game. Now West Ham are reaping the benefits. He can receive the ball with one foot and pass with the other, which helps him see the bigger picture very early. He rarely takes more than two touches and that gets West Ham moving quickly. He is an excellent passer, too, a real side-foot specialist, so it’s no surprise West Ham average around 50 passes more per game this season compared to last. He is stronger and more disciplined and it’s interesting to see the West Ham staff on the touchline asking him to sit deeper. At Arsenal he was like a wind-up toy. He charged around and quickly ran out of energy. Now he is more effective at managing that energy and realises the importance of staying back. Song was easily distracted when he first arrived at Arsenal in 2005 . When he first arrived in England I wondered if he was more interested in the trappings of Premier League football. He was easily distracted by the things that were on offer — as soon as he realised he could get free boots he would have them delivered from all over and his locker was stuffed with freebies. It was partly immaturity but also suggested he wasn’t always focused. When Barcelona came calling he was quick to give in to temptation. The allure of Barca was like Aladdin’s cave — prestige, titles, financial rewards. That’s hard to turn down, but with the players Barca have it was always going to be difficult. Cesc Fabregas tried and failed so the warning signs were there — the grass is not always greener. When Fabregas and Robin van Persie left, Wenger let them go to further their careers. With Song, it was more of a disappointment. Arsenal invested a lot of time in him and hoped he would want to stay and repay them. Song was unable to resist joining Spanish giants Barcelona in 2012 . But he is loving life at West Ham. My sources tell me he’s been a breath of fresh air at the training ground. He arrives flamboyantly dressed and trains with a big grin on his face. The fans love what he brings to the team and he is more appreciated at Upton Park than he was at the Emirates or the Nou Camp. He has matured, too. Where he used to try to catch the eye with his dyed hair, now he’s doing so with performances on the pitch. If West Ham can afford him, Song faces a dilemma. Will another glittery move prise him away or will he stay put? He’s loved at Upton Park and could do far worse than to stay on song at West Ham. Song returned to London on loan and he has been a breath of fresh of air at West Ham . PS . What a great story for AFC Wimbledon to be drawn against Liverpool in the FA Cup. I played against the Crazy Gang many times, though often it was like playing a bunch of louts! They would turn up at your ground with the ghetto blaster music blaring. They tried to make as much noise as they could to disrupt opponents. It was like their battle cry to get into match mode but it never affected me. In away games in their tunnel, you would line up and look across to see Vinnie Jones head-butting the toilet door and John Fashanu going through his martial arts routine.

"A manhunt has been launched to find two young men who were filmed slapping and taunting an elderly man on a subway train in Chicago. The men, both African American in their late teens or early 20s, towered over their victim as they laughed and jumped around him, hitting his head, on a CTA Blue Line train. At one point the slaps become so hard they are audible on the clip, which was filmed by their friend and posted on Facebook. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Police are now appealing for anyone that recognizes the men in the video to come forward. Defending the attack, one of the group - which remains at large - called radio station WBBM to say the white victim had but touting racial slurs. 'We didn't do nothing. We got on the train and he was saying some racial slurs,' he says. Flinching: The attacker menacingly holds his hand over the man who is quivering with fear before he is hit . Tries to defend himself: The man gingerly stands up to defend himself but the attacker pushes him back . The young man calls himself 'A-T-L.' He says he didn't take part in slapping the man. 'I don't know why they did what they did,' he tells WBBM. 'I just recorded it because it was funny.' A spokesman for the CTA said: 'Though this crime apparently was not reported, because neither CTA nor Chicago Police have a report of the incident, we are pulling additional video to share with police as part of a now-open investigation.

"Tens of thousands of protesters converged on the nation's major cities Saturday to protest police violence against black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Huge crowds - at least 25,000 in New York City - took to the streets chanting slogans and waving signs. Comparable numbers were observed in Washington, D.C., while other major demonstrations hit Chicago, Boston and cities in California. The incensed crowd were joined by the relatives of black people shot dead, mainly by white police officers. In Washington, Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden and Eric Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, attended. Proceedings were mainly peaceful, but two NYPD officers were injured in a confrontation on the Brooklyn Bridge after thousands of protesters stopped traffic. Scroll down for video . Shutdown: The Brooklyn Bridge was closed amid protests today which saw 25,000 take to the streets of New York City . Crowds: The huge number of people flooded the Brooklyn Bridge after passing by City Hall . Police: Officers took to the streets in Oakland to control the protest march . 'Victims': Protesters carried replica coffins to represent those killed by police violence . New York: Protesters decrying the police marched through New York, with the NYPD reportedly confirming crowd sizes of at least 25,000 . Capital: In Washington, D.C., organizers estimated that 25,000 also took to the streets - though local police do not give estimates . Chicago: In Illinois' biggest city there were also sizable demonstrations . Also among the crowd were Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by George Zimmerman in Florida, and Samaria Rice, who 12-year-old son was gunned down by police in Cleveland, Ohio, last month. Waving signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Who do you protect? Who do you serve', the crowd gathered in Washington D.C.'s Freedom Plaza, before marching down iconic Pennsylvania Avenue. They chanted the same words, 'Black lives matter', as they made their way to the U.S. Capitol to call for an end to apparent racial profiling by police. Loud music blasted from a stage set up for the rally. Killed: The protesters held up photographs of people killed by police - which they termed murder - as they marched through Chicago . Rallying cry: Many activists have taken up the dying words of Eric Garner - killed with an alleged chokehold - as a protest slogan, seen above on t-shirts of Chicago protesters . Relatives together: Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden (second left) and Eric Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, were joined by Sybrina Fulton (second right), the mother of Trayvon Martin, and Samaria Rice (far right), the mother of Tamir Rice, at the march, which was organized by Rev Al Sharpton (third right) On the road: Protesters streamed down the Brooklyn bridge Saturday night as the protests continued . Trashed: Protests were mainly peaceful, but an NYPD patrol car was photographed covered in trash and beaten up . Smashed: The vehicle had a broken back window and bags of trash heaped on top of it . West coast: Protesters also gathered in Oakland, California outside a county court house to demonstrate . Shouting out: The activists shouted slogans and waved placards in sympathy with crowds on the other side of the country . The 'Justice for All' march, organized by civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, brought together thousands of supporters of two black men: Michael Brown, 18, and 43-year-old Eric Garner. Estimates of crowd sizes were not all clear, but CBS reported that New York City numbers exceeded 25,000 - but led to no arrests. Police in Washington do not give public estimates of crowd sizes, but organizers said that 25,000 marched there as well. In Boston, Chicago, Colorado and Oakland, California, large crowds could also be seen - making the total likely to be well in excess of 50,000. By afternoon the NYPD had reported no arrests in relation to the protest, but photographs did emerge of a smashed-up patrol car. Some Boston protesters were arrested, but those demonstrations were also largely peaceful. Joining in: A man in New York dressed as Santa - part of the city's annual 'Santa Con' - took up a placard and joined the march . 'Die-in': Activists in Colorado Springs, Colorado, lay down to protest the killings . Thick with people: hundreds in Boston joined the protests despite cold weather, also laying down to mimic dying . Demonstrating: Thousands of people were marching through the nation's capital to protest decisions made by Missouri and New York grand juries not to indict the white officers who killed Garner and Brown . 'This stops today': Waving signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Who do you protect? Who do you serve', the crowd gathered in Washington D.C.'s Freedom Plaza, before marching down iconic Pennsylvania Avenue . High turnout: This photo shows demonstrators marching down Pennsylvania Avenue to the US Capitol . Brown was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson while unarmed in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, while Garner died when officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in an apparent chokehold in Staten Island. In both cases, grand juries declined to indict the white officers involved. During the march, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, were joined by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice. Martin, a 17-year-old African American, was shot dead by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Florida in 2012, while Rice was gunned down by Cleveland police last month. Mrs Garner, whose husband died in July, told protesters: 'Let's keep it strong, long and meaningful.' At one point, the rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from Ferguson and demanded to speak. Taking to the streets: Mrs Garner told protesters, young and old: 'Let's keep it strong, long and meaningful' Raising their arms up: At one point, the rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from Ferguson and demanded to speak . Protesters hold signs referring to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised in the air when he was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 - something that has been disputed . Large numbers of protesters on the ground supported the group, some chanting, 'Let them speak.' Ultimately, organizers allowed Johnetta Elzie of St. Louis to address the crowd. 'This movement was started by the young people,' she said. The group, mostly in their 20s, then left the stage. Organizers called the interruption unnecessarily divisive. But some in the Missouri group said they were disappointed and found the rally staid and ineffective. 'I thought there was going to be actions, not a show. This is a show,' Elzie said. Sharpton addressed the interruption and told the crowd, 'Don't let no provocateurs get you out of line. ... We are not here to play big shot. We are here to win.' Getting ready: Lou Phillips holds up his signs before the 'Justice for All' march on Pennsylvania Avenue . Making a statement: Over the past few months, politicians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system . Tragic: Brown (left) was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson while unarmed in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, while Garner (right) died when officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in an apparent chokehold . Then, block after block of tightly packed people moved through the city. Protests - some violent - have occurred around the nation since grand juries last month declined to indict the officers involved  in the deaths of Brown and Garner. The latter gasped 'I can't breathe' while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes  in Staten Island. Some protesters held signs and wore shirts reading: 'I can't breathe.' Over the past few months, politicians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system. Terry Baisden, 52, of Baltimore said she is 'hopeful change is coming' and that the movement is not part of a fleeting flash of anger. She said she hasn't protested before but felt compelled to because 'changes in action, changes in belief, happen in numbers.' Meanwhile, Murry Edwards said he made the trip to Washington from St. Louis because he wants to make sure the momentum from the movement in Ferguson reaches a national stage. 'This is the national march,' Edwards said. 'We have to get behind the national movement.' Sheryce Holloway, a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, attended a smaller gathering outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington ahead of the main rally. She said she also has been participating in protests at her alma mater. Elsewhere: A man shouts slogans against police as he takes part in a march on police brutality  in New York . Angry: Men scream as they hold up placards reading: 'Stop police brutality and murder' in New York . A man wears a rope around his neck as he joins protests over the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner . Holloway said the goal of the protests is 'ending blue-on-black crime. Black lives do matter.' Saturday's march is sponsored in part by the National Action Network, the Urban League and the NAACP. At the Capitol, speakers will outline a legislative agenda they want Congress to pursue in relation to police killings. While protesters rally in Washington, other groups including Ferguson Action will be conducting similar 'Day of Resistance' movements all around the country. A large march is planned in New York City.","At least 25,000 took to the streets in New York City, police confirmed, with similar estimates in the capital .

"New emails released in the Sony hack seem to illustrate the very big role the husband of studio head Amy Pascal played in her decision making on the job. There was much speculation as to why Sony fired their head of communications, Charles Sipkins, this November,  just 15 months after he started on the job, and now an email exchange between Pascal and Bernie Weinraub, her husband, sheds some possible light on the situation. It seems that after Pascal was not invited to attend an executive roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter, Weinraub told her to get rid of Sipkins. Scroll down for video . Man with a plan: Bernie Weinraub suggested his wife Amy Pascal (above) 'fire' the studio's head of communications after she was not invited to an industry event . He's out: Six days after the email, Charles Sipkins (above) was out of a job at Sony . In the email exchange, obtained by Bloomberg News, Weinraub writes to his wife after learning of this slight, 'I would fire your P.R. guy immediately.' He then adds, 'Or at least tell him you’re not going to deal with him anymore.' Pascal was the only head of a major studio not on hand for the event. Shockingly, Pascal then forwarded the email to George Rose, the head of human resources at Sony, who responds by saying; 'He's right.' Six days later, Sipkins was out of a job. Making matters worse, the executive roundtable, which is held every year, is usually meant to be a discussion of the films from each studio that could possibly be contenders during awards season, and Sony has numerous films expected to garner nominations in major categories at this year's Academy Awards. The studio just received eight  Golden Globes nominations between Sony and Sony Pictures Classics, and will likely have one major Oscar contender across the board in the Steve Carrel drama Foxcatcher. Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Paramount's Brad Grey, Disney Studios' Alan Horn, Universal's Donna Langley, IFC Films' Jonathan Sehring and Warner Brothers' Kevin Tsujihara were invited to the event. Cool kids: Universal's Donna Langley, Disney Studios' Alan Horn, Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Warner Bros.' Kevin Tsujihara, IFC Films' Jonathan Sehring and Paramount's Brad Grey attended the executive roundtable . Pascal commented on this recent leak by saying the roundtable incident had nothing to do with the decision to terminate Sipkins. Others who have been slighted by Pascal in leaked emails this week include President Obama, who was the subject of a racist exchange between her and producer Scott Rudin, and writer Aaron Sorkin, who she called 'broke' before alleging he only wanted to adapt a book because he was sleeping with the writer. White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said on Friday that he felt an apology from Pascal and Sony was 'appropriate.' Sipkins and Weinraub have yet to comment on these most recent emails.","Bernie Weinraub, the husband of Sony Chair Amy Pascal, suggested his wife fire the company's head of communications, Charles Sipkins .

"The Iranian clergy has revived Salman Rushdie's death fatwa 25 years after it was issued over his 'blasphemous' Satanic Verses. On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on all Muslims to murder the award-winning author and anyone involved in the publication of his work. This Friday, senior cleric Ahmad Khatami . reminded worshippers at the Tehran Friday prayer that the 'historical . fatwa' is 'as fresh as ever'. Threat: Cleric Ahmad Khatami (left) reminded Muslims the $3.3m bounty on Salman Rushdie's head still stands . He added that even if Rushdie repents, it will not affect the sentence. The religious ruling forced the award-winning writer into hiding, and Britain's ties with the Islamic republic were severely damaged just a few years after collaborating on a UN resolution between Iraq and Iran. Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator, was stabbed to death in the face at work, a Norwegian publisher shot and an Italian publisher knifed. Thousands took to the streets to burn copies of the book and thirty-seven people were massacred in . Sivas, Turkey, in a 1993 attack intended to target Aziz Nesin, the . book's Turkish translator. More than two decades later, Rushdie has emerged from hiding and is regularly seen at public events. Fled: The award-winning author, pictured with the book, was forced into hiding after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini vowed to kill him, anyone involved in the book's publication, and anyone close to him . Crisis: The outrage and widespread chaos has lasted 25 years. Here Pakistani Muslims are pictured protesting against Salman Rushdie and Britain in 2007. Five years later, the bounty was raised . Pages of the book were burned in street protests across the Middle East and three publishers were murdered . People of all ages and nationalities took to the streets with placards calling for his assassination . However, this week cleric Khatami implored followers not to abandon their attacks. He said: 'The important thing is that this fatwa is as fresh as ever for Muslims. Faithful Muslims are looking for an opportunity to implement Imam's fatwa. 'Our enemies thought that with the acceptance of the resolution, Imam had retreated from his principles. 'Then this incident happened. It showed the world that the revered Imam had not retreated one bit.' The Satanic Verses, Rushdie's fourth novel, propelled the Indian-born writer into a storm of controversy that forced him into hiding for the best part of a decade. Rushdie, pictured right with his ex-wife Padma Lakshmi, has been seen out and about numerous times since emerging from hiding. In 2007, he was knighted and appeared publicly to receive the honour from the Queen . Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, reminds Rushdie every year that the fatwa still stands . The title refers to the so-called 'satanic verses', a group of alleged Qur'anic verses that allow intercessory prayers to be made to three Pagan Meccan goddesses. The book's publication in 1988 sparked a wave of protest and condemnation from Muslims who accused it of blasphemy and mocking their faith. The following year, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a fatwā, or religious ruling, calling for Rushdie's death. The British government gave the writer round-the-clock police protection. Rushdie has received notices every year since the publication reminding him of the religious ruling. In 2012, Hassan Sanei, the head of the state-funded 15 Khordad, raised the bounty on Rushdie's head by $500,000 to $3.3million ($2million). He said Islamaphobic literature and films would not have been made if it weren't for the Satanic Verses. 'Surely if the sentence of the Imam had been carried out, the later insults in the form of caricatures, articles and the making of movies would not have occurred,' he said in a statement. 'I am adding another $500,000 to the reward for killing Salman Rushdie and anyone who carries out this sentence will receive the whole amount immediately.' Also in 2012, Rushdie became the subject of a computer game in Iran called The Stressful Life Of Salman Rushdie And Implementation Of His Verdict. The programme is intended to teach the younger generation about the 'highly important' fatwa.","Senior cleric Ahmad Khatami told Tehran Friday prayer fatwa 'fresh as ever'

"Julie Roberts, who was hospitalised twice after being bitten by a spider leaving her unable to walk . A mother-of-four has been hospitalised twice by a spider bite which left her unable to walk after developing a two-inch blister and needing antibiotics from a drip. Julie Roberts says she was bitten by the spider at a friend’s barbecue in Hull, East Yorkshire after doctors told her an insect caused her injuries. She spent three days in hospital receiving treatment before being discharged. But days later she had to be re-admitted for another three days as she continued to feel unwell. And now she says she is suffering from anxiety and panic attacks due to her ordeal. Ms Roberts said: 'At the moment I feel like a nervous wreck. 'I have been having panic attacks and freaking out – I was never like this before. 'All this has made me feel really poorly. 'I don’t know if I got bitten while I was there or when I got home, but when I woke up on the Sunday morning I noticed there was quite a big mark on my leg. 'By tea-time, a blister was forming and half of my leg was red.' Ms Robert's ordeal began when she noticed the bite mark on her leg. She called the NHS 111 service for advice about the bite and was told to go to her nearest walk-in centre. She was given antibiotics and told to go to hospital if her symptoms worsened. After continuing to feel unwell, the 42-year-old then went to Hull Royal Infirmary, where she was admitted for three days and given antibiotics through a drip. She explained: 'The doctors said that because the bite had blistered, they knew it was caused by a spider. 'I have been bitten by mosquitos before and never had a reaction like this, so it is obviously something in the spider’s bite.' After her stay in hospital,she returned to her job as a secretary for a plumbing firm but four days later was forced to return to hospital for another three days after feeling worse than ever. After more treatment, she is now recovering at home and says she has become paranoid as she tries to keep her house free from insects. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Her foot also become swollen and she was put on a drip of antibiotics to bring down the swelling . She added: 'I’ve become really paranoid. I always shake my clothes before I put them on to check there are no spiders hiding. 'My eldest daughter has cut all the garden down at the back of the house and I have vacuumed the house from top to bottom. 'We have also got some conkers to put in the house as I have heard that they stop them getting into homes. 'My friend’s husband got bitten by a spider and had a bad reaction. 'Apparently, there is a shop that sells items to stop spiders coming into your home, so I will be making a trip there when I feel up to it.' After being bitten by the spider, Ms Roberts developed a two-inch blister on her foot, which left her unable to walk . Experts say high temperatures during the summer has led to spiders growing bigger than ever. This is because the warm weather means the spiders have had more to eat, and have not been killed off by falling temperatures. Entomologist Barry Warrington explained: 'I have definitely seen a difference this year. 'The spiders are much larger and part of the reason for that is because of the good weather we have been having lately. 'Now, as the nights are drawing in, people will start to notice more spiders in their homes. 'The males, which are larger, will roam about looking for a female and this is when they are often encountered indoors, as well as looking for warmer places to hide.'","Julie Roberts believes she was bitten by a spider at a friend's barbecue .

"The brother of President John F Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, is suing the funeral home which sold the killer's coffin for £55,000. Robert Oswald, 80, has accused Baumgardner Funeral Home in Fort Worth, Texas, of acting in bad taste for selling the coffin after his body was exhumed as part of a CIA conspiracy probe. Two days after President Kennedy was gunned down as he rode in an open-topped motorcade, Oswald was shot dead by night club owner Jack Ruby as he walked through Dallas police station. Oswald was buried at the Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Texas in 1963, but his body was exhumed 18 years later and examined after mounting speculation about CIA involvement. The coffin of President John F Kennedy's accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, is at the centre of a macabre ownership battle . Two days after President Kennedy (left) was gunned down as he rode in an open-topped motorcade, Oswald was shot dead by night club owner Jack Ruby as he walked through Dallas police station . Robert Oswald. 80, claims he is the rightful owner and said that something so 'disgusting' should not be sold. He said he paid a total of £451 to purchase a casket, vault, suit and flowers for the funeral and thought the coffin had been destroyed years ago. Allen Baumgardner, a funeral director who was part of the exhumation, kept the coffin and after failing to sell it on numerous occasions, finally found a buyer in 2010. 'His motive is to keep items away from the public. He does not want it out,' Mr Oswald's lawyer, Gant Grimes, told The Independent. President Kennedy was fatally shot by a sniper while traveling with his wife Jackie Kennedy in Dallas . The simple pine coffin is in poor condition, having suffered water damage and the ravages of time and decay . 'He appreciates there is some historical interest in things such as letters and such because [Oswald] played a significant role in US history. But this was the coffin. He bought it for his brother. He never thought he would see it again.' When the original coffin was bought by Robert Oswald, it was a gift to his dead brother and formed part of his estate. Mr Baumgardner argued that as neither Oswald's widow nor daughters had claimed the coffin, ownership was vested with the funeral home. The simple pine coffin is in poor condition, having suffered water damage and the ravages of time and decay.

After his death, doubts that Oswald was the true assassin quickly surfaced and some historians came to believe that he was in fact a covert U.S. intelligence agent. The former Marine is said to have defected to the Soviet Union in 1960 promising to reveal valuable military secrets. But he was allowed back into the country less than two years later with no consequences for his betrayal. The government theory that Oswald acted alone was not enough to convince many Americans following the President's assassination, including the leader's own brother. Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General at the time, immediately suspected that the CIA had something to do with the President's death in Dallas. The former Marine is said to have defected to the Soviet Union in 1960 promising to reveal valuable military secrets . An anonymous bidder bought the coffin for nearly £56,450 at Nate D Sanders Auctions in California . There have been a number of other conspiracy theories involving the USSR and the Mafia, who were said to be angry with JFK after the botched Bay of Pigs invasion. When Oswald was buried, the absence of mourners meant reporters covering the burial were asked by officials to act has pallbearers and carry the coffin. But mounting speculation as to whether Oswald was inside the coffin or whether a Russian agent had been placed instead meant the pine box was exhumed and the remains checked. An anonymous bidder bought the coffin for nearly £56,450  at Nate D Sanders Auctions of Santa Monica, California, exceeded the original closing deadline by two hours. The coffin was not the only item up for auction, as several instruments used to embalm Oswald, his death certificate, an Easter card he sent to his brother were also up for sale . A section of the car seat on which President Kennedy was sitting when he was shot was also available at the auction.

Sitting on wood crate which measures 84in by 24in.' State District Judge Don Cosby of Fort Worth heard testimony and arguments in a two-day trial that ended earlier this week. Lawyers say the judge is not expected to rule before Christmas. Laura Yntema, a manager at Nate D. Sanders Auctions, said, 'It's in limbo until the case is resolved. So whatever the court tells us to do, we'll do regarding the casket.

"Kevin Pietersen has taken no prisoners in his new book KP: The Autobiography, which is due to be released on Thursday. The former England batsman discusses his opinions on, among others, Matt Prior, Andrew Strauss, Andy Flower and Alastair Cook. Here, Sportsmail's Paul Newman and Mike Dickson assess the damage. Kevin Pietersen and his wife Jessica Taylor attend the Pride of Britain Awards on Monday night . Pietersen chats to former England team-mate Jonathan Trott before a Surrey v Warwickshire game in August . MATT PRIOR @MattPrior13 . 'I’m looking forward to reading the full KP book. Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!! Obvs sad to see the accusations against me and I WILL have my right of reply! However today is not the day and Twitter is not the place!' GEOFF MILLER, Former England selector . 'There was no atmosphere of bullying within the England set-up. What we tried to do was pick the best squad to create the best atmosphere to win matches.' GRAEME SWANN . 'It’s codswallop...We had a magnificent team ethos and team spirit until Mitchell Johnson took his blindfold off and then it all fell apart …He has picked on people who he thinks can’t answer back.' GARY LINEKER @GaryLineker . 'The weather at my #FFLGolfDay is horrendous! I blame Andy Flower.' JONATHAN AGNEW . 'Pietersen claims Flower had it in for him for attempting to have him sacked in 2008. But Flower brought Pietersen back into the team following the scandal over texts to South Africans.' CHRIS TREMLETT @ChrisTremlett . 'Glad KP has finally been able to give his side of the story. People can now make an informed opinion of what went on.' MICHAEL VAUGHAN @MichaelVaughan . 'Many to blame but mostly a lack of communication and man-management. I will remember KP for what he was. A maverick who could play innings that no other England player could!' On the ridiculing of Matt Prior . Pietersen’s one-time friend and fellow South Africa-raised player is heavily criticised even though - or maybe even because - Matt Prior was the player who tried to broker a peace deal after the ‘textgate’ revelations in 2012. Prior is sneeringly referred to as ‘The Big Cheese’, or simply ‘Cheese’, throughout the book, a reference to the nickname Pietersen alleges the wicketkeeper used to describe himself in the early part of his career. In continuing the theme he says Prior was ‘a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie’. Pietersen also ridicules Prior, a huge cycling enthusiast, for taking his bike on tour to New Zealand and writes: ‘Here’s a thing about playing cricket at the other end of the world. You don’t need to take your bike with you. They have bikes in New Zealand. ‘Who the hell takes a bike? If Cheese wasn’t a top genius cricketer Cheese would have been a world-class cyclist. Obviously.’ Most seriously, Prior is described as ‘a classroom bully’ whom Pietersen attacks as ‘not captaincy material or even vice-captaincy material’.

Kevin Pietersen (left) and Matt Prior (right) celebrates England's Ashes win in 2011 . On build-up to last winter’s Ashes . Rather like Shane Warne, Pietersen was not a fan of camps held before going away on tour and he felt no differently about the one held before leaving for the Australia tour in late 2013. ‘The pre-Ashes camp was the biggest shambles. Bonding? No. Boredom? Absolutely. It was one of the most frustrating periods of my life, purely because I knew I wouldn’t see my lad for however long when we were on tour and we were here doing this nonsense.’ Pietersen was not impressed by the pre-Ashes training camp which ensured he was away from his son .

Pietersen was unimpressed when, as the team gathered, the two bowlers were dead set against the point made by skipper Andrew Strauss that they should ease off criticising fielders when they had made a mistake. ‘They felt that bowlers were well within their rights to be angry and aggressive towards the fielders. ‘I just stood there and realised that it was the closest I’ve ever come to thinking I could willingly slap two guys on my own team.’ Pietersen (centre) was not impressed by Stuart Broad (left) and Graeme Swann's treatment of fielders . VIDEO Pietersen blasts former England 'regime' On wanting to ‘mute’ Nick Knight . Pietersen had a long-standing antagonism towards the former England batsman and now commentator Nick Knight, who he felt used information gleaned from the dressing room against him, and settles a score in the book. ‘He shows a better sense of balance sitting on the fence all the time than he ever did on a cricket pitch. The game moves at an incredible pace but Knight is one of those commentators you actually mute because he’s just so boring.’ Nick Knight (right), the Sky Sports pundit, is slammed as 'boring' on television by Pietersen . On criticising James Taylor . KP did not feel that the diminutive batsman was ready for international duty when called up for his debut in the Headingley Test against South Africa, and was not afraid to make his feelings known, although he insists this was done in private. ‘I have nothing against James but the fact is, at five feet six, he’s one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket. His Dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest attack in world cricket, I didn’t think he was up to it. I rang and asked Andy Flower, in my usual sweet way, how on earth have you picked Taylor?’ Batsman James Taylor (left) was deemed unworthy of international cricket by Pietersen (right) Pietersen has taken aim at England fringe players such as Michael Carberry (left) and James Taylor (right) On the ‘KP GENIUS’ twitter account . Pietersen claims that the hurt he felt over a parody Twitter account in his name led to him breaking down in tears in front of Andy Flower and led to his infamous ‘it’s difficult being me’ comment after the Headingley Test of 2012. The former England batsman says the parody Twitter account made him distrust his team-mates . On Strauss and ‘Textgate’ Read his views on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior . I did NOT text South Africans ways to get Strauss out . Flower's regime led to cliques (and Trott telling Prior and Swann to 'f*** off') Flower was a 'f****** horrendous' 'Mood Hoover' Pietersen was in a depressed state after being subject to the mocking spoof Twitter account and felt isolated from the rest of the dressing room. He says he was a broken man but maintained that the exchange of messages with South Africa players was blown out of all proportion when he spoke to Andrew Strauss about it. ‘We had a fine big ding dong. He accused me of having done it. I admitted that I had been in communication with the South Africans. Yes, but it was nothing bad. These guys are friends. You guys have been treating me like sh** for years. You’ve been acting like a d*** to me. I went through example after example.’ Pietersen denies he gave South Africa information on how to dismiss Andrew Strauss (right) in 2012 . On his deteriorating Strauss relationship . The two had been close friends in the team before the Middlesex man was given the captaincy and there was soon a frosting of relations when they got to the West Indies in Strauss’s first tour as skipper. ‘A week into his captaincy he told me in the Caribbean that I couldn’t go home and see my family at a really tough time in my life. The way he conducted himself, the distance he put between us straight away: I just didn’t think that Straussy was my kind of guy any more.’ Pietersen and Strauss celebrate the latter's century earlier that summer against West Indies at Trent Bridge . Pietersen and Strauss are all smiles after England beat India at The Oval to become the world's No 1 Test side . On Swann and reintegration . At one of the meetings to rehabilitate him back into the team Graeme Swann made it clear he was not happy that he had been dragged to Oxford for a meeting at a time when his wife was about to give birth. Pietersen was unimpressed by his reaction. ‘I just thought Swanny, you sad, sad bastard. If you don’t want to be here don’t come. You are a grown man, your wife is having a baby. But if Andy Flower calls you somewhere you just go?’ Graeme Swann (left) claims Kevin Pietersen's autobiography is a 'work of fiction' (both pictured in 2008) On Alastair Cook and how it all ended . The England captain is portrayed condescendingly as a bumbling Yes man who fitted the squeaky-clean image the ECB want from its leader. ‘Cooky hates conflict,’ writes Pietersen. ‘He’s another Mr Nice Guy - like Ned Flanders from The Simpsons.’ Of the meeting which ended Pietersen’s England career, he writes: ‘Cook shakes my hand but he doesn’t want to look at me. He looks at the floor. I feel sorry for him.’ The England captain has since privately insisted that he was ready to speak with Pietersen about the reasons for his demise at that meeting, but that Pietersen walked out without seeking an explanation. That is contested by Pietersen who insists that, even though he left the meeting after barely five minutes, he only did so after saying: ‘Is that it?’ He then headed straight to his lawyer to negotiate his pay-off.

"Condition: Caroline Kinsey, who was raised as a man called Carl, only found out she had both male and female sex organs aged 19 . A woman with both male and female sex organs lived as a man for over 40 years because her parents didn't tell her she was born a hermaphrodite for two decades. Caroline Kinsey has lived almost all her life as a man as her parents hid her intersex medical condition from her until she was 19. She underwent surgery as an infant and was brought up as Carl John Baker. But after years of mockery at school and assuming that 'everybody's body looked like hers', her parents finally revealed the truth about her condition when she was 19. After a short, failed marriage to a woman and a period suffering depression, Caroline decided to dress as a woman two years ago and now wants to take on a permanent 'female persona'. She revealed her condition was kept from her 'for as long as possible' by her parents on medical advice and because her mother and father 'didn't know any better'. She said: 'From being young I have always known I was different. I could never quite put my finger on why. 'A doctor told my mother they should deny me my first birthright, the chance to be a woman, in favour of my second birthright, being a man, . 'The doctor said it would be easier to hide my female genitalia than the male one, so knowing no different that is what they did. 'They were also advised to keep my secret from me and the rest of the world for as long as possible.' Caroline was born in Bull Hill Hospital, Darwen, Lancashire, in 1968 to Monica and Rudolph Baker. But, after her delivery, their good news was shattered when a nurse said their new baby daughter also had male genitalia. Caroline was brought up as Carl John Baker in the family home, in Darwen. In 1970, she and her younger brother Martin were taken into care after social workers discovered they had been left alone at the family home. She added: 'I had a really feminine sounding voice, but I was never told I was different to anyone else and I assumed everybody’s body looked like mine. 'As soon as I got to school I realised I didn’t fit in. The boys called me horrible names and the girls thought I was weird. School was a really hard time for me and I never really had a girlfriend.' Scroll down for video . Living a lie: Caroline, pictured as Carl on her . wedding day (left) has since decided to adopt a 'female persona' after . learning of her condition . Abandoned: Caroline lost contact with her mother . Monica Baker (left) after being taken into care as a youngster (right) when she was left home alone . After turning 19, Caroline got back in touch with her family. She said: 'I hadn’t been back long when mum said she was going to share something important with me. The . condition of being 'Intersex' affects one in every 2,000 births in the . UK (although figures may be much higher) and there are an estimated . 30,000 intersex people in the UK. There are several known abnormalities that can lead to specific sexual ambiguity. So called 'XX male syndrome' occurs . in people who have two X chromosomes - one of which contains a . significant amount of genetic material from a Y chromosome. These people appear to be male, but . are, in fact, genetically female. Typically, they will possess male sex . organs, but these will often be underdeveloped. They will also often develop breasts and maintain a high-pitched speaking voice. In fact, biologists now recognise a . host of conditions, both genetic and otherwise, which are labelled . under the umbrella term 'intersex' - which replaces older terms such as . 'hermaphrodite'. Intersex people may be genetically . female, but physiologically male. Some will be true hermaphrodites, . producing both eggs and sperm. Many will have been subjected to 'gender reassignment surgery' after birth, sometimes successfully, often not. 'She told me to sit down and she went and fetched my baby book. In there were pictures of me as a baby and details of my birth. 'She started to tell me about the day she gave birth to me and the reaction by the nurse. 'Everything all of a sudden started to make sense. My whole life people had sensed I was different. 'She told me they went with the doctors’ advice because they didn’t know any better.' Caroline continued to spend her life as a man, working in restaurants and pubs as a kitchen porter. For a short period she also married, but the relationship broke up not long after they wed. She found herself sinking into . depression and, in a desperate act to feel better, she decided to try . dressing as a woman two years ago. She . said: 'To start off, it was really strange as I had only ever known how . to dress as a man. But very quickly I realised it was the right thing . for me.' Caroline added that even now she struggles for acceptance in her new persona. She said: 'I grew up as a boy, which I shouldn't have because secrets were kept from me. 'I didn't feel right in men's clothes so after 41 years I decided to take a challenge and put women's clothes on. 'The first dress I wore was a pink dress when I walked to the job centre, a people started to stare and say, 'what an idiot'. 'But since that year I've started to wear women's clothes because I knew I was a real woman. 'I feel happier than ever now. I feel healthy and don't even look back into my past because I don't want to remember it.' New start: Caroline, 42, says she now wants surgery to remove her male genitalia so she can officially become a woman . 'But even now, two years on, not everyone accepts me. I do a lot of volunteer work and visit the Salvation Army. 'Many of its members accept me for me and can see how taking on my female persona has made be a more happy and balanced person, while others just want to be nasty all the time. 'I am now looking into having surgery to remove my male genitalia forever. 'Hopefully, this will enable me to put the past behind me and help me move on and find love.' Campaigners for intersex groups say there are often public misunderstandings about the condition. Dr Jay Hayes-Light, director of the UK Intersex Association, said: 'Being intersex is not a lifestyle choice, but a medical condition. 'Caroline’s case is typical of that of an a intersex child who had no idea about their condition. 'The public often confuse intersex people with those who are transgender because of a lack of understanding.' 'Discrimination against intersex . people is often the unreported abuse of a minority, which has for . generations been kept a secret by parents and other family members. 'Gay . people are now, rightly so, accepted into society and have a right to . live as part of the community. Intersex people also deserve these same . rights. 'I back Caroline’s appeal for people to be more tolerant and hope people realise her condition has been inherited, not chosen.'","Caroline Kinsey, 42, was born with both male and female sex organs but was raised as a boy .

"Rock-Paper-Scissors is thought to have been played for more than 2,000 years. But a strategy for winning the game of chance has evaded mathematicians until now. A team of researchers in China has found that most players use a strategy that appears random, but consists of predictable patterns that an opponent could exploit to win the game. Game on: Mathematicians have found that most players use a strategy for Rock Paper Scissors that appears random, but consists of predictable patterns (pictured) that an opponent could exploit to win the game. This diagram explains that people often rotate from rock to paper to scissors when they are on a losing streak . The first known mention of the game is in a Chinese book called Wuzazu, written by Xie Zhaozhi in around 1600. He wrote that the game, which was called shoushilling, dates back to the time of the Han Dynasty from 206BC to 220AD. It is thought the game originated in China before becoming popular in Japan. In the earliest version, a frog which is represented by the thumb, battles a slug (little finger) and a snake (index finger) although different animals have been used. The game arrived in Europe in the early 20th century and became popular in the 1920s in the UK, before catching on in the U.S. in the 1930s. The modern version uses rock, paper and scissors, although in some parts of Asia, cloth replaces paper. It was popularly thought that the best strategy for winning the game was to choose from the three ‘weapons’ at random, which over a large number of games means that a player is equally likely to win, lose or draw. This mixed strategy, which is also known as the Nash Equilibrium means that each choice has an equal probability in the next round of the game and previous experiments have shown that this works for Rock-Paper-Scissors, Technology Review reported. However, convinced that there is more to the seemingly random game than meets the eye, Zhijian Wang of Zhejiang University in China conducted his own experiment and discovered that gameplay typically consists of predictable patterns. If these are spotted and unlocked by players, they could go on to win the game. A total of 360 students divided into groups of six players, played 300 rounds of the game and recorded the outcome of each round. A first: Mathematicians identified a feature of game theory called 'conditional response' and it has never been detected before in Rock-Paper-Scissors (pictured). The pattern could be used by canny players to boost their chances of winning . Players typically choose either rock, paper or scissors a third of the time - which if picked randomly, confirm the Nash Equilibrium concept. Gamers on a winning streak usually stick with a particular action, while those that lost a round switch options in a ‘clockwise’ direction, from rock, to paper, to scissors. Mathematicians studying game theory call this behaviour a ‘conditional response’ and it has never been detected before in Rock-Paper-Scissors. The findings are not surprising when you consider that it is human nature to stick with a winning strategy and make changes after losses. Dr Wang found that typically, players in every one of the groups chose each option a third of the time – which if picked randomly confirms to the Nash Equilibrium concept. However, he also discovered that players on a winning streak tended to stick with a particular action, while those that lost switch options in a ‘clockwise’ direction, from rock, to paper, to scissors. Mathematicians studying game theory call this behaviour a ‘conditional response’ and it has never been detected before in Rock-Paper-Scissors. Dr Wang thinks this might be because the behaviour only becomes apparent in large-scale experiments. ‘This game exhibits collective cyclic motions which cannot be understood by the Nash Equilibrium concept but are successfully explained by the empirical data-inspired conditional response mechanism,’ he said. It might seem less surprising when you consider that it is human nature to stick with a winning strategy and make changes after losses. Dr Wang plans on examining the psychological nature of the game in more detail and is interested in whether humans are hardwired to follow a conditional response strategy.","Hundreds of games of .

"More than 1,000 years ago, this 50-year-old woman was laid to rest in a ceremonial ritual in the ancient settlement of Pachacamac, near Lima, Peru. The mummified skeleton, which was found in a vast burial site just yards from the long-abandoned civilisation's temple, was discovered in a foetal position. Careful not to damage the well-preserved body of the woman, archaeologists have kept her in the same state she was found in as they prepare to unveil the mummy for a French museum exhibition. The mummified skeleton of a 50-year-old woman, found in a foetal position in an ancient burial site in Peru, will go on display this week . Careful not to damage the well-preserved body of the woman, archaeologists have kept her in the same state she was found in as they prepare to unveil the mummy . Experts carefully lower the woman, discovered in the ancient civilisation of Pachacamac, as they prepare the skeleton for its unveiling at the Musee de Confluences, in Lyon, later this month . The mummy will be revealed to the public at the Musee de Confluences, in Lyon, when it opens later this month. From a pre-Inca civilisation, the frail skeleton will form part of the new museum's exploration of human representations of death in different ages and cultures around the world. Pachacamac, based around 25 miles south of the Peruvian capital, was situated on the Pacific coastline. More than 80 skeletons and mummies - including infants who appeared to have been killed for ritual reasons - were found in a spectacular 1,000-year-old tomb at the site in 2012. Beyond these bodies, a further 70 skeletons and mummies - all in the fetal position - were lying around, most of them still wrapped up. The frail skeleton will form part of the new museum's exploration of human representations of death . The Pachacamac civilisation, based around 25 miles south of the Peruvian capital, followed the god Pacha Kamaq - who they believed created the first man and first woman . Pachacamac, with its temple and 17 pyramids, is revered as one of the most significant ancient settlements in South America .

The thousands who lived in the ancient town, which existed between the years 800 and 1450, followed the god Pacha Kamaq - who they believed created the first man and first woman. The townsfolk, who built 17 pyramids, merged with the Incas as they conquered much of South America. The monumental site, which covers almost 600 hectares of arid land, is considered one of the most important ancient settlements in South America, widely thought to be as significant as Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines.

"A 'jealous and controlling' teenager strangled his young girlfriend and killed their unborn child because he thought she was talking to other boys, a court heard today. Aston Robinson, 18, repeatedly punched girlfriend Kayleigh-Anne Palmer, 16, before strangling her with her tartan scarf so she would 'be quiet', a jury was told. Bristol Crown Court heard that Robinson lashed out at the schoolgirl - who was 24 weeks pregnant - after getting into an argument about boys she had spoken to. While Kayleigh lay dying, he fled the scene before calmly heading to a bookies to check the status of a £20 bet. Kayleigh-Anne Palmer, 16, was strangled with her tartan scarf by Aston Robinson, 18, a court heard today . The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later. She tragically passed away three days after the incident. Robinson handed himself into police and confessed to killing his girfriend, but denied her murder. He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage, from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said: 'He said, ""I'm so sorry for your loss. I didn't want that to happen. I was hoping that when she woke up, and after my jail sentence, I would go back to her arms. '""God took her way in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour.""' Mr Quinlan added: 'But God didn't take Kayleigh away, this jealous and controlling young man murdered her. 'His senseless act of violence also destroyed the life on an unborn child. 'He said he used her own scarf and did it because he was jealous and wanted her to ""be quiet"".' Kayleigh was 24 weeks pregnant with Robinson's child when he allegedly murdered her during a fight about other boys she had spoken to . Robinson (right of both pictures) went to the bookies to check on a £20 bet while Kayleigh lay dying . Robinson denies murdering Kayleigh, who died on April 5 this year, and the destruction of their unborn baby, on April 3. The court was told that Kayleigh had reported her boyfriend to the police on a number of occasions in the past after he had punched and kicked her. On one occasion Kayleigh went to hospital with a bloody nose after he punched her hard in the face. The court heard that when the schoolgirl, from Cheltenham, told Robinson she was pregnant he reacted badly, pushing her to the ground before shouting at her, 'this will stop you having a baby'. Just days later police were called after a distressed Kayleigh told a stranger that she had been punched in the face following another argument with her boyfriend of six months, the court heard. She was taken to accident and emergency where staff reported the abuse. Mr Quinlan said: 'He suffered with paranoia where she was concerned. 'He was jealous and became jealous when he even thought that she was, or might, have lied to him. 'She said he had become jealous and accused her of looking at another boy so he punched her to the face causing the injuries. 'These episodes of violence, hostility towards the fact she was pregnant, and his jealousy manifested itself in accusations that she was seeing other boys. 'Their relationship was punctuated by his inability just to let her be.' He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage (right), from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old (left) Robinson denies murdering Kayleigh, who died on April 5 this year, and destruction of their unborn baby . Bristol Crown Court was told that Kayleigh had reported her boyfriend to the police on a number of occasions in the past after he had punched and kicked her . The day before her death, Robinson sent Kayleigh a text message in which he told her, 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate'. The message was swiftly followed by another, to her mother, which read, 'Make sure you tell Kayleigh I'm having nothing to do with her or the baby'. Robinson, also from Cheltenham, then turned up to Kayleigh's house where the pair rowed once more before he left. The following day Kayleigh got ready for school, kissed her mum goodbye and left for Robinson's house. Another argument developed there over boys Kayleigh had been talking to, and when she said 'how would you like it if I had met some boys?' Robinson lashed out. During an interview with police he told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends. He said she offered no resistance and did not struggle, and he dragged her from the sofa to the floor. When she stopped moving he rolled her over and, after discovering she was blue, immediately bolted from the property at 11.45am. He ran into his sister, Michaela, who discovered Kayleigh lying face down on the living room floor and attempted to resuscitate her. Robinson later handed himself in at Cheltenham police station. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Kayleigh-Anne Palmer was 24 weeks pregnant with Aston Robinson's baby .

"There's only one thing to do when the kids won't eat their vegetables: bribe them. At least that's what some Colorado schools are doing now that Michelle Obama's Healthy and Hunger Free Kids Act has scared students away from their school lunch programs, according to KUSA. Jefferson County Public Schools now has a 'Hungry to Win' raffle program, EagNews reports. Each time a student buys a lunch, they are entered in the raffle for a chance to win prizes such as jump ropes, kites, iTunes gift cards, and even bicycles and iPods. Scroll down for video . Incentive: Jefferson County public schools in Colorado have implemented the 'Hungry to Win' raffle program, offering students prizes for eating school lunches . Down: At Jeffco schools, school lunch sales were down six percent in fall 2013 . 'With all the new regulations and the changes that we've made, our lunch participation has gone down, Lori Burris, Jeffco Schools lunch facilitator, told KUSA. 'So, this was to be an incentive to try school lunch and maybe bring them back.' Burris said school lunch sales were down six percent last year and she said school officials believe the decline is because students don't like the changes that have been made to make the lunches healthier. Anna Ketzer, a first grader at Devinny Elementart School, won a new bike as part of the raffle, according to KUSA.' She said that she was very excited to win the bike and likes the lunches because she doesn't have to make her own. Criticism: First Lady Michelle Obama has received criticism about the school lunches and some schools have even dropped out of the federal program . Come Back: Lori Burris, Jeffco Schools lunch facilitator, said that the lunches are 'a little different,' but the 'Hungry to Win' contest is an effort to encourage students to 'come back and try [the lunches]' Burris said that the lunches are 'a little different,' but the 'Hungry to Win' contest is an effort to encourage students to 'come back and try [the lunches]', according to EagNews. She said that the contest has resulted in school lunch sales increasing by four percent since it was first implemented. Kay Burnett, a kitchen manager at Devinny, said that there are a lot of good food items offered at the school and she said she believes the raffle is a great idea. Increase: Burris said that the contest has resulted in school lunch sales increasing by four percent since it was first implemented . Burris and Burnett praise the program, but few Facebook commenters share their views. One commenter wrote: 'This is amazing! Jeffco is teaching our kids how to gamble! Not just to gamble, but to gamble to eat. Is the next field trip to Las Vegas so we can teach them how to live on the streets after they don't win? ""Hey, buy our food and you could win a bike!"" or ""Hey, play our slots and you could win a car!"" What's the difference?' Others criticized the government, Michelle Obama, and questioned whether the school's approach is even legal. KUSA reports that the prizes were at no cost to the school district and came from food suppliers.","Jefferson County Public schools in Colorado have implement a 'Hungry to Win' raffle program, giving kids who buy school lunches a chance to win numerous prizes .

"Jetting across the world without a care in the world except what Prada shoe to wear. This is Dorothy Wang, the 26-year-old heiress to one of China's largest mall chains, worth $4 billion, and star of Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills. In the future, she says, she wants to 'do it all' to follow her father into wealth and success - jewelry design, cooking, publishing, fashion. But for now, she describes herself as 'funemployed' as she has a raucous time living luxuriously rather than toiling through job ads. Scroll down for video . 'Funemployed': Dorothy Wang, 26, scales the world - going to parties and appearing on Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills .

Another picture shows her wearing two Rolex watches, with another golden one beside her, and the hash tag #badbitchproblems. However, in an interview with Business Insider this week, Wang insists it is not all fun and games.

Rolling: Wang, whose father is worth $4bn after creating a Chinese mall chain, is picture in a limousine . She asks whether she should wear the silver or black Prada strappy sandals, adding 'double shoe problems' Night on the town: Wang shared a picture dining on oysters and red wine with a friend, who sports a massive diamond ring .

'It was important for me to do the show and get it on the air, on my own, and I didn't even tell my dad about it so no one could say anything like that,' she says. 'He didn't invest anything in it, he didn't even know about it. 'And so that was important for me to have for myself as well to carve my own path, which is very different from my dad's. 'But I can turn this into a business, just not in the traditional sense like my father's, but I think it can be just as successful in another way.'

'This is my life now!': She posted a picture on Instagram hard at work posting her collection to customers . Choices: Promoting her line, she photographed a selection of her own jewelry box . 'Proud': Wang shares a picture of her with friends watching her own reality show . In between holidays to Hawaii and shopping sprees in Las Vegas, Wang has developed a jewelry line, turning her catchphrases on Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills into necklaces. Fans can buy silver and gold chains with the words: #rich, #fabuluxe or #nofilter - an Instagram phrase which means a picture is naturally impressive, without the use of photo editing. While she hopes the business venture takes off - with more collections planned, including a necklace with the phrase #funemployed on it - Wang continues to entertain her growing fan base with snap shots of her luxurious lifestyle. Many posts feature idyllic scenes as she asks people to guess which country or city she has traveled to.

"Belgian royals turned out in blustery wind and snow today to commemorate the Battle of Bulge fought between the Nazis and allied forces 70 years ago.

Bob Izumy, a US Army Veteran, received rapturous applause as he took part in the parade today in Belgium . Jams Morgia is pictured beaming as he joins other WWII veterans for the 70th anniversary celebrations . More than 10,000 troops were killed in the conflict launched by Hitler in a final bid to infiltrate the west by infiltrating one of its quietest fronts. Over the course of four days from December 16, American divisions of the alliance came under the siege of Nazis, with German troops switching uniforms to cut telephone wires and sabotage their resources. After weeks of bloodshed, western forces triumphed in what was hailed by Winston Churchill as 'an ever-famous American victory'. Dressed in black, the Belgian royal family today braved blizzards and freezing temperatures to lay wreaths at the McAuliffe monument in Bastogne, named after the American general who spearheaded the ferocious defence.

Queen Mathilde  steps out of the blizzards and freezing temperatures to greet US veterans of World War II . Famously, when offered an ultimatum by the Germans in the final stages of the battle whether to surrender or face further blows, he replied: 'Nuts!' In the final months of 1944 and keen to take control of the crucial port of Antwerp, Hitler launched one of the Nazis' bloodiest offensives on the West. Taking US forces by surprise, tens of thousands of German troops descended on Ardennes - a heavily forested region stretching through Luxembourg and Belgium. Thick winter fog plagued the allied forces' efforts to destroy German strong-holds, and with Nazi troops donning US Army uniforms to sabotage communications between divisions by snapping phone lines, victory was unlikely. However after depleting the German's armored tanks and resources, Western allied forces triumphed. His impassioned response is honoured by the tradition of throwing nuts into the crowds, an act carried out by the King and Queen today. King Philippe also greeted veterans who took part in the courageous battle who had travelled to Bastogne for the festivities. Among them was Bob Izumy who, alongside his fellow veterans, received rapturous applause when wheeled down the city's streets in a wheelchair during the parade. Hundreds of European well-wishers donned United States Army uniforms to take part in the celebrations. 'We must never forget what happened in 1944. Many American soldiers came here to defend Europe. We must honor them for what they did,' said 62-year-old Jean-Claude Klepper of Virton. Shops and local restaurants adorned drawings and American flags in respect of the battle.

"A former University of Wyoming student who was threatened with rape by an anonymous Facebook poster has been charged with misdemeanor for sending the threat herself. Meghan Lanker-Simons was originally believed to be the target of the Facebook posting by a supposed Republican who called her 'that chick that runs her liberal mouth all the time,' and threatened sexual violence. University of Wyoming police traced the IP address of the computer from which the threat was sent to a computer named 'ElComputerdeMeg' and belonging to Meghan Lanker-Simons. Hoax: University of Wyoming student Meg Lanker-Simons (pictured on April 29 with her husband Andrew) posted a threatening message targeting her, in order to frame Republicans . Threats: Police say the woman mentioned in this post, Meg Lanker Simons, actually wrote the threatening message. Her husband, Andrew, responded angrily (below) Court documents add that the 'user logged . into the computer at the time was meghanm, or Meghan Michelena, also . known as Meghan Lanker-Simons.' Lanker-Simons has pleaded not guilty to the charge of misdemeanor for interfering with police. The Laramie Boomerang reports that Lanker-Simons’ attorneys filed a motion to suppress evidence seized during a search warrant. Prosecutor Joshua Merseal, of the Albany County and Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, has filed a response asking the court to deny the motion. The . posting that threatened Lanker-Simons occurred on a Facebook forum for . UW students, leading to an investigation by University of Wyoming police . because it was directed at a student. The Facebook page, which is not officially affiliated with the university, was taken down and a student-led demonstration against sexual violence was held. People were outraged by the Facebook posting and demanded the author of the post be found. Lanker-Simons' own husband Andrew Simons posted on the page expressing his disgust and vowing to 'take this as far as it will go.' Outrage: The posting sparked an outcry across the University and students even organized protests. Meg Lanker-Simons went along with the outrage until police learned she was behind the post . Ironic: Meg Lanker-Simons, pictured in 2011, wrote a strongly worded reaction to the threatening post (that she herself posted) calling it 'disgusting' Lanker-Simons is a blogger and local radio show host who advocates for liberal causes. In . 2010, she filed a lawsuit against the university that forced UW to . allow 1960s radical Bill Ayers on the campus for a speech on education. Ayers co-founded the Weather Underground, an anti-war group from the Vietnam Era that claimed to be responsible for a series of bombings, including nonfatal explosions at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol. The Facebook post came to light when people including Pamela Kandt, co-convener of the Episcopal Women's Caucus and a Casper activist, complained to the university and demanded action. Besides the threat of sexual assault, the posting was written to make it appear as if its author was a conservative Republican. Kandt came to Lanker-Simons' defense last month. 'I will tell you, I believe Meg is innocent of this outrage,' Kandt told the Laramie Boomerang, adding she believes the citation issued by police is a 'classic case of blaming the victim.' 'I mean, my God, who would do this to herself?' she added.

Video footage has emerged which appears to show Peter Howarth-Lees as he is jumped on by a member of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice outside the supermarket . An investigation has now been ordered by the head of the Mutawa into the incident, it has been reported. Mr Howarth-Lees, who is married to a woman from Saudi Arabia, was attacked after members of the Mutawa followed him out of the shop, The Telegraph has reported. A statement apparently written by Mr Howarth-Lees and posted on to a local website describes how he and his wife were directed to the female cashier before three men approached them and objected. He said the couple were harassed by the men, despite the cashier's assertion that the customers were a family, before the argument spilled out into the car park after they had paid for their goods. He said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car. He said: 'While I was on the ground all three of them proceeded to kick me repeatedly in the head and back and then one of them stamped hard on my face.' Mr Howarth-Lees said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car . His wife then got out of the car before one of the men, apparently as seen in the video, climbed on to a car and jumped on to Mr Howarth-Lees. The incident finally came to an end after the couple were driven away in a British Embassy car. Mr Howarth-Lees has told The Telegraph that the head of the Mutawa had told him an investigation had been ordered. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is the Saudi Arabian government's religious police to enforce Sharia Law within the Islamic nation. Altogether, it has 3,500 to 4,000 police officers who enforce a strict religious code among citizens. The incident took place outside a supermarket in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia (file picture) Members patrol the streets checking dress code, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, and other behaviour it believes to be commanded by Islam. The Mutawa are known for having full beards and wearing their headscarves (ghutrah or shemagh) loose without an agal and often come from Saudi Arabia's lower classes. The body has widespread powers to detain and berate offenders and shut down businesses and are employed directly by the King. The organisation's 2013 budget was the equivalent of $390million. In May this year it was reported that five Saudi men had been sentenced to 32 years in prison and 4,500 lashes by a criminal court in Saudi Arabia for holding a Valentine's Day party. The men were caught at a rented rest house in the Al-Farouq area of Buraidah Qassim province and accused of holding a party with women who were unrelated to them, drinking and dancing. Mutawa members rounded up the men with the help of security patrols for their offences along with six women on February 14.","Peter Howarth-Lees and his wife attacked by religious police in Saudi Arabia .

"Gerard Depardieu said he had 'no choice' but to kill the creatures which had blocked a vehicle in which he was a passenger while on a tour of Burkina Faso . Hell-raising French actor Gerard Depardieu has admitted he shot two lions on a trip to Africa - then ate them. The 65-year-old said he was forced to kill the animals after the creatures had blocked a vehicle in which he was a passenger. 'We broke down on a track in the bush, in Burkina Faso,' said Mr Depardieu. 'The two lions waited in front of us and wouldn't move. 'Hours passed, and we couldn't get out of the car, the African driver was very afraid. 'We had no choice; we had to shoot them,' said Mr Depardieu, referring to the lions. Asked directly if they were then eaten, he replied: 'Yes'. Mr Depardieu first mentioned his hunting expedition in September, telling So Film magazine: 'I killed two lions once, and I understand why the lion is the king of the jungle. In legitimate self-defence. 'Imagine you're driving and your engine breaks down. You get out, and in your way are these animals. So you shoot, just to scare them. They don't move. I wasn't there for hunting. I was in Africa for Africa.' Mr Depardieu, who has had bypass surgery five times, also explained the reason for so much of his bad behaviour, saying: 'When I'm bored, I drink. 'Apart from occasional compulsory moments of abstinence. After undergoing bypass surgery and also because of cholesterol and stuff, I have to be careful.' In his latest interview - which appears in the Independent Magazine - Mr Depardieu also discussed the 2011 incident when he was thrown off an Air France flight for urinating in an aisle. 'I have lots of friends in the UK. And in Ireland. Where incidentally I recently p****d in a plane,' he said. 'There was this air hostess a little depressive, and I urgently wanted a p**s. Mr Depardieu said after killing the creatures he understood 'why the lion is the king of the jungle' (file photos) The Green Card star said he was not in Burkina Faso on a hunting expedition, but was 'in Africa for Africa' 'We'd been delayed 45 minutes, there were seven planes in front of us, and the hostess blocked me with her foot, so I p****d in a bottle. Luckily all the police at Dublin airport know me.' Last month, Mr Depardieu shocked an audience at what was meant to be a solemn First World War commemoration by turning up 'scandalously drunk'. The Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac star was due to read out poetry by the French poet-singer known as Barbara - who survived France's wartime Holocaust - at the event in Brussels. But within a few seconds of arriving on stage, Mr Depardieu had ignored much of the prepared text, and was waiving his hands in the air while telling jokes, shouting, and using uncouth language. Mr Depardieu took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the very rich, and now mainly lives in Russia and Belgium.","Says he had 'no choice' but to kill creatures that blocked his car for hours .

"A boys' club who had a rare piece of Banksy artwork left on their front door have had it valued on the Antiques Roadshow for £400,000. The work, called Mobile Lovers had appeared overnight on a plank of wood screwed to a wall close to the Broad Plain Boys' Club in Banksy's home town of Bristol. Dennis Stinchcombe from the club, became involved in a row with the local council after removing the artwork put on a public wall near the youth club. Scroll down for video . Broad Plain Boys' Club leader Dennis Stinchcombe, left, took the Banksy artwork to the Antiques Roadshow where it was given a valuation by Rupert Maas, right . Mr Maas, right, told Mr Stinchcombe, left that selling the work for £400,000 would be a 'good deal' The artwork, called Mobile Lovers when it was first left on the youth club door in Bristol . The struggling club hoped that by selling the piece they would be able to remain open. However, the artwork was removed by the city council, who maintained they owned the wall, and put on display in Bristol. But the artist waded into the argument by writing a letter to the club's owner, giving him his 'blessing' to do what he felt was right with the art. Mr Stinchcombe, 58, has now had the piece valued by experts from the Antiques Roadshow, who were filming in Bristol. He said he was hoping to keep a low profile, but everyone at the mansion house recognised the piece immediately. Gallery owner and expert, Rupert Maas, told Mr Stinchcombe that selling the artwork for £400,000 would be a 'good deal'. Confirmation: The artist waded in to the row by writing a letter to Dennis Stinchcombe, who runs the club, giving him his 'blessing' to do what he felt was right with the art . The youth club owner said: 'I am looking to sell the Banksy at the highest price, and I just took it down to get an expert opinion. 'I'm not an art dealer and I've got no idea what I am doing. He said it was like everything else - Banksy is an incredibly hard thing to put a price on. 'And the reason behind that is there are no set fees or prices, but it is a very unique piece. 'They also said in real terms, if somebody offers me £400,000, that would be a good deal. 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and it is better to just get the money in the bank. Funding: Mr Stinchcombe said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club (pictured) as well as help fund other youth projects in the area . Popular: A couple joke around next to the Banksy artwork, painted onto a wooden board bolted to the wall . 'I could take it to auction and get no more for it, so we are in between a rock and hard place really, on making a decision. 'But the people there today were amazing, everyone was going mad for it. 'Everyone was taking photos and gathering round. I was hoping to keep it quiet but everyone saw me there, and I guess it will end up on TV now. 'But I am just trying to do my job properly and get the most money for my boys.' It is thought the piece is worth more than other pieces of Banksy work, due to a handwritten note delivered to the club by the artist himself. Row: Bristol City Council said it was not '100 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached to, and days later removed the piece with the support of police . Safe keeping: Before the artwork was taken by the council, the club had removed it from the wall and positioned it inside to protect it from vandals . Mr Stinchcombe has approached a number of wealthy businessmen, including Richard Branson, in a bid to get the best price for the work. The painting was first discovered at the club in St Jude’s, Bristol, on April 15 after Banksy posted a picture of the new design on his website. They removed the artwork to protect it from vandals and put it on display inside the club. However, Bristol City Council said it was not '100 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached to, and days later removed the piece with the support of police. Resemblance: Some critics of the piece have suggested the man in the painting looks like former Prime Minister Tony Blair . It was put on display at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery while its ownership was decided and more than 10,000 people viewed it over the Easter weekend alone. But on May 6, Mr Stinchcombe received the letter from Banksy, who gave the cash-strapped boys club permission to sell it. The following day the city's Mayor George Ferguson received a similar letter from Banksy confirming it was genuine. The artist had written: 'I don't normally admit to committing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought anytime soon you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece. 'I'm a great admirer of the work done at the club and would be chuffed if this can help in some way.' UK-based street artist Banksy is known worldwide for his stencils which . often carries political messages or questions about society. Despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for thousands, his true identity remains a secret - leading to a network of myths surrounding him and it is rumoured that his own parents don't know what he does,  believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator. There is also the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all. Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism. However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation. He has allegedly been photographed in the past but has always been wearing a mask or hood. In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story. Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.' Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated. His most famous artworks include Naked Man - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and Balloon Girl, which he has created several versions of across London including Hackney and the South Bank.

"Rising star: Liz Truss is the youngest-ever woman to join a Conservative Cabinet and is already being talked up as the 'next Margaret Thatcher' For the youngest-ever woman to join a Conservative Cabinet — especially one who is already being talked up as the ‘next Margaret Thatcher’ — Liz Truss has some unusual qualifications. The new Environment Secretary, 38, whose constituency is just 15 miles from the Queen’s Norfolk home at Sandringham, once called for the Monarchy’s abolition. She’s also described the British as ‘among the worst idlers in the world’. Then there was the little matter of an 18-month adulterous affair with a married Tory MP which, he said, cost him his marriage. It caused an almighty storm when she stood as a Tory parliamentary candidate in South West Norfolk and it emerged that she had failed to tell the selection committee about the relationship. All this is history, though. Who could deny the ambitious Truss’s astonishing agility, despite all that baggage, to find herself in the Cabinet less than four years since becoming an MP? ‘Working with her is like being next to a hornets’ nest,’ says one figure who has worked under her at Westminster. ‘It’s ceaseless, frenetic activity under the sword of Damocles if things aren’t done exactly as she wants them.’ Elizabeth Mary Truss has all the correct credentials to offset a party hierarchy full of Old Etonians. Her first school was a primary in Paisley, Scotland, before moving to a comprehensive in Leeds. She was brought up in a Left-wing household — her father a mathematics professor, her mother a nurse who took her on CND marches. At Oxford University, Truss was president of the Lib Dems and questioned the need for the Monarchy. She declared: ‘We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We believe in fairness and common sense . . . we do not believe people are born to rule.’ Two years later, however, she joined the Conservative Party. After being elected as an MP, she co-authored Britannia Unchained, which set out proposals to restore Britain’s economic position. One passage said: ‘The British are . among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we . retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children . aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in . football and pop music.’ And . now to the affair. At 28, she was burning for front-line politics, . having worked for both Shell and Cable & Wireless in executive and . accountancy roles. She had made it on to the party list of ‘preferred . candidates’ when, in the run-up to the 2005 election, she worked in the . office of Tory frontbencher Mark Field, the culture spokesman, who was . 41. She was married, too, to a financial controller. Field’s wife Michelle was chief executive of a hospital charitable foundation. Scroll down for video . New role: New Environment Secretary Liz Truss is pictured leaving Downing Street yesterday, following her new Cabinet appointment . The affair lasted 18 months, towards . the end of which she became pregnant. Truss told friends that the baby . was her husband’s and when it was born, he was named as the father on . the birth certificate. Indeed, Truss’s marriage survived the . scandal.Though the affair was well-known around Westminster, no one told . the selection committee at South West Norfolk. Their . indignation at having chosen someone with such a large skeleton . jangling in her cupboard led to vain efforts to deselect her, prompting . some bright spark among the Westminster Tory chatterati to dub those . recalcitrant locals as the ‘Turnip Taliban’. But . the relevant moniker should have been ‘Teflon Truss’. A war of words . raged, and when it died down, there she was, unhindered in her march to . political stardom. Affair: Truss's affair with former culture spokesman Mark Field (right) lasted 18 months. Her marriage survived the scandal, but Field was not so lucky . Field was not so lucky. His wife . divorced him and he lost his frontbench position. These days, as his . former intern-lover takes her seat at the Cabinet table, he remains on . the backbenches as he approaches his 50th birthday. He is, however, . happily remarried. Around . Westminster, when  they bump into each other, they nod politely. Truss . has now also effectively leapfrogged her former boss at the Department . for Education, Michael Gove. While working as his junior there, some . detected what one colleague describes as ‘the whiff of disloyalty’ in . the frank way she would talk publicly about her ‘disappointment’ over . Gove not acting on her suggestions. As . for the Environment brief, she is ‘ferociously intelligent and will . pick it up very quickly,’ says one close figure, ‘even though I observe . scant interest in agriculture and rural affairs beyond what she . absolutely needed as an MP with an agricultural constituency’. Those . who work for her will also learn, as one with such experience says, . ‘that she is a sucker  for flattery. Compliments — especially about her . genius, political skill, or emphatic, rosy predictions about her future . career — are certain to be met with peals of girlish laughter. Survivor: Truss survived efforts to deselect her after news broke of her affair with Field. She is pictured arriving for the possible deselection vote at Swaffham Assembly Rooms in 2009 .","Liz Truss, 38, is the youngest-ever woman to join a Conservative Cabinet .

"It was the feature that made him instantly recognisable, and in Britain ridiculed. Adolf Hitler's toothbrush moustache was as much his hallmark as a swastika and his side-parting hair style. Now the story of how the dictator went from having an elaborate handlebar moustache to the style he is forever associated with has been told in Emmy-nominated series The World Wars. Before and after: A new series reveals that Adolf Hitler got his infamous toothbrush moustache (right) after he had to trim his handlebar style (left) to allow his gas mask to properly seal during the First World War . The three-part mini series from the History Channel sheds a new light on the conflicts that defined the 20th century, and features dramatic re-enactments as well as interviews with historians and current political figures including John McCain, Colin Powell, Stanley McChrystal and Dick Cheney. The series, spread over six hours, starts with a First World War soldier discovering that his handlebar moustache, complete with twisted ends, is preventing his gas mask from sealing tightly during a gas attack in a trench. The soldier, revealed to be a young Adolf Hitler, is then shown trimming the facial hair into a neat square, creating the infamous style. Stephen David, the series' executive producer, said his research team had learned how Hitler had favoured a longer moustache prior to the outbreak of the First World War while making the programme. 'We're trying to be as factual as we can,' he told The Wrap. Preference: Hitler, pictured as a young soldier, had favoured a longer moustache prior to the outbreak of the First World War . 'Sometimes we have to compress time. He wasn't ordered to shave the . mustache, but actually he shaved the mustache while he was in the . hospital. Budget-wise, it would have been tough to film there as well as . in the trench.' After the conflict ended in 1918, Hitler kept the moustache, still preferring the trimmed style as he rose to power in Germany in the early 1930s, and it soon became one of his most identifiable features. Mr David said: 'I think in actuality after World War I . that was a fashion, and a lot of people did that. Between World War I . and World War II, that was a fashion that a lot of people had. And being . that Hitler had it, he kind of killed that fashion.' Proof? Hitler's preference for a longer moustache is evidence that this photograph appearing to show him cheering the outbreak of war in 1914 was faked . Hitler's preference for a longer moustache at the outbreak of the First World War was recently used by historians to suggest that a famous photograph of him apparently celebrating Germany's declaration of war on August 2, 1914 in Munich was a fake. The picture, which first appeared in the pages of the Nazi . propaganda publication German Illustrated Observer on March 12, 1932, . the year Hitler ran for president,  appeared to show a 25-year-old Hitler cheering, and he later claimed it was at that moment that he found his purpose in life. It was captioned: ‘Adolf Hitler, the German patriot, is seen in the middle of the crowd. He stands with blazing eyes – Adolf Hitler.’ However, it has been claimed the photograph was faked by Hitler and his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, as the original negative of the picture was never found, and he can not be seen in newsreel footage of the event. Ridicule: Hitler's moustache was one of his most identifiable, but also his most ridiculed features - as demonstrated by comedian John Cleese in Fawlty Towers . Satire: Charlie Chaplin was another adopter of the toothbrush moustache, and used this similarity to Hitler to his advantage when parodying him in 1940 film The Great Dictator (pictured) Mr David said he had initially struggled to find an actor to play Hitler in the series, which has been Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Writing . for Nonfiction, Outstanding Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming, . and Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series. He then cast actor Maximilian Klas as the young Hiter, and Hugh Scully, who had a small role in another History Channel series The Men Who Built America, as the older version of the dictator. He said: 'The hardest part to find was Hitler. We did a lot of casting, I remember our casting notice was picked up online at one point and a lot of sites were saying, “It's finally good to look like Hitler!”' Although popular between the wars, when it was sported by comedians Charlie Chaplin and Oliver Hardy, the toothbrush moustache fell out of favour after the Second World War due to its strong association with Hitler.","Adolf Hitler had favoured a longer handlebar moustache with twisted ends .

"The United State's Central Intelligence Agency has recently come under fire for harrowing torture practices following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But one of the prisoners accused of accused of planning and carrying out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks says he 'does not hold any grudges' against his torturers. On Friday, lawyers of Ammar al Baluchi issued a statement in response to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's controversial 500-page report on the CIA's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as 'deeply flawed,' ABC reports. James Connell, al Baluchi's lead attorney, said the prisoner 'holds no grudge against the CIA for his torture, and saw the suffering of those who torture,' according to Courthouse News Service. No Grudge: On Friday, lawyers of Ammar al Baluchi (photographed) issued a statement in response to the recently released CIA 'torture' report saying the prisoner 'holds no grudge against the CIA for his torture' Deeply Flawed: Earlier this month, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a controversial 500-page report on the CIA's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as 'deeply flawed,' However, Connell isn't buying his client's statements. Connell said, in the statement, that the CIA is using al Baluchi to 'retroactively justify' its torture program, according to ABC. 'The CIA and its defenders are using Mr. al Baluchi as a scapegoat for its illegal and reprehensible use of torture,' Connell said. 'The United States spent incredible amounts of money, energy, and American credibility, and now the CIA is pointing at Mr. al Baluchi to justify its massive torture infrastructure.' Justice: Photographed is Camp Justice at the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which is home to more than 100 prisoners being held without trial on suspicion of terrorism. Prisoners: The CIA torture report has revealed that Al Qaeda suspects were kept awake in 'stress positions' for 180 hours, waterboarded until they started vomiting and became unconscious, and one died of hypothermia chained naked to a floor . Al Baluchi is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed 9/11 mastermind. Al Baluchi is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, charged with war crimes, and is to be tried for his alleged role in planning and carrying out the 9/11 attacks. Al Baluchi was arrested in 2003 and the CIA admitted to subjecting the prisoner to beatings and freezing baths. However, Courthouse reports that Connell found it strange that the 'torture report' gave so little information about al Baluchi's experience but gave so much about that of others in custody. The report states that at least five detainees were subjected to 'rectal feeding' or 'rectal hydration' in torture techniques 'far more brutal' than previously revealed, according to ABC. CIA: A United Nations special investigator demanded those responsible for 'systematic crimes' be brought to justice . Waterboard: The report details instances of detainees being waterboarded and subjected to 'rectal feeding' or 'rectal hydration' (photographed is a demonstration by the group 'World Can Wait' in New York in 2008 where thy held a mock waterboarding torture of a prisoner) The report allegedly details what interrogators did to many detainees, but provides very little information on the treatment of al Baluchi. CIA officials have said that al Baluchi has provided them with valuable information and defenders of the 'torture program' said that al Baluchi's confessions gave information which led to the disruption of terror attack planned in Pakistan. Defenders also say that al Baluchi's torture led the prisoner to giving them information that led to the capture of Osama bin Laden. However, the report allegedly concluded that the information had already been obtained, prior to al Baluchi's torture, and had nothing to do with the prisoner's confessions. The report doesn't urge prosecution for wrongdoing or criminal probes, but a United Nations special investigator demanded that those responsible 'systematic crimes' be brought to justice.","Lawyers of Ammar al Baluchi, an alleged 9/11 conspirator,  say the prisoner 'holds no grudge against the CIA for his torture, and saw the suffering of those who torture'

"Doctors say a University of Virginia student who drank a quart of soy sauce on a dare is the first person known to have deliberately overdosed on salt and lived with no lasting brain damage. John Paul Boldrick was 19 when he drank the soy sauce as part of an initiation to join the Zeta Psi fraternity house in February 2011. He ended up in a coma but survived with no lasting neurological problems, according to LiveScience. A new case report in the Journal of Emergency Medicine details how Boldrick, after consuming such a high amount of salt, survived hypernatremia, a condition that arises when there is too much salt in the blood. Sauced: A University of Virginia student who drank a quart of soy sauce on a dare is the first to have survived a sodium overdose without lasting neurological damage . Hypernatremia causes the brain to lose water, according to LiveScience. When there’s too much salt in the blood, the body tries to equalize the salt concentration and water moves out of body tissue and into blood. The brain shrinks as a result. When Boldrick drank the soy sauce, he began seizing and foaming at the mouth, according to the case report. Brothers at Zeta Psi brought him to an emergency room and he was given anti-seizing medication. Boldrick was already in a coma when he was taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center. ‘He didn't respond to any of the stimuli that we gave him,’ Dr David J Carlberg, who was working at the center when Boldrick was brought in four hours after consuming the soy sauce, told LiveScience. ‘He had some clonus, which is just elevated reflexes. It's a sign that basically the nervous system wasn't working very well.’ LiveScience reports the hospital flushed out the salt in Boldrick’s system using sugar water dextrose administered through a nasal tube. Within a half hour, 6 liters of sugar water were pumped into Boldrick’s body. After five hours, his sodium levels returned to normal. Boldrick was in a coma for three days, but woke up on his own. After a month, doctors said Boldrick seemed fine—back at school and doing well on his exams. Overdose: Dr David J Carlberg, left, who treated John Paul Boldrick after he drank a quart of soy sauce, said Boldrick survived without brain damage because 'we were more aggressive' Dr Carlberg told LiveScience he believes the young man survived without brain injury because the hospital was able to reduce his sodium levels so quickly. 'We were more aggressive than had been reported before in terms of bringing his sodium back down to a safer range,' said Carlberg. Most people with hypernatremia have psychiatric conditions as well, Dr Carlberg told LiveScience. Usually, such sodium overdose happens gradually. LiveScience reports that doctors in the 60s and 70s used to accidentally cause hypernatremia when they gave salt to poisoned patients, causing them to vomit. The case report also notes salt overdose was a common method for suicide in ancient China.","University of Virginia student John Paul Boldrick was dared to drink a bottle of soy sauce while pledging Zeta Psi .

"CLICK HERE to read Patrick Collins' full match report from the Emirates . Arsenal may be struggling to piece a defence together from their injury ravaged squad but Arsene Wenger has no such problems at the opposite end of the pitch. The Gunners' 4-1 victory over Newcastle was only the second time this season that the manager has been able to play his three main attackers - Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck - together from the first whistle. And, with Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield, it appeared Wenger had settled for an all-out offensive gameplan to counter his deficiencies at the back - where Mathieu Debuchy was drafted in to central defence. Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring a brace in Arsenal's 4-1 defeat of Newcastle . Danny Welbeck was unfortunate not to get on the scoresheet with a volley from Alexis Sanchez's pass . Sanchez (left) turned provider after setting up two of the goals in another victory over the Magpies . Attacking statistics for Sanchez (left), Giroud (centre) and Welbeck from our brilliant Match Zone . The front three in a 4-3-3 formation lined up with Giroud returning to his typical centre-forward role supported by the pace of Sanchez on his favoured right and a case of deja vu for Welbeck shunted out on the left. The strategy was extremely effective in the first half at the Emirates with Arsenal dominating possession and early proceedings while Alan Pardew's side struggled to escape their own half. After probing with their typical brand of pass and move football, two of Arsenal's front three combined for the opening goal. Teenager Hector Bellerin won back possession in the middle of the field before feeding Giroud who spread play out wide to Sanchez. The pass may have been heavier than the Chilean had wanted but Sanchez managed to put in a superb return cross for the Frenchman to power home with a towering header in between two defenders to make it 1-0 to the Arsenal.

Giroud's heat map shows how he dominated Arsenal's attack from central positions . Welbeck was unfortunate not to double the lead only minutes later after racing into the area and digging out a lofted shot only for the goal to be ruled out for a nudge on Toon defender Daryl Janmaat. The England international came close again in the first half when some neat interchanging passes on the edge of the area led to Sanchez playing a scooped pass over the top of the defence, which Welbeck met with a volley but skewed his effort wide. Sanchez's role as a creator reaped rewards again after the interval when, with Arsenal still dictating play, the fleet footed winger cut in from the left and squared for Cazorla who dinked the ball over Fabrizio Coloccini and stayed on his feet to double Arsenal's lead. Sanchez embraces Cazorla after providing an assist for the Spaniard to score Arsenal's second . Giroud completed his brace with the outside of his boot before being substituted to a standing ovation .

Giroud scored his first goal through power but relied on touch for his second . Welbeck and Sanchez race to celebrate Giroud's second goal at the Emirates . Giroud netted his second only four minutes late following a rapid counter attack on the opposite flank where Oxlade-Chamberlain found Bellerin and the 19-year-old drilled in a low cross for the striker to finish exquisitely with the outside of his boot. Arsenal's defensive frailities were exposed when Ayoze Perez brought one back for Newcastle after prodding home a Jack Colback free-kick in a crowded penalty area. Still striving for full fitness, Giroud was replaced by Lukas Podolski to standing ovation on 73minutes. Sanchez could not extend his recent hot scoring streak but played an influential part in Arsenal's attack . Sanchez was most prevalent down the right hand flank in Arsenal's 4-3-3 formation .

Without him Sanchez and Welbeck almost got on the scoresheet from a breakaway move in the second-half, although the former Manchester United forward's touch from his team-mate's pass denied him a one-on-one opportunity. Welbeck should be credited with an assist after being hauled down by Paul Dummett in the closing minutes to allow Arsenal to complete the rout courtesy of a cheeky 'paneka penalty from Cazorla. It was Arsenal's fourth shot on target and they scored from each of them.

"Manchester City could face Christmas without any senior strikers and their captain following a costly 1-0 victory at Leicester. Forward Edin Dzeko suffered a calf injury in the warm-up at the King Power Stadium and skipper Vincent Kompany suffered a recurrence of a hamstring problem 77 minutes into his comeback. Dzeko joins fellow strikers Sergio Aguero and Stevan Jovetic on the sidelines and there is little chance of any of them being fit in the next fortnight. Kompany might also be out of action until the new year. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany feels his leg before  being substituted on Saturday . The Belgium defender returned to the squad after missing three matches because of a hamstring problem . Kompany down injured in what could be a serious blow to Manchester City's title chances . Manager Manuel Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult immediately after the game to know what happened to both of them. 'Vincent Kompany has the same problem in his hamstring he had a few weeks ago, that is one of the reasons he didn't play on Wednesday in Rome. 'Edin Dzeko felt a muscle injury in his calf. Maybe he will also be a couple of weeks out. I think it is impossible (for him to return) before the new year. 'We will see with Vincent how hard his injury is but I think it will be very difficult for them to play before the next year.' Dzeko had made only two appearances since returning from another calf injury while Jovetic, who was a substitute in Wednesday's Champions League win at Roma, has had niggly hamstring issues in recent weeks. Pellegrini said: 'Jovetic also has a problem in his hamstring after the game against Rome. It is not a very important injury but I think he will also need a couple of weeks.' Top scorer Aguero damaged knee ligaments in last weekend's victory over Everton and could be sidelined for up to eight weeks. Kompany applauds fans are he walks off injured during the Premier League match on Saturday . Kompany was forced off with an injury during the second half against Leicester . The problems forced Pellegrini to draft 18-year-old forward Jose Angel Pozo into his starting line-up at Leicester and the youngster could now get further chances. Pellegrini said: 'We will see with Jose Pozo. We have other young players in the squad Patrick Vieira manages. We will see also another way to play but we are not going to complain about injuries.' The injuries marred City's latest victory in their Barclays Premier League title defence, although their performance was far from a convincing one. Pellegrini's men looked lethargic after their Champions League exertions and only another goal from on-loan former England midfielder Frank Lampard separated the sides. Lampard has now scored six goals since joining the club on a short-term loan from sister outfit New York City and his latest display is likely to increase Pellegrini's desire to extend the deal beyond December. Pellegrini said: 'There have been no serious discussions, but we know exactly what we must do. 'Frank wants to stay, we want to keep him. Now we must resolve the problem with New York City and MLS. 'He is very important. One of the reasons why he played today was because he has scored for me. Frank has been very useful for us in this moment.'","Vincent Kompany went off after 77 minutes with an injury against Leicester .

"Hate crime: Island Nettles was beaten into a coma by a Facebook friend who only moments earlier realized she was born a man . The mother of a man accused of beating a transgender woman to death is said to have forced her son's friend to confess to the crime, according to police sources. The victim, 21-year-old Islan Nettles, died Thursday in a Harlem, New York, hospital after being taken off life support five days following the attack. Nettles was pronounced brain dead after being beaten on the street by one of her Facebook friends, 20-year-old Paris Wilson. Wilson's mother has now been accused of taking one of his friends to a police precinct, where she made him confess to the crime and claim he was too drunk to remember anything about it. A source told the New York Post: 'She brought this innocent kid in to the [32nd] Precinct and he confessed.' But the friend did not match witnesses' accounts of the killer's description, prompting police to dismiss his 'confession'. According to Nettles' family, the victim had two Facebook profiles - one using her birth name Vaughn Nettles and another 'female' profile. Wilson was friends with Nettles on her female profile. When she ran into Wilson near a police precinct on Eighth Avenue and 147th Street in Harlem, he started flirting with her. But his male friends were quick to inform him that Nettles was born a man. Angered at being embarrassed in front of his friends, Wilson started to beat up Nettles while his friends verbally harassed her. The attack happened at an intersection off of Eighth Avenue in Harlem near a police precinct. Hate crimes against the gay community in New York have seen a dramatic increase this year . 'He deserves to rot': Nettles' mother Delores says she hopes Wilson will spend the rest of his life in prison . Wilson, a rising senior at Buffalo . State University, wouldn't let up on Nettles, issuing blow after blow . even after she hit her head on the pavement. Nettles' friends informed cops, but Nettles was already unconscious by the time they arrived and broke up the fight. According to the criminal complaint, witnesses say Nettles was found passed out on the ground with a swollen shut eye and blood on her face. After the attack, Nettles was hospitalized, slipped into a coma and later died. The witness eventually told detectives about the anti-gay remarks- after initially leaving them out of the criminal report- and the hate crimes task force took over the investigation. Wilson was charged on a misdemeanor assault charge, but now that Nettles has died and her death ruled a homicide, he will likely face murder charges. He was released on $2,000 bail. Delores Nettles, the victim's mother, hopes that her daughter's killer will spend the rest of his life in jail. 'He deserves to rot because he took a life,' she told the New York Daily News. Now, she and the rest of the victim's family are planning for Islan's funeral. 'I accepted him no matter what because I loved him at the end of the day,' she said. 'My son was a beautiful woman.' Murdered: Nettles died at Harlem Hospital after being ruled brain dead and taken off life support. Her attacker will likely face murder charges now that her death has been ruled a homicide . The attack on Nettles was the latest in a spate of bias incidents this year in New York and a total of 68 have been reported so far this year, showing a significant increase from the 54 that were reported in all of last year. The bias attacks this year range from yelled slurs to the May killing of a 32-year-old gay man in Greenwich Village. Police stepped up patrols this summer in response. In May, police said Mark Carson, 32, was first taunted with homophobic slurs, then shot in the head in Greenwich Village, not far from the site of 1969 riots that helped give rise to the gay rights movement. A suspect was arrested on a charge of murder as a hate crime. The killing, and other bias attacks, sparked a summer protest attended by thousands. Some of the other bias incidents this summer included an assault last week where two men were attacked in Chelsea. Christine Quinn, the city's first openly gay City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate, denounced the most recent attack. 'An attack against one person, or one community, is an assault against all New Yorkers,' she said in a joint statement with other council members. 'We ask all New Yorkers to come together, to embrace our differences and to denounce hate violence.'","Islan Nettles was friends with Paris Wilson on Facebook .

"Current QPR first-team coach and former England manager Glenn Hoddle looks ahead to the crunch Premier League match between bitter rivals Manchester United and Liverpool. Third-placed United go into the game looking for their sixth consecutive win in the league, while the visitors will be hoping to turnaround their poor start to the season with victory at Old Trafford. In last season's corresponding fixture at the Theatre of Dreams, Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 victory. Sportsmail columnist Hoddle  expects the match to have a different outcome though this time around. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard scored two penalties in their 3-0 win at Manchester United last season . LIVERPOOL'S MISSING STRIKERS . Liverpool’s most glaring problem is their lack of goals. Hardly surprising when you lose both Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. This time last year Liverpool had already scored 30 Premier League goals. This season they have scored only 19. Of the 101 goals they scored last season, 53 came from those two and another 12 from Steven Gerrard. You have to have some sympathy for Brendan Rodgers. He might have expected to lose Suarez but could never have expected to cope for this part of the season without both of them. Last season I saw some games where they were scintillating. At other times they were average but Suarez got them the points. Liverpool have failed to replace Luis Suarez's goalscoring talent (right) after his summer move to Barcelona . After 15 games last season Liverpool had 30 points, eight more than United. Now United (28) are seven clear. Both sides have made 16 changes to their defences this season. United have used 11 players, Liverpool 9. LIVERPOOL’S TACTICAL PROBLEMS . Liverpool just can’t replicate the style they had last season. It’s not just that the strikers they signed, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli, haven’t fitted in and scored goals, they don’t offer the same qualities off the ball as Suarez and Sturridge. Last season, Liverpool came at teams in a frenzy of attacking football, especially at Anfield, and would often sweep them away in the first 20 minutes. It was this time last year when they started playing like that, with a 5-1 win against Norwich and a 4-1 win over West Ham, both at Anfield in December 2013 and then, on this weekend last year, a 5-0 win at Tottenham which made everyone sit up and take notice. This fixture last season at Old Trafford was a great example of their best form - a 3-0 win after they were 2-0 up very early in the second half. Suarez and Sturridge had energy and pace but Lambert and Balotelli are much more static. They don’t run into the same areas to stretch teams. Liverpool are not just missing the goals, the style of play that had been so effective isn’t working at the moment. Liverpool have had to adapt to a different style of play upfront with the summer signing of Rickie Lambert . LIVERPOOL’S STAGNANT MIDFIELD . Because of their lack of goals, Gerrard has been playing much further up the pitch. That means they’ve lost their best distributor of the ball from deep. Jordan Henderson, Lucas and Joe Allen haven’t been hitting the same heights this season either. They’re struggling with their distribution - they don’t have a quick enough picture in their minds of how the game is unfolding. Previously, they would have Gerrard supporting them and Sturridge and Suarez as well as Raheem Sterling giving them plenty of options. Reds duo Gerrard (left) and Jordan Henderson (centre left) have failed to reach last season's heights . MUDDLED UP DEFENDING . It's interesting that Liverpool had conceded 18 goals this time last year - this season it’s 19 - but neither side can get a settled defence. Liverpool have fielded the same back four on only three occasions this season and the last time they named an unchanged side was against Chelsea back in April. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has fielded the same back four on only three occasions this season . Incredibly, United haven’t named an unchanged side since November 2012. In defence they have switched between a back three and a back four and have only been able to go with the same personnel and formation on four occasions. Liverpool are still finding their way. New signing Dejan Lovren is struggling while Alberto Moreno isn’t picked every week. United are decimated by injuries, at various times losing Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Rafael, Jesse Lingaard and Paddy McNair. Luke Shaw is one of several  United defenders who will Sunday's match at home to Liverpool due to injury . UNITED’S VULNERABILITY . My specific concern is Ashley Young playing at left back or wing back. They got away with it at Southampton. When Shane Long got on the back post at 52 minutes on Monday, he should have made it 2-1 and that would have been a decisive moment. It was waiting to happen and had been clearly signposted. Young finds it very difficult to defend in those situations. Louis van Gaal has a problem on Sunday: does he stick with a back three, putting Michael Carrick in there and leaving himself vulnerable on the flanks? Young will probably be up against Sterling! I would prefer a back four with Rojo at left back but that would mean they have Evans and McNair at centre half, one of whom has only just come back from injury and the other who will be low on confidence after being taken off early against Southampton. Ashley Young (left) was unconvincing defensively in United's 2-1 Premier League win at Southampton . LUCKY MANAGERS . Graham Taylor once talked about how Napoleon had said he preferred lucky generals over clever ones. I think Van Gaal will realise that he’s been fortunate so far in his Premier League season to be in third place having played so poorly. But having got the team into that position he must now feel confident. He knows he has players coming back, he will have a stronger defence in the second half of the season and Manchester United are likely to get better. Despite a never-ending crippling injury list, United boss Louis van Gaal has guided his side to third in the table . THE VERDICT . Both sides are playing poorly and both are defensively weak. When the tactical systems aren’t working well, it tends to come down to the quality of the individuals, and that’s why I feel this game has come at the right time for United. If United beat Liverpool on Sunday it will be their sixth consecutive win in the Premier League this season . With Robin van Persie coming into form and Wayne Rooney on the pitch, they have more experienced players of quality than Liverpool. And they have the momentum of five consecutive wins, however, scratchy they were. Liverpool are in a trough, confidence is low. At Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon, it’s hard to see beyond a United win. Robin van Persie (right) scored both goals in United's 2-1 victory on the south coast on Monday night .

"Steve Bruce has led a furious backlash against Gary Cahill after the defender escaped punishment for a ‘Swan Lake’ dive in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Hull. The England defender was already carrying a yellow card after a bad foul on Sone Aluko and then, with the score at 1-0 to Chelsea, took an embarrassing 53rd-minute tumble as he passed between David Meyler and Tom Huddlestone in the Hull area. Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but he enraged Hull manager Bruce by opting against showing Cahill a second yellow. Gary Cahill goes through Hull's Sone Aluko in this challenge that landed him in referee Chris Foy's book . Hull boss Steve Bruce was furious Cahill was not sent off after taking a dive in the Hull penalty area . Curtis Davies remonstrates with referee Chris Foy after Cahill's apparent dive . Foy had already booked Willian for diving and later showed a yellow to Diego Costa for the same offence – leading Bruce to warn the Premier League that they need to clamp down on simulation. His calls were echoed by pundits Garth Crooks and John Hartson, who said: ‘Diving is like a cancer which is spreading through football.’ Bruce said: ‘I’ve just been asked if Cahill should have gone, and the simple answer is yes, especially given the referee has booked two people for simulation or diving. ‘Oscar, Eden Hazard or Willian are running at pace, so the smallest connection can bring them over. (But) this is England’s centre-half. He could have been a red card for his first challenge on Aluko. That was reckless and dangerous. ‘You expect the referee to do his job.’ Cahill could have been given a straight red card for the foul on  Aluko earlier in the game . Nikica Jelavic and and Tom Huddlestone protest to referee Chris Foy after only brandishing a yellow card . Bruce added: ‘Look at the replays and there’s no justification for it. He’s taken off thinking Meyler is going to challenge him, looking to win the penalty. ‘In Latin countries it’s applauded. But people enjoy the Premier League because of the honesty and integrity. We need to stop this simulation that has creeped in. That was not a hard decision. ‘When you see Hazard live, with his short centre of gravity, you can’t touch him. But today was Cahill. The referee was 10 yards away. Everybody in the ground saw it. ‘It’s like something out of Swan Lake. It’s that blatant, that obvious what he’s trying. And yet there’s some excuse they’ll find for it. Maybe we might not have been good enough to get something, but playing Chelsea with 10 men is a lot easier than playing against their 11.’ Felipe Luis writhes in pain and referee Foy brandishes a red card after a studs-up challenge from Huddlestone . Huddlestone walks off while John Terry checks on his team-mate, after Foy sends Hull midfielder off . Hull’s Tom Huddlestone was sent off for a disgraceful and dangerous foul on Filipe Luis shortly after Cahill’s reprieve, with Bruce convinced the ‘frustration’ of Foy’s earlier decision had pushed his midfielder to act so rashly. He added: ‘Tom Huddlestone, who is the most laidback person, is frustrated with the decisions and produced a horror challenge which deserves a red card.’ Jose Mourinho said: ‘I didn’t see it on television. (But) I don’t believe Cahill dived. And if you tell me I’m wrong because he did, then something happened. Or they blocked his run. Or they touched. Or he lost balance. But that big, honest guy, I don’t believe he dived in the opposition’s box.’ Referring to Willian, whose dive was far outside the box, Mourinho added: ‘Willian, if he wants to dive, doesn’t dive on the midfield line. He dives in the box.’ Sunderland's Adam Johnson was accused of diving to win a penalty against West Ham on Saturday . West Brom's Sebastien Pocognoli was booked for an outrageous dive against Aston Villa . Former Tottenham striker Crooks said: ‘Steve Bruce is right with everything he says. Chris Foy bottled it today - Gary Cahill should have gone. Referee Chris Foy bottled it. What else would you call it?’ Ex-England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said it was up to players to tackle the scourge of diving. He tweeted: 'Diving is getting silly. Players need to self police the game. The only way it will change. What is the point of the PFA if they can't get their players to have a code of conduct?' Former Liverpool and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy called for players to be punished retrospectively after claiming Sunderland's Adam Johnson dived to win a penalty against West Ham on Saturday, while West Brom defender Sebastien Pocognoli was booked for an outrageous dive against Aston Villa. Speaking on Match of the Day Murphy said: 'I still believe you can do it retrospectively if you have the right panel of people. You could have an ex-player, an ex-referee and an ex-manager who could then impose a ban. I tell you it would stop so quickly.'

"Leicester might have weathered the verbal storm last week but they had no answer here to the muscle of Toulon as the French giants took control of Pool 3. The cash-rich Top 14 side had let out their anger off the field at Welford Road last week, but yesterday they vented their rage where it matters. Their physical firepower proved too much for the Tigers, who must now set their sights on qualifying as one of the top runners-up. Leicester made too many mistakes and were blown away inside the opening quarter. The loss of influential lock Brad Thorn did not help, as Leigh Halfpenny exacted revenge for defeat in the reverse fixture with a clinical kicking display, aided by tries from Mathieu Bastareaud and Ali Williams. Toulon full back Leigh Halfpenny (left) is well tackled by Leicester scrum half Ben Youngs . ‘If you’re inaccurate against Toulon then you’re going to get punished,’ said Richard Cockerill, Leicester’s director of rugby. ‘We were second best and they deserved to win. They were better than us at the breakdown and they were better at the contact point. In big games, tiny moments or opportunities make a big difference. They’re a very big team and we struggled to break them down. Physically we got outdone. ‘There is only so much you can give physically when you’re working on a completely different salary scale to the opposition. They’ve got marquee players across the board, haven’t they? Halfpenny, Habana, Mermoz, Bastareaud… They’ve got a marquee player in every position. They’ve got Juan Smith and then Gorgodze comes off the bench. ‘You can’t be French and European champions when you’re a poor side.’ Powerful French centre Mathieu Bastareaud powers over for Toulon's second try at Stade Mayol . In this town in the South of France, they like to mix their rugby with a splash of drama, whether it’s the players being marched through a red sea of supporters outside the ground before kick-off, or threats to axe another star. Comic-book tycoon owner Mourad Boudjellal loves a good story and last week it was the Welford Road bust-ups involving Martin Castrogiovanni and Delon Armitage . Only Armitage kept his place in the team, shifting to the wing to accommodate the return of Halfpenny. The Wales full back’s role has been limited since his summer move — making just one line break all season but providing a solid defensive unit and taking over kicking duties from Jonny Wilkinson. The 25-year-old showed the composure of his predecessor in the opening exchanges. Springbok winger Bryan Habana proved a menace down the left and, following his fifth-minute penalty, Halfpenny converted Ali Williams’s close-range try to build a 10-0 lead in as many minutes. Blaine Scully (left) crosses in the corner for Leicester's sole try during the match . Leicester were caught cold, their play littered with inaccuracies and indiscipline, gifting their hosts two more kickable penalties. But in the 28th minute, fly-half Owen Williams powered through the Toulon defence with a piece of individual play that should catch the eye of Wales coach Warren Gatland. The ball was recycled by Ben Youngs and went through three pairs of hands to send Blaine Scully over in the right-hand corner. Leicester went into the break trailing 16-5, fortunate not to be behind by more. Halfpenny proved he is not quite at the marksman level of Wilkinson when he missed his first shot at goal after the break, before Armitage found himself on the receiving end of a wholehearted shoeing at the breakdown — though the travelling fans offered him little sympathy. Toulon flanker Juan Smith (left) competes in the air with Leicester lock Geoff Parling . Full back Mathew Tait showed great awareness to use referee George Clancy as an auxiliary blocker, before racing into Toulon territory, but Niki Goneva wasted the chance by cutting inside when he should have pinned his ears back and gone for the line. That proved to be a key moment as the hosts hit back at the other end, with French centre Bastareaud dashing in under the posts after fly-half Nicholas Sanchez was stopped just inches short. Williams then kicked his first and only penalty of the afternoon for the visitors, but the crowd booed them for being negative and not going for the try. The Tigers struggled to make inroads after that and Toulon comfortably kept them at arm’s length to see out the win although they may be frustrated at not securing a bonus point after dominating for long periods. Toulon and Springboks winger Bryan Habana (right) breaks the tackle of Leicester fly half Owen Williams . Leicester had their chances. Mathew Tait ran a perfect line off Leonardo Ghiraldini before the officials failed to award a potentially pivotal line-out after Halfpenny had carried the ball into touch five metres from his line. Cockerill was fuming in the coaches’ box and his anger was compounded when Toulon pulled away with a try under the Tigers’ posts as giant centre Bastareaud crossed. Williams responded with a penalty but Leicester had left themselves with too much to do. The introduction from the bench of Tom Croft was one positive as Irish referee George Clancy continued to frustrate Leicester with some questionable decisions. But ultimately the tourists had no answer to wave after wave of attacks on the Mediterranean coast.","Leigh Halfpenny kicks 13 points for Toulon .

"He has been crowned 'His Royal Cuteness' – and no wonder. In these new pictures, taken as Prince George prepares to celebrate his last Christmas as an only child, the 17-month-old looks more adorable than ever. Looking remarkably like his father William when he, too, was a toddler, George grins for the cameras, showing off the dimples he has inherited from his mother and more than a hint of his mischievous character. Scroll down for video . Prince George dressed in an adorable jumper in a picture taken at a courtyard in Kensington Palace last month . George is obviously enjoying himself - here he is captured flashing a cheeky grin during the photography session . Prince William recently revealed George loves to play with his parents' iPad. Here he is pictured grimacing at the camera . The charming series of photographs, taken in a courtyard at Kensington Palace at the end of last month, has just been released by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. They are the first official pictures of George since his first birthday in July. According to an aide, the pictures were taken by one of the couple's staff members, who happens to be a former professional photographer. George is dressed in a traditional white collared shirt and a navy woollen tank top featuring an appropriate guardsman design. The jumper is believed to be from Cath Kidston – and cost £20. The young Prince's outfit is completed by Rachel Riley blue shorts (£49) and his favourite navy Early Days shoes (£29). No doubt getting George to sit still would have taken some effort on the part of the mystery photographer, although he appears to be quite the performer in front of the lens. William and Kate, who are expecting their second baby in April, have both spoken of their son's energetic character and how he tears around Kensington Palace just like William used to do. The Duke has described his son as 'a little bit of a rascal'. The couple do not release an official Christmas card but have distributed the latest pictures, according to aides, to thank the media for allowing Prince George to grow up 'without intrusion'. The Cath Kidston tank top worn by Prince George had sold out before his official Christmas photographs were released - but may go on sale again. The blue sleeveless jumper, decorated with marching guardsmen complete with bearskins and red tunics, sold out about three weeks ago and is no longer available, a spokesman for the brand said. But it will 'possibly' be brought back following the release of the festive pictures. The Cath Kidston spokesman said last night: 'We'll see how the demand goes. It's something we can look into. We didn't know it (the tank top) had made the cut until this evening.' He indicated that there may be talks this week with the brand's production team about making the item available again. It does not currently appear on the brand's website but two other tank tops for boys - one featuring the image of a police car and the other featuring the image of a dog - are discounted and are both priced at £18, having originally been £28 and £32 respectively. Earlier this year, George's great-grandmother the Queen met designer Cath Kidston, famous for her floral prints, during a tour of the Terminal 2 building at Heathrow. Kidston has received an MBE for creating a thriving worldwide business and helping to kick-start the trend for vintage chic. The business, which was founded in 1993, has 160 stores including a flagship store next to the Ritz hotel in central London. He may only be 16 months old but George has become a fashion trendsetter with the 'George effect' ensuring his outfits sell out in record time. Within days of being born, the term was coined after the swaddling blanket he wore in his car seat as he left hospital became a hit. Sales of the printed white aden + anais cloth rose by 600 per cent in the week that followed. In May, George topped a poll to be named most stylish child, winning 23 per cent of the vote. The prince is following in his mother's footsteps. The Duchess of Cambridge's impact on fashion was dubbed the 'Kate effect' for boosting sales of the clothes she has worn. George appeared in red striped dungarees - the £39.99 Stripes Short Overall by Spanish children's wear label Neck & Neck - to watch the Duke of Cambridge play polo at Cirencester Park Polo Club in Gloucestershire on Father's Day. They sold out within 24 hours. The dungarees he wore to a New Zealand play date for his first official engagement proved equally sought after. The £75 classic tailored dungarees with a sail boat smocked design on the front panel were by Rachel Riley, a British luxury children's brand based in Marylebone. Riley said the royal endorsement was like hitting the jackpot for her business. During his overseas tour to New Zealand and Australia, the prince wore a white smocked romper with Peter Pan collar and sail boat decoration by Les Petites Abeilles - strikingly similar to the traditional romper suit William was seen in as a toddler in the Eighties. A furry kangaroo backpack William was seen carrying for his son while in Sydney also sold out soon after.

Here he is pictured at a zoo in Sydney (left) and as he travelled through New Zealand's Wellington Airport (right) in April . Prince George plays with a group of children during a parents group meeting at Government House, New Zealand . This year will be Prince George's final Christmas as an only child, with the Duchess having recently announced she is pregnant with her second child. Here Prince George is pictured at the Natural History Museum (left) in July and with his mother in Canberra, Australia (right) in April . Since his birth, the couple have sheltered their son from the limelight and have appealed to the media for privacy, which has been respected. The Duke and Duchess will be at Sandringham in Norfolk with the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional Christmas celebrations, before a planned 'second' Christmas with Kate's family at Anmer Hall, a couple of miles away. Sources say the couple are 'enormously excited' about Christmas while Kate's sister Pippa has apparently planned party games for Prince George. A spokesman for the couple said yesterday: 'They release pictures when it feels appropriate and to mark milestones in Prince George's life.' Doesn't that face - and that top - look familiar?

"There are precious occasions in a manager’s career when the football flows, the fans sing his name and the world is a wonderful place. The briefest glance at Arsene Wenger’s face told us that this had been such an evening. The cares and controversies of an arduous week had dissolved in a flood of goals. His team, skilfully constructed from a calamitous injury list, stylishly practised the football he preaches. And his mood was such that he even allowed himself a rare statement of his basic philosophy: ‘My job is to win football matches, and make people happy’, he said . Santi Cazorla scored twice as Arsenal defeated Newcastle 4-1 in the Premier League on Saturday evening .

And it was then that we sensed how much he had been hurt by the furore which followed those doltish insults on Stoke station last Saturday evening. Wenger does not reveal his private face so easily, he does not allow himself to appear vulnerable. But he actually deigned to speak of the Stoke incident: ‘99.9 per cent of the people in this country treat me with respect. I can take the other 0.1 per cent.’ He even spoke in vague reproach of the way he has been treated: ‘When you try to attack and you win, everyone says ‘‘well done’’. If you attack and don’t win, they say you are not realistic.’ Olivier Giroud (centre top) gave Arsenal the lead on 15 minutes with a towering header against Newcastle .

Arsenal striker Welbeck (centre) came close to doubling their lead but his shot went narrowly wide past the post . Cazorla (left) attempts to dribble past Newcastle midfielder Cheick Tiote during Saturday's Premier League match . He was in genuinely expansive form. But then, so were his team. Right from the start, Arsenal played enviably precise football at a dizzying pace. And with Newcastle total strangers to their recent impressive form, those who had doubted both Wenger and his team became swept up in the thrill of it all. The movement was bewildering, the imagination dazzling. In Santi Cazorla, greatly enjoying his 30th birthday, and the imperious Olivier Giroud, they had players capable of setting the tone, dictating the terms. Arsenal performed like a team brimming with breezy confidence, and when Per Mertesacker’s header struck the inside of the Newcastle crossbar after eight minutes, their football was denied the lead it deserved. Yet the opening goal was delayed only until the 15th minute and was the product of another sublime passing sequence, which culminated in Alexis Sanchez flighting a cross and Giroud towering above Daryl Janmaat for his emphatic scoring header. Arsenal appeared to have fashioned a second a few moments later, when Danny Welbeck scuffed a scoring shot beyond young Jak Alnwick. But Welbeck was deprived for an apparent clip on Janmaat, leaving Wenger to fret and fume for the only time. When Arsenal are in this mood, they can be almost unplayable. Yet they desperately sought a second goal to ease the nerves of their supporters, and it might have come most dramatically in 32 minutes when Sanchez hoisted an exquisite sand-iron of a chip into the six-yard box and Welbeck allowed it to fall over his shoulder before meeting it with a volley. It passed a foot beyond the far post, and it might have been one of the goals of the season. But Arsenal demonstrated why they needed the insulation of further goals, when a free-kick dropped inside their own box and Papiss Cisse hit Wojciech Szczesny from a handful of yards.

Newcastle were finally discovering their game, and the entertainment was totally absorbing. Despite having been largely outplayed, Newcastle were still in the match. And their mood early in the second half added to the home misgivings. But the Arsenal goal on 54 minutes was both brilliant and soothing. Sanchez, taking up all the difficult, uncomfortable positions, touched a short pass inside the area. Cazorla, with a small miracle of balance and technique, looked up, found his feet, and chipped the chance into the wall of the net. Four minutes later, it seemed over. Mathieu Flamini instigated the adventure with a probing ball from deep. A swarm of red-shirted attackers made themselves available, Hector Bellerin played a precise cross from the right, and the excellent Giroud appeared at the near post to devour the opportunity. But Arsenal always offer teams a chance, and this was no exception. On 63 minutes, Jack Colback struck a free-kick from the left and Ayoze Perez, quite unmolested, diverted the scoring header. Arsenal seemed destined to finish this one with nerves stretching. Then, with six minutes remaining, a section of the Arsenal fans burst into a chant of ‘There’s Only One Arsene Wenger’. It was clearly aimed at those who have been attacking the old chap of late, and the demonstration of loyalty produced one final flourish. Welbeck accelerated once more into the Newcastle area, and a bumping of bodies with defender Paul Dummett produced the inevitable penalty. Cazorla sauntered up and chipped nervelessly, Wenger gave a small, approving nod and Arsenal were handsomely home. Asked about the possibilities in tomorrow’s Champions League draw, he replied: ‘Maybe I will go to church at the weekend.’ At the end of such a week, a few words of thanks to the Almighty might not go amiss.

"You had to be impressed by Manchester City’s performance at Roma on Wednesday night. Their intent was clear from the start and they finally began to look like a team with authority in Europe. I’ve questioned why they persist with two up front in European games.

It was just what was needed for that game. Edin Dzeko (left) started up front on his own in Manchester City's 2-0 Champions League win at Roma . Samir Nasri was outstanding. Sometimes he doesn’t dominate games but with Aguero and Yaya Toure not playing and David Silva not starting, he rose to the challenge. Maybe he feels a little bit in the shadow of those players but he played like a leader. It was a wonderful performance and Manuel Pellegrini must be delighted.

Last year’s beaten finalists have struggled to hit the heights of last season – when they finished second both in Europe and domestically – and another display which lacked cohesion for large parts did not provide enormous encouragement that a corner has been turned. But they are still in the hunt, and that is what counts. A fireworks display lights up Allianz Park before Saracens and Sale arrive on the pitch . Saracens full back Alex Goode crashes over in the corner for his side's opening try . England and Saracens fly half Owen Farrell kicked 13 points at Allianz Park . No 8 Billy Vunipola, so disappointing for England during the autumn, won the man-of-the-match award with one of his best performances of the season while the second half was at least better than the first. But the home side’s failure to secure a bonus-point for the second week running left director of rugby Mark McCall deeply frustrated. Victory at home to Munster and away at Clermont in the New Year remains the only sure way for Saracens to qualify from this pool. It is not an easy ask. ‘I thought we were patchy today,’ McCall said. ‘In the first half we didn’t get into scoring positions often enough and missed some golden opportunities. ‘We gave away three or four really bad penalties and spent too long defending. I thought Billy got better and better as the game went on but we may live to regret not securing a bonus point.’ Saracens number eight Billy Vunipola (centre) was a handful for Sale Sharks defence all night . The win moves the Londoners to the top of Pool One but, with Clermont and Munster playing on Sunday, that position will almost certainly be relinquished when the final whistle blows at the Parc des Sports Marcel Michelin. Saracens woes were summed up by the torrid afternoon suffered by former England winger David Strettle, who dropped the simplest of passes after seven minutes with the line at his mercy. Far more seriously for the 31-year-old, who has enjoyed an excellent season for Saracens, he then suffered a nasty clash of heads 13 minutes later and was removed for a Head Injury Assessment. Sale Sharks substitute Joe Ford tries to get an offload away after he is tackled by Chris Wyles . He did not return following several minutes of on-field treatment. Owen Farrell, starting at fly half for Saracens, kicked two first-half penalties against a Sale side showing eight changes – including regular fly half Danny Cipriani being omitted from the squad – after defeat last week ended their interest in the tournament. Cipriani remains in contract talks with the Manchester-based side, with sources close to him suggesting a one-year contract extension is likely. Sale lost Henry Thomas, James Gaskell and Rob Miller last season but Diamond is confident of securing Cipriani’s services. Sarries and Scotland flanker Kelly Brown makes a strong run at the Sharks defence . ‘I’m very hopeful of Danny staying in Manchester,’ Diamond said. ‘Neither of us have been in a great rush. We know where we both stand with it. We will be showing a bit of ambition in the transfer market next year. We’re hopeful Danny will stay.’ Nathan Hines and Eifion Lewis Roberts scored the visitors tries, while Saracens crossed through Ben Ransom, Alex Goode and the impressive Vunipola. But no amount of fireworks could light up the latest disappointing performance for Saracens.","Alex Goode, Ben Ransom and Billy Vunipola cross for home side .

"Arsene Wenger was at last able to relax and savour an emphatic winning performance — and his name rang around the Emirates Stadium. Only a week after Wenger was verbally abused by a group of Arsenal supporters at a train station on the way home from a defeat at Stoke, this emphatic win against Newcastle had fans singing in support of the manager. Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla scored two goals each as they overwhelmed Alan Pardew’s team, for whom Ayoze Perez scored a consolation. Olivier Giroud rose above Daryl Janmaat to head Arsenal in front against Newcastle at the Emirates . Arsenal fans showed their support for Arsene Wenger by chanting 'There's Only One Arsene Wenger' Giroud scored his second with a neat flick at the near post that rifled past Alnwick into the top corner . The 28-year-old (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates as they celebrate his second strike . Giroud said: ‘I did not want to talk a lot about the situation (fans criticising Wenger) because it is always the same when you’re losing; the man to be criticised is the boss. It’s part of the job and we have to deal with that. ‘We’ll always be together, keep the faith, keep working hard and I think there’s no thoughts about changing the boss as he’s still the man for the situation. It’s nice to hear the fans supporting him and it’s a fantastic night for us.’ Three points eased the Gunners, who lie sixth, closer to the Champions League places, but it was the nature of the performance which will have delighted Wenger. Santi Cazorla also scored twice during the 4-1 win, the first a smart finish past Alnwick after some brilliant play . Giroud wheels away in celebration at giving the Gunners the lead in their Premier League encounter . He said: ‘The most important thing is that our fans go home happy because we won. I have worked in this country for 18 years and I am grateful for that, but 99.9 per cent will still have respect, even when they are not happy, so I can live with the 0.1 per cent. ‘You want the fans to be happy and when we lose and they are not happy, I completely understand.’ His side, still beset by injuries, were positive and fluent in attack and scored some wonderful goals, starting with a header from Giroud after 15 minutes. Arsenal had not scored in the first half of their previous six Premier League games but they set off like a team with a point to prove. Per Mertesacker glanced a header against the bar before Giroud opened the scoring with a fine header from an Alexis Sanchez cross. France international Giroud said after the game that Arsene Wenger is still the right man for Arsenal . Cazorla completed the win from the penalty spot as the Spain international chipped the ball down the middle . Wenger’s team thought they had the second within a minute but Danny Welbeck’s goal was ruled out by referee Lee Mason, who decided the scorer had fouled Daryl Janmaat as he jinked into the penalty area from the left. Newcastle’s Cheick Tiote was fortunate not to be sent off after only five minutes. Tiote followed through with a waist-high challenge on Sanchez and sank his studs into the Chilean’s midriff. Cazorla scored the second soon after the restart with a deft chip from a tight angle to deceive Newcastle’s 21-year-old goalkeeper Jak Alnwick. Giroud appeared at the near-post to flick in the third, before Perez scored with a diving header. Cazorla chipped in Arsenal’s fourth from the penalty spot.","Arsenal beat Newcastle 4-1 at the Emirates on Saturday evening .

"New emails released Saturday in the Sony hack find Amy Pascal and another high-ranking executive inside the company blasting some major Hollywood players. Pascal and producer Mark Gordon trash Leonardo DiCaprio after the actor decided not to star in their Steve Jobs biopic Jobs in one email,  while another executive, Tom Rothman, blasts Jaden and Willow Smith for an interview the youngsters did with the New York Times. In the exchange Pascal is sent a link by Tom Rothman, an executive at Tri-Star Productions, to a piece in which the Smith children claim they can control time and discuss 'Prana energy'. Scroll down for video . Attacking kids: Another executive trashed Jaden and Willow Smith (above) in an email to Pascal after a New York Times interview the two did . The two add that they find nothing of worth in all the music and fiction produced by other people, so write their own albums and novels for entertainment. Poking fun at the surreal article, Rothman emails Pascal saying:  '1. Read this. 2. they r home schooled: don’t let this family date your movies!!!' In on portion of the piece, Jaden Smith, then 16, said: 'Honestly, we’re just trying to make music that we think is cool. We don’t think a lot of the music out there is that cool. So we make our own music. 'We don’t have any song that we like to listen to on the P.C.H. by any other artist, you know?' Willow adds: 'That’s what I do with novels. There’re no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it’s the best thing.' Rothman's comments came despite the fact that Jaden Smith has starred in three Sony blockbuster films : The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Karate Kid and After Earth. There is a little bit of a silver lining to the new leak though, as one exchange reveals that one of the hottest, and handsomest, actors in Hollywood is a big fan of Pascal - Ryan Gosling. Trashed: Amy Pascal labeled Leonardo DiCaprio (above) 'despicable' after he dropped out of the studio's Steve Jobs biopic . These new email exchanges were released by The Daily Beast, and all involve Pascal. Like many of the emails, the first exchange deal with the frequently problematic Jobs picture the studio is working on, and the moment DiCaprio decided to pull out of the film. Pascal tells the film's producer, Gordon, that the actor just changed his mind about doing the picture, to which Gordon responds 'Horrible behavior.' Pascal takes it a step further however, writing back 'Actually despicable.' Former friends: Tom Rothman (left) was the executive who mocked Jaden Smith, who he posed with at the The Day the Earth Stood Still premiere . Fun friend: The emails also revealed that Ryan Gosling (above) is a big fan of Pascal . Making it all a little better though are the gushing emails about Gosling's affection for Pascal. Gosling's talent manager, Ilene Feldman, writes to Pascal after she met with her client: 'Ryan absolutely loved you. Said it was like speed dating because he was late after hitting every wrong gate on the lot.' She then adds: 'Not it should turn to marriage. He really wants to do something with you.' What's more it seems that the movie Gosling is interested in doing is the Ghostbusters remake at the studio. Hannah Minghella, the co-president of production at Columbia, writes in an email to Pascal after learning this: 'There is one make [male] part paul is planning. How insane would that be… He also wants jennifer [Lawrence] and Emma [Stone].' Very insane indeed.","In new emails released from the hacking of Sony, Amy Pascal calls Leonardo DiCaprio  'despicable' after he passes on her Steve Jobs film .

"It has not been the best of weeks for Angelina Jolie. First she was accused of being ‘a minimally talented spoiled brat’ in a leaked email – and now it has been revealed the Oscar winner has contracted chickenpox. The 39-year-old star was covered in small red spots in a video released yesterday on the Universal Studios’ website in which she said she would miss the premiere of her new £70 million movie Unbroken in Los Angeles tomorrow. ‘I found out last night I have chickenpox,’ she said. ‘I will be home, itching, and missing everyone.’ Oscar wining actress Angelina Jolie has contracted chickenpox which will prevent her from attending the premiere of her new £70 million movie Unbroken in Los Angeles tomorrow .

"A father has hit out at a primary school after teachers allowed his four-year-old daughter to get in a cab with a complete stranger after class. Malia Melon's family spent two hours searching for her after she was ushered into the private taxi which was waiting outside PS 78 in the Bronx, New York, for another child with a similar name: Melina. Her father Fitzroy Melon was first told his little girl had got on a bus, then that she had walked home, before she was returned to the front gates, he claims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Outraged: Fitzroy Melon pictured with his daughter Malia, who was ushered into a cab meant for her classmate . Panic: Malia's family frantically searched for two hours while she was driven to the house of a girl called Melina . 'That could have been anybody. Any crazy person could just walk up and take someone. Thank God that's not the case.' he told NBC. The family frantically searched the surrounding streets for Malia, while the other child Melina was left standing on the sidewalk. It wasn't until the cab driver arrived at the home of the child he was supposed to pick up, that the school realised the mistake, according to CBS. The incident on Tuesday came after another parent claims their six-year-old was allowed to walk home alone. A spokesman for the school district said: 'This was the first day that the driver came to the school. 'When the driver picked up another student, the school contacted the driver, who brought the student back. Fear: The four-year-old rushed into her parents' arms when she returned to the school in the Bronx . Anger: Mr Melon is now looking to move Malia from PS 78 (pictured) to another school in the area . 'The matter is being looked into, and the safety of our students is always top priority.' Last week, a three-year-old girl in New Jersey was embroiled in a similar mix up after she was picked up from school by her classmate's grandmother. Two staff members at the pre-K school signed off on the toddler’s release and sent her home with the woman, who reportedly kissed and hugged Madison, according to The Paterson Press. It was not until the child arrived home that the mix-up became apparent and Madison Mills was promptly returned back to the school. But according to Gemar Mills, his three-year-old, who suffers from a peanut allergy, could have died in the time it took the other family to bring the child back.","Malia Melon, 4, was put in private cab waiting for her classmate Melina .

"Alastair Cook insisted he would be leading England at next year’s World Cup — despite falling for just one run as Sri Lanka clinched the one-day series in Pallekele. Cook’s latest failure with the bat was part of a dismal 90-run defeat for England, who now trail 4-2 in this seven-match series. He also dropped a crucial catch, putting down Kumar Sangakkara on 41. The Sri Lanka batsman went on to make a match-winning 112. Alastair Cook says his dropping of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a 'really costly drop' Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI . Cook, the England captain, said: ‘Days like these don’t make the job any easier. It’s tough, not scoring the runs I’d like. It’s not a great place to be as a captain. I’m a better player than I’m showing at the moment. I’ve just got to keep going.’ Cook, who averages 17 in this series and has made only one half-century in his last 21 one-day innings, was confirmed as World Cup captain a week ago and seems to be in no mood to relinquish the job. But when coach Peter Moores was asked by Sky Sports to confirm Cook’s captaincy, he said: ‘We review everything at the end of every series. We’ve always said that. ‘We make no bones that we’re passionate to try to get our best side to go out and win a World Cup. Cook needs runs but he’s also had some great times as an England player. He’s in a tough patch but that’s something he’s working hard to get out of.’ Sangakkara leaves the field in Kandy for the final time after spearheading Sri Lanka's 90-run ODI win . The keeper-batsman's team-mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series . Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run-a-ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one-day international on his home ground. It set up a 90-run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play. Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports: 'It didn't help, me dropping ""Sanga"" on 40 was a really costly drop . 'That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them. 'It was probably a 260 (run) wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that.' After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one . England coach Moores said: 'We felt we could draw the series level today but we've been outplayed in all departments. 'We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you've got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well. 'We made some errors and didn't field as well as we could have.' Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said: 'It was a challenging wicket to bat on but 'Sanga' was amazing once again. 'Together with (Tillakaratne) Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end. 'The older he (Sangakkara) gets, the more runs he scores.' Sangakkara himself added: 'It's great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling. 'I've had a wonderful career and it's extra special to finish off with a win.'","England captain Alastair Cook dropped Kumar Sangakkara on 41 .

Bad news: Danity Kane, consisting of (L-R) Dawn Richard, Aubrey O'Day and Shannon Bex, has disbanded after a recording session resulted in a catfight on Monday . TMZ reported earlier this week that band members Dawn, 31, and Aubrey, 30, got into a . fight, which resulted in Dawn punching Aubrey in the head.

"James Bond has seen off countless dastardly villains in his time – but he might have met his match in North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. For the leader of the communist regime is believed to be behind the leaking online of a working draft of the script for the next 007 film. And he is also thought to be responsible for the revelation of a number of embarrassing emails which show producers’ scathing criticisms of the £190 million production. Scroll down for video . A draft script for the next 007 film, featuring Daniel Craig and his co-stars Lea Seydoux, left, and Monica Bellucci, right, is believed to have been hacked by the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un . One of the leaked emails from a Hollywood executive criticising the movie and seeking more of a 'twist' In one withering leaked put-down, MGM film division president Jonathan Glickman says of the finale in the script: ‘You guys set me up for a let-down on the climax. So I was not surprised.’ (L to R) Andrew Scott, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, director Sam Mendes, Lea Seydoux, Craig, (middle) Monica Bellucci, Christoph Waltz, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista and Rory Kinnear . James Bond 'Spectre' film photocall, London . Craig and his co-star Miss Bellucci pose for pictures at the 'Spectre' film premiere in London . Complicated role: Newcomer Andrew Scott will also have a very pivotal and interesting roll in the new movie . The leak followed a cyber-attack on Sony Studios, which is making the film with MGM. Other emails put online by the attackers have already caused huge embarrassment in Hollywood. Filming of Spectre, the 24th movie in the James Bond series, began last week, with Daniel Craig returning as 007. He will star alongside Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux. Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz also stars, and is believed to be playing Ernst Blofeld, Bond’s iconic nemesis who is set to return decades after his last appearance. But while there’s huge anticipation surrounding the follow-up movie to Skyfall, behind the scenes studio executives have said the script is a huge disappointment, and have complained that writers have ‘wasted’ Blofeld’s return. In one withering put-down, MGM film division president Jonathan Glickman says of the finale in the script: ‘You guys set me up for a let-down on the climax. So I was not surprised.’ It has been revealed that Glickman is disappointed by the entire premise of the story, in which Bond battles Spectre after the evil organisation takes over a number of Western spy agencies. He writes of Spectre’s plan, as portrayed in the film: ‘They should need the combined resources of all the intelligence agencies to pull it off. Surely there is something more pressing than suppressing one document.’ Kim is believed to be behind the leaking online of a working draft of the script for the next 007 film and a number of embarrassing emails which show producers’ scathing criticisms of the £190 million production . The leaked notes also reveal dismay that the return of arch-villain Blofeld – famous for stroking his white cat – is being thrown away. Referring to scenes that seemingly fail to pass muster, one studio executive writes: ‘Also, there needs to be some kind of a twist rather than a series of watery chases with guns. This is Blofeld after all. What does he have up his sleeve?’ In another fierce barb, a producer says of the climax: ‘We need to cut 20 pages and this whole set-piece could go.’ Sony producer Elizabeth Cantillon responds to the script by writing ‘rough, rough, rough’ and complains of the end of the film: ‘Bond is simply fighting henchmen in many overblown and familiar sequences – helicopter, elevator shaft, netting.’ The leaked version of the script has Bond destroying part of Mexico City during a rogue operation and facing forced retirement as MI6 merges with MI5. Bellucci, who at 50 is the oldest Bond girl, plays the wife of a man Bond assassinates. Director Sam Mendes is likely to have been left in a fury by the leaking of the script, which has been worked on extensively by several writers, including Neal Purvis and Robert Wade – who authored Skyfall – and acclaimed British playwright Jez Butterworth. One Hollywood insider told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The script is still being worked on, even though filming has started. There has been a lot of concern that the script isn’t up to par. Very few people working on the film have seen a complete version because it’s simply not ready.’ Hollywood has been in uproar over the massive cyber-attack on Sony. Hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace said they infiltrated the company’s computers in retaliation for the release of the film The Interview, which will reach US cinemas over Christmas and Britain in February. Made by Sony and starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, the comedy features the assassination of Kim Jong-un, whose head is seen to ‘explode’. North Korea has denied being behind the leaks but called the hack ‘a righteous deed’. Spectre is scheduled to hit the big screens in November next year.","Follows an attack on Sony Studios which is making the film with MGM .

"The government and London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) agreed to allow West Ham to bank all of the revenues from executive boxes and corporate hospitality under the terms of the 99-year lease they were awarded to move into Olympic Stadium - at a cost of millions of pounds a year to the taxpayer. It has been confirmed that the government agreed to demands by the Hammers to retain 100 per cent of the corporate cash generated from 16 ‘super boxes’ and a wide range of executive packages. The key element of the deal was revealed by the European Commission (EC) to The Charlton Athletic Supporters' Trust. The Trust is also trying to force LLDC to reveal the exact details of the rental contract between the LLDC and West Ham, amid concerns the Hammers move may impact negatively on local clubs such as Charlton and Millwall.

The Olympic Stadium will also have double the number of VIP lounges of Upton Park, to enable the Hammers a substantial uplift on the £18million a year in revenues the club currently generates from match days. The EC has also confirmed that LLDC has agreed to reduce the estimated £2m a year rent West Ham will pay to use the 54,000-seat stadium if they are relegated to the Championship and that The Hammers won’t be required to pay £15m towards the stadium until they have completed the sale of Upton Park to London developer Galliard Group for an undisclosed amount.

"The mother of an eighth grade student has reacted angrily after her son got detention for sharing his lunch with a school friend. Sandy Bradford's son Kyle, 13, shared his chicken burrito with a friend at Weaverville Elementary School in California because he didn't like the cheese sandwich he was given by the cafeteria. But shortly after the teenager did the good deed he was given a detention slip by teachers who told him off for sharing his snack. Good deed: Kyle, 13, from California shared his chicken burrito with a friend who didn't like the cheese sandwich he was given by the cafeteria . Anger: Sandy Bradford, Kyle's mom reacted angrily after her son got detention for sharing his lunch . Discipline: The detention note explains 'Kyle came through the line and got a lunch then while at the table gave it to another student. Policy is no sharing food, which he is fully aware of' Bradford told KRCR-TV: ‘It seemed like he couldn't get a normal lunch so I just wanted to give mine to him because I wasn't really that hungry and it was just going to go in the garbage if I didn't eat it.’ However, the Trinity Alps Unified School District said it has regulations that prohibit students from sharing their meals. The detention note explains: 'Kyle came through the line and got a lunch then while at the table gave it to another student. Policy is no sharing food, which he is fully aware of.' According to the district, students can have allergies that another student may not be aware of and this is why they limit food swaps at lunchtime. Tom Barnett, the Superintendent of the Trinity Alps Unified School District said that they also enforced the rule for hygiene. He said: ‘We have a policy that prohibits students from exchanging meals. Of course if students are concerned about other students not having enough to eat we would definitely want to consider that, but because of safety and liability we cannot allow students to actually exchange meals.’ Rules: Tom Barnett, the Superintendent of the Trinity Alps Unified School District said that they also wanted the kids not to share to be hygienic . Weaverville Elementary: The school is sticking by its policy which prohibits students from exchanging meals . However, Kyle’s mother Sandy is standing by her son's decision. She thinks that he did the right thing by sharing his lunch. She told KRCR-TV: 'I feel very angry because he was doing the right thing and he was being kind and considerate and he was punished for it.'

"Arsene Wenger savoured another four-goal performance from Arsenal as his name rang around the Emirates Stadium and insisted the majority of fans are content with his work. His team have scored eight goals in two games since he was verbally abused by a group of Arsenal fans at a railway station on the way home from a defeat Stoke. Wenger's side beat Newcastle 4-1 on Saturday - a repeat of Tuesday's victory in the Champions League at Galatasaray - with Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla scoring two goals each. Olivier Giroud rose above Daryl Janmaat to head Arsenal in front against Newcastle at the Emirates . Giroud (far left) watches on as his header sails into the top corner of the Newcastle net . Arsenal fans showed their support for Arsene Wenger by chanting: 'There's Only One Arsene Wenger' Giroud scored his second with a neat flick at the near post that rifled past Alnwick into the top corner . The 28-year-old (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates as they celebrate his second strike . Ayoze Perez was on target for the visitors, who lost for only the second time in their last 11 games. The home crowd sang: 'There's Only One Arsene Wenger' and the three points closed the gap on the top four. 'My job is to win football games and make people happy,' said Wenger. 'What happened last week … I work for 18 years in this country and I am grateful that I have been accepted by 99.9 per cent with a big respect. 'I can take the 0.1 per cent and live with it but my job is to make people happy. If they are not happy, I have to live with it. 'On one side, we benefit because we have become extremely popular. On the other side, the negative is that everybody talks and has opinions and that is what is maybe more difficult to live with when it doesn't go well.' Giroud watches on as his strike nestles into the roof of the net to give Arsenal a 3-0 lead on 58 minutes . Santi Cazorla also scored twice during the  win, the first a smart finish past Alnwick after some brilliant play . Giroud wheels away in celebration at giving the Gunners the lead in their Premier League encounter .

Players Ratings  by Matt Barlow . Arsenal are caught between two distinct views among supporters: those who trust Wenger implicitly and back him wholeheartedly and those who are grateful for his 18 years of work but believe the time has come for him to move on. Defeat at Liverpool next week and the pendulum may swing back towards the anti-Wenger lobby, but when everything comes together on the pitch, as it did on Saturday, his team are still quick, creative and wonderful to watch. 'We try and it's always the same in football,' said Wenger. 'If you try to attack and you win, everybody says well done and when you don't win, everybody says you are not realistic enough. Our target is to keep our style but to defend well as well and that's what we did today.' Giroud was outstanding, opening the scoring after 15 minutes with a majestic header and flicking in Arsenal's third with the outside of his left boot. Cazorla produced a deft chip from a tight angle for the second. Yet, even with this three-goal cushion, there was a ripple of anxiety around the Emirates when Perez pounced with a diving header to make it 3-1, with 27 minutes remaining. Both Wenger and Newcastle manager Alan Pardew felt memories of the Champions League tie against Anderlecht, last month, when Arsenal surrendered a three-goal lead to draw 3-3, were haunting the stadium. France international Giroud said after the game that Arsene Wenger is still the right man for Arsenal . Cazorla completed the win from the penalty spot as the Spain international chipped the ball down the middle . 'You could see at some stage that we were a bit edgy, when we were 3-1, the crowd as well,' said the Arsenal boss. 'There was the ghost of Anderlecht here a little bit and we need a few more wins to completely lift the confidence. 'In the last six games, we won five. We can score goals, we showed that again and overall it was a dynamic game. Despite being depleted at the back we were quite solid and going forward we always looked dangerous. 'In the end we won in a convincing way. It was needed. The response was strong after the Stoke game. Let's go well over Christmas. ' Cazorla (right) hugs team-mate Alexis Sanchez who provided him the assist for his goal at the Emirates . Cazorla (centre right) is congratulated on his second strike of the match by his Arsenal team-mates . Cazorla settled the nerves in the 88th minute by clipping a Panenka-style penalty over the dive by Newcastle's rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick after Danny Welbeck had been fouled by Paul Dummett. 'Arsenal came out flying but we weren't as efficient with the ball as we've been,' said Pardew. 'They didn't give us time. They were quicker and faster. We grew into it a little bit and I still thought at 3-1 that the game was in the balance and the demons might return from Anderlecht if we could get another. 'We have great belief and we don't give up and we didn't give up, even though not playing our best.'","Arsenal beat Newcastle 4-1 in the Premier League on Saturday evening .

"Scroll down for video . A one-year-old baby died in Upstate New York on Tuesday after it ingested liquid nicotine, the chemical used in the popular e-cigarettes. The baby died at its home in Fort Plains on Tuesday and when it was found unresponsive it was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. ABC reports that police say the death was a 'tragic accident' and that no foul play was involved. Dangerous: Liquid nicotine that could have been  for an e-cigarette killed a one-year-old in Upstate New York who ingested the dangerous chemical . It's unclear as to whether or not the liquid was for an e-cigarette but officials expressed their concern about similar accidents happening to children of e-cigarette smokers in the future. 'One teaspoon of liquid nicotine could be lethal to a child, and smaller amounts can cause severe illness, often requiring trips to the emergency department,' the American Association of Poison Control centers in a statement yesterday. They also states that even though liquid nicotine is dangerous for children there are currently no child-proof packaging standards set in place. The American Association of Poison Control Centers made an announcement in November that the number of exposures to liquid nicotine is on the rise. By November 30 there had been 3,638 exposures to the dangerous chemical. That's more than double the 1,543 exposures reported in 2013. In 2011 just 271 exposures were counted. The child's death on Tuesday marks the first death related to the substance since 2012 when a man injected himself with the chemical. Dr.Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that even the smallest amount of nicotine can be dangerous for children. 'They’re not that difficult to get into,' Seger said of the vials that contain the nicotine. 'The issue is once the exposure occurs, it could be bad.' ABC spoke with Phil Daman, president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association who questioned whether or not the nicotine the child found was in fact the standard liquid used for e-cigarettes. Growing popularity: As the popularity of e-cigarettes increases so does the number of dangerous exposures to -liquid nicotine used in the cigarette . The liquids range in strength from low to high and the one consumed by the child could have been a higher dosage than normal. Daman also said he was, 'saddened to hear the terrible news.' '[We] want to always be mindful to put safe products on the market,' said Daman . He said companies should do their best to 'err on the side of caution.' Symptoms of nicotine exposure are vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation. Children may be more likely to consume the nicotine liquids that are flavored and made to look like candy. 'E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavors that are appealing to children,' said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden in April. As more and more children become exposed, legislators and companies are taking steps to ensure safety. The e-cigarette Vapor World, changed their packaging to make bottles child resistant. Governor Andrew Cuomo of is set to sign a bill in coming weeks that will require child-resistant caps on liquid nicotine bottles.","The baby died at its home in Fort Plains on Tuesday and when it was found unresponsive it was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead .

"A gadget that alerts speeding drivers when emergency vehicles are nearby was last night facing calls by police and motoring organisations to be banned. The £999 Target Blu Eye is a dashboard-mounted device which, astonishingly, is perfectly legal, according to its makers. It can detect when police cars – even unmarked vehicles – are more than half a mile away by picking up encoded radio signals, and then sends a warning to the motorist. When a 999 vehicle is within 1,200 yards, it sets off a green light on the display. As it gets nearer, the lights go to amber and finally they go red when it is just yards away. The device can even detect the radio signals from police officers on the beat and force helicopters. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Naeem Khokhar (pictured), of CBS Automotive, demonstrates how the device works . UK distributor CBS Automotive claims it will prevent accidents by alerting drivers to emergency vehicles rushing to incidents. But last night Gwent Police Crime Commissioner Ian Johnston called for them to be banned. He said: ‘This device is a passport to villainy and there is no legitimate reason for a law-abiding person to have one. The sellers are being very naive if they believe that they will be used to reduce accidents. ‘A criminal will carry out a drug deal, see a light on their dashboard and then ditch their illegal stash, only to pick it up when the police aren’t around – or a motorist will be speeding on the motorway, an alert will pop up and they’ll slow down.’ Devices that detect the position of speed cameras are legal for use on UK roads. Several years ago, legislation was proposed to make detectors with radar and laser illegal, but the ban did not go ahead. The Mail on Sunday took a red Vauxhall Corsa fitted with the device for a test drive on Friday with Naeem Khokhar, the managing director of CBS Automotive. The device’s aerial was concealed behind the car’s rear-view mirror while its control box was hidden in the glovebox. The LED alert panel was mounted next to the car’s controls. As we pulled out of the firm’s Cambridge headquarters, the device automatically started registering two lights out of five. Mr Khokhar said it was likely that it had been set off by the British Transport Police officers, who are stationed close to his office. As we drove along the street, the panel’s lights flashed again – this time the cause was a traffic warden. The Target Blue Eye (pictured) uses different coloured lights to warn of police cars' proximity . Its UK distributor claims it will prevent accidents by altering motorists to emergency vehicles rushing to the scene of accidents . The Target Blu Eye emits a beep when a vehicle is within range and a double-beep if the radio is transmitting data – meaning that emergency service personnel are talking over the radio. We parked near to ambulances at Addenbrooke’s Hospital and all five lights lit up. Mr Khokhar said: ‘There have been times when I’ve stopped at traffic lights and the Blu Eye starts going off but I can’t see any other vehicles. I have then driven off and seen a police car behind a bush.’ Mr Khokhar denied there was potential for the devices to be used for criminal activity. He said: ‘If anything, these devices are a criminal prevention tool. If you are planning to carry out a crime where there are emergency vehicles and the device is going off then you wouldn’t dare go through with it.’ But Steve Evans, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘We have grave concerns about any product that may be used to compromise police officers’ or public safety.’ AA spokesman Luke Bosdet added: ‘The only person who will have one of these fitted to their cars is the type of person who is trying to dodge the law.’","The dashboard-mounted Target Blu Eye picks up encoded radio signals .

"A soldier who returned home for the holidays to spend time with his wife and newborn baby has been told that he will have to stay elsewhere after the landlord said that he would be breaking the terms of his wife's lease. Sergeant William Bolt is stationed in Missouri, but his wife lives in Central, South Carolina with their newborn baby girl. However, the landlord of the apartment is forcing Sergeant Bolt to leave his wife's home because he would be overstaying the time allowed for visitors. Scroll down for video... Welcome home, now get out! Sergeant William Bolt who has returned home for the holidays to see his wife, Lily, and newborn baby in South Carolina is being kicked out of his wife’s apartment after the landlord said he cannot stay for more than a week . Difficult choice: Sergeant William Bolt is stationed in Missouri, but his wife, Lily,  has been in Central. She gave birth to their daughter two weeks ago . Rules are rules: The landlord at The Groves apartment complex in Central told him he had overstayed, saying visitors are not allowed to stay in the apartments past seven days, per the agreement signed by Bolt’s wife . An agreement signed by his wife Lily, stated that guests can only stay in the residence for up to a week - but no longer. 'I'm stationed in Missouri and we haven't seen each other in six months. What's the problem with me staying and visiting with my wife?' Sergeant Bolt said. The landlord, whose name is Chuck, told FOX Carolina he enforces the same rule for all his tenants. The problem occurs because Sergeant Bolt's name is not on the lease that his wife signed. The fact he is a visiting spouse makes absolutely no difference and the landlord has made it very clear that there will be consequences if she disobeys. Common sense: Lawyers say the landlord would have a hard time pressing charges, since the person visiting is the tenant’s husband . Sleep outside! SinceSeargent Bolt’s name is not on the lease, even though he is a spouse visiting, the landlord said he is not allowed to stay . The landlord has said that he has the power to press charges and even double his wife's rent if he stays in the apartment. 'He stated to me that he didn't care about our situation, he didn't care about me being in the military,' Sergeant Bolt said. Legal experts believe the landlord would have a hard time evicting Mrs Bolt, especially since it is her husband who would be staying and not some other guest that she could be earning something from.","Sergeant William Bolt is stationed in Missouri, but his wife lives in South Carolina with their newborn baby girl .

"The bombing mission targeting a German munitions factory had been a success, but Second World War pilot Charlie Brown's attempts to get home safely seemed doomed to failure. His B-17F bomber had been attacked by no fewer than 15 planes - leaving one of his crew dead and six wounded; 2nd Lt Brown himself had been knocked out and regained consciousness just in time to right his plane after it went into a dangerous nose dive. But as he tried to return from the raid on Bremen to the safety of Allied territory after the mission on December 20, 1943, the danger was not over. Brown soon had another major concern: a German plane was flying directly next to his own - so close that the pilot was looking him directly in the eyes and making big gestures with his hands that only scared Brown more. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mercy: Charlie Brown (left) was the lone pilot controlling an American bomber in 1943 when Franz Stigler (right) decided not to shoot at the bloodied soldier because he 'fought by the rules of humanity' Re-enactment: The German plane came purposefully close to the American plane . The moment was fleeting however, as . the German quickly saluted the American plane  - nicknamed in 'Ye Olde Pub'  - before peeling away as . soon as one of Brown's men went for the gun turret to attack their . enemy. The New York Post details Brown's . ensuing 40-year struggle to come to terms with why that German pilot . decided to go against orders and spare the Americans - allowing him to . fly and land his battered plane safely and go on to live a happy and . full life following the war. The pilot in question was Franz . Stigler, a 26-year-old ace who had 22 victories to his name - needing . just one more to be awarded the Knight's Cross. But on that day, as his Bf-109 closed in on . the US plane he sensed something was wrong - the enemy plane was not . engaging with him; in fact, unbeknown even to Brown, the plane had lost . it's tail-gun compartment and one wing was badly damaged. As Stigler drew closer he saw the . gunner covered in blood, and how part of the plane's outside had been . ripped off. And he saw the wounded, terrified US airmen inside, trying . to help one another tend to their injuries. It was then he remembered the words . of his commanding officer Lt Gustav Roedel. 'Honour is everything here,' he had told a young Stigler before his first mission. 'Special brothers': Brown (left) found Stigler (right) more than 40 years after the war after taking out a newspaper advert . The crew of the B-17F - nicknamed Ye Olde Pub - that took off on a cold, overcast winter day in Britain to target an FW-190 factory at Bremen, Germany. That mission on December 20, 1943, was 2nd Lt. Charles L. Brown's first combat mission as an aircraft commander with the 379th Bomb Group. Back Row (l-r)S/Sgt Bertrand O.Coulombe - Engineer/Top Turret Gunner; Sgt Alex Yelesanko - Left Waist; Sgt Richard A. Pechout - Radio Operator; Sgt Lloyd H. Jennings - Right Waist; S/Sgt Hugh S. Eckenrode - Tail Gunner; Sgt Samuel W. Blackford - Ball Turret2nd Lt Charles L. Brown - Pilot; 2nd Lt Spencer G. Luke - Co-Pilot; 2nd Lt Albert Sadok - Navigator; 2nd Lt Robert M. Andrews - Bombardier . The senior airman added: 'If I ever see or hear of you shooting at a man in a parachute, I will shoot you down myself. 'You follow the rules of war for you - not for your enemy. You fight by rules to keep your humanity.' His moral compass was more powerful than his need for glory. 'For me it would have been the same as shooting at a parachute, I just couldn't do it,' Stigler later said. He ended up escorting them for several miles out over the North Sea. But he feared that if he was seen . flying so close to the enemy without engaging, he could be accused - and . doubtless found guilty - of treason. And when he saw a German gun turret . looming into view he realised he had to make a decision. Meanwhile, the . US crew had begun to train a gun on him. Stigler made his decision, he saluted his counterpart, motioned for him to fly away from German territory and pulled away. Flying aces: A specially-commissioned painting to mark the moment Franz Stigler's humanity and compassion allowed Charlie Brown to steer his plane to safety . Honoring past moves: Brown and Stigler met with then-Florida governor Jeb Bush in 2001 . The bombers began their 10-minute bomb run at 27,300ft under heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns. Even before they had dropped their payload Brown's B-17 took hits that shattered the Plexiglas nose, knocked out the number two engine, damaged number four, and caused damage to the controls. These initial hits forced Brown to drop out of formation with his fellow bombers . Almost immediately, the solitary, struggling B-17 came under a series of attacks from 12 to 15 German Bf-109s and FW-190s. In the ten-minute assault the number three engine was hit and oxygen, hydraulic, and electrical systems were damaged. By tthe end of it, the planes controls were only partially responsive. The bomber's 11 defensive guns were reduced by the extreme cold to only the two top turret guns and one forward-firing nose gun. The tail gunner was killed and all but one of the crew in the rear incapacitated by wounds or exposure to the frigid air. Lieutenant Brown took a bullet fragment in his right shoulder. This was the state Stigler found the plane in, prompting his remarkable act of mercy. The stricken B-17 did make it across 250 miles of the North Sea and landed at Seething in Norfolk. As soon as he landed, Brown told his commanding officer about the spotting of the German soldier, but he was instructed not to tell anyone else for fear of spreading positive stories of the German enemy. In 1987, more than 40 years after the . incident, Brown - who was still traumatised by the events of that . fateful day - began searching for the man who saved his life even though . he had no idea whether his savior was alive, let alone where the man in . question was living. Brown bought an ad in a newsletter . catering to fighter pilots, saying only that he was searching for the . man 'who saved my life on Dec. 20, 1943.' Stigler saw the ad in his new . hometown of Vancouver, Canada - where he had moved after the war, unable . ever to feel at home in Germany - and the two men got in touch. 'It was like meeting a family member, like a brother you haven't seen for 40 years,' Brown said at the pair's first meeting. Stigler revealed how he had been . trying to escort them to safety and had pulled away when he feared he . had come under fire. He told Brown that his hand gestures where an . attempt to tell him to fly to Sweden. Their story, told in the book A Higher . Call, ended in 2008 when the two men died within six months of one . another, Stigler at age 92 and Brown 87. In their obituaries, each was mentioned as the other's 'special brother'.

"A six-year-old girl died after falling into a giant pot of boiling hot curry at school. Anusha Ashwathappa rushed out of class for lunch when the bell sounded. According to the school in Chikballapur, India, she was caught between hordes of other children running through the verandah. The government-run school near Bangalore is facing calls to explain how Anusha fell into boiling pot . When she got to the food, she was pushed and fell into the scalding sambar, it is claimed. Anusha suffered 70 per cent burns. When an ambulance did not arrive, the headmaster drove the little girl to the hospital, where she died hours later. The district education officer, Krishnappa, and three school cooks are being questioned over the case. Grieving father Gangappa Ashwathappa refused to hold a funeral until the case has been resolved. She was taken to a hospital in Bangalore where she was treated for 70 per cent burns but later died . He said: 'I won't cremate my daughter's body until school authorities, including the headmaster and three cooks, come here. 'I want to ask them what they were doing when the children were pushing each other.' The incident sparked outrage in the village of Gowribidanur Taluk, with calls for the staff to explain what happened. None of the teaching staff at Darinayakanapalya Government School near Bangalore turned up to work on Wednesday amid fears the children and parents would confront them, the district's education officer explained. Indian schools are facing calls to reform the where and how food is prepared after a series of scandals in recent months. In August at least 20 children in Bihar died after lunch . Police officers told local press they have ordered the school to give the mother and father jobs in compensation. Sambar is a spicy vegetable stew popular in southern India. It is served boiling hot and brewed in giant vessels. The case is the latest in a series of scandals surrounding the Mid-day Meal scheme in Indian schools. Designed to provide free hot meals to primary school children, reports have emerged of contaminated food, poor facilities and a lack of funding throughout the country. Teachers have called for reforms of the system and stricter controls on how and where the food can be prepared. Last month, at least 20 children died and 60 were hospitalised in Bihar after eating a 'poisoned' lunch provided by the school. A week earlier, 27 children in Rampur Bakhra fell ill from a curry in which authorities found a lizard. And a dead scorpion in a meal left 39 children in Orissa vomiting throughout the afternoon.","Anusha Ashwathappa, from near Bangalore, suffered 70 per cent burns .

"Scroll down for video . A prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown. The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm. The St. Louis County prosecutor has released more documents related to the investigation of the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer, including a transcript of a police interview with Dorian Johnson (pictured center, at Brown's funeral), the friend who was with Brown when he was killed . Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting. In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun. Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran. In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running. 'It definitely struck him in his back,' Johnson said, later adding: 'It caused him to stop.' Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28 (left), shot unarmed teen Michael Brown, 18, (right) dead on August 9 . Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied: 'If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin.' Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot. By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer. Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson. As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's 'hands kinda went up.' Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson. Scene: Wilson shot Brown seven or eight times, with the shooting sparking condemnation across the US over police violence, specifically against black men . Another said Brown threw up his hands and said something that sounded like, 'Don't kill me.' Among the documents released Saturday was a witness list, with all of the names of the witnesses whited out. It shows that 62 people testified before the grand jury between Aug. 20 and Nov. 21, including some who appeared multiple times. Some of the people interviewed by federal authorities did not testify before the grand jury. McCulloch apologized in a written statement for any confusion that may have occurred by failing to initially release all of the interview transcripts. He said he believes he has now released all of the grand jury evidence, except for photos of Brown's body and anything that could lead to witnesses being identified.","Dorian Johnson was with Michael Brown when he was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 .

"Career saved: Brett Winstanley won the British Open Clay Pigeon Shooting Championship earlier this year after laser eye surgery . When Brett Winstanley won the British Open Clay Pigeon Shooting Championship earlier this year, it marked an extraordinary comeback. Although the marksman was only 24 when he clinched the title, he hadn’t competed for six years because his deteriorating eyesight had forced him to give up the sport. But following successful laser surgery, Brett is now back in the game and even hoping to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio. He suffered from short-sightedness, which occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back. This means that light doesn’t reach the light-sensitive tissue (retina) at the back of the eye but focuses too early, so distant objects become blurred. ‘When you are shooting, good hand-to-eye co-ordination is essential,’ explains Brett. ‘And you need excellent sight. ‘My father used to shoot and I would watch him. When I was six, he let me have a go. I swiftly overtook him, and by the age of nine I was shooting competitively.’ His early success was quite extraordinary. Aged 12, he was in the England team and also won his first sub-junior world championship in Miami. But the following year, Brett’s vision in his right eye started to deteriorate. ‘It wasn’t catastrophic, but I had to retrain for six months. I had previously shot left-handed, and I changed hands.’ However, by the time he reached 16, his eyesight was even worse. He went to an optician and was given glasses to wear – but he hated using them for shooting. ‘I found that I got glare from the targets, and I couldn’t wear safety glasses over the top,’ Brett says. ‘I struggled enough with glasses to know that I couldn’t deal with contact lenses.

Brett was wary about the reported risks – indeed last week Spice Girl Mel B revealed she is going blind in her left eye following a procedure 15 years ago, and is now planning to have a cornea transplant to correct her vision. But Bruce Allan, a consultant surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says better techniques and technology means laser surgery is much safer than it was 20 years ago. Improving: Better techniques and technology means laser surgery is much safer than it was 20 years ago . ‘I have many more contact lens wearers turning up in my clinic with serious eye infections than I do laser patients,’ he says. ‘Surgery is very safe as along as you have it carried out in the right place with an experienced surgeon.’ In March, Brett met ophthalmic surgeon Faqir Qazi at the Optical Express Treatment Centre in Manchester, who explained what would happen with a procedure known as LASIK – Laser-Assisted-In-Situ-Keratomileusis eye surgery. This uses two computer-guided lasers. Brett describes the procedure as no worse than having a tooth extracted. ‘During the second part all I could see was the orange light of the laser and I could hear a sort of popping sound. It was so straightforward.’ After his successful comeback Brett was given a new gun by his sponsors – gun makers Caesar Guerini – and now has his sights set firmly on Rio. ‘I’m really going for gold.

"When a child wakes up in the middle of the night, mothers will think of everything to try and get their young one calmly back to sleep - including a softly sung lullaby. Many will chose a rendition of Rock-a-bye-Baby, but Kimberly Henderson of Sumter, South Carolina, has proven that her choice of tune may be more effective. She was recorded singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida. The child had woken up during the middle of the night, so Mrs Henderson walked into the kitchen of the family home and cleared her lungs. Her sister then uploaded the video YouTube and Facebook, leading to almost five million views. The mother told ABC News: 'I woke up this morning and I was just in awe. 'I don't even know where to start. I uploaded it to Facebook and everybody just started sharing the c*** out of it. And then the radio station in Seattle uploaded it and it's gotten like 4 million views.'

"The lifeless body of a young girl lies in the street, an innocent victim of a series of suicide bomb attacks that today tore through the heart of the Syrian city of Aleppo. The youngster pictured in a blood-stained rubble-strewn street is one of at least 40 victims of this morning's blasts, which could signal a new stage in the civil war. In a sign of the growing intensity of the bitter conflict between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, the town's main Saadallah . al-Jabari Square was rocked by four explosions - the likes of which have so far been mainly limited to the capital Damascus. And with fears of further attacks, the young girl's body - a potent symbol of the collateral damage each side is prepared to risk - has been left untouched in the street as locals fear further bombings. Scroll down for video . Innocent victim: This young girl was one of those killed in a series of bombings in Aleppo, Syria . Scenes of destruction: Men stand amid wreckage after three blasts ripped through Aleppo's main square. A severely wounded boy is treated by doctors in one of the city's last standing hospitals following the bomb blasts . Meanwhile, a Syrian shell has hit a home in neighbouring Turkey, killing at least five people, including a six-year-old boy. Abdulhakim Ayhan, mayor of the Turkish . town of Akcakale along the Syrian border, said the boy and a woman were . among the dead in shelling. Angry townspeople marched to the mayor's office to protest over the deaths. Meanwhile, a government official blamed the . 'terrorist' rebels for the coordinated assault on Aleppo's mainsquare, which is controlled by Assad loyalists. A fifth explosion was reported only a few hundred metres away in Bab al-Jinein, near the Chamber of Commerce and an officers' club. The area is on the fringes of the Old City, where a number of running battles have been fought. The anonymous official earlier stated that 29 people were killed and 70 injured in the explosions, but the latest report from the opposition say at least 40 are dead and more than 90 injured. Syrian pro-government television station Al-Ikhbariya TV showed footage of massive destruction from the scene of the blasts. It described them as the work of 'terrorists', a term the government uses to describe rebels fighting to topple Assad. The station showed footage of four dead men, including one dust-covered body being pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building and loaded onto the back of a pickup truck. It earlier said two car bombs had been used in the attack. Survivors: A father and son seek treatment and refuge following the suicide bombings that rocked Aleppo this morning .

The station also broadcast footage of . three dead men disguised as soldiers in army fatigues who it said were . shot by security forces before they could detonate explosive-packed . belts they were wearing. One appeared to be holding a trigger device in . his hand. Many of the buildings on the square had their facades ripped off and a crater stood in the road. 'It was like a series of earthquakes,' said one shaken resident. 'It was terrifying, terrifying.' He added the officers' club and a hotel were almost completely destroyed. Aleppo-based activist Mohammad Saeed said the explosions went off minutes apart. 'The area is heavily fortified by security and the presence of shabiha,' he said, referring to pro-regime gunmen. 'It makes you wonder how car bombs could reach there,' he added. Destroyed: This photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, shows the effect of the rebel attacks . Ruins: A road in Aleppo is a mass of debris following today's attacks . Debris: A bulldozer removes the wreckage of a building flattened by the blast. Aleppo has been the scene of fierce fighting. Aftermath: Cars were destroyed by the chain of explosions, which are believed to have killed at least 40 people. The square is in a . government-controlled district in western Aleppo, Syria's largest city, . which is now split in two with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . mainly in the west and rebels in the east. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for . Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said most of the casualties were members of . the regime forces. Fighting only with light weaponry, rebels have resorted to bomb attacks in areas still controlled by President Assad. Several large protests in support of the president have been held in Saadallah al-Jabari Square. A pro-Assad Lebanese paper said on Tuesday that the president was visiting Aleppo to take a first-hand look at the fighting and had ordered 30,000 more troops into the battle. It said Assad would remain in the city. Havoc: Civilians survey the scene of destruction. The square has been the scene of pro-Assad rallies. Fear: Civilians preparing to flee a residential area affected by the four explosions. The Syrian government blamed 'terrorists'. Opposition activists say 30,000 people have been killed in the 18-month-old anti-Assad uprising, which has grown into a full-scale civil war. For much of the revolt, Assad has retained a grip on Aleppo with many rich merchants and minority groups there, fearful of instability, remaining neutral while protests spread. Rebels mounted a new offensive last week to seize the city, and over the weekend fires started by the combat gutted the historic market in the Old City, a world heritage site. One of the bombs caused a large crater in the surface of the road. The damage to the surrounding area was extensive.

"Scroll down for video . Cardboard cutouts of lynching victims were found hanging from ropes around the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, apparently linked to protests over the death of Eric Garner. Three of the effigies were pictured around campus - one hanging from a gate, another from a tree and one on the floor held up by an activist. The lifesize cardboard figures - which seemed to resemble historical lynching victims from 1911 - was printed with a slogan linked to protests over Eric Garner's death by apparent chokehold at the hands of the NYPD. Lynched figure: A cardboard cutout of a young man - believed to be 1911 lynching victim Lawrence Nelson - was found on campus at the University of California in Berkeley . Cut-out: Police are investigating the incident, in which another cut-out labelled Laura Nelson was found. It had #ICan'tBreathe written on it - which is a slogan picked up by Eric Garner protesters . Each of the three figures read 'I can't breathe', which are the final words of Garner as he was filmed being taken down and killed by a group of officers. It was unclear who set up the highly-visible effigies, which appear to have been set up to coincide with a protest event Saturday afternoon. Police are now trying to establish who is behind the protests - which the university said are likely to have a racial element. A spokesman for the school told USA Today: 'It certainly could have been racially motivated, so we're taking it very seriously and are very interested in finding out who did this and what the intention was'. Online: People used social media to share images of the cut-outs. A university spokesman said that racial issues could be at play . Spencer Pritchard, a 21-year-old student involved in the demonstrations, said he hoped the effigies were the work of 'someone who wanted to bring attention to the issue.' The demonstrations coincided with protests nationwide, where as many as 50,000 protests converged on major cities around the country to protest over police killings of black men. One of the figures shown on the effigies was named as Laura Nelson, a black woman who was lynched in Oklahoma in 1911, the year written on the figure. Her 18-year-old son, Lawrence, was also killed after a mob broke into their jail cell and carried them to be hanged. The two were in prison for allegedly shooting dead a sheriff's deputy.

"Staying healthy has become a national obsession – certainly if our reading habits are anything to go by. Last year, Britons spent a staggering £47.4 million on health-related books in a bid to shed our muffin tops, relieve what ails us, and render us less stressed. While nearly every other area of publishing shrinks, this is one sector still doing roaring business. Read yourself healthy: CAROLINE SANDERSON, associate editor at The Bookseller, (not pictured) reviews her top-five health books 2014 . Sales this year are expected to continue to grow. Perhaps wearying of unrealistic fitness regimes, we are disciplining ourselves instead with The Fast Diet and The 5:2 Diet (two of the biggest sellers for a second year running), increasingly going sour on sugar, as recommended by the World Health Organisation, and juicing every last nutrient out of everything from blueberries to Brussels sprouts. As an associate editor at The Bookseller, I get an early peek at some truly useful, life-enhancing books which don’t necessarily subscribe to the latest craze. These are five of my best from 2014... Later! A Guide to Parenting a Young Adult by Gill Hines and Alison Baverstock . (Piatkus, £14.99) There are dozens of books on bringing up a baby or training your toddler, but almost nothing on young adults. With my firstborn fast approaching 17, I was delighted to see this one. Amid helpful case histories and thought-provoking exercises, there is a great deal of sensible advice on such contentious topics as career paths, first love and the Hotel of Mum and Dad. It gently reassured me too that my lovely son is not the recluse I was worried he might be. Helpful tomes: Later! A Guide to Parenting a Young Adult and We Need to Talk About Grief : How to Be a Friend to the One Who’s Left Behind . We Need to Talk About Grief : How to Be a Friend to the One Who’s Left Behind by Annie Broadbent . (Piatkus, £12.99) After my father died of cancer last December, I’ve been thinking a lot about what has helped. Thousands of people find themselves in the same situation, yet I have found few books that truly articulate the kind of feelings which rise up. Then I fell upon the compassionate approach of someone who lost her mother to cancer. Annie combines candid first-person stories of bereavement with sensible and sensitive advice underno-nonsense headings. She also makes a heartfelt plea for thosewho would rather cross the road than speak to a bereaved friend toget to grips with death, which is something I feel needs to be said. The Mount Athos Diet by Richard Storey, Sue Todd and Lottie Storey . (Vermilion, £10.99) I am suspicious of diets which claim to be both effective and delicious, but the recipes in The Mount Athos Diet, based on a typical Mediterranean peasant diet (vegetables, pulses, fruit, nuts,wholegrains and olive oil) have enticed me to try them from next month. The method involves fasting for three days, eating moderately for three and feasting on the seventh. The monks of Mount Athos are among the healthiest people in the world. Food and beauty: The Mount Athos Diet and French Women Don’t Get Facelifts . Don't forget: Where Memories Go: Why Dementia Changes Everything . French Women Don’t Get Facelifts by Mireille Guiliano . (Doubleday, £14.99) The trendy idea that nobody does it better than the French is a galling one. But in this book Mireille Guiliano, who takes her mantra from Coco Chanel (‘no one is young over 40, but one can be irresistible at any age’),shares her knowledge on ageing with a style and attitude that is indeed hard to resist. She covers everything from hair and shoes (the two biggest ‘tells’, apparently) to proper breathing, and the benefits of going to bed an hour earlier twice a week when you’re aged over 50. And Botox? Just say non! Where Memories Go: Why Dementia Changes Everything by Sally Magnusson . (Two Roads, £16.99) Sadly, dementia has been a dominant theme among the bestselling books on illness this year. Sally Magnusson’s is a personal and humane approach to the distress and challenges of the condition,but also a call for us to reconsider how we look after society’s most fragile. I’m also pressing everyone to read Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine And What Matters In The End by Atul Gawande.","CAROLINE SANDERSON reviews her top-five health books 2014 .

"The newborn was taken into state care on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive Court of Protection despite the mother's pleas to be allowed to raise her. File picture . A mother ordered to give up her baby after a forced caesarean begged a judge: Please don’t take my daughter away. The newborn was taken into state care on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive Court of Protection – despite the mother’s pleas to be allowed to raise her. The case provoked a wave of anger from MPs and patient pressure groups, with one MP describing social workers as ‘dictators who are unaccountable and out of control’. The treatment of the 35-year-old Italian, who arrived in Britain last summer and then fell into an episode of serious mental ill health, was condemned as extraordinary and totalitarian. It will raise questions of how secret justice in Britain could impose an invasive medical  procedure on a foreign citizen and then seize her child, apparently without contacting the authorities in her own country. The girl, born last August, is now close to being adopted by a British couple, despite a court hearing that her mother had recovered and was giving clear and articulate evidence as she pleaded to keep her. The judge who heads the family courts, Sir James Munby, has said they must be open to the public, but no information concerning any element of the treatment of the Italian mother has been made public by the courts or by Essex County Council, the local authority responsible for the baby. The case follows a series of scandals over the way justice for families is meted out behind closed doors. The woman, who is a mother of three girls, is understood to have arrived in Britain while pregnant last July. One report said yesterday that she was to take a training course at Stansted Airport with Ryanair. She was arrested and sectioned under the Mental Health Act following an episode at an airport hotel. The woman has a bipolar condition and courts have been told that she is affected by ‘manic episodes’ and paranoid delusions if she fails to take medication. On August 23 last year, while the mother was detained, Mr Justice Mostyn made an order in the Court of Protection ‘for the birth to be enforced by way of caesarean section’. The child was taken into care by Essex social workers the following day, and she has lived in state care ever since. Tory MP Douglas Carswell (left) called Essex children's services 'unaccountable and out of control'. The judge who heads the family courts, Sir James Munby (right), has said they must be open to the public, but no information concerning any element of the treatment of the Italian mother has been made public . In February another judge, Judge Roderick Newton, began the adoption process at Chelmsford County Court. His ruling is understood to have said the mother had recovered her health and had given clear and articulate evidence. Judge Newton said: ‘She has accommodation, she has a secure job and she does have the support of her family. ‘She told me that she felt well and that in a rather perverse and tragically sad way her daughter had saved her. ‘It had finally brought her to the realisation of accepting that she is bipolar.’ The woman’s other children, aged 11 . and four, are being brought up by her parents in Italy. The court heard . that she asked for the children to be returned to her in Italy, to stay . in foster care until she could show that she would maintain stability in . her life. Judge Newton . said: ‘She begged the court not to agree to the care and placement . orders being made so that she lost her daughter forever. ‘She believed that by committing to take the medication she could return back to Italy with the child, that she should not go into adoption. She said that nobody is perfect, neither she nor any adoptive mother, and that, I am quite sure, is the case.’ The judge added that the mother before the court in February and the woman with the earlier mental episode were ‘almost like different people’. Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming is a long-standing campaigner against court secrecy, which he brands 'disgraceful' However social workers told the court that they doubted whether the mother would continue to take medication and that she had lapsed in the past. They said the child should be adopted before the age of nine months. Judge Newton said: ‘It is not a case where I can accede to the mother’s wishes even though I understand, not just the strength of feeling that she has, but it is rare to have it articulated in such a forceful and coherent form.’ The adoption is now likely to be challenged by lawyers. It may also be raised in the Commons by Lib Dem MP John Hemming, a long-standing campaigner against court secrecy, who said: ‘It is hard to avoid the suspicion that adoption targets set for Essex may have come into play. ‘We do not know whether she was held in the UK as a favour for Essex social workers. We cannot know because of the disgraceful secrecy of the courts.’ Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘As an Essex MP, I have serious concerns about Essex children’s services. They are unaccountable and out of control. 'These people are dictators who abuse their powers. They are arrogant bullies and people are frightened of them. ‘They operate in secret, they have great powers, and they are unaccountable.’ The SOS – NHS Patients in Danger pressure group said: ‘This is extremely troubling. We would ask why the caesarean order was not challenged by NHS doctors.’ A spokesman for Essex council said: ‘We will not comment on ongoing cases involving vulnerable people and children.’","Case of Italian woman condemned as extraordinary and totalitarian .

"The world's population looks set to smash through the seven billion barrier in the next few days, according to the United Nations. It comes just 12 years since the total reached six billion - with official estimates saying the figure will top eight billion in 2025 and 10 billion before the end of the century. And it is most likely the baby will be born in the Asia-Pacific region - where the population growth rate is higher than anywhere else in the world. Scroll down for video... Crowded: The world's population looks set to smash through the seven billion barrier in the next few days - and it is most likely the baby will be born in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Mumbai, India, pictured here . Experts say the pace of growth - which has seen the number of people on the planet triple since 1940 - poses an increasing danger to citizens. With more people to feed, house and provide medical care for, they say the world's resources look set to come under more strain than ever before. As populations stabilise in the industrial world, almost all growth in the near future is expected to take place in developing countries. Of the 2.3 billion people the UN believes will be added by 2050, more than one billion will live in sub-Saharan Africa. The Indian subcontinent will add some 630 million people. It will mean less land and water available for each person. Poorer people, who tend to depend more on natural resources, will bear the brunt as they will not be able to compete with the rich. The major issues will be how to feed the new arrivals, which will see the need for new varieties of improved crops. Ageing populations are also set to pose a problem with some industrial countries, such as Japan, nearly doubling its share of the population aged 65 and over in the past 20 years. This will put increased pressure on pension and healthcare systems. The report states: 'Another two billion people may be added to the world population by mid-century, many of them in places where hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation are already taking a high toll. 'Supporting the world’s human population will mean eliminating poverty, transitioning to an economy that is in sync with the earth, and securing every person’s health, education, and reproductive choice. 'If we do not voluntarily stabilize population, we risk a much less humane end to growth as the ongoing destruction of the earth’s natural systems catches up with us.' But despite the problems the world is facing, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Dr Noeleen Heyzer said the seventh billion child of the world has a better chance than decade ago of surviving past the age of five than a decade ago. The life expectancy for both women and men has also increased in every Asian and Pacific country during the past decade, Dr Heyzer added. And although the pace of development is 1.1 per cent in 2011 - meaning an extra 78 million people will live on the planet by the end of this year - it has slowed down slightly from its peak of 2 per cent in 1968. Professor David Bloom, from the department of economics and demographics at Harvard University, said in a report earlier this year that the issues would also affect developed countries. He said: 'Population trends indicate a shift in the 'demographic centre of gravity' from more to less developed regions. 'Already strained, many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food, water, housing, and energy to their growing populations, with repercussions for health, security, and economic growth. 'The demographic picture is indeed complex, and poses some formidable challenges. 'Those challenges are not insurmountable, but we cannot deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand. 'We have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge-action gaps we see in the area of child survival, to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy. 'It's just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change.' Britain is mirroring the world's expansion. In 1801, its population was 10.5 million - and is now close to 62.5 million.","Children most likely to be born in Asia-Pacific region .

"A British forensic archaeologist has unearthed fresh evidence to prove the existence of mass graves at the Nazi death camp Treblinka - scuppering the claims of Holocaust deniers who say it was merely a transit camp. Some 800,000 Jews were killed at the site, in north east Poland, during the Second World War but a lack of physical evidence in the area has been exploited by Holocaust deniers. Forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls has now undertaken the first co-ordinated scientific attempt to locate the graves. Treblinka death camp in Poland where 17,000 Stone Memorial is one of the few reminders of the horrific events of the past . As Jewish religious law forbids disturbing burial sites, she and her team from the University of Birmingham have used 'ground-penetrating radar'. Her work at the site, where the Nazis tried to destroy all traces of industrial-scale killing, is being followed in forthcoming Radio 4 documentary The Hidden Graves Of The Holocaust. Sturdy Colls said: 'All the history books state that Treblinka was destroyed by the Nazis but the survey has demonstrated that simply isn’t the case. 'I’ve identified a number of buried pits using geophysical techniques. These are considerable in size, and very deep, one in particular is 26 by 17 metres.' The programme’s presenter says that the pits contain the burnt remains of thousands of bodies. The forensic archaeologist, who has now presented her findings to the authorities responsible for the memorial at Treblinka, added: 'I really hope this is the first stage in a long-term programme to seek out those hidden graves of the Holocaust.' Survivor Kalman Taigman remembers his arrival at the camp’s railway station, packed into a cattle wagon. 'I . was with my mother. We were about 100 people in a wagon. They opened . the doors, firing guns and hitting us, and sent us into a yard. I ran . with my mother and tried to calm her. 'They . told me to leave my mother but I didn’t do it quickly and I was hit on . the head. When I got up, she was gone. She went with all the rest of the . women to the gas chamber.' Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in occupied Poland near the village of Treblinka during World War II . The camp was constructed as part of Operation Reinhard . Treblinka operated between July 23, 1942 and October 19, 1943 . During this time, approximately 850,000 men, women and children were killed at Treblinka.

"Alan Davies is understood to have been involved in an altercation with the man . Actor Alan Davies has been accused of grabbing the throat of a climbing instructor as he visited a leisure centre with his children. The 48-year-old is understood to have been at Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre in north London when instructor Eamonn O'Connor claims he tried to walk past the family on the stairs. Mr O'Connor said the actor, famed by the Jonathan Creek television series, grabbed him by the throat, claiming he had 'lost it'. Metropolitan Police officers were called to the scene though no arrests were made in connection with the incident. 'When he reached the bottom of the stairs he just turned and went for me,' the instructor told the Sun. 'He just flipped. He grabbed me by the throat. 'He was growling and not making any sense.

The Senate voted 56-40 on Saturday for the long-term funding bill, the main item left on Congress' year-end agenda. The lengthy legislation will now be sent to President Obama for his signature before it becomes law. Resolution: Both houses of Congress have now passed the $1.1trillion spending bill which will fund the government through to September 2015 . However, though the majority of the government was given funding for the next ten months, the Department of Homeland Security was only funded until February 27. The earlier date reflects outrage by lawmakers at an executive order by President Obama which will remove the threats of deportation from millions of illegal immigrants. Republicans will hope yo use the early deadline to force the President to roll back the new policy. The compromise bill had faced opposition from Democratic liberals upset about the repeal of a banking regulation and Republican conservatives unhappy that it failed to challenge Obama's immigration moves.

"Behind bars: Ben Westwood has been jailed for nine years after he drove at speeds of up to 180mph during a police chase . A getaway driver who hit speeds of 180mph during a 65-mile police chase was jailed yesterday. Ben Westwood left a trail of sparks and flames as he fled from a robbery scene in a stolen Audi RS5. During the pursuit on the M6, he almost outran a police helicopter and left officers in high-performance BMWs trailing in his wake. The 33-year-old is thought to be the fastest speeding driver ever to be prosecuted in the UK. Westwood was caught on January 13 after police officers spotted him and his gang attempting to break open a cash machine at a Murco petrol station in Penn, West Midlands. While three of the gang were arrested at the scene, the getaway driver and accomplice Gregory Simpson, 26, headed off in the Audi at speed towards the M6. They managed to evade capture for more than an hour during the dramatic chase. At one stage, Westwood drove the . supercar in the wrong direction down a slip road at 70mph towards an . onrushing police car. It avoided crashing by veering out of the way. Westwood eventually abandoned the £85,000 vehicle outside a block of . flats in Wolverhampton, where he was found hiding with Simpson. Scroll down for video .

Sentencing Westwood, of Wednesfield, . West Midlands to nine years in prison, Recorder Nigel Baker said the . jail term reflected ‘an atrocious piece of dangerous driving’.

The driving was dangerous. ‘The police helicopter indicated the Audi was reaching speeds of 180mph, maybe even faster. ‘It was highly likely that if he . stayed on the motorway, then he would have outrun that helicopter.’ Westwood, who was jailed for dangerous driving, conspiracy to burgle and . conspiracy to steal, was said to be the leader of the gang. He was previously jailed for four and . a half years for being part of a gang which stole luxury cars by taking . keys from owners’ homes.

Shoppers at an eastern Massachusetts toy store are getting an early Christmas present: All their layaway bills totaling $20,000 have been paid off by an anonymous woman dubbed 'layaway angel.' Employees at the Toys R Us in Bellingham, about 40 miles southwest of Boston, told The Milford Daily News that the woman paid off all 150 of the store's layaway accounts Wednesday. Workers say the bubbly, older woman gave the store manager a hug and said: 'If you have it, give it.' She also told an employee that paying all the bills would help her sleep better at night.

The company released a statement saying 'this incredible act of kindness is a true illustration of holiday giving at its best.' Diane Brewer of Mendon told WFXT-TV that she was elated the woman paid off her layaway bill at the Bellingham store.

Emily Burlingame told NECN that she found out about the random acts of kindness when she went to pay her layaway balance this week.

"DEREK LAWRENSON: Asked recently to name the Formula One Driver of the Year, a man as knowledgeable as David Coulthard found he couldn’t split the respective claims of Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo and called it a tie. And this is supposed to be the main rival to Rory McIlroy, who has just compiled unquestionably the greatest season in the entire history of golf in the United Kingdom. A man who may or may not be the best driver this year. No such ambivalence in golf, of course. There’s not a soul in the sport who wouldn’t confirm without a moment’s hesitation that McIlroy was not just the best driver, he was the best in every other category as well. Rory McIlroy poses with the Claret Jug after winning The Open for the first time in his career this year . McIlroy alongside the Race to Dubai trophy, another honour that he took in 2014 . He has been named Player of the Year by his peers on the PGA Tour, the PGA of America, and the Association of Golf Writers, while the European Tour will surely follow suit this week. The problem Hamilton has got is that we don’t really know how good he was given the car he was driving was so superior to the rest. But in golf, everyone can play the same clubs and balls as McIlroy. We can say without fear or favour that he blew them away simply because he was miles better. During the summer, McIlroy won two majors — The Open and USPGA — and a World Golf Championship event with 12 rounds of perfection. Rickie Fowler described it as ‘probably the best stretch of golf ever played.’ McIlroy also won the European Tour’s flagship event at Wentworth and played a leading role in Europe’s Ryder Cup victory. McIlroy (right),  pictured with Graeme McDowell (left), was in the victorious Europe Ryder Cup side . Never mind he declared for Ireland for the Olympics. He had no choice given the invidious politics. Take it from me: the Belfast boy is a proud member of the United Kingdom. So get behind him tonight. In fact, get behind him full stop. This man is going to do things over the next decade that will transcend golf and be Federer-like, Ronaldo-like and Messi-like, and you won’t want to miss it. JONATHAN MCEVOY: Lewis Hamilton and Rory McIlroy are both glorious talents. They each go about their sport with more élan than any contemporary can muster. So handing the Sports Personality title to either would not remotely be a travesty in sporting terms. But this is the British Broadcasting Corporation’s award. Yet only one of the two leading contenders, Lewis Hamilton, wishes to be known as British (even though he is the one living in a tax haven). McIlroy has cast himself away to Ireland for Olympic purposes and, by any reasonable logic, should not pick up one of our national baubles. At least Hamilton, who moved from Switzerland to Monaco, wears the Union flag on the underside of his long-peak cap and smiled on each of the 11 times God Save the Queen honoured one of his race victories. Lewis Hamilton (centre) celebrates with his Mercedes team after winning the Formula One championship . Hamilton celebrates on the podium and is sprayed with champagne after securing his win . I am afraid Mr McIlroy has signed and returned his card, and disqualified himself. The case for Hamilton is, in itself, immensely strong. There are more than a billion drivers in the world. Only a golden thread win world titles. And at the very top of the pyramid are drivers who, through their magical prowess, transcend their sport. Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton, the double world champion, is one such person. Hamilton secured his driver's title with a race victory at the Abu Dhabi grand prix at the Yas Marina circuit . This year alone he eclipsed Sir Jackie Stewart’s record of grand prix wins (albeit there are more races now). Of course, ‘personality’ is a slightly different thing from high-performance achievement. Yet with his bling and his tattoos, Hamilton at least stands out among his pit-lane peers. As this is the season of goodwill, I have the perfect solution: Lewis for the Sports Personality of the Year and Rory — the admittedly brilliant Rory — for the Overseas award.","Golf correspondent Derek Lawrenson explains why he feels Rory McIlroy should win the title .

"CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's appraisal of Liverpool's loss to Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . If it was an audition for a coaching job in Spanish football at some point in the future, then it was a case of 'don't call us, we'll call you' for Brendan Rodgers on Tuesday night against Real Madrid. If there is one thing the Spanish dislike it's a coach who errs on the side of caution – they laud those who fight fire with fire and those who first and foremost try to make themselves hard to beat are looked down upon. It's one of the reasons why former Liverpool coach Rafa Benitez has never quite enjoyed the unanimous approval of his countrymen, despite his trophy haul. 'Poor image of Liverpool,' cries AS while Marca praises Real Madrid's 'Impecables' (faultless) on Wednesday . Some will have understood Rodgers' attempt at smothering Real's midfield passing game but Diario AS chief football writer Alfredo Relano spoke for the vast majority when he wrote: 'Giving up on the result from the moment of team selection was a crime against his club's history.' Others compared the Liverpool coach to Granada boss Joaquin Caparros, who had said before last weekend's match against Madrid: 'All I ask for is that they don't walk all over us.' That seemed to be one of the motivations behind the team selection, although when respected El Pais journalist Santiago Segurola was asked about that comparison he said: 'Yes but that was Granada, this is Liverpool.' In his daily editorial Relano added: 'It takes two to tango and yesterday Liverpool didn't want to dance. Even at the end when they brought on (Steven) Gerrard and (Raheem) Sterling. They were only one goal behind still didn't really go for it.' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers didn't impress the Spanish media on Tuesday night against Real Madrid . Rodgers rested a number of key players, with captain Steven Gerrard joining the action from the bench . Rodgers was given 4.5 out of 10 in Marca's ratings. 'The Liverpool coach prioritised the Premier League,' said the Madrid sports newspaper, who ran the headline: 'Little more than a friendly' above its match report. There is a phrase in Spanish football, 'Ganar sin despeinarse' ('Winning without messing your hair up'), that also featured in their coverage of a victory achieved with surprising ease. Rodgers impressed everyone in Spain last season with Liverpool's title charge. The way he took the favourite English team of so many football fans in Spain to within touching distance of the title will have put him on the radars of most clubs. Even Barcelona, whose current coach Luis Enrique has not covered himself in glory so far, will be monitoring his progress. But the reaction in Catalonia to Tuesday night's showing was equally lukewarm. VIDEO Visit The Redmen TV for more Liverpool videos from the Bernabeu . Mundo Deportivo journalist Orfeo Suarez says Rodgers' line-up was not 'behavior of a distinguished manager' Prestigious Mundo Deportivo journalist Orfeo Suarez wrote: 'Dismissing the Champions League and dismissing the Bernabeu in such a way is not the behavior of a distinguished manager.' Rodgers will have the last laugh if Liverpool beat Chelsea at the weekend, and qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, where he will get another chance to impress outside of England. If that chance does not come though, then the lasting memory in Spain of Rodgers this season will be of a man who brought the second best team in England last season to play the third best team in Spain last term, and never really gave them a game.

"Ben Stokes smiles as he contemplates a reputation as the wild child of English cricket that not even early displays of rare class have enabled him to shed. Last winter saw the extremes of a maiden Test century in the toughest of circumstances in Perth and a broken wrist suffered while punching a locker in frustration for a man who was once sent home from a Lions tour in disgrace. It is the more positive side of a gifted cricketer who should be at the forefront of the England team for the next 10 years that Alastair Cook and Peter Moores want to see as they begin their build-up to February’s World Cup. Stokes is hoping to be an integral part of the England squad for next year's World Cup . Ben Stokes celebrates scoring a century in the third Ashes Test in Perth last year (left) after a cool innings . First ODI - November 26, Colombo (9am BST) Second ODI - November 29, Colombo (4.30am) Third ODI - December 3, Hambantota (9am) Fourth ODI - December 6, Colombo (4.30am) Fifth ODI - December 10, Pallekele (9am) Sixth ODI - December 13, Pallekele (4.30am) Seventh ODI - December 16, Colombo (9am) Stokes joined England at Loughborough on Tuesday for a three-day training camp ahead of their one-day tour of Sri Lanka later this month and insisted that the self-inflicted indiscretions that have hindered his progress are a thing of the past. ‘I now know you can’t let emotion get the better of you,’ said the all-rounder who guided Durham to the Royal London Cup last summer. ‘Everybody knows I lost my temper easily when I was a kid and tended to look away from the game itself. Now I can manage that to make sure I’m getting the best out of myself.’ The locker incident, which came in Barbados as Stokes struggled to end a run of low scores, cost him his place at the World Twenty20 and at the start of a summer where he failed to nail down a regular place in all formats. But he insists it was not a symptom of a bigger problem for a 23-year-old who has invited comparisons with Andrew Flintoff as much for his off-field habits as for his exciting all-round performances on it.

T20Is Wickets 0 Economy rate 11.50 . ‘That incident was totally from wanting to do so well,’ said Stokes. ‘It wasn’t like I had lost my mind and become a psycho. It was completely my own fault, but I never want to lose my emotion. I now know that I shouldn’t punch lockers. It’s just about dealing with failure in the right way. ‘Mind you, the opposition could be scared of me, thinking, ""I don’t want to get on the wrong side of him."" I could just give them the ""psycho"" eyes then! I don’t think angry is the right word to describe my attitude but sometimes I have been overly competitive. When I don’t do what I want it can become frustrating.’ It will be a more grown up Stokes, he insists, who is about to embark on a prolonged spell of one-day cricket he hopes can help England upset the odds at the World Cup in Australia and his native New Zealand. Not least in his attitude to the prospect of the arrival of his second child. His partner Clare is expecting their daughter on February 21, just two days before England face Scotland in Christchurch where Stokes was born and bred before his family emigrated for Cumbria when he was 12. Stokes struggled with the bat for England in summer - here he is caught by India's Suresh Raina in the third ODI . It provides a quandary that Stokes has a mature approach to. ‘If I can get back and the baby comes at a time when it doesn’t affect the cricket I will do but I don’t want to miss any big matches,’ he said. ‘We have talked about it and Clare completely understands my job and the situation. She actually said ‘if we tell our daughter you missed her birth because you were playing for your country I reckon she will think that’s quite cool’.’ That match in Stokes' old home town will see him come face to face with his county captain Paul Collingwood, who this week rejoined the Scotland coaching staff. ‘I’ve played with him for a long time and he’s a great captain and coach but it will be nice to beat them and rub it in his face,’ smiled Stokes. More mature, perhaps, but clearly still with a competitive sense of mischief. The all-rounder jumps for joy (centre) as Durham win the Royal London One Day Cup final at Lord's .

"Ally McCoist is set to meet the Rangers board on Wednesday for the talks that will determine his point of departure from Ibrox. The Rangers manager is expected to convene with football board chairman Sandy Easdale and Mike Ashley’s lieutenant Derek Llambias with legal teams of both parties present. The midweek showdown is where McCoist will learn of the club’s response to serving written intent to quit at the end of the 12-month notice period on his contract — the move that stunned Scottish football on Friday. Ally McCoist watched Rangers lose 2-0 at Queen of the South on Friday night . McCoist could then be placed on gardening leave or have his contract settled at a cost of £400,000 in order to have the issue resolved before Livingston visit Ibrox on Saturday and next Monday’s Annual General Meeting. But he could yet remain until the end of the season, with the balance paid in the summer. Clearing out McCoist and his entire coaching staff, including assistant Kenny McDowall and No 3 Ian Durrant, would clock in at a fee of more than £1million for a cash-strapped club relying on Ashley loans to limp through the winter. Rangers chief executive Charles Green (top row centre) talks to Ally McCoist before the match . It remains to be seen if Ashley, who controversially handed Dennis Wise and Joe Kinnear jobs at Newcastle, is content to write the cheque and parachute a preferred candidate in at the first-team helm. His man, Llambias, a non-executive director, has been implementing savage cuts at a lower level and not among the high earning staff — a move that left McCoist alarmed and helped precipitate his decision to quit. From the clutch of front-runners to replace McCoist, the Newcastle owner is likely to find the name of Billy Davies for his consideration as the No 1 Scottish contender. Rangers Manager Ally McCoist (right) was the centre of attention at Queen of the South . The former Nottingham Forest manager has upped his presence at Ibrox in recent months. Davies has spoken previously of managing Rangers being his career ambition and, perhaps crucially for his immediate employment prospects, boasts an excellent second-tier record in England, including a promotion for Derby and Play-Off Final appearance with Preston. McCoist ordered his players in for Saturday training in the aftermath of Friday night’s pitiful performance at Queen of the South. That 2-0 loss did not see Rangers concede any further title ground on Saturday because leaders Hearts’ match at Cowdenbeath was postponed.

"Once upon a time in America, a football coach offered this definition of a fan: ‘He’s a guy who spends the afternoon yelling that the quarterback’s incompetent and the wide receiver’s a jerk. Then he leaves the stadium and he can’t remember where he parked his car.’ The football managers of England would never dare voice such contemptuous sentiments. But from time to time, when vilification becomes truly vicious, their faces reveal their private thoughts. Most football fans are decent people who are shabbily treated. They pay far too much and receive too little in return. Their views are unheeded and their comfort is largely disregarded. Yet a small but significant proportion of the football public deserves neither sympathy nor consideration. Football grounds have never appealed to delicate sensibilities, for conflict lies at the heart of the game. But in recent seasons, attitudes have become increasingly belligerent. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has come under scrutiny from the club's fans this season, after recent results . Arsenal fans hold up a banner wishing Wenger to leave the club during their match at West Brom last month . There is an air of abrasive entitlement. ‘We pay for our seats!’ is the cry. ‘And that allows us to say and do anything we choose’. In the real world, of course, such attitudes are properly rejected. But football inhabits a moral universe in which insults are the common currency. Those of us who cover the game rarely mention the prevailing atmosphere, since raw malevolence is the weekly norm. But from time to time, some small eruption will not be ignored. And when such eruptions start to form a pattern, then the game may be forced to take a critical look at itself. Today, such a pattern seems to be taking shape. And the central figure of each little drama is the football manager. Last week, Nigel Pearson of Leicester told a particularly irksome provocateur to ‘f*** off and die’. He was foolishly offensive, of course, and the Football Association charge he now faces was inevitable. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson was charged by the FA after an incident with a Foxes supporter . Pearson appeared to tell a supporter to 'f*** off and die' during their match at home to Liverpool in December . The Leicester boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline . Yet the wonder is that so many of his colleagues somehow contrive to maintain their self-control in the face of dire provocation. After a run of fine results, Alan Pardew has apparently justified his continuing employment on Tyneside but only a few months have passed since he was virtually a prisoner of the dugout, his brief excursions the signal for all manner of screeching derision. After his last, successful season, Brendan Rodgers has so far been spared a similar fate but if Liverpool lose at Old Trafford this lunchtime, the manager may face unhappy consequences when Arsenal visit Anfield next weekend. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew (left) and Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers have been scrutinised this season . Which brings us to Arsene Wenger. By the depressing standards of Stoke v Arsenal matches, last weekend’s affair was unexceptional. As the pantomime villain of the Potteries, Wenger was jeered from the start. When he had clearly decided to remain in his seat, he was taunted with endless choruses of ‘Arsene Wenger, he’s scared to stand up!’ But the genuine outrage was reserved for Stoke station on Arsenal’s homeward journey. After their team’s defeat, a section of the travelling support was intent on challenging their manager. The short video, posted on YouTube, has become shockingly familiar. A bunch of jostling oafs pursue him to the train, shouting: ‘Here he is! Here he is! Wenger! Wenger! **** off!’ The c-word is spat out, the threats are despicable. And one of the most brilliant managers that the English game has known, a man whose talents built a stadium, whose club have qualified for the Champions League on 17 consecutive occasions and who, just last spring, won the FA Cup, is obliged to stride past his knuckle-dragging tormentors with face white and strained. It was deeply humiliating, yet it was the consequence of a climate in which the mob may choose a managerial victim and hound him without logic or mercy. The radio phone-in, that parliament of fools, prattled: ‘He’s not up to the job ... past his sell-by date ... I’m sorry but he’s got to go.’ In an earlier age the callers might have been reaching for the black cap. So-called ‘social media’ was equally predictable in the choice of cliche: ‘Tactically naive ... lost the plot.’ Wenger’s replacement was loosely discussed. Wenger looks dejected as Arsenal came unstuck away at Stoke in a 3-2 defeat earlier in December . Wenger was targeted by Arsenal fans as he boarded a train at Stoke-on-Trent station after the match . The 65-year-old was tormented by a flurry of strong verbal abuse by some travelling supporters . At one stage, the popular solution was Jurgen Klopp of Borussia Dortmund. Then somebody noticed that Klopp’s club were near the foot of the Bundesliga, so the trail went conveniently cold. The hunt for a plausible candidate goes on. Now major football managers are lavishly rewarded. Most of them enjoy the financial security of a long-term contract, which may be a factor in their increasing longevity. Not a single Premier League manager has been sacked this season, the first time in 18 years that the League has reached mid-December without a casualty. At last, the clubs are accepting that patience is indeed a virtue. Sadly, that enlightened attitude is not reflected in the conduct of their crowds. Yet, week after week, club owners sit in cushioned comfort high in the grandstand; rugs upon their knees, chums at their elbows. Borussia Dormund boss Jurgen Klopp (left) has often been linked with as Wenger's replacement . And somehow they never hear the threats, the menace, the choreographed ugliness belching out from that same, small, loutish section of their following. But the poor manager hears, all too clearly, since much of the malice is directed at him. And no matter how he affects to ignore it, the relentless jibes take their toll. The more thoughtful members of his profession are aware that a crisis is taking shape. Not in the manner of three decades past, with hazardous terraces and grounds which were tragedies waiting to happen but in a more insidious fashion. Hostility is flourishing unchecked, civility is perceived as weakness and something akin to hatred is being sown in fertile soil. There is a sense that the national game is drifting towards a dangerous acceptance of the unacceptable. The urgent need is for deeper thinking, more incisive analysis and credible long-term solutions. Distinguished managers, the likes of Arsene Wenger, could make valuable contributions to that debate. It is surely time that football sought their advice. THE PERILS OF POVERTY AT RANGERS . The decline of Glasgow Rangers continues at saddening pace. Beaten by Queen of the South on Friday and hopelessly adrift in their efforts to win promotion from Scotland’s second tier, they have just received the resignation of their manager Ally McCoist. Unfortunately, they cannot afford to pay up McCoist’s one-year rolling contract. How recently it seems since apparently sane people were arguing that the future of Rangers lay in the English Premier League. In these straitened times, poor Rangers might struggle to pay the fare down from Glasgow. Rangers boss Ally McCoist's (centre) resignation  was rejected as they couldn't afford to pay up his contract . In the next television football rights deal, the Premier League is to introduce up to 10 live matches a season on Friday nights. Games in this coveted slot could be worth as much as £10million each. We must assume that none of these fixtures will include, say, Hull v Southampton (return journey 508 miles), Palace v Sunderland (578 miles) or Swansea v Newcastle (708 miles). Otherwise, we might conclude that the game has finally sold itself lock, stock and barrel to the television companies. And turned its back on the travelling, ticket-buying supporters who have been its most faithful followers these past 100 years.","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was heckled by some of the club's fans after their 3-2 defeat away at Stoke in December .

"Luis Suarez is not worried after his goalless start to life at Barcelona and insists that his partnership with Lionel Messi and Neymar will work. The striker has played in two La Liga games since his move from Liverpool this summer but Barcelona have lost both, away against arch-rivals Real Madrid and at home against Celta Vigo. Suarez, speaking on the eve of his return to face his former side Ajax in the Champions League, says he had always dreamed of playing at Barcelona and will fit in at the club. Luis Suarez is set to make his Champions League debut for Barcelona against Ajax on Wednesday . The 27-year-old appeared relaxed as he spoke at a press conference ahead of the game . Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny for recent selections and results . Despite a lacklustre start at the Nou Camp, Suarez says he fits in well at 'dream club' Barcelona . He hailed Messi the best player in the world, over Cristiano Ronaldo, and insists that he knows what he has to do to improve and find his feet with Luis Enrique's side. 'It's not just Leo, it's all the other players in the team too. For anyone that has any doubt, I'm completely proud and completely relaxed to have him as a team-mate,' said the Uruguayan. 'All the players learn from each other. Leo learns from us and we learn from him, that way we get on really well. I don't doubt Messi is the best in the world, he can't be compared with anybody. 'I know my colleagues on the pitch now. I felt a little strange at first, but that feeling has passed. Now I feel good, and I thank them because they make me feel part of a whole, it helps me to be more comfortable in the field.' Suarez attempts a 'rabona' kick during a training session with his new teammates . Suarez is confident of striking up a partnership with Lionel Messi (back)... 'the best player in the world' The third member of Barcelona's all-star attack, Neymar, makes up one of Europe's most potent strikeforces . Suarez looks on as Messi speaks with his teammates during a final practice session at the Amsterdam Arena . Suarez admitted that he wasn't yet at his best but is aware of what changes he needs to make to get back to the form that saw him share the European Golden Shoe with Ronaldo last season. 'You always have to win when you play for FC Barcelona. The two losses were certainly tough and now we have to show that we are able to rectify the situation. 'I know what I have to do to improve. Losing these games consecutively is not normal at a club like Barca but I'm happy to be able to come back and play.' He had plenty of kind words for Ajax and also Liverpool, whom he wished well in their clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Suarez said: 'All the love that I received at Liverpool was spectacular. Liverpool made me grow and become the Luis Suarez that I am today. Obviously I want them to do well tonight.' Suarez arrives in Amsterdam, clutching his favourite mate drink, ahead of the European clash . The Uruguayan was given a warm welcome at the airport, where he remembered for his time at Ajax . Suarez is ushered away ahead of the meeting with his former club Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena . Suarez signed for Ajax after a bitter split with another Dutch side, Gronigen, in 2007. He took them to court because they rejected an offer from his suitors, and although he lost the case Ajax upped their bid and Gronigen finally accepted it. The striker became a legend at Ajax, netting an incredible 111 goals in 159 games, eventually earning the captaincy. He said that he wouldn't celebrate if he scored his first Barcelona goal at the Amsterdam ArenA. Suarez reacts during Barcelona's unexpected 1-0 La Liga defeat to Celta Vigo . Suarez is yet to score a goal for the Catalan club since returning after serving a four month suspension . Both games that Suarez has played in for Barcelona have ended in defeat - to Real Madrid and Celta Vigo . 'Obviously I would love to scream and shout with excitement, but out of respect for Ajax I would not,' explained Suarez. 'Playing for Ajax was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. They taught me how to do a lot of things that I couldn't before. I also played in my first Champions League game with them, a dream I have had since I was a boy in South America. 'I really love not just the club, but also the city, because of the way they treated me over the years. 'The people were great to me and I would love to come back and play here. There will surely be an opportunity to come back and play in the future.' The former Liverpool striker hopes the Reds do well against Real Madrid in their Champions League clash . Suarez is likely to be given a warm reception from Ajax fans after scoring 111 goals for the Eredivisie side . In November 2010 Suarez bit PSV's Otman Bakkal during a bad tempered goalless draw, eventually being suspended for seven games. He only turned out twice more for Ajax after that, in the Champions League, before sealing his transfer to Liverpool, and the rest is history. Despite the incident and his departure, Suarez is still loved by Ajax fans who sang 'You'll never walk alone' to him during a farewell lap of the pitch. He will be in for a warm reception on Wednesday night as Amsterdam welcomes back home one of its favourite sons.","Barcelona travel to face Ajax in Champions League Group F clash .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted Robin van Persie was a ‘lucky boy’ not to have been dropped a fortnight ago after a poor spell of form. Van Persie, 31, will lead the line against Liverpool  after scoring three goals in his last three games, including a match-winning double at Southampton on Monday night. But Van Gaal indicated he was ready to leave out his fellow Dutchman — only to have his hand forced by injuries to other players. Louis van Gaal (left) admitted he was prepared to drop Robin van Persie during his off-form spell . Van Persie scores a brace in United's last game against Southampton - his third goal in three games . Van Persie played against Hull on November 29 under severe pressure after a run of one goal in six games and having only 13 touches in a win at Arsenal. But Falcao and James Wilson weren’t fit enough to start against Hull and though Wilson had recovered to face Stoke three days later, Wayne Rooney was missing because of a knee injury. Van Gaal said: ‘I am very happy for Van Persie that he is scoring goals. He wasn’t playing very well before but he was a lucky boy because Falcao was injured, Rooney can play in a lot of positions and Wilson is a young talent who has to show himself in training sessions. The Dutchman would have been on the bench had Radamel Falcao been fit enough to play . ‘I have always played with two strikers, only three or four times with one striker, so maybe he was lucky.’ Van Gaal says he will resist the temptation to rush back Angel Di Maria (hamstring) and Phil Jones (hamstring), although both are training. He expects Mario Balotelli to play some part for Liverpool today, saying of the Italian: ‘It is difficult for other teams to manage him, but it is also difficult for his team-mates!’","Manchester United face Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday .

"One of Britain’s most famous athletes was  drawn into an investigation on Saturday night after it was claimed that the sport’s governing body failed to act upon ‘suspicious’ drugs test samples. Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), told the Mail on Sunday he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up. In a scandal now engulfing the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), 225 athletes from 39 countries were revealed to have produced anomalous blood readings. They include three British athletes – one of whom is a household name and a star of track and field events. Dick Pound, a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up . The star’s name appears on a leaked list of 65 athletes whose tests scores were labelled ‘Suspicion Red’ – which experts say should have triggered an automatic check for the banned drug EPO. The drug helps deliver oxygen to muscles by stimulating the production of red blood cells. But amid mounting concerns that the IAAF did not conduct follow-up tests on most or all of the sportsmen and women, Mr Pound – one of the sport’s most senior figures – has been approached to establish what happened to the results. He said: ‘What I understood… was that a great number of cases came back and were short of something that could be declared positive, but whoever had done the analysis clearly thought that there was something afoot.’ The British star has so far declined to comment, yet the scandal has already claimed several high-ranking executives and shows little sign of abating. The ‘Suspicion Red’ list is among a cache of documents sourced by The Mail on Sunday and said to have come from a whistleblower at the IAAF’s Medical Commission. Although undated, the list is said to have been compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the introduction into athletics of much stricter tests for banned substances. It has been argued that it is unlikely any readings taken during this period could be used to investigate athletes retrospectively, but Mr Pound said it may be possible to uncover past violations of cheating if these readings are used in conjunction with frozen samples. While being named on the list does not provide conclusive evidence that the British star was taking banned substances, experts have said it raises serious questions about whether proper checks were made. Elsewhere in the documents are more detailed lists which do not mention the British athlete, but do suggest that World and Olympic champions showed abnormal blood values that strongly suggest the use of performance-enhancing drugs. These more detailed documents relate to tests taken between 2001 and 2006. The two other Britons named are less high-profile, and the level of suspicion is lower and coded ‘orange.’ The IAAF does not dispute the authenticity of the information, which was first obtained by the German television station ARD-WDR and broadcast in a documentary last month, without revealing any names, but it says it may not prove the stars had been cheating and suggested other factors might have produced high test results. However, on Saturday night the former head of Jamaica’s anti-doping commission described the IAAF’s response to the scandal as ‘completely unsatisfactory’ and suggested there was more to the list ‘than we are being told’. The British star has so far declined to comment, yet the scandal has already claimed several high-ranking executives and shows little sign of abating . Renee Anne Shirley, a respected campaigner for transparency in sport, added that the existence of the ‘red’ list ‘raises serious concerns about what happened next’. She said: ‘That is the real issue here. Being on such a list in the first place is in itself indicative that something irregular has been flagged up. ‘Did the IAAF target test the people on this list, as I would expect should have been the case, or not? And if not, why not? ‘I think there is more to this list than we have been told and the IAAF’s response so far is completely unsatisfactory. What did they find when they did further investigation? Did they in fact do anything? ‘With everything going on and so much uncertainty, it is simply unsatisfactory to say there is no problem and expect people to accept that blindly.’ Many of the names listed in the documents are accompanied by detailed readings of their blood values, with figures appearing under various headings. For instance, one is ‘hgb’ – haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood. The documents also record the altitude level – which can affect red blood cell count – at which the tests took place. Together, the results produce an overall figure known as the ‘off score’ level and anything over 125 is considered to be a marker of potential doping. The documents show that the highest ‘off score’ level for a male athlete was 167.63 – considered to be extraordinarily high – yet there is no record that he was charged with a doping offence. The highest ‘off score’ level for a female athlete is 170.03 and again there is no public record of the athlete being charged. More than a quarter of the athletes named in documents are Russian, lending credence to claims that Moscow operated an ‘East German-style’ doping regime. There is also a high number of Kenyans on the lists. The IAAF has claimed that it did follow up ‘suspicious’ readings of blood levels and exonerated many of the names. It emphasised the appearance of a name on a list marking suspicion did not indicate that a doping offence had taken place. IAAF general secretary Nick Davies has insisted that the mere presence of a suspicious value does not indicate a positive test, and that the information provided by the documents ‘was partial and misleading.’ Mr Pound said WADA's inquiry has 'resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious' He has also said in a statement that: ‘Athletes with a “red flag” reading may well be guilty of doping but equally – and we can prove it in the vast majority of cases – they may be innocent, which is why this information should have stayed locked up in a safe.’ On Saturday night, he told The Mail on Sunday in an email: ‘We welcome the intervention of WADA. In all our statements we have underlined that we will co-operate totally with WADA.’ Asked whether he believed the IAAF had followed up suspicious blood readings, he replied: ‘Yes – but let WADA do their work now.’ Mr Pound will establish the terms of reference for the WADA inquiry before deciding whether to accept the invitation to lead it. He said: ‘WADA has a general monitoring responsibility with respect to international standards and with respect to the anti-doping code. ‘We are meant to do that and it’s part of our mandate. And this is a specific inquiry that has resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious. ‘I think our stakeholders, the IOC, the international federations and the public authorities, would expect us to do something and our chairman has responded by saying yes indeed we agree and will set up a commission and give it the neces- sary resources to do whatever has to be done.’ There is already a separate IAAF ethics commission inquiry into the doping lists. Last week three key IAAF figures – treasurer Valetin Balaknichev, marketing consultant Massata Papa Diack, and legal adviser Habib Cisse – agreed to stand down while allegations against them were investigated by the ethics committee.

"Paul Ince isn’t standing outside The Red Lion to endorse the view held by Gary Neville that Sunday's ‘M62 Clasico’ between Manchester United and Liverpool is a glorified pub game. It is more a reminder that Ince is a unique Red Lion himself, the only player to captain both of England’s most successful clubs — and deadliest of rivals — in the past 50 years. In six seasons under Alex Ferguson at United between 1989 and 1995, Ince won six major trophies, including the club’s first League and FA Cup Double. Even surrounded by luminaries such as Roy Keane, Eric Cantona and a young Ryan Giggs, he was known as The Guv’nor. Paul Ince poses outside the Red Lion after Gary Neville likened Liverpool vs Manchester United to a pub game . Ince is the only player to have captained both Manchester United and Liverpool during his career . At Liverpool, he spent two seasons at the end of the Nineties helping to guide a new generation of stars dubbed The Spice Boys, including Jamie Redknapp, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and a little known teenager called Steven Gerrard. While not demeaning the current United and Liverpool teams to the extent of former team-mate Neville — who controversially claimed Sunday’s lunchtime contest could be like ‘the Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion’ — Ince, who has retained his independence by turning down television and ambassadorial work at both clubs, agrees these are not vintage times for his former sides. Taking United first, the former England captain says: ‘They’ve won their last five games but I watched them against Southampton and they were poor. I couldn’t work out how they were trying to play. United keep the ball but don’t seem to go anywhere with it. Just making 600 passes doesn’t make you a great team these days. Our 1994 team would have annihilated them. They’re not powerhouses . ‘I think Louis van Gaal is trying to do what he did with Holland but hasn’t got the players suited for it. ‘With Holland he had Nigel de Jong to sit in front of the back four so he could play 3-5-2. But I’ve seen United a few times this season and I don’t think they have any power in that midfield area. I’m not saying Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera and Daley Blind are bad players, but they’re not powerhouses. They haven’t got the legs. ‘Manchester City and Chelsea are better teams because they have power all over the pitch. Think about this Chelsea team; John Terry, Gary Cahill, Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa. There was a phase three or four years ago of looking at Spain and trying to get technical like them, because they had won the World Cup. That phase has gone. Power is more essential than these nice, technical players passing the ball. ‘United keep the ball but don’t seem to go anywhere with it. Just making 600 passes doesn’t make you a great team these days.’ Robin van Persie scores against Southampton to extend United's winning run to five games . Ince insists United's 1994 double winning side would have easily beaten the club's current crop . The way Ince describes today’s Premier League, it sounds ideal for the 1994 Double-winning side he played in. Peter Schmeichel, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Mark Hughes, Keane, Cantona and Ince himself provided physicality and leadership in abundance, Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis speed on the flanks. ‘That United team would have beaten this current side without a doubt — it’s a no-brainer,’ said Ince. ‘The 1994 side was the best ever, I honestly believe that. Look at who we had; Cantona and Hughes, Keane, Robson, Bruce, Pallister, we were also good players. We would steamroller them. They have tried to buy five or six new players to share the goals and it hasn’t materialised. ]You need those top strikers. City have Aguero, Chelsea have Costa, even at the bottom Burnley have Ings . ‘Obviously the game is different now and you can’t tackle as much — you have to factor that in — but when you compare that team to the team now, we’d annihilate them.’ To be even-handed, Ince is happy to assess Liverpool, too, following their disappointing Champions League exit on top of some indifferent Premier League form. ‘Quite apart from Luis Suarez, I can’t understand why Daniel Agger left in the summer,’ says Ince. ‘I thought he was fantastic and left-sided centre-halves are priceless. Instead of spending £20million on Dejan Lovren, they could have saved the money. I’d have spent whatever it took on a great striker like Edinson Cavani or Radamel Falcao, make a statement to replace Suarez and the 35 goals he scored. Instead they tried to buy five or six new players to share the goals around and it hasn’t materialised. ‘You need top strikers. City have Sergio Aguero, Chelsea have Costa, even at the bottom of the table QPR have Charlie Austin and Burnley have Danny Ings. Top clubs need more than one. When City lose Aguero, they bring in Edin Dzeko. Liverpool lose Daniel Sturridge and nobody is scoring.’ Liverpool have been left downcast after their elimination from the Champions League by Basle . Ince was charged with taking care of the so-called 'Spice Boys' during his time at Anfield . Listening to Ince speak — fittingly the interview takes place in Warrington equidistant between Manchester and Liverpool — you can hear the passion still burns bright. He still wants to succeed as a manager, despite his last job at Blackpool ending in the sack last January, and recalls with fervour the atmosphere in the dressing-room before big United-Liverpool games. ‘With United at Anfield, there was always a lot of noise — “Let’s get into them”. I was vocal, Brucey was vocal, Keano was vocal. Even Denis Irwin would be shouting and he was the quietest one there. It was different at Old Trafford. We’d be focused, almost silent in concentration. Sometimes the manager [Ferguson] would get worried it was so quiet and gee us up — “Come on lads, are we up for this?” But we knew what we needed to do. ‘When I was at Liverpool, United were top dogs. We’d go to Old Trafford a bit apprehensive, wondering what would happen. One reason I am looking forward to this game is that neither team will be frightened of the other one. ‘I think Van Gaal might go four at the back and have a real go at Liverpool. But Brendan Rodgers will fancy getting at United’s defence.’ Ince goes in for a tackle on United's Paul Scholes during the 'M62 Clasico' in 1998 . Steven Gerrard celebrates after scoring in Liverpool's 3-0 defeat of United at Old Trafford last season . Ince, 47, has good friends in both camps. He was in the Liverpool team when Gerrard made his debut against Blackburn 16 years ago. ‘For me, Stevie G should be the first name on the Liverpool teamsheet,’ he stresses. ‘It is sad his contract situation has been allowed to fester. You shouldn’t give anyone a contract out of sentiment but look at what he’s still doing for the club. He’s only 34 and the team struggled against Sunderland without him. ‘I remember strolling around in a training game when this little rascal steamed into me. I was angry and asked what he was doing, and he told me to “f***ng shut up!” I asked Jamie Redknapp who this upstart was. “That’s Stevie G”, he replied. You could tell he wanted it so much and what he’s done for Liverpool will never be repeated. Now he has to make a decision about his future. If he doesn’t want to stay, to be in and out of the team, there will be no shame in him going to another club, but hopefully abroad! I think he’s got lots to offer. When you’ve got his experience, even when you don’t play well, you help your team-mates play better.’ For United today, Ince’s pal Giggs will be in the home dug-out next to Van Gaal. ‘I’ve seen a change in Giggsy. When I started my coaching badges, he said he wouldn’t bother with all that. Yet there he was last summer with Gary Neville and myself finishing our pro licenses together! Ince would like to return to club management after spells with clubs including Blackpool and Blackburn . Ince is slightly surprised that Ryan Giggs has moved into management at Louis van Gaal's assistant . ‘I’m sure Giggsy will tell the new United players about what this game means to the fans.’ Giggs had four matches in charge of the first team last season after David Moyes was sacked but Ince doesn’t think it was necessarily a dress rehearsal. ‘He told me he loved every minute but I don’t think United can be his first permanent management job, and he won’t think it can be,’ said Ince, who began as a boss at League Two Macclesfield. ‘People will say if things don’t go well for Van Gaal, Giggs will get the hot-seat, but that is miles away for me. You have to learn your trade outside the Premier League. Giggsy’s not fussed, he knows that. If they turn around and offer him the job, he can’t say no, but he is prepared to go down the levels to learn his trade.’","Liverpool face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Premier League matches will be played on Friday nights from summer 2016 under the next TV deal but the Mail on Sunday can reveal that another more radical proposal — league games played overseas — will not happen for the foreseeable future. Fan power has seen the idea shelved, perhaps for good. The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore wants overseas games to happen, following the lead of the most lucrative sports league in the world, the NFL. Most of the Premier League’s clubs, led by the major foreign-owned sides, want them to happen. Meaningful games in foreign host cities could earn tens of millions per match. But home-based supporters’ opposition seems to have kiboshed the notion. Premier League stars such as Oliver Giroud (above) are set to be a hit around the world . The Premier League’s chief executive Richard Scudamore (centre) wants overseas games to happen . Sergio Aguero, November's Premier League player of the month, could now be scoring goals on a Friday . ‘The clubs are keen for us to keep developing the concept but we’re no nearer,’ said Scudamore, who first proposed in 2008 that a ‘39th game’ be played abroad each year, in an exclusive interview. ‘The idea of an extra game is gone. Whether you play a regular season game (overseas), that has challenges, not least among the fans, which we take into consideration. ‘I’ve never shied away from the fact that personally I think it’s a good idea. I bear the scars from thinking it’s a good idea. A lot of the clubs think it’s a good idea... but there is absolutely no time line and no idea when it might happen.’ Asked to confirm that an overseas game will not happen foreseeably, in the next TV round and before 2020 at the earliest, Scudamore said: ‘You can make that assumption.’ Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal . The Premier League tender document for UK live TV rights for 2016-19 is just dropping on the desks of senior executives at major broadcasters. The Premier League will sell 168 live games per season to UK television from 2016-17 to 2018-2019, up from 154 games now. Those games will be sold in seven packages, five of 28 games and two of 14 per year, and about 10 games per season will be on Friday nights. No buyer will be allowed more than 126 games per season. The Premier League currently make £3.018billion from Sky and BT for domestic live rights for 2013-16 and about £2.9bn more combined from foreign live rights (£2.2bn), highlights, near-live rights and mobile clip rights. These massive sums flow to the clubs, who in turn spend it buying and paying big-name players, most of them foreign, and therefore attractive to global audiences. So a ‘virtuous circle’ of growth continues. BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013 . The Premier League will soon boast the second biggest annual income from broadcast rights in the world, according to a report from industry specialists TV Sports Markets. The English top flight currently sits in third place, behind the figures for American football and baseball in the US. But the next TV deal could soar to £7.5bn between 2016-19, an annual income of £2.5bn, which would take the Premier League second. And 38 per cent of the League’s broadcast income is from overseas, already the highest ratio by far in the world. 1 NFL £4.14billion . (American football income from broadcast rights in 2014) 2 MLB £1.94billion . (American baseball) 3 Premier League £1.91billion . (Domestic and overseas income) 4 NBA £1.21billion . (American basketball) 5 Champions League . 6 Serie A . 7 Olympics . 8 NHL . 9 Ligue 1 (France) 10 La Liga (Spain) Analysts and insiders have contrasting views of how much these deals could grow but everyone agrees they will grow. It would be no surprise to see the total three-year pot soar from £5.9bn to £7.5bn, and if major new players such as Qatar-owned beIN SPORTS come to the table for the UK rights, as long suggested, it could yet be more. The Premier League’s global appeal is being highlighted this weekend at ‘BPL Live’, a huge public event in Mumbai, India, where 20,000 fans from the sub-continent are gathering in a public park, essentially to watch Premier League matches on a big screen. Yesterday they watched Chelsea play Hull on one screen and Leicester host Manchester City on another. Today they will be treated to Manchester United against Liverpool. There is also a tented village where fans can be photographed with the Premier League trophy, visit exhibitions by the League’s clubs and meet a range of ‘legends’ including former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. Vijay Kuppili, a 30-year-old manager with an online company, has made a two-hour flight from his home town in south-east India specifically to attend BPL Live this weekend. ‘I’ve been following the Premier League for 10 years, since Arsenal’s Invincibles,’ he said, although he is a Manchester United fan, through admiration of Sir Alex Ferguson’s management and teams. He and college mates, variously fans of United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, watched whatever games they could as students in their communal digs, and remain hard-core fans today. Interest has also soared again in the past year, he says, because the coverage within India has improved, with more games and higher broadcasting standards. The NFL has made lucrative sums of money by staging a host of games at Wembley Stadium . Colin Kaepernick scores a touchdown for the San Francisco 49s against Jacksonville Jaguars in London . That can be explained by STAR TV’s investment. The rights holders on the sub-continent paid £93m for their current three-year rights, up from £29m previously. They have also invested in new commentators, some of them trained in England by veterans including Sky’s Martin Tyler, and now offer games in multiple languages. ‘Football is an aspirational sport and India has a committed fan following for the Barclays Premier League,’ said STAR’s chief operating officer, Sanjay Gupta. ‘BPL Live is a great initiative to take fans closer to the game, its iconic clubs and legendary heroes.’ Schmeichel, in Mumbai to help promote the event, said interest in the Premier League in India is ‘massive’. He has also travelled extensively as a United ambassador and adds: ‘Every time I go somewhere I’m still genuinely taken aback at how big United are.’ Champions Manchester City are set for Premier League games on a Friday night under a new rights package . Yesterday he went to the Leicester City tent at BPL Live to have a FaceTime chat with his son Kasper, Leicester’s goalkeeper, back home. ‘I was surprised to see how many people were in there, the interest here is in the League as a whole, not just one club,’ Schmeichel Snr said. ‘There are people in Chelsea shirts, and United, Liverpool, but also Leicester and other clubs.’ Scudamore sees India as one of eight key ‘strategic’ international markets where the rights values can soar in the 2016-19 sales round. The USA and China are also in that bracket. ‘The size of the market, the potential growth in the market and also the appetite of local partners to develop that market — when you get those three things coming together, that’s what determines it,’ he explained. He knows that the League is most likely to see a surge in TV income in any market, domestic or foreign, where two or more rival broadcasters both desperately want the rights. Chelsea fans sing during the Barclays Premier League 'Live' event in Mumbai, India . ‘Growth tends to be driven, historically, by competitive tension,’ he said. ‘Where there is competitive tension our rights grow and where there isn’t any they tend not to grow. Therefore it’s difficult to forecast. But do I see headroom? Yes. Do I see growth? Yes.’ Independent analysts agree. Kevin McCullagh of industry specialists TV Sports Markets, said: ‘The Premier League’s international rights value is the envy of sports properties around the world, including the biggest US leagues such as the NFL, MLB, and NBA. ‘There is still room for growth in Premier League international rights values. Crucially, it is popular in many regions with growing pay-television industries, such as in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Latin America. Pay-television has been the big driver of sports rights values around the world. It is also benefiting from the rise of football in the US — football rights fees have been growing strongly there in recent years.’","The Premier League will sell 168 live games per season to UK television from 2016-17 to 2018-2019, up from 154 games now .

"Sachin Tendulkar has poured cold water on any lingering hope that England may spring a surprise at next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The 41-year-old, speaking at Lord’s during the launch of his new autobiography 'Playing It My Way', doesn't see Peter Moores's side competing Down Under in February. England face India in a triangular series in Australia ahead of February's showpiece - one they are expected to struggle in given the turmoil to have engulfed the team over the last 12 months. James Anderson (left) and England captain Alastair Cook celebrate the Test series win over India in August . But Cook and coach Peter Moores (right) are not expected to make England competitive at the World Cup . And Tendulkar - almost a year to the day since his final Test match against the West Indies - can’t think of any reason for those gloomy predictions to be wrong. 'I don't think so, sorry,' he said when asked of England's chances. 'Anything is possible in this sport but going by the current form I don't think England will be that competitive.’ They are in disarray having won just one one-day international series this year - that came against the equally shambolic West Indies in March - and serious questions remain over who will make the plane or whether captain Alastair Cook should be on it. Scotland coach Paul Collingwood is even plotting their downfall when the sides meet on February 23 in Christchurch. 'I can't pinpoint one team but there are a few competitive teams. I'd like to name Australia, South Africa... New Zealand are a dark horse. India. I think these four would be my semi-finalists,’ Tendulkar added. 'I feel India can surprise a lot of guys and believe the spinners will come into play. You talk about pitches conducive to fast bowlers but because of the size of the grounds I think spinners will come into it.’ His book is dedicated to 'all of my fellow Indians' and the former batsman speaks glowingly about the emergence of the IPL - although admitting initial doubts over its legitimacy in terms of quality - while also documenting the anguish he felt in search of a hundredth 100. The varying merits of the three formats have been hotly debated in his homeland, but Tendulkar - who has scored more runs and centuries than anyone else - left it in no doubt his preferred form. Sachin Tendulkar was speaking at his book launch in Canary Wharf in London on Friday . It has been a year since India legend Tendulkar retired from cricket after a lengthy career . 'Test cricket will always be right at the top,' he added. 'I think for Test cricket we had some decent crowds. If you go to most of the players they will back Test cricket as No 1. 'Twenty20 has opened up a bigger audience. 'Somebody who likes T20 can be converted. 'Its impossible to keep each format a popular as each other. T20 is exciting and allows you to be innovative. In Test cricket batsmen are prepared to play reverse sweeps. I don't remember anyone bowling slower ball bouncers in the 90s.' Tendulkar made it clear he had not published a book in order to create headlines and had just one line on Kevin Pietersen's recently-published autobiography: 'I think certain things should stay in the dressing room.'","Sachin Tendulkar doesn't see England being contenders at the World Cup .

"England have wrapped Jimmy Anderson in cotton wool by ruling him out of their one-day tour of Sri Lanka to safeguard his fitness for the World Cup. England’s prize bowling asset was troubled by his left knee during the summer and was still feeling it when he joined up with the rest of the 50-over squad on Tuesday at the start of their three-day training camp in Loughborough. Now he will miss the seven-match one-day series in Sri Lanka, which starts on November 26, along with his strike partner Stuart Broad, who is still recovering from an operation on his right knee. James Anderson has been ruled out of England's ODI tour to Sri Lanka with a knee injury . First ODI - November 26, Colombo (9am BST) Second ODI - November 29, Colombo (4.30am) Third ODI - December 3, Hambantota (9am) Fourth ODI - December 6, Colombo (4.30am) Fifth ODI - December 10, Pallekele (9am) Sixth ODI - December 13, Pallekele (4.30am) Seventh ODI - December 16, Colombo (9am) England remain confident that both will be fit and ready for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February but there will remain a question mark over both crucial figures until they are ready to bowl again. Anderson has now been told to rest but hopes to continue his recovery in South Africa before Christmas with the England Performance Programme and if all goes well he will return for the triangular series that precedes the World Cup. England do not plan to call up a replacement to face Sri Lanka, meaning more opportunities for the likes of Steven Finn, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes and all-rounder Ben Stokes. However, not having a bowler who has taken 257 wickets in 184 one-day internationals is a blow to England’s hopes of upsetting Sri Lanka in their own conditions in a crucial segment of their World Cup preparations.

"In the cloakroom of the Bristol Hawks gymnastics club, 10 pairs of tiny shoes are lined up. They belong to toddlers making their first foray into a world of tumbling and soaring leaps in the ground-floor gymnasium. Not so long ago Claudia Fragapane was among them. Still only 17, she now trains alone on the top floor of this huge warehouse-style building in Easton, an inner city area of Bristol. The roofs of the neighbouring back-to-back terraced houses are visible from the windows as she bounces across the sprung floor, keenly observed by coaching duo Helen Potter and Rory Weaver. Gymnastics still holds the same magic for Fragapane as it did when she first left her shoes at the door more than a decade ago, but it is serious business, too. Claudia Fragapane receives the SJA Committee Award in the SJA Sports Awards in December 2014 . Fragapane in action during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow earlier in the year . The 4ft 6in powerhouse, is tipped to evolve into Britain’s greatest gymnast. This summer she became the first Englishwoman in 84 years to win four gold medals at the Commonwealth Games and at the World Gymnastics Championships in China in October she made four individual finals. ‘I’ve been amazed by it all,’ says Fragapane, words tumbling from her mouth as quickly as she spins through the air. ‘If someone asked me before I would have said “No way will I do all that”. It’s not so much the feeling of winning I love but the feeling of doing something to the best of my ability.’ In Glasgow she won vault, floor, all-around and team gold. She has been recognised with a dizzy whirl of award nominations and is a strong favourite to follow Tom Daley and Wayne Rooney by winning the BBC’s Young Sports Personality of the Year today, from a shortlist of three with para-cyclist Sophie Thornhill and golfer Bradley Neil. ‘The awards are a nice chance to dress up,’ says Fragapane. ‘In training I don’t make an effort at all, I just chuck my hair up. We’ve got a rule that we can be as scruffy and vile as we want and nobody will mind.’ Here the focus has already turned to the Rio Olympics in 2016. Fragapane is taking advantage of a break between sessions, leaning against the wall of the gym demolishing sandwiches from her lunch box. She has spent the morning working on a new, more tricky vault. By the time Rio comes round, they want to challenge North Korea’s Hong Un Jong, currently the world’s best on the apparatus. Talk about Olympic medals is kept to a minimum but Potter, herself a former Great Britain gymnast, acknowledges that Fragapane has the potential to deliver four medals in Brazil, when she will still be just 18. ‘At the World Championships (in Nanning in October) you could sense countries like Russia were watching us in the gym,’ says Potter. ‘They have seen what we’ve done at the Commonwealths and in Europe and they now know we’re a legitimate threat.’ Fragapane on the beam during the 2014 Commonwealth games . Fragapane is only 17-years-old and is four foot and six inches tall but being smaller can be an advantage . It is not until you see Fragapane in the flesh that you get a sense of the phenomenal power she generates with her bulging thighs and rippling shoulders. Gone are the days of Soviet Bloc domination where only those built like classical ballet dancers, Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci, among others, could succeed. The reigning world all-around champion, Simone Biles, of the United States is a stocky 4ft 7in, while Shawn Johnson, a 2008 Olympic champion, is a similar build to Fragapane. ‘Gymnastics is one of the few sports where being small can be an advantage,’ says Potter. ‘Claudia has an advantage when it comes to doing multiple somersaults. She’d probably have been a good diver. Or the Cirque du Soleil would love her.’ At 5ft 1in, Claudia’s father Paolo is the tallest of the entire Fragapane clan, so she is unlikely to grow into a giant over the next few years, much to her disappointment. ‘I’d like to grow so people don’t look at me twice and be like “How old is she?” because I do have an older face,’ says Fragapane. Paolo, who migrated to England as a schoolboy, and Fragapane’s mother Teresa met in Bristol and swiftly discovered they both originate from Sicilian villages just 40 minutes apart. They now have five daughters and Claudia falls in the middle. ‘I love my women,’ says Paolo, whose accent is a curious mix of Italian and Bristolian. ‘They are all positive people and I think Claudia has always been a performer. She’s not a show-off but we are not quiet people.’ Fragapane (centre) celebrates a gold medal with Ruby Harold (left) and Hannah Whelan (right) Fragapane pictured competing in the floor final during the Commonwealth games . After Fragapane’s success at the Commonwealth Games, Paolo held a party at the Noah’s Ark play centre in Brislington which he owns and runs with daughter Lorenza, 26. ‘We got all the families together, about 300 people, we Italians like the big gatherings, I can name you up to my third cousin. Back in my home village of Santa Elizabetta, the consulate spread the news to the locals about Claudia being a descendant of the village.’ Paolo is a genial character but he puts his foot down when it comes to boyfriends. ‘I don’t get close to the boyfriends because I’d like them to get married or at least know they’re properly together before that,’ he says. ‘Claudia is not having a boyfriend until she’s 35. She says 18 but I’ve said it has to be a prince, not an actual prince, rather a good bloke, but she doesn’t have to know that yet.’ Having finished school in the summer, Fragapane spends 35 hours a week in the gym. Both Potter and Weaver spend twice that amount, factoring in time spent searching for floor routine music, devising new moves and keeping an eye on her competition. Fragapane has set her focus upon success during the Olympic games in Rio, Brazil in 2016 . Fragapane is one of the favourites to win BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year . Her floor routine in Nanning broke new ground with break-dance style moves interspersed with traditional but exquisitely executed tumbles and twists. ‘We didn’t think of it as break-dancing,’ says Weaver. ‘It actually came about because she was resting her feet, but it fitted well with the music. Claudia has this cheeky grin which she flashes the judges and you can’t take your eyes off her. Her sister Chiara is exactly the same.’ Fragapane is coaching eight-year-old Chiara as part of a group twice a week. ‘She treats me like a coach,’ she says. ‘I like the fact I can relate to them (the children) because I’m doing it at the moment.

"A teenage boy is believed to have fatally shot himself while chatting with a friend on FaceTime, the day before his 16th birthday . Blake Hannett, 15, from Lynwood, Illinois, died after the weapon went off and the screen on his phone went blank on Thursday, police have said. Officers found the teenager at his desk with a .38 caliber handgun on the floor under his chair. Victim: Blake Hannett, 15, from Lynwood, Illinois, died after the weapon went off and the screen went blank on Thursday, police have said. He had been chatting to a friend on FaceTime . According to ABC 7, Blake's family said his death was an accident. They claim the teen had searched his house for the gun after he had heard a noise, fearing it was an intruder. He was apparently more concerned than usual because a suspicious person had been in the neighborhood in the last few days. Hundreds of students have paid tribute to the Marian Catholic High School student who was a member of the marching band. A memorial was held at the school and memorial covered in flowers was placed in the middle of the school hall. Marian Catholic High School Principal Steve Tortorello told the station: 'He was a wonderful kid, a top-notch kid, the kind of kid that really represented our school and we're just terribly hurt by his loss. 'Blake was a solid student who always brought life to the classroom. He's the kind of kid that you knew was in class that day because he was a bright and friendly kid.' Marian Catholic Band Director Greg Bimm paid tribute to Blake saying: 'There are leaders who just change the spirit, he was one of the guys. His smile changed us all.' Police have said the investigation is still ongoing. It is unknown whether the friend he was speaking to at the time witnessed his death. A friend Jon Michalski wrote on Facebook: Blake was the best friend anyone could ask for, you couldn't ask for any one better. He always knew how to put a smile on mine and everybody else's face no matter what. 'He was that one person who could get along with anyone. And if you've read any of the news posts you would read about how he has a contagious priceless smile, this is so true.'

"David Moyes was still barking out the orders in English on the rain-swept pitches of Real Sociedad's Zubieta training ground this week, shouting: 'Chance to score, you should score!' at players over-elaborating in front of goal in the morning six-a-sides. It will be a while before he's directing his new charges in Spanish but ahead of his first Basque derby on Sunday night, midfielder Esteban Granero has reassured him: 'Nothing is being lost in translation'. Moyes has already been teased for a recent press conference when he dared try out his first few words in Spanish 'dos, tres, cuatro' before reverting to English but Granero knows all about the language barrier from his days playing under Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers. David Moyes speaks with the bench during a La Liga match between Real Sociedad and Elche . Former Real Madrid and QPR midfielder Esteban Granero has every faith that Moyes will succeed in Spain . The midfielder claims he finds Moyes' accent easier to undertstand than his former boss Harry Redknapp . 'Harry's accent was tough, David is easier to understand,' says the former Real Madrid midfielder who also played under Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. 'We have a translator who is doing an excellent job and English is not such a strange language for us to understand. There are five or six players who speak the language and our goalkeeper Eñaut Zubikarai has also started classes.' Granero was the player Moyes mistakenly referred to Stefano in his opening match in charge but the midfielder has pointed to another top British coach who thrived in San Sebastian without having the greatest command of Spanish. John Toshack won the Spanish cup in 1987 with La Real but was also famous for turning standard English phrases such as 'headless chicken' and 'pigs might fly' directly into Spanish, much to the amusement and bemusement of fans. Granero said: 'Toshack is a legend here and not just because of those phrases, but it's true they only added to the legend. We have a very important job to do here and that eclipses everything else. There might be a little thing that makes you laugh from time to time but that in no way affects the authority of the manager. We know he is the boss and we are ready to follow what he asks of us. 'He has arrived at a moment when we have more desire than ever to learn and improve. Anything he says to us, to that end, be it in Spanish, English or Chinese is important and will be taken in.' John Toshack became a legend with La Real after introducing his own phrases to the Spanish vocabulary . Real Sociedad have not posed as great a threat this season after selling star player Antoine Griezmann . New signing Alfred Finnbogason has struggled to score following his 7.5m euros move . Granero has played for Harry Redknapp, Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini in his career . Moyes has not got it easy. The team reached the Champions League two seasons ago and finished seventh last year but much of that was down to French winger Antoine Griezmann who scored 16 goals in the last campaign but moved to Atletico Madrid in the summer for 30m euros. The club spent 7.5m euros of that money on a new record signing before the season started brining in 25-year-old Icelandic international Alfred Finnbogason but after one training session this week he could be seen being given one-to-one tuition on receiving the ball on the half turn by Moyes' new assistant Billy McKinlay – basic stuff for such an expensive acquisition. The new striker has so far been a massive disappointment, and elsewhere the squad could do with a couple of new signings, preferably in January. The biggest single message from the manger to his players since he arrived a month ago has been to drive home the need for greater intensity and aggression and it is a message that Granero, as a former Mourinho player, is no stranger to. 'For Mourinho the aggression was very important,' he says. 'We were up against a Barcelona side at their absolute peak and it was almost impossible to get the ball off of them yet we still managed to win the league and beat them in the Cup Final and that was due, in no small part, to us imposing ourselves physically. 'At QPR Harry was the same; he wanted his team to be aggressive. In the Premier League if you are not aggressive then you don't touch the ball. 'When I first moved to England I would find myself stopping during games thinking that the referee was going to give a foul but the whistle never came. It took me a while to readjust when I came back to Spain. David will get used to the different refereeing here.' Granero takes the ball past Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke during a La Liga game this season . The Spanish midfielder believes there is very little difference between the Premier League and La Liga . Moyes watches over a training session ahead of his first home game in charge at the Estadio Anoeta . That reference to the match officials is an important one. Moyes can demand his team be more physical but he has to factor in the philosophy of many match officials that every foul is a yellow card. There will be other cultural differences to be overcome but Granero says Premier League football and La Liga fútbol are no longer miles apart in terms of style. 'Give it a few more years and there will be almost no difference at all,' he says. 'Where there is a still a difference perhaps is with the forming of young players and how good the youth academies are in Spain but the British aren't stupid and they know that mixing the aggression and the physicality of their football with a better way of educating young players - something they have been doing for the last six or seven years will end up giving them a very strong team. Give it another decade maximum and England will have one of the strongest teams in Europe again.' Granero speaks positively about Moyes since his arrival at Sociedad . One of the special things about Sunday night's derby is that almost all the players on both sides will be homegrown. Athletic Bilbao retain their Basque-only policy and Real Sociedad still learn heavily on their Zubieta accademy. Moyes was five games into his reign as Manchester United manager last season when he faced his first Manchester derby. On Sunday night he finds himself facing his first Basque derby, once again, five games into a new job. United were beaten 4-1 by Manchester City last September and it was the first sign that not everyone was playing for the new man. It's a very different scenario at La Real where players have been buoyed by his arrival. Granero believes he can lead them back towards the Champions League. Moyes looks downcast while losing the Manchester derby 4-1 to fierce rivals City in September 2013 . Granero called on the advice of his close friend Juan Mata (left) after Moyes was appointed manager . Moyes was brought to the Spanish club to realise their ambition of returning top the Champions League . He said: 'That is the challenge. The president wants it and I think the coach has come for that. We achieved it last season and we want it again. We know we have to go one step at a time but we have to be confident and ambitious. 'We know we have to improve and we look to David as the key to that. He has prestige as a coach and this is a prestigious club. His ideas are very clear and he is really motivated. He wants to coach a big club and we want that the big club to be Real Sociedad. Getting back in the Champions League is the challenge; it is what we all want.' Granero was straight on to the phone to close friend Juan Mata when Moyes was confirmed as his new coach. 'He spoke very highly of him. We all know what the big clubs are like – the criticism comes quickly and the coach always pays. But Juan said to me that he was unlucky there and that he would have liked for them to have shown a little bit more patience with him. Their loss is now our gain.' The Basque derby is Spain's friendliest derby. 'Not unlike the Merseyside derby' says Granero who played in two West London derbies in his season under Redknapp. He won the fixture at Stamford Bridge getting the better of Rafa Benitez in charge at the time. Granero also played for current Manchester City manager Pellegrini at Real Madrid and comparing the Chilean to Mourinho he said: 'They are a lot more alike than people would imagine. They each project a very different image but the reality is Pellegrini shows plenty of fire in the dressing room and Mourinho usually stays very calm.' Manuel Pellegrini is more calm in the dressing room than Jose Mourinho, says Granero . Granero insists there is more than meets the eye with his former boss Redknapp . He also says Redknapp does not quite fit the image he projects. 'There is more to Harry than meets the eye. He is a lot more studious and far more on top of things tactically than it seems. He can seem to be someone who is not completely on top of the training sessions but he is aware of everything that is happening. He is very intelligent. You don't stay in football that long without that intelligence.' If Moyes wants to stay in Spanish football at Real Sociedad long term, getting the better of La Real's local rivals will be vital. His side will move to within two points of Athletic Bilbao if they can get the win the game. There has been a warm welcome for him on Spain's cold, wet northern coast. 'He has come to the right place,' says Granero. 'We hope he stays.'","David Moyes is preparing Real Sociedad for derby against Athletic Bilbao .

"Apple has faced criticism over the past week for copying many Android features on its larger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but it appears this imitation goes both ways. Just days after Apple added encryption by default to iOS 8, Google has announced its next-generation Android software will equally prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information. As with Apple’s security tool, only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running Android L will be able to access the files on it. Scroll down for video . Google is set to release its Android L software (pictured left) next month. Once installed, it will encrypt data by default, and only people with the device or smartwatch's (Moto 360 pictured right) password will be able to access the files - preventing the police and governments getting access to it using a search warrant . As with Apple, this means that if search warrants are served on Google for the customer's information, it won't legally be able to get hold of it. Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of Android Jelly Bean. Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature on Android Jelly Bean. However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed. To enable encryption on devices running Android KitKat or Jelly Bean, plug the phone or tablet into charge. Make sure the device remains connected to the power cable throughout. Go to Setting, Security and select Screen Lock. Choose a PIN or password and follow the steps. Select the Encrypt option when prompted. Encryption can take up to an hour, depending on how many files are stored on the device. However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed. Any devices that upgrade to Android L next month will have this tool turned on by default, but it can’t be disabled. ‘As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on, ’ said Google’s director of global communications and public affairs Niki Christoff. ‘For over three years Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.’ Earlier this week, Apple launched a new Privacy page, and the firm's chief executive Tim Cook wrote an open letter to customers. Mr Cook said: ‘At Apple, your trust means everything to us. 'We’re publishing this website to explain how we handle your personal information, what we do and don’t collect, and why. ‘A few years ago, users of internet services began to realise that when an online service is free, you’re not the customer. You’re the product. ‘But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn’t come at the expense of your privacy.’ Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of Android Jelly Bean (pictured). However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed . According to Apple's new privacy site, on devices running iOS 8, personal data including photos, messages - including attachments - email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders are placed under the protection of a user’s passcode. ‘Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,’ continued the firm. ‘So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8.

Mr Cook wrote: 'Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to warrants from devices running iOS 8' In March, Google published a video that detailed the process it takes when responding to search warrants from law enforcement officers and governments (screengrab pictured). Under the new rules, Google will be able to legally decline requests for any information protected by a passcode, by default . The reference to competitors is believed to have been an attack on Google, which the firm has countered with its Android L encryption announcement today. The rollout of new software to Google devices, however, is significantly slower than Apple. Apple can push updates to every device because it owns the hardware, but Android runs on the devices of multiple manufacturers, which will have to roll out Android L individually. This could take months, if not years. And data stored on Google Drive, as with iCloud, is not encrypted automatically, so could still be retrieved with the appropriate warrant.

One couple - Moon Ray, 25 and Jason, 29, were among seven people in new York queuing up a week ago. They travelled over 1,000 miles (1,609km) from Jackson, Mississippi and arrived in New York on September 1 to find that they were not first in the queue, because cousins and New Yorkers Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo had beaten them to it. The Mississippi couple paid $2,500 (£1,500) to swap places with the cousins.

While some people camping out 10 days before release are genuine fans, waiting to get their hands on the handset, others hope to sell their place in line. One person camped out in London (store pictured right) is hoping to get £1,000 for their efforts - which could buy them a couple of handsets at a later date . A couple who travelled more than 1,000 miles to stand in line outside the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, New York, have paid $2,500 (£1,500) to be first in line. Moon Ray 25, and her husband Jason, 29 travelled from Jackson, Mississippi on September 1 to discover there was already a queue outside the shop. Cousins Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo from Statten Island, New York had beaten them to it by one day – but happily accepted the money to switch places. ‘We take turns going to the bathroom and washing and working out at the gym nearby,’ Ms Moon said . ‘We only sleep a couple of hours a night - I brought a tent but cried when they told me I couldn’t use it.’ Joseph, who was third in line last week, is a veteran at waiting in line for Apple product, having camped out for new releases before. Ms Moon said: ‘People passing by say all sorts of things to us - they think we’re crazy.’ One of the tents is being manned by Task Rabbit, an online company that outsources household errands, after being paid by a client to queue up on their behalf. Uma Subramanian of the firm, said: ‘We’re taking it in turns to man the tent for a client who requested our services online. I cannot say how much he paid us or who he is, because that’s confidential, but our workers charge between £10 and £20 an hour for whatever activity they have been paid to do.’ Apple unveiled its latest smartphone last week alongside its much hyped Apple Watch.

"Parents were ordered to send their children to a workshop on Islam or have them labelled  as racist for the rest of their  school career. They were sent a letter warning that the primary school pupils would have a ‘racial discrimination note’ put on their records if they did not go. Families were told to pay £5 per child for the Explore Islam trip next Wednesday to Staffordshire University, which would involve Year 4 and Year 6 children being shown Islamic artefacts. Parents accused Littleton Green community school of 'blackmailing' children to go to a workshop on Islam . The letter: Parents were sent a letter which threatened to brand their children 'racist' if they didn't go . Mothers and fathers were warned: ‘Refusal to allow your child to attend will result in a Racial Discrimination note being attached to your child’s education record, which will remain on this file throughout their school career. ‘All absences on this day will be investigated for their credibility and will only be sanctioned with a GP sick note.’ Yesterday parents at Littleton Green Community School in Huntington, Staffordshire, said the threat to the pupils aged between eight and 11 was ‘ludicrous’. Gillian Claridge, 55, said: ‘How dare they threaten to brand the children racist at such a young age? It’s going to make them feel like little criminals. ‘The very nature of religion is all about choice. On this occasion they were not being given any choice at all. It was a draconian move and it’s left a lot of parents fuming.’ Stacy Waldron, 26, whose eight-year-old daughter is a pupil, said: ‘I feel my child will be [seen as] racist if I don’t allow her to go. This is my choice, not hers, and she shouldn’t have to pay for it.’ South Staffordshire MP Gavin  Williamson described the threat  as ‘bonkers’ and ‘a very heavy-handed approach’. Parents were sent a text telling them to pay £5 towards transport for the trip to Staffordshire University . Headmistress Lynn Small had to apologise for her original letter and wrote to parents again last night asking them to 'disregard' what she had said . He added: ‘The idea of attaching a “racial discrimination note” to children’s education records saying it will remain on their file for the duration for their school career seems unfair, particularly when it is not the child’s decision whether or not he or she attends.’ According to the letter sent last Wednesday, the visit is part of  the National Curriculum for religious education and also reflects ‘the multi-cultural community in which we live’. It went on: ‘It is a statutory requirement for primary school children to experience and learn about different cultures. 'The workshop will give your child the opportunity to explore other religions. ‘Children will be looking at religious artefacts similar to those that would be on display in a museum. They will not be partaking in any religious practices. ‘If you would like to discuss this further, please contact our RE  co-ordinator, Mrs Edmonds.’ However, the school backtracked just one day later after council officers intervened. Littleton Green community school in Huntington, Staffordshire, was told it 'required improvement' by Ofsted . A revised letter sent out on  Thursday apologised for ‘inaccuracies’ and told parents: ‘On  reflection, disregard a section from the earlier letter.’ Headmistress Lynn Small said:  ‘We are a mainly Christian school, but we have to cover at least one other religion as part of the National Curriculum. This visit is part of that. ‘They would not be taking part in any religious practices. We have had similar workshops on a variety of religions in the past, including one on Islam, with no problems at all and the children have absolutely loved it.‘We have pupils and teachers who belong to the Islam faith and it is right for the children to understand and appreciate their faith as well as their own.’ Littleton Green: The children from the primary school in Huntington are due to go on the trip next week . Angry parents outside Littleton Green School - they say their children should not be branded racist if they don't go . A spokesman for Staffordshire County Council said it was important for children to learn about  different cultures but that parents had the right to withdraw their children if they wished. ‘Clearly it is not appropriate for comments about racial discrimination to be made in these circumstances,’ he added. An Ofsted report this year concluded that the school, which has 341 pupils, ‘required improvement’. Dear Parent/Carer, . As part of the National Religious .

"A man who stole a truck full of 7,500 pairs of yet-to-be-released Nike Lebron 12s from a Tennessee factory has been arrested - and all but 700 pairs of the shoes were recovered. Charles Jennings, 35, an employee of cargo transportation company Intermodal Cartage Group, used his employee ID card to scan into a secure lot at the Memphis facility in November. Once inside he got in a truck that was full of the specialty sneakers - worth up to $1.5 million - and drove away, according to Breitbart News. Memphis is a major distribution hub for both Nike and FedEx, putting the FBI and US Marshalls on the case. Arrested: Charles Jennings, 35, an employee of cargo transportation company Intermodal Cartage Group in Memphis, allegedly stole a truck full of 7,500  new Lebron 12 Nike shoes, worth an estimated $1.5 million . Police allege Jennings spent a week selling the shoes to different retailers. However they were able to track down the truck was arrest him on November 14. He has been charged with theft of property worth $600,000 or more. It is believed he made $623,000 from the 700 pairs of trainers that were missing from the truck, ESPN reported. That would mean selling them for about $83 each. Stores would then mark up the price to about $200. It is unclear whether any penalties will be imposed on the stores that did buy from Jennings. Lebron: It is believed Jennings made $623,000 from 700 pairs of trainers he sold from the 7,500 that were in  truck, worth a rough total of $1.5 million . He was released from jail on a $75,000 bond. 'He had a pretty good idea what he had,' Dunbar told ESPN. 'They were Nikes and they were more valuable in that they hadn't been released yet.' Jennings is due to appear in court next on December 30.

"The brutal murder of a 17-year-old girl, who was gang-raped, horrifically mutilated and left to die on a building site, has sparked a national outcry in South Africa. Anene Booysen was discovered by security guards on the site in the sleepy town of Bredasdorp, 80 miles east of Cape Town. According to a Health Department spokesman, her injuries were so severe that her family asked authorities not to release the details. National outcry: Hundreds of mourners gather for the funeral of 17-year-old Anene Booysen who was brutally raped and murdered in a crime that has shocked south Africa . However it was later revealed that her stomach had been slit open down to her genitals and that she had died from her injuries in hospital. She managed to identify one of her attackers before her death and two men have appeared in court charged with rape and murder. Jonathan Davids, 22, and Johannes Kana, 21, covered their faces to hide from television cameras and photographers as they made their way into the courtroom. The magistrate ordered the pair court to remain behind bars until Feb. 26 when their bail application will be heard. They face a maximum life sentence if found guilty. Police freed a third man arrested after the incident due to lack of evidence linking him to the crime, but said they were investigating whether there were others also involved. A crowd of 100 people protested outside . the courthouse in Bredasdorp, carrying placards saying 'Show no . mercy to rapists' and 'No bail to murderers'. Booysen's brother told local media he knew one of the suspects. He said: 'He was a friend of mine, we went to school together, stayed in one house, we were like brothers.' The girl was attacked in the sleepy town of Bredasdrop where two men have been charged with her rape and murder . On . Friday, hundreds of people marched through Bredasdorp, chanting 'enough . is enough' and hundreds attended the funeral on Saturday. Hundreds . of mourners, including politicians, packed a church in the town of . Bredasdorp, while a tent was set up to accommodate those who couldn't . fit inside. The killing . echoed the gang rape of a student on a New Delhi bus last year, and has . focused attention on South Africa's high rates of sex crime. Booysen was found by security guards lying a short distance from her house after partying at a bar last Friday evening. The Women's League of the ruling . African National Congress is trying to mobilise the public into similar . action to the protests against anti-female violence that took place in . India after the New Delhi attack. On . Saturday, South African media reported police had arrested a . Johannesburg pastor for luring a woman into his church and raping her. President . Jacob Zuma expressed shock and outrage, calling for the harshest . possible sentences for the killers and a concerted campaign 'to end this . scourge in our society'. According to a Health Department spokesman, Booysen's injuries were so severe that her family asked authorities not to release the details . South Africa's women's minister called on Tuesday for the toughest possible to be imposed. Minister of Women Lulu Xingwana, who has met with the victim's family said: 'We are saying to the court today there must be no bail for these criminals and monsters.' 'We expect the toughest and the harshest sentence that can act as a deterrent to other criminals that abuse and kill our women and children.' 'As an activist I strongly push that there should be no bail for these monsters. What would they do if this happened to any of their family members?' said Faraah September. South Africa has the highest number of reported rapes per head of population of any Interpol member country, with more than 64,500 reported in 2011/2012. A rape is said to be committed in South Africa every four minutes. Even when suspects are caught, only 12 percent of cases end in conviction and sex crimes seldom cause much public concern.","Murder of teenager Anene Booysen sparks national outcry .

"Bill Cosby says he only expects the 'black media' to stay 'neutral' and give him a fair hearing over mounting rape claims. The 77-year-old said that African-American media should be impartial in reporting the allegations that he is a serial rapist. 'Let me say this. I only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind,' Cosby told Page Six. Scroll down for videos . 'Love and strength': Bill Cosby, left, has praised his wife of fifty years, Camille, right, for the 'love and strength' she has displayed . In the telephone interview Cosby also praised his wife's 'love and strength'. Dozens of women have come forward to claim that the entertainer drugged and raped them - none of whom have dampened the 'strength of womanhood' in Camille Cosby, her husband said. Cosby refused to address the allegations in a phone conversation Friday, but did imply his relationship with Camille, who married him fifty years ago, remains intact. When asked by the reporter how she was coping he said: 'Love and the strength of womanhood.' He then repeated the phrase twice more. He has previously said he 'doesn't have to answer to' the rape accusations, which he characterized as 'innuendo'. He then finished the conversation by saying he had been told not to talk to the media. Cosby has been under fire from an ever-expanding list of accusers, many of whom have a similar story of being slipped a pill before the comedian, best know for playing Cliff Huxtable on the Cosby Show, assaulted them. While he has never explicitly denied any accusation, his legal team have hit out against some of his accusers, particularly former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who repeatedly called him a rapist in a televised interview with CNN. Defiant: The above was Janice Dickinson's reaction when asked what she would like to say to Cosby's legal team, who have refuted her allegations . Dickinson also used the appearance to address Cosby's wife - whom she said she pitied for having a rapist husband. She said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her. 'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me. 'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me. 'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children.'","Embattled entertainer, 77, praised Camille Cosby, his wife of 50 years .

Australia has taken part in airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq but is still awaiting legal agreement with the new Iraqi government over the deployment of 200 special forces advisers. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said on Wednesday that Australian special forces sent to Iraq haven't been able to enter the country yet because the Iraqi government has not provided the necessary legal guarantees. Mr Abbott said he wanted the same indemnity from prosecution under Iraqi law for 200 Australian special operations troops as American troops already had in Iraq. The soldiers are being sent to advise and assist Iraqi security forces. They were sent a month ago to the United Arab Emirates at the request of the United States. At the same time, Australia also sent six F/A-18F Super Hornet jet fighters. The fighter jets were now flying almost daily combat missions against Islamic State targets in northern Iraq, Mr Abbott said.

Thomas Ballard, 37, was arrested on Monday after officers swooped on his home in Egg Harbor Township with a search warrant. After searching his home and truck, investigators seized two personal computers and several cell phones, according to the Attorney General's Office. Child porn charges: Thomas Ballard, 37, has been accused of distributing thousands of images including pictures of pre-pubescant girls being bound threatened with knives . Ballard is charged with distributing and possessing child porn and tampering with evidence. He remained jailed Tuesday on $100,000 bail, and it was not known if he has retained a lawyer. Between October 2013 and March 2014, Ballard allegedly distributed more than 3,000 files depicting sexual exploitation of children. He first came to the attention of authorities in 2010 after allegedly posting comments on a website known to be frequented by those interested in child porn images. He allegedly posted one message on the site saying he 'trades privately.' Police said this suggests he was offering to trade images via email.

"Devastating: Maria Chelysheva, eight, is said to be 'inconsolable' after losing her entire family who were all overcome by rotten potato fumes . An eight-year-old Russian girl has been orphaned after her entire family was wiped out by deadly gas caused from rotting potatoes. Grief-stricken Maria Chelysheva lost her father, mother, brother and grandmother who were killed one by one after entering a cellar where they stored potatoes for the winter. Relatives are caring for the girl who is inconsolable over her loss. Her father, respected law professor Mikhail Chelyshev, 42, was first to enter the cellar, not realising the potatoes had become seriously rotten. He fainted from the noxious fumes, and soon afterwards died, say police. When he failed to re-appear, his worried wife Anastasia, 38, went to look for him in the dark and was also overcome by the poisonous gas. Next the couple’s 18 year old son Georgy went in search of his parents, only to suffer the same tragic fate as his mother and father after inhaling the highly toxic fumes. Anastasia’s mother Iraida, 68, called a neighbour to say there was something suspicious and to plead for help. But before assistance arrived, she also went into the cellar, suffocated from the gas, and collapsed and died like the others, say police. It is understood that as she went in, she left the door open, allowing the fumes to disperse. Victims: Father Mikhail Chelyshev, 42, brother Georgy Chelyshev, 18, and mother Anastasia Chelysheva, 38, died in the cellar when one by one they went to investigate . Maria has been left orphaned by the tragic freak disaster, which took place at the family home . Maria's grandmother, Iraida, 63, went to investigate the problem in the cellar after both parents and brother Georgy Chelyshev, 18, right, also never returned. She also died . When Maria entered the cellar, she found the bodies of her whole family on the cellar floor. The shocking case was at Laishevo, a town near Kazan, in the Russian republic of Tatarstan on the Volga River. 'They all died of gas poisoning which has accumulated in the basement as a result of badly rotting potatoes,' said a local investigator. Georgy Chelyshev, 18, left, and his father, respected law professor Mikhail Chelyshev, 42, right were two of four of Maria's family relatives who were killed by the toxic potato fumes, according to police . 'The poor girl  found the bodies of the deceased.' Relatives and friends are appealing for cash to support the girl. A memorial service for Professor Chelyshev was held in the marble hall of  Kazan Federal University, where he was head of the department of civil and business law. Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as glycoalkaloids, of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine is also found in other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana) as well as the potato, eggplant, and tomato. This toxin affects the nervous system, causing weakness and confusion. These compounds are generally concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits. Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber; the highest concentrations occur just underneath the skin. Cooking partly destroys them. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. The U.S. National Toxicology Program suggests that the average American consumes at most 12.5 mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is several times this, depending on body weight).","Maria Chelsyheva lost her father, mother, brother and grandmother within minutes of each other going down into the cellar at the family home .

"Squashed into a child’s rubber dinghy floating precariously in the English Channel, a suspected illegal immigrant stretches out a paddle to his rescuers. The man and a companion, believed to be from Pakistan, were apparently dropped off by a sailing yacht in the world’s busiest shipping lanes half a mile from the Kent coast. Having squeezed themselves into the toy inflatable, the pair drifted in the dangerous waters until they caught the attention of a passing tourist boat. Scroll down for video . Inflatable dinghy: The two men from Pakistan had to be rescued by lifeboat crew as they drifted across some of the world's busiest shipping lanes, threatened with being run over by heavy cargo tankers and ferries . Caught on camera: The pictures and video were taken by staff of the Dover Sea Safari which runs sea trips in the area . Helped: Pictures showed one of the men, dressed in a white T-shirt, already taken to safety on the RNLI crew's Rib (rigid inflatable boat) and the other still in the tiny blue dinghy, being rescued . Its skipper summoned an RNLI lifeboat . crew who pulled the men to safety and took them to Dover, where they . were detained by immigration officials. The . incident came days after eight Afghans were rescued from a broken-down . inflatable in the Channel when a P&O ferry spotted them. Yesterday, . an MP voiced fears that  people will die attempting to reach  Britain . unless French authorities send the hundreds of would-be immigrants . camped in Calais back to their home countries. Video . filmed from the pleasure boat that raised the alarm on Tuesday . afternoon shows one of the men sitting in the tiny boat with a small bag . between his legs. He reaches out a blue plastic paddle to the RNLI crew . and is hauled out. A second man has already been rescued and is seated . at the front of the lifeboat wearing a white T-shirt. The . footage also captured the small two-masted yacht that is believed to . have dropped off the pair, with a man in a dark jacket and hooded top at . the helm. James Salmon, 42, a skipper with pleasure cruise firm Dover Sea Safari, had 12 passengers on board when he saw the dinghy. He . said: ‘It was about 3.15pm and we were heading back from Deal towards . Dover when we spotted two guys waving their paddles and shouting for . help. Response: The two men were taken to Dover by the Walmer RNLI crew where they were handed over to Border Force staff . On shore: The two men (wearing orange lifejackets) walk along in Kent with a group of police officers . Helped by the emergency services: The two men are checked over by paramedics while police watch . ‘They were about half a . mile from shore. They knew how to say “help” but that’s all they really . said. We approached them and noticed they were of foreign origin, so we . radioed Dover Coastguard and were asked to make sure they were safe and . well. A lifeboat arrived about five minutes later and brought them back . to shore.’ Mr Salmon . expressed concerns about the dangers to would-be immigrants attempting . to cross the Channel, which is used by hundreds of vast cargo ships and . large passenger ferries every day. He . said: ‘The inflatable was tiny, like a two-man boat. We were . astonished. They appeared to have travelled by yacht up to a couple of . miles from shore and then they must have been dropped off and paddled . from there. This seems to be the new way of doing it. ‘They . were absolutely desperate to get across the Channel,  but it’s the . busiest shipping lane in the world and their lives were in danger.’ The . RNLI crew, from Walmer, took the two men to Dover where they received . medical checks before being handed to Border Force staff. Charlie . Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said yesterday: ‘This . highlights the importance of the French getting a grip of the problem. ‘In . particular, they should  repatriate people at Calais back  to their . home countries as soon  as possible. These dinghies are unsafe craft and . are not suitable for crossing the Channel. I am deeply concerned about . the risk of loss of life.’ A . spokesman for the UK’s  Border Force said: ‘Officers were alerted to . two suspected illegal entrants who were rescued by the RNLI off the . coast of Kent. ‘Both individuals are believed to be Pakistani nationals and have been detained while further investigations take place.’ Off the Kent coast: It is thought they may have been helped by other people amid reports the dinghy was dropped from a yacht which had already sailed some of the journey between France and England . Location: The incident happened off the coast of Walmer (file picture). The two men were taken to Dover by the Walmer RNLI crew where they were handed over to Border Force staff . Immigrants gathered in Calais are becoming increasingly desperate to cross the Channel to England to claim asylum. 'This seems to be the new way of doing it. They were absolutely desperate to get across the Channel but it's the busiest shipping lane in the world and their lives were in danger' James Salmon, Dover Sea Safari . It follows a crackdown by authorities in Calais who are clearing unofficial immigrant camps in the town. Last Saturday eight Afghan immigrants had to be rescued around five miles off the port of Dover in the Channel when their RIB's motor broke down after running out of fuel. The alarm was raised by the captain of a passing P&O ferry which could have run them over. They were rescued from the choppy seas by Dover Lifeboat workers. Romanian Marian Badea, 29, a ninth man who was in the boat with them, was charged with attempted facilitation. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Folkestone Magistrates’ Court next week. The eight Afghan nationals who were detained following the rescue are to be deported, said a spokesman for the Border Force.","It is thought the men from Pakistan may have been helped by other people .

"Australian wineries are making the move away from the traditional wine regions and taking their business south of the Bass Strait to Tasmania. Shiraz is among the varieties increasingly being grown in the southern state, and Nick Glaetzer was one of the first to take the plunge, breaking away from his family's well-known winery in the Barossa region in South Australia. Initially, Mr Glaetzer's family thought he was crazy trying to grow the grapes down south, which have their roots in the hot and dry Barossa and are famous for their full flavours. Young winemaker Nick Glaetzer made the move south to Tasmania to produce Shiraz wine, due to warmer temperatures in the Barossa . But with temperatures in Australia's main regions including the Hunter Valley and Margaret River on the up according to Business Insider Australia, the young winemaker's daring move may have paid off. They also report that a study by the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered up to 73 per cent of Australian land currently used for viticulture could become unsuitable by 2050. Mr Glaetzer left the Barossa in 2003 and travelled the world, making stops at vineyards in France and Germany, taking note on how the grapes were grown in cooler conditions. In 2008 he settled in Tasmania, and told the Daily Mail Australia he was 'searching for cooler climate regions,' in part because conditions in the Barossa were getting warmer. Just years later he became the first person to ever win a prestigious national award, the Jimmy Watson Memorial Trophy, for a Shiraz produced in Tasmania. 'Having worked in the colder climates in France... I understood how to grow these wines in cool climates.' Mr Glaetzer said. Mr Glaetzer left the family business in the Barossa, and became the first to win a prestigious national award for a Tasmanian Shiraz . His father still owns the family business, Glaetzer Wines, but Mr Glaetzer said 'I wanted to try and make different styles to what my family was doing.' 'They were a bit surprised (initially), especially picking Tasmania. There's a lot of comments from other winemakers and my family comparing it (Tasmanian wine) to light beer.' Due to the cooler climate down south, Tasmanian wines tend to be 15-20 percent less alcoholic than those grown in hotter climates. However with global warming, predictions are that some regions may become too hot for the vineyards to properly operate. Australian Shiraz tends not to be grown in Tasmania, with the main variety produced being Pinot Noir. However, CEO of Wine Tasmania Sheralee Davis said it's a trend that is increasing. 'It's fair to say we are seeing quite a lot of wine producers move to Tasmania... The cooler the climate, within reason, the higher quality of wine.' Ms Davies also said growing in cooler climates is 'high risk but it's high reward', and over the past few years have seen big expansions from key wine producers in Tasmania. Tasmanian wine is less alcoholic and more sublet in flavour, but despite this the wine industry is booming the southern state as temperatures increase in other regions . Despite the prediction that rising temperatures on mainland Australia are going to have devastating effects on the wine industry, Michael McCarthy, head of the Barossa Wine Experiment insisted even if this is the case, the change will not be immediate. 'One of the things that people need to remember is if we're going to move into a warmer drier world, it's not going to be sudden.' Mr McCarthy said the vineyards are adapting as the changes happen, and people need not take the risk and jump ship simply because of what he described as cycles of weather. When asked if they would make the move down south, Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), which own iconic wine brands Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindeman's among many others, said they are monitoring external conditions on their own. TWE also said they are working to 'develop technologies and management practices to deal with these changes in the vineyards,' but as they already have roots down across Australia have no plans to move all production to one region. A study suggests that more than 70 percent of Australia's current wine regions may become unusable to 2050 .","Nick Glaetzer left his family's business in the Barossa region, South Australia in 2003 .

(Mahmoud) Abbas had been able to give the assurances we suggested, and . without which we were unable to vote in favour of the resolution. Victory: Palestinians wave their national flags as they celebrate the UN General Assembly's vote . Jubilant: Palestinians take part in a rally where Palestinian Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's speech is projected on Israel's controversial barrier in the West Bank city of Bethlehem . 'In particular, we called on President Abbas to set out a willingness to return to negotiations without preconditions, and to signal that the Palestinians would not immediately seek action in the International Criminal Court, which would be likely to make a return to negotiations impossible. 'We sought these assurances because they . would help create the strongest possible foundation for a return to . talks, if combined with action by Israel and support from the . international community, after a long and painful period for both . parties in the absence of negotiations. This was the guiding principle . behind our vote.' Rejoice: Palestinian take part in a rally in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The 193-nation U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution on Thursday to upgrade the Palestinian Authority's observer status at the United Nations from 'entity' to 'non-member state' Celebrations: Palestinians hold posters depicting President Mahmoud Abbas as they celebrate on a street in Gaza City . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rebuked the vote calling it an ‘unfortunate and counterproductive’ move that further obstructs the path to a peaceful agreement between Palestine and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the General Assembly shortly before the vote ‘defamatory and venomous,’ saying it was ‘full of mendacious propaganda’ against Israel. Netanyahu called the vote meaningless. Future: Real independence, however, remains an elusive dream until the Palestinians negotiate a peace deal with the Israelis, who warned that the General Assembly action will only delay a lasting solution . Abbas had told the General Assembly that it was ‘being asked today to issue the birth certificate of Palestine.’ Abbas said the vote is the last chance to save the two-state solution. After the vote, Netanyahu said the U.N. move violated past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians and that Israel would act accordingly, without elaborating what steps it might take.Thursday's vote came on the same day that the U.N. General Assembly in 1947 voted to recognize a partitioned state in Palestine, with the jubilant revelers then Jews. The Palestinians rejected that partition plan, and decades of tension and violence followed.' Tension: There are fears the vote could stoke further tension with Israel,l following the ceasefire, which was celebrated by Palestinians, pictured . Just before Thursday's vote, Israel's . U.N. ambassador, Ron Prosor, warned the General Assembly that 'the . Palestinians are turning their backs on peace' and that the U.N. can't . break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land . of Israel. The vote had been certain to succeed, with most member states sympathetic to the Palestinians.Several . key countries, including France, this week announced they would support . the move to elevate the Palestinians from the status of U.N. observer . to non-member observer state . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas . Alexander said last night: 'Labour welcomes today’s overwhelming vote . for enhanced status for the Palestinians at the UN as an important . non-violent, legal and diplomatic step towards a negotiated two-state . solution. Violence: About 160 Palestinian people were killed in the eight day offensive in Gaza that has sparked renewed international debate over Palestine's UN status . 'The British . Government’s decision to abstain is worse than a blunder. It is a . historic misjudgment which will be interpreted as a sign not of . influence but of irrelevance. 'The Palestinians right to a state is not a gift to be delivered but a right to be acknowledged. 'The . Labour Party have long called for the UK government to support the .

"They market themselves as a state full of untouched wilderness, craft beer and edgy art exhibits, but Tasmania can't shake its reputation as the bogan capital of Australia. Finalists for the title of Biggest Bogan in Australia were announced on comedian Paul Fenech's Seven Network TV series Bogan Hunters on Tuesday night and four of the seven finalists hail from the country's southernmost state. Tasmania scooped the pool with Bogan Hunters hosts suggesting it should secede from the rest of the country and 'become its own bogan state'. Scroll down for video . Clint Saxon was one of four finalists to hail from Tasmania in a nationwide search for the biggest bogan in Australia on Channel Seven's The Bogan Hunters . None of the finalists in the nationwide search came from NSW or Queensland, with one finalist each from Victoria, West Australia and South Australia. Tasmania's top four entrants included Andrew, a man with no teeth who has the names and birthdates of his eight children tattooed down his arms because he's always too 'smashed' to remember them. 'That way if I go to Centrelink and they I ask me I can say “Here we go”,' he told the camera. Justin, also from Tasmania, is the competition's youngest finalist in his early 20s. He was commended by the judges for his variety of tattoos, including an artistic representation of his ex-girlfriend, whom he got pregnant when he was just 16 . His best mate Darren, also from Tasmania, made the finals of the competition, largely for his driving record. He has 52 driving offences to his name and a 'car graveyard' full of burnt out cars, some of which were destroyed by his own dangerous behaviour behind the wheel. Justin is the competition's youngest finalist, in his early 20s. He was commended by the judges for his 'Aussie pride', evident in the presence of a Made in Australia tattoo on his arm and a Southern Cross tattoo on his shoulder. He also has a tattoo that takes up all of his chest and stomach – an artistic representation of his ex-girlfriend, whom he got pregnant when he was just 16. Andrew, the third Tasmanian finalist, is a man who has the names and birthdates of his eight children tattooed down his arms because he's always too 'smashed' to remember them . Clint Saxon, the final Tassie contender, hails from Georgetown, which he calls the 'boganest place in the world'. Judges said he made the final list because he 'ticked so many bogan boxes', including naming 'doggie style' as his favourite sex position and flaunting some 'homemade' tattoos done by his missus. But Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, said despite Tasmania earning four spots in The Bogan Hunter final, most people had 'laughed off' the show and its bogan portrayal of Tasmania. Andrew's best mate Darren, also from Tasmania, has 52 driving offences to his name and a 'car graveyard' full of burnt out cars, some of which were destroyed by his own dangerous behaviour behind the wheel . 'I think Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and we want people to share our stories, so if that makes us bogans then so be it,' Mr Martin told Daily Mail Australia. 'We’re a bit different, we’re a bit quirky. I guess it depends if you think a bogan is (something) negative.' Mr Martin said the effect of the show on Tasmania's tourism would be 'non-existent'. None of the finalists in the nationwide search came from NSW or Queensland, with one finalist each from Victoria, West Australia and Mel from South Australia (pictured) 'Anyone who is not going to come to Tasmania… because of a silly TV show, they’re probably not the type of market that’s coming here anyway,' he said. 'It's a bit of a contradiction because of our emerging reputation for art and culture. I suppose we're the bogan capital and one of the most sophisticated destinations on the world map.' Tasmania's dubious honour of the bogan capital has come as a Tasmanian mayor was forced to deny he called his constituents 'bogans'. Nanna Shazza, as she is known as in the show, hails from Victoria and enjoys drinking a goon sack of wine hung from a clothesline . Bertrand Cadart, the mayor of Glamorgan Spring Bay, came under fire for suggesting the opponents of a tourist venture on the state's east coast are 'the most bogan of bogans'. 'The people here, they are too disparate, you know, from the most bogan of bogans... to the greenest pains in the arse,' Mr Cadart told The Monthly magazine. He later insisted he was not talking specifically about his constituents but about people from all over Tasmania who oppose environmentalist Graeme Wood's plan to turn a former woodchip mill at Triabunna into a tourism complex. Fordy from Rockingham in Western Australia rounds out the list of seven finalists . The winner of Bogan Hunter will be announced next Tuesday following a showdown on who has the best bogan appearance, attitude and sex appeal. The champ wins the Golden Thong award and a ute full of beer.

"The father of a Colorado high school gunman who shot dead a 17-year-old girl before taking his own life has posted an obituary for his son on the one-year anniversary of the shooting. Karl Pierson, 18, stormed Arapahoe High School in Centennial, suburban Denver, with a shotgun, a machete, several homemade bombs and 125 rounds of ammunition on December 13, 2013. He apparently intended to kill his debate coach, Tracy Murphy, but instead fatally shot fellow student Claire Davis in the head at point-blank range, before turning the gun on himself.

Scroll down for video . Father and son: Mark Pierson (right) has posted a newspaper obituary for his 18-year-old son, Karl (left), exactly one year after the high school student shot dead a 17-year-old girl before turning the gun on himself . Happier times: In the obituary in the Denver Post, Mr Pierson (pictured with Karl several years ago) described his late son as 'a young man full of hope and promise who lost his way for a moment, but now is found' In the obituary, Mr Pierson wrote: 'Karl Pierson walked on to the spirit world December 13, 2013. He was a young man full of hope and promise who lost his way for a moment, but now is found. 'I love you, I miss you, I forgive you.' The message was simply signed off: 'Dad'.

Organizers said the victim's father, Michael Davis, is expected to speak during the ceremony. After Claire's death, the Davis family issued a statement saying 'the grace, laughter and light she brought to this world will not be extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger.' Speaking to AP, Mr Pierson said he did not mean to disrespect the Davis family by posting the obituary, but said he wanted his son to also be remembered for the good things he did in life.

Police later revealed that Karl had intended to target Mr Murphy - months after he had already shouted a death threat against the coach in a school hallway. At the time, school officials did not punish the student. But Mr Murphy was so fearful after the encounter he considered resigning, according to police reports.

"The Swedish group unanimously objected to their song being used in an anniversary exhibition fot the Battle of Waterloo claiming it would send out the 'wrong signals' It was the song that catapulted them to international stardom – and set them on the road to amassing multi-million-pound fortunes. But Abba are now strangely reluctant to repay the debt they owe to the famous battle that helped inspire their 1974 hit Waterloo. The Swedish group were asked to help commemorate next year's 200th anniversary of the battle by allowing the first vinyl cut of the Eurovision-winning track to form part of an exhibition. But the group unanimously objected, claiming it would send the 'wrong signals' about their song. Last night, military historian Andrew Roberts condemned the band's decision. He said: 'It seems rather po-faced. 'It is a great shame people don't want to help with a project which is all about educating young people about this important event.' Waterloo 200, which is organising next year's celebrations, had hoped to borrow the original disc from the Abba Museum in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, so that it could be included in an exhibition of 200 objects illustrating the importance and influence of the 1815 battle. David Huse, the chief executive of Waterloo 200, said: 'It is a shame that Abba won't lend us the original copy of the record. 'We are keen that as many people as possible should embrace the commemorations and we thought including the song would be a good way of illustrating how the battle has impacted on popular culture. It would also have been a useful way of raising awareness of the events of 1815 among people who are familiar with the song but don't know anything about the battle that inspired it.' But, refusing the request, Abba insisted the song is not about the actual battle, when French forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte were beaten by British and Prussian armies. The song has the famous opening lyric 'My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender' – and during the hit's 1974 Eurovision performance, conductor Sven Olof Walldoff actually dressed as Napoleon. The song has the famous opening lyric 'My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender' – and during the hit's 1974 Eurovision performance, conductor Sven Olof Walldoff actually dressed as Napoleon (pictured is a painting of the 1815 battle) A spokeswoman said the group's four members – Benny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Fältskog and Björn Ulvaeus – all agreed that the loan of the disc would have been inappropriate. She said: 'The question has come to us and we have said no to it. The issue was discussed by all four members of the band. 'The song isn't about the Battle of Waterloo and we don't want the record to be part of the exhibition. It gives the wrong signals. 'Waterloo is a pop song about someone meeting their own Waterloo. It is not about the battle.' Mr Roberts said it was perhaps ironic that the song's lyrics were actually inaccurate. He joked: 'This is one of those rare occasions when Abba got it wrong. Napoleon did not surrender at Waterloo, but aboard HMS Bellerophon a month later.'","Swedish group were asked if song could be used for anniversary exhibition .

"A West Coast storm  left California to remedy landslides, flash floods, and now, a small tornado. A tornado touched down in south Los Angeles just before 9.30am Friday causing damage to trees and roofs as residents stared incredulously at the phenomenon. 'I’ve been here 56 years and I have never seen a tornado,' Deborah Lavergne, who worked at a nearby day care center that was damaged, told KTLA. 'It’s my first time. … It was crazy.' Scroll down for video . Tornado: A tornado touched down in downtown Los Angeles Friday ripping off roofs, damaging trees, and even mangling a steel billboard . Smallest: The tornado was listed as an EF0, the smallest category possible, with wind speeds of 65 to 85pmh. It reportedly lasted only one minute . The tornado was listed as an EF0, the smallest category possible, with wind speeds of 65 to 85pmh. It reportedly lasted only one minute. No one was hurt by the small tornado that mangled a steel billboard, according to the National Weather Service, and onlookers got to experience a rare phenomenon seeing the first tornado in the city of Los Angeles since 2004, according to the U.S. Tornado's Facebook page. Witnesses reported seeing roofs being torn off and blown away by the wind as well as debris, trash cans, and trees being whirled around. The storm also caused a waterspout -- a tornado over water -- off the coast of Newport Beach. Damage: The tornado, with winds from 65-85mph, left sidewalks covered in branches from damaged trees . Destruction: Photographed is the destruction left by the small tornado that ripped the roofs off of two homes . Uprooted: Photographed, the tornado uprooted a tree in downtown LA damaging a fence and a house . The tornado is the latest in a long line of storm-related incidents occurring in California since Thursday. The storm has been dubbed a 'Pineapple Express,' a storm fueled by a stream of tropical moisture. Since it's beginning, the storm has drenched northern California and given much-needed rain to southern California. Landslides reportedly left 10 homes uninhabitable and 13 damaged. Landslides covered some homes up to the roofs Friday. The storm has even left more than 50,000 people without electricity at one point. Waterspout: The storm also caused a waterspout -- a tornado over water -- off the coast of Newport Beach . RV: Photographed, an RV sits underwater from the flooded Russian River Friday in Guerneville, Calif. The totality of the storm forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes and disrupted passenger rail services along the coast according to The Daily Republic. The Republic reports that one person was found dead in a flood-control channel of an Orange County town. It has not been determined if the cause of the death was storm related, but if so, it would mark the third storm-related death on the West Coast since Thursday. Two deaths were reported on Thursday in Oregon. Both are reportedly due to the storm, which has also affected areas of Washington. The Weather Center reports that mudslides of land charred by recent wildfires left part of the Pacific Coast Highway blocked with 18 inches of mud.The Los Angeles Fire Department rescued two people who were swept away by the flow of the rain-swollen Los Angeles River. Landslides: Landslides left 13 homes damaged and 10 homes uninhabitable Friday . Rainstorm: A morning rainstorm left roads covered in mud after slides of land charred by recent wildfires began to slide . Hay Bails: photographed, hay bails are lined up to block a potential mudslide in Silverado Canyon, Calif., Silverado Canyon has been evacuated due to heavy rains . Amid the harsh, weather-related incidents, the storm did bring one good thing: rain. After three years of drought, the storm gave California up to 5 inches of rain. The Republic reports that the highest rainfall measured Friday was more than 5 inches at San Marcos Pass and downtown Los Angeles received more than 1.5 inches of rain. Wired reports that though the rain is appreciated, much more is needed to make up for the three-year drought that has forced cutbacks in farmer's irrigation supplies and conservation measures in California. Wired reports that the state would need 18-21 more inches of rain in the next six months to make up for the drought.","A small tornado hit downtown Los Angeles on Friday for the first time in 10 years .

'Certainly, we think it is the biggest in the region, if not Britain. 'It is bigger than the house anyway.' The couple, who have nine grandchildren, bought the decoration from a friend who never inflated it because it was too big. The huge figure, along with a tiny light-up Christmas tree, now stands outside the couple's home for the festive season. Mr Wild added: 'We have lived here for about 36 years.

"British families could be facing a shortage of Brussels sprouts this Christmas after a period of wet weather in October left vegetables at the bottom of stalks wrecked. A hot summer had actually produced larger than average sprouts - but mid-Autumn downpours meant much of the early crop stalks had to be cut due to water damage. The news will cause concern among those hoping to cook the perfect Christmas dinner next week. Concern: British families could be facing a shortage of Christmas favourite Brussels sprouts . A memo by Morrisons trading director Andrew Garton read: 'Much of the early crop stalks had to be cut higher up the stem due to water damage,' The Sun reports. 'Farmers require a period of cold, dry weather to finish the sprouts and maintain a healthy appearance.' Approximately 30 per cent of the Brussels sprout harvest appears on shop shelves in the ten days before Christmas. Morrisons has promised not to raise its prices as a result of the shortage - which is believed to have effected the whole industry. And farmers are hoping for good weather in the lead up to Christmas so that families will not be disappointed on December 25. Despite the shortage of sprouts, experts claim that good conditions in 2014 have seen other vegetables enjoy the best produce for years - meaning Christmas favourites such as parsnips, carrots and potatoes will be in plenty of supply.

"Australian Leanne Rowe woke up following a car crash speaking with a French accent . A Tasmanian bus driver has started speaking with a strong French accent after suffering a serious head injury in a car crash. Leanne Rowe is one of just 62 people in the world and only the second in Australia to be diagnosed with the incredibly rare condition known as 'foreign accent syndrome'. Ms Rowe first started speaking in what sounds like a French accent when she woke up in Melbourne's Austin Hospital with a broken back and jaw after being involved in a serious car accident. She told ABC: 'Slowly, as my jaw started to heal, they said that I was slurring my words because I was on very powerful tablets.' But eight years on, and despite her . injuries having apparently healed, the condition still hasn't faded and . her French accent is as strong as ever. Ms . Rowe, who was a member of the Army Reserves before the crash, says she . is slowly coming to terms with the rare condition but revealed it has . left her feeling anxious and depressed at times. She told the TV station: 'It makes me so angry because I am Australian. I am not French, I do not have anything against the French people.' Ms Rowe's daughter Kate Mundy now does the majority of speaking for her mother in public. Scroll down to watch video . Angry: Ms Rowe, pictured with her mother, right, and daughter Kate Mundy, left, has struggled to come to terms with the unusual condition . She said: 'It has affected her life greatly. People see the funny side of it, and think its really interesting, I . mean, it is interesting but I've seen the impacts on mum's life.' Her family doctor Robert Newton believes Ms Rowe suffers from the extremely rare Foreign Accent Syndrome - and admits he's never seen anything like it. He said: 'She turned up after having a nasty head injury eight years ago speaking with a French accent - I couldn't believe my ears. She'd done French at school but she'd never been to France, didn't have any French friends at all.' Baffled: Ms Rowe's doctor Robert Newton, pictured, admits he was stunned when his patient - who he had treated fro many years - came in suddenly speaking in a French accent . Ms Rowe is one of just 62 people to be diagnosed with the condition in the last 70 years. Psychologist Karen Croot, from the University of Sydney,  is one of just a few people in the world to have researched Foreign Accent Syndrome. She says the condition is caused when tissue in the area of the brain which controls speech is damaged. And while it may sound like Ms Rowe is speaking with a French accent, is is actually just an accident that her speech sounds similar to the language. She said: 'It's just an accident of chance that happens to that person that what happens to their speech happens to overlap with the features of a known accent'.

Mr Farage once pleaded with former Tory outcast Mr Powell to help him win a seat in Parliament . The Ukip leader also twice asked him to stand as a candidate in the 1990s. On both occasions Mr Powell rejected the request.

Mr Farage has never hidden his admiration for Mr Powell, who became a political pariah in 1968 after railing against immigration in his ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech. He simply shrugged this week when the comedian Russell Brand attacked him on live TV as a ‘pound shop Enoch Powell’. But the letter, found by the Daily Telegraph in the archives of Cambridge University, shows how he actively sought Mr Powell’s support. Writing from his home in Kent, Mr Farage said: ‘I have everything in place to fight a good, aggressive campaign but a voice from you could transform things.’ The letter came after Mr Farage drove Mr Powell to a rally at Newbury Racecourse, where the former Tory was giving a speech. Mr Farage said he was asked to drive Mr Powell because he had a fancy car. The Ukip leader said: ‘He had spoken at my school and I was later asked to drive him to a by-election rally, I think they chose me because everyone else available had a Morris Minor and I had a Merc! It was scary. 'Protesters smashed the back of the car when we arrived but Enoch didn’t blink.’ Nigel Farage simply shrugged this week when the comedian Russell Brand (pictured) attacked him on live TV as a ‘pound shop Enoch Powell’ They met again a few months later in Bow, East London. Mr Powell, who died in 1998, turned down Mr Farage’s request after giving the matter ‘very serious consideration’. The following year, Mr Powell was invited to stand as a Ukip candidate in the 1995 European Parliament election, and then in the 1997 general election. He rejected both requests. But he did go on to give his backing to three Ukip candidates in the mid-1990s. Mr Farage has described Mr Powell as a ‘political hero’. He said last month that the ‘general point’ of Mr Powell’s speech about the impact of immigration had been ‘absolutely right’ – but conceded his prediction of violent racial clashes had ‘thank God’ proved to be wrong.","Ukip leader also pleaded with Powell to back him in Eastleigh by-election .

"A North Korean comedian was sent to do hard labour in a coal mine midway through her performance after she made a ‘slip of the tongue’ about the country's draconian regime. Lee Choon Hong, a popular comedian known for satirising and mimicking people in North Korean society, was performing for workers on a vast farm project ordered by leader Kim Jong Un when she commented on 'sensitive issues', it was reported. The comedian was immediately taken off and sent to the Jikdong Youth Coal Mine, without even having a chance to say goodbye to her family, according to local reports in the notoriously secret country. Lee Choon Hong was performing for workers at a farm project ordered by leader Kim Jong Un, pictured, when she commented on what was described as 'sensitive issues' The comedian was performing in Sep'o in North Korea when she was interrupted and taken to Sunchon . It is not known how long Lee will be held for, but a typical punishment is likely to involve a six-month evaluation period during which she would be observed at work in the mine before a decision to release her was made. Lee, who had been ordered by authorities to entertain the workers on a 150,000-acre pastureland farm project in Sep'o in Kangwondo Province, was doing her act when she made what was described as a 'sensitive comment'. A source told Radio Free Asia: 'She had a slip of the tongue while giving a performance for the workers at the Sepo reclamation project site'. They added: 'She was sent straight to the city of Sunchon in South Pyongan province to carry out reform work at the Jikdong Youth Coal Mine', and said she had had to postpone her daughter's wedding as a result. What the comedian said has not been reported, but it is said to be the second time she has upset authorities in North Korea - she was reportedly sent to do reform work in the mid-2000s after 'misspeaking'. Lee, who is known for being talented at impersonating people's voices, frequently performed for the late dictator Kim Jong Il, and was chosen to join his Entourage Of Delight in the 1980s. Life under the regime of the diminutive dictator with big ambitions is tough and regimented, and anyone stepping out of line can expect to be punished. Life in Kim Jong Un's regime is joyless and regimented - here soldiers march past the dictator in a show of military might .","Lee Choon Hong was performing for farm workers in Kangwondo Province .

"High street stores are set to enjoy bumper sales today as shoppers try to grab a festive bargain and avoid the chaos of online order deliveries. Around £40billion of sales are expected in the run-up to Christmas – and today is predicted to be one of the busiest days, on what some have dubbed White Saturday. The continuing discounts are thought to be a key factor, while the delivery problems for online orders mean many shoppers are likely to brave the cold and pick up presents the old-fashioned way to make sure they have them in time for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Crush: Shoppers on Black Friday scrambling for deals while today is predicted to be one of the busiest days . In fact, industry experts said the weather itself could well be a factor in the sales surge, despite the Met Office issuing an ice warning to many areas. Matthew Hopkinson, of retail analysts the Local Data Company, said people shop on the high street for the ‘experience’, adding: ‘The colder weather makes people feel more festive.’ Today’s so-called White Saturday follows the trend of certain days being marked out for high retail sales – such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday a fortnight ago – which was 50 per cent higher than expected and put a vast strain on delivery systems. Retail analyst Patrick O’Brien from Verdict said the problem with online deliveries had been ‘very damaging’. Many shoppers are likely to brave the cold and pick up presents the old-fashioned way to make sure they have them in time for Christmas . He added: ‘The amount of publicity you are seeing due to this problem will definitely cause concern, in terms of people not wanting to take the risk online.’ The Christmas period is crucial for the high street, with retail sales totalling £41billion last December. The British Retail Consortium predicts that Christmas food sales are likely to peak just three days before Christmas, on Monday December 22.","Around £40billion of sales are expected in the run-up to Christmas .
