"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidates faced off twice in 11 hours on Saturday and Sunday in debates ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. While both debates were staged in the Granite State, it was clear that the rivals intended for their messages to go beyond New Hampshire. Here are five things we learned from the weekend. Romney's debating skills on display . Neither debate did much to change the state of play in New Hampshire. Front-runner Mitt Romney's rivals went after him in both debates. Even when other candidates slighted Romney -- Rick Perry referred to an ""insider from Wall Street,"" and Gingrich went after Romney's private-sector record by repeatedly citing an article by The New York Times -- the jabs were either veiled or dispassionate. And using The New York Times to back up an argument probably won't excite the conservative base. Romney's opponents did step up their attacks between Saturday and Sunday, but then they seemed to back off. CNN.com Opinion contributor Todd Graham, an award-winning college debating coach, speculated that Romney's rivals dropped the direct attacks because they were ""worried about overcorrecting, appearing rude, and alienating voters (Gingrich came close when he told Romney to 'drop the pious baloney') -- or in the heat of the moment, they forgot their coaching once the second debate was under way."" Graham concluded that between Romney's polished debating skills and sometimes poor debating by his rivals, he has only solidified his position. Looking ahead to the general election? Over the past few years, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights movement has made strides, and many question whether someone who is not a supporter of the movement could win a general election in 2012. Such rights played a role in both debates. Rick Santorum, who has run on a predominantly social values platform, offered perhaps his strongest statement of homosexual support to date, saying he would not repudiate a son who told him he was gay. He was careful, however, not to say that he would fight for gay individuals, instead saying he would be an advocate for ""every person in America"" and would make sure people are treated with ""respect and dignity."" On the same topic, Romney said he has hired gay staffers in the past and would never discriminate against gays or attempt to take away their rights. Are these two men looking ahead to a general election, where strong social conservative values may not play as well? Social issues played a big role in Iowa and will do so again in South Carolina. Santorum's answer may have been a good middle-of-the-road response and a reminder of a phrase often used by Christian conservatives: Love the sinner, hate the sin. That may be a message to which conservative voters in South Carolina can relate. Message received? Americans have made clear their disdain for Congress, partisan politics and theatrics bringing government to a standstill. Both Gingrich and Romney touted their records of working with Democrats to hammer out legislative deals. Gingrich, who is best known for battling President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, highlighted that he struck deals with the Democratic president even though he wanted to make him ""a one-term president."" And Romney noted that when he was running Massachusetts, the state legislature was 85% Democratic but that he found ""common ground,"" adding that he's proved he can ""work with Republicans and Democrats who are willing to work together."" Santorum touted his ability to gain support among voters of both parties in his former Pennsylvania district, and Huntsman said that serving one's country should always trump party loyalty. But before candidates can work on uniting the party, they will have to triumph over their rivals as the bruising GOP primary plays out this winter. Huntsman's last stand? Since former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is placing all his chips on a strong finish in New Hampshire's Tuesday primary, the debates were his last, best chance to make his case. Saturday's lukewarm performance was followed by a stronger delivery on Sunday morning. After coming under attack Saturday night by Romney for his service as U.S. ambassador to China during the first two years of President Barack Obama's term, Huntsman strongly defended his time in Beijing on Sunday. But he also highlighted his fiscal plans as in tune with conservative Republican principles. And in a state where independent voters hold sway, Huntsman made his pitch, saying, ""the American people are tired of the partisan division. They have had enough. And I say, we've had enough, and we have to change our direction in terms of coming together as Americans first and foremost and finding solutions to our problems."" Ron Paul punches hard -- in person . The candidates have let super political action committees that support them do their dirty work on the campaign trail, spending millions on attack ads. But Ron Paul was one of the few candidates to repeat to his rivals' faces the same harsh criticism he's unleashed in ads or on the campaign trail. Paul stood firm in calling Santorum ""corrupt"" and Gingrich a ""chicken hawk"" for not having served in the military. ""Would you use that phrase (chicken hawk) again?"" moderator Diane Sawyer asked Paul on Saturday. ""Yeah,"" Paul responded. ""I think people who don't serve when they could and they get three or four or even five deferments aren't -- they have no right to send our kids off to war. ""I'm trying to stop the wars,"" he said. ""But at least, you know, I went when they called me up."" Gingrich responded with anger. ""Dr. Paul has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false,"" he said, denying that he had asked for a deferment and pointing out that his father had served overseas. ""I think I have a pretty good idea of what it's like as a family to worry about your father getting killed, and I personally resent the kinds of comments and aspersions (Paul) routinely makes without accurate information and then just slurs people."" CNN's Gabriella Schwarz, Shawna Shepherd, Paul Steinhauser, Rachel Streitfeld, Shannon Travis and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","Romney's opponents step up their attacks over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky's wife, Dottie, told CNN that she is angry about accusations of child sexual abuse occurring in her home, calling them ""absolutely untrue."" ""No child who ever visited our home was ever forced to stay in our basement and fed there,"" she said. ""We would never do anything to hurt them."" Her husband faces more than 50 charges surrounding a child sex abuse scandal that allegedly spanned more than 15 years. ""We don't know why these young men have made these false accusations, but we want everyone to know they are untrue,"" she added. An alleged victim testified that he made overnight visits to Sandusky's home as a boy and stayed in a basement bedroom. While there, he described a pattern of sexual assaults over a period of several years, according to the grand jury report. ""The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but no one ever came to help him,"" the report states. Responding to the allegations, Dottie Sandusky said she was ""shocked and dismayed"" by the alleged victim's testimony, calling his accusations false. ""I continue to believe in Jerry's innocence and all the good things he has done,"" she added. The former defensive coordinator posted $250,000 bail and left jail on Thursday, one day after he was arrested on 12 new counts of abuse involving two new alleged victims, raising the total number of victims to 10. Sandusky was then driven in a three-vehicle motorcade from the jail to his State College, Pennsylvania, home. Authorities say he is currently under house arrest and must wear an electronic monitoring device. He'll also be restricted from contacting the alleged victims, possible witnesses, and must be supervised during any interactions with minors. ""As in many of the other cases identified to date, the contact with Sandusky allegedly fit a pattern of 'grooming' victims,"" said Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. ""Beginning with outings to football games and gifts; they later included physical contact that escalated to sexual assaults."" A grand jury report made public last month detailed 40 charges of rape and molestation against the former coach in a child sex abuse scandal that, at the time, involved eight alleged victims. The lawyer for a 29-year-old man who is suing the school, Sandusky and Second Mile criticized Dottie Sandusky's statement. ""It really is a sad, clear demonstration of how sick she is because of how sick he is,"" said Jeff Anderson, who represents an accuser identified as ""John Doe A."" The Sanduskys both ""in their own way deny what we all know to be and what has been revealed daily."" Anderson's client was not cited in the initial grand jury report. The plaintiff, who Anderson said was 10 years old when he first met Sandusky, alleged the former coach sexually abused him dozens of times over several years during the 1990s, the lawyer said. ""The idea that 11 men (10 from grand jury reports plus 'John Doe A') who have nothing to do with each other have fabricated this many stories of abuse is beyond rational,"" said Anderson's co-counsel, Marci Hamilton. ""Victims rarely make up being sexually assaulted and abused."" ""John Doe A"" is cooperating with authorities, his lawyers said. Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, will face a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, where his alleged victims are set to testify. It is expected to be the first time the former coach will face them in court. The new accusers -- identified by authorities as Victim 9 and Victim 10 -- are believed to have encountered Sandusky at The Second Mile charity, a nonprofit organization he founded for underprivileged children. Victim 9 was between 11 and 12 years old when he first met the former coach in 2004. Sandusky allegedly gave the boy gifts and money, and took him to university football games, according to the grand jury report. Sandusky allegedly met Victim 10, then about age 10, in 1997 after a counselor recommended the boy attend the charity ""because of difficulties in his home life."" That witness said Sandusky performed oral sex on him and indecently touched him in an outdoor pool on campus. Penn State, meanwhile, said Thursday it has created the Center for the Protection of Children for ""the study, research, prevention and treatment of child abuse."" A portion of the funding will come from football bowl game revenues. ""We are opting to put our expertise and research power to work confronting the problem of abuse,"" said Penn State President Rodney Erickson in a statement. The university recently partnered with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center with a commitment of $1.5 million.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects, according to a Bush-era Justice Department memo released by the Obama administration. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, seen in a December sketch, was waterboarded 183 times in a month, a memo says. The controversial technique that simulates drowning -- and which President Obama calls torture -- was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo. Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times in March 2003. Mohammed is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Obama released the memo Thursday, saying that ""exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release.""  Watch other tactics outlined in memos » . The memo, dated May 30, 2005, was from then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA. It paints a different picture from the one described by former CIA officer John Kiriakou. In a December 2007 interview with CNN, Kiriakou said Zubaydah had been waterboarded for ""about 30 seconds, 35 seconds"" and agreed to cooperate with interrogators the following day. In an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Michael Hayden, who directed the CIA from 2006 to 2009, was asked about the number of times Mohammed was waterboarded. Hayden denounced the release of the memos and did not comment on the number, saying it was his understanding that the frequency of waterboarding was among the operational details that had not been declassified.  Watch one expert say tactics 'worse than Abu Ghraib' » . The 2005 memo refers to a letter that had contained the numbers as well. Part of the reference to the letter was redacted in the released memo. Waterboarding is among the interrogation tactics that Obama has prohibited through an executive order. The CIA also has admitted waterboarding Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. Obama said last week he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned. ""Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,"" Obama said in a statement. ""This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States."" The president applauded the work of the U.S. intelligence community and said no one who ""carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice"" would be prosecuted.","Memo: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed waterboarded 183 times in one month .

"(CNN) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Feller died Wednesday night in Cleveland, Ohio, of acute leukemia, according to a statement from the Cleveland Indians. He was 92. Feller was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in August and underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to implant a pacemaker in October. In mid-November, Feller was hospitalized with pneumonia. The major leaguer was an icon for Indians fans. ""We in Cleveland have been blessed to have had him with us these many years,"" said Indians owner Larry Dolan. ""To say he will be missed is such an understatement."" Feller spent 18 years in a Cleveland Indians uniform. He started 484 games, winning 266 of them. Feller had a lifetime ERA of 3.25, threw three no-hitters, including the only Opening Day no-hitter in Major League Baseball history, on April 16, 1940. In 1946, he pitched 36 complete games. ""Since 1936 he has been with us. For 75 years he has been a contributing citizen, a model for all athletes, and friend of thousands,"" Dolan said. ""As so it shall be in the larger sense, Bob will be with us always. Not at Opening Day, not at Fantasy Camp, not in the Press Box, but in our hearts."" Indians manager Manny Acta said Feller was a special person. ""There has never been a great one with such an affiliation to his original franchise,"" Acta said.

"(CNN) -- A three-judge federal appeals court panel Tuesday overturned a lower court's order blocking key parts of a Texas law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion, potentially clearing the way for enforcement of the law. In August, just before the law was set to take effect September 1, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas, found several portions of the law ""unconstitutionally vague,"" and ruled it violated the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech. But a panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Sparks' injunction against enforcing the law, saying opponents did not prove it violated the Constitution. The panel remanded the suit back to the lower court for further proceedings. As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure. Sparks' injunction blocked Texas from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who failed to place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them, or does not make the fetus' heartbeat audible. It also blocked penalties against the woman. A previous U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Pennsylvania case ""held that the fact that such truthful, accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a concurring opinion. ""Insisting that a doctor give this information in his traditional role of securing informed consent is permissible."" ""Today's ruling is a victory for all who stand in defense of life,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. ""Every life lost to abortion is a tragedy, and this important sonogram legislation ensures that every Texas woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying, and understands the devastating impact of such a life-ending decision. ""We will continue to fight any attempt to limit our state's laws that value and protect the unborn,"" Perry said. The suit was filed by the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights. Nancy Northrup, the center's president and CEO, said the court decision was ""extreme."" ""This clears the way for the enforcement of an insulting and intrusive law whose sole purpose is to harass women and dissuade them from exercising their constitutionally protected reproductive rights,"" Northrup said in a statement. ""Until today, every court that has reviewed similarly intrusive laws have ruled the laws unconstitutional."" The law, she said, ""serves only to place multiple hurdles between women and the free and full exercise of their reproductive rights."" The center, she said, is evaluating ""all available means"" to challenge the Texas law ""and all laws that seek to undermine women's fundamental rights."" The bill generated some controversy in Texas, but easily passed through the state's House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor is required to give, ""in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity and the presence of external members and internal organs,"" the law says. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: Abortion-rights group: Law is ""insulting and intrusive""

"(Fast Company)  -- The tech world's getting used to the idea Steve Jobs is absent from Apple again, for medical reasons. We think he'll be back soon. But one day he won't come back, and who might fill the big chair then? For the time being Tim Cook is in control at Apple, as he has been every time Steve Jobs has had to take time to tackle his health issues. Cook's time in the role has, self-evidently, been highly successful, and many commenters are tipping him to be Steve's eventual successor -- with these stand-in periods acting as a carefully managed succession plan. But is Tim really the guy for the job, given that Steve is still active as CEO in the background, and all big decisions are still cycling through him? Could someone else from inside Apple be a better fit, or is there someone working elsewhere we can imagine as the next Apple CEO? Tim Cook . Currently Apple COO, repeat stand-in for Steve Jobs. Demanding, keen-minded, unemotional. A science and business scholar, previously at Compaq and 12 years at IBM where he managed product and manufacturing inventories and chains. He's credited with making Apple's products stream reliably from their eastern manufacturing homes to their end users, and hot-tipped to replace Jobs by many. Recently introduced the high-profile Verizon iPhone. Once said: ""Replace Steve? No, he's irreplaceable. That's something people have to get over."" Odds for replacing Steve: Long, long, long. A good temporary replacement, but lacks dynamism and creative vision. Jonathan Ive . Currently Senior VP of Industrial Design at Apple. Highly regarded, award-winning brains behind nearly all of Apple's iconic computing and mobile products since 1996 -- starting with the industry-startling original candy-color iMac, and recently refining the aluminum unibody designs that are now a design reference point. A highly accomplished presenter and speaker, he's known as a perfectionist and thinks focus groups are a symptom of corporate ""creative bankruptcy."" Odds for replacing Steve: Medium-long, as though he's a super-hot property in the design field, and some of his philosophy aligns with Jobs', he lacks the industrial and technical training to replace his boss. He could be a powerful co-chair, though. Phil Schiller . Currently Senior VP of Worldwide Product Marketing at Apple. A 20-year Apple veteran, in different marketing management roles, he's credited with some of the smart moves that placed iMac, iPods, and iPhones as the chic devices to own in the public's eye. He often speaks at Jobs-led keynote speeches, and has led a keynote or two of his own to introduce new products. Not regarded as a business tiger, he does Twitter, and has spoken clearly about what makes Apple products unique: ""We want things to be beautiful, surprising to see, but they also have to be functional. One without the other doesn't make any sense."" Odds for replacing Steve: Medium. He has definite genius in marketing, and shares much of Jobs' product vision. But he doesn't have a dynamic public presence, and some see him as a bad CEO -- probably better suited at staying where he is, to support any future new CEO and ensure consistency. Scott Forstall . Currently Senior VP iPhone Software at Apple. Forstall is responsible for some of the key decisions behind Apple's OS X and its Aqua interface, and led the release of OS X Snow Leopard. A computer scientist by training, and formerly an employee of Jobs' NeXT computer firm, Forstall reports directly to Jobs and is credited with the successful industry-defining iOS interface of the iPhone and iPad. He's a smooth public speaker and has notable attention to detail: ""I actually have a photographer's loupe that I use to make sure every pixel is right"" Odds for replacing Steve: Good. Forbes called him a name you ""need to know in 2011,"" and he's young, possesses the right kind of technical knowledge and dynamism, and has become an increasingly important figure in key Apple product decisions. Eric Schmidt . Currently Executive Chairman of Google, formerly CEO. Educated in electrical engineering, he has a PhD and taught at Stanford Business School as a part-time professor. Joined Google in 2001, swiftly adopted the CEO role as a business-savvy figurehead in place to manage the tech-minded, but less business-savvy Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He stepped aside from this role in 2011, and will now advise CEO Page from a board level. Schmidt served on Apple's board from 2006 to 2009, but left due to conflict of interests with Google. A slick public speaker, Schmidt is however famous for making oral slip-ups that damaged Google's reputation, including ""We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about."" Odds for replacing Steve: Medium. He has stepped back from the hot seat at Google, and could easily depart its board which could resolve some conflicts of interest with Apple. He is highly business-minded, technically educated, but lacks Jobs' slickness and (possibly) creative vision. Would he do it, though? Tony Fadell . Currently retired, retained as a ""special advisor"" to Steve Jobs at Apple. Fadell is a computer science engineer, formerly CEO of Constructive Instruments and employee at Apple spin-off General Magic and Philips. Joined Apple in 2001 as a contractor advising on iPod design, then was quickly hired to its iPod and Special Projects group, a group he ran as SVP from 2006 after Jon Rubenstein's departure. Retired in 2008, at the same time as his wife Danielle Lambert (VP of HR at Apple) to concentrate on his family. On retiring he noted ""I'm determined to tell my kids and grandkids amazing stories beyond my iPod and iPhone ones."" Odds for replacing Steve: Unknown. He made a bold decision to spend time with his family, but retained a key role advising his former boss Jobs. He has the right technical skills and creative imagination and is certainly trusted by Jobs, but could he be tempted back for a couple of years for the right eight-figure salary? Mark Papermaster . Currently VP in Engineering at Cisco Systems. He is educated in electronics and worked at IBM for 26 years, including senior roles in the PowerPC chip project -- the chips that, at the time, powered Apple's computer lineup. Highly regarded in the industry, Apple tried to recruit him in 2007, but didn't find him a fit for the role in question. After Fadell left, Papermaster was recruited in late 2008 to help integrate Apple's recent chip design acquisitions. A controversial battle with IBM occurred, concerning Papermaster's intense inside knowledge of IBM's tech, and though this was resolved he left Apple in late 2010 due to the iPhone 4 antenna woes and broader ""cultural"" differences. Odds for replacing Steve: It's very unlikely to happen. Unless Apple's Board decides Papermaster's technical expertise and dynamism are crucial to develop the internally produced chips that Apple is increasingly relying on for its signature products. A possible co-CEO? Peter Skillman . Currently VP of Meego Ux and Services Design at Nokia. Skillman has an MSME in Product Design from Stanford, but is most famously known as the man behind Palm's revolutionary Pre phone -- the last-ditch effort by Palm to remain relevant in a post-iPhone world. He left his VP of User Experience role Palm after its acquisition by HP and joined Nokia in late 2010. Speaking about his area of expertise since joining Nokia, Skillman noted ""Design is just 5% of a world class product and experience. Marketing, sales, distribution, [and] procurement is what makes up the other 95%."" Odds for replacing Steve: Long in the short term, good in the future. Skillman certainly has the right criteria for the Apple CEO role, understanding technical matters, design principles, marketing roles and management issues. He's unlikely to leave Nokia soon, and who knows if he'd be tempted to join Apple, but he's the right stuff. Copyright © 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC.

"(CNN) -- Colombia's main leftist group suggested on Monday it is willing to reopen talks with the government. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, has been at war with the state since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. In a statement, the FARC said it would be interested in addressing certain issues at a ""hypothetical negotiating table."" It called on the government of President Juan Manuel Santos to speak to such subjects as privatization, deregulation and the degradation of the environment. The statement was signed by the FARC's new leader, who goes by Timoleon Jimenez. ""This conflict will have no solution until our voices are heard. Without lies, Santos, without lies,"" it read. In November, a military operation killed then-FARC leader Alfonso Cano. Following his death, the group said it would not not end its guerrilla struggle.

"Opelika, Alabama (CNN) -- At the Community Market food bank, two small alcoves -- each with three chairs and a desk -- are used for interviewing potential clients. At the desk closest to the front door, Michael Davis sits across from an elderly woman with thick glasses. Dottie Battle is a volunteer at the food bank, and she asks for Davis' identification. He reaches into a worn Ziploc bag, pulls out his driver's license and social security card, and hands them to her. Battle asks for his gas, electric and telephone bills, and Davis also pulls them from the same bag. Then Battle asks Davis if he has applied for food stamps, a requisite for this program. He shakes his head ""no."" ""You need the food stamps,"" Battle says firmly. ""You need them badly. And we will need proof that you went and applied for them before you come back. ...You know that, you've shopped here before."" Failure to comply with all the requirements could mean denial from the Community Market program -- at a time when Davis says he's been hungry for about two days. ""It's not a good feeling,"" Davis says. ""You have to think about it like fasting, like they did in the Bible, and pray for another blessing. That's really the only way to get through it."" After about 10 minutes, Davis is approved for 75 pounds of food from the Community Market this visit. He quickly picks up his documents and begins looking for food on the shelves. Rising food prices expected to cause inflation . This week, the U.S. Labor Department announced that raw import grain prices rose 1.4% this past February -- that makes an 8.5% increase over the past twelve months. Keystone food commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat have already increased 149% this past decade, according to the New America Foundation's Smart Strategy Initiative Director Patrick Doherty. Doherty recently wrote for CNN that the U.S. is too vulnerable to rising food and oil prices, and that strong policy decisions are needed to steer the economy through the prolonged price spikes. ""With persistent high unemployment, oil fueling more than 95% of America's transportation system, and transportation costs running 24% of income in suburbia and in exurbia, 35%, America's middle class is extraordinarily exposed,"" writes Doherty. For families already on the brink, such increases could be devastating. ""If prices go up any more, you are going to see more people here and other food banks,"" says Community Market director Elsie Lott. ""You can see it every day. People that used to give us food are now asking for it."" Hunger already a 'social fever' Over the past year in Lee County, Alabama, more than 3,000 families accessed the Community Market food bank. Nationwide, the Gallup Organization reports 16%have gone hungry during the year due to finances. ""Hunger is like a persistent social fever in our country,"" says Jim Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center. ""It is like a malignant social ill that leaves the country weaker, and more susceptible to other problems like poorer educational performance and health problems."" FRAC advocates for federal funding of food programs as a way of solving hunger. ""If you look at other wealthy societies, mostly European, but also some Asian, they have a vastly different hunger problem than we do,"" Weill says. ""Fewer people in those countries go hungry. The sharing of economic growth and the sharing of affluence lifts a lot of people out of poverty and hunger."" A recent New York Times data sheet shows those differences plainly. In Singapore 2% of the population goes hungry. Advanced economic countries of Sweden, Denmark, Germany France, England and Switzerland all have fewer hungry people than the United States. Renewed focus on feeding children . To curb this trend, especially among children, many private businesses annually help fill the pantries of the poor. Bank of America, Xerox and Geico help food banks around the country. Small businesses have also helped extensively in underserved communities. In the Tuscaloosa area, for example, the Alabama Credit Union funds a food program called Secret Meals for Hungry Children. Enrollment has swelled has from 18 participants to more than 900 in a little more than two years. ""The thing that most surprises me is the numbers,"" says the program's administrator, Dusti Monk. ""I think it was a little naive of me to think that hunger was a third world country issue, when it's right here in our backyards."" The program enlists teachers to identify hungry children, and then request meal packets from the credit union. The teachers secretly slip meals into the student's back packs on a Friday, so the kids have food over the weekends. ""You can tell the kids are hungry by the way they eat when they get to school on Monday,"" Monk says. The program costs $120 per student, annually. Monk says the Credit Union recruits sponsors from the community and around the state, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. President Barack Obama has enlisted the help of private organizations like the Alabama Credit Union to help eliminate childhood hunger by 2015. During his term, ""food insecure"" households have remained virtually unchanged according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Four decades ago, President Richard Nixon urged Congress to help eliminate federal hunger spending programs. ""That hunger and malnutrition should persist in a land such as ours is embarrassing and intolerable,"" Nixon wrote in 1969. Back then, less than 5% of the population was estimated to go hungry due to poverty or other economic reasons, according to research by the Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition. A government 'waiting for you to die' For people, like Wendy Madison of Opelika, rising food prices could be the difference between good health and a bad smile. Madison says she has been poor most of her life, and that she lost her front teeth due to poor nutrition. ""It's the worst thing in the world,"" Madison says. ""I don't even want to look at people. I cover up to smile. Emotionally, it hurts just as bad as being hungry."" Madison says there was a 10-year period where her family was doing well, before her husband Joseph had a massive heart attack. She says her family's biggest mistake is they failed to plan for such hard times, and didn't save. Now, their family of three depends on a little more than $1,000 dollars in disability pay, along with $294.00 in food stamp benefits per month -- the equivalent of a dollar per meal. Madison says her food stamp benefits have not increased despite rising food prices. An increase in benefits have been denied repeatedly -- leaving the Madisons ""begging for food while going hungry."" ""It makes you feel useless,"" Madison says, ""like your government is waiting for you to die so they don't have to help you anymore.""","U.S. is vulnerable to rising food and oil prices .

"(CNN) -- Some found it shocking when Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber granted convicted double-murderer Gary Haugen a reprieve Tuesday, setting aside Haugen's scheduled December 6 execution. Haugen, who killed another prisoner while serving a life sentence for a previous murder, had waived all appeals. In a previous term as governor, Kitzhaber allowed two men to be executed, and he explained Tuesday that ""I simply cannot participate once again in something that I believe to be morally wrong."" A medical doctor with an active license, the governor also referred to his oath as a physician to ""do no harm"" as he announced Haugen's reprieve and a moratorium on executions for the remainder of his term in office. Notably, in issuing a reprieve (or delay) rather than commuting Haugen's sentence, Kitzhaber left open the possibility of Haugen's execution under a future governor. As the news spread, many people reacted with anger. Kitzhaber has been called a coward and worse. This wave of anger, though, should not distract from two important truths: first, that Kitzhaber's actions are within, not without, the basic rules of our democracy; second, that Kitzhaber is a proxy for the thousands of people in this country who have had to live with doubt and even regret because they were thrust into the death penalty process while doing their civic duty as jurors, judges or lawyers. In 1984, Oregon voters chose by referendum to reinstate the death penalty. The legislature formulated rules for capital punishment. Prosecutors elected, as they could, to pursue the death penalty against Haugen. A jury heard the evidence, and 12 Oregon citizens voted to have Haugen put to death. The courts that heard Haugen's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. Then, after all of this, Kitzhaber chose not to finish this expensive and consuming project. Kitzhaber's choice is anti-democratic, it does frustrate the will of prosecutors, it must be confounding to those 12 jurors, and it constitutes a tremendous exercise of power based on just one person's sense of morality. It is also wholly within the genius of American government. Oregon and other states have incorporated executive clemency into their systems of criminal law, drawing on the example laid out in the United States Constitution. The framers of the Constitution chose intentionally to give the executive that power, knowing full well that it would necessarily run contrary to popular will. If you are angry with Kitzhaber for using that power, also direct your anger at Alexander Hamilton, who was a driving force behind the institution of executive clemency in the United States. Here is part of what Hamilton said about it in Federalist Paper 74: ""Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed. ... On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men."" The anti-democratic institution of clemency that is generating such anger is contrary to the voters of Oregon, yes. However, we should not forget that that same institution is ancient, principled and an integral part of the broad scheme of justice that wiser men than I have constructed. A second buried truth is revealed within the tortured way in which Kitzhaber announced his decision. During a prior term as governor, in 1997, he had allowed two executions, and it seems clear that he was deeply troubled by his role in those killings. How could he not be? It is a heavy responsibility to participate in a deliberative process that identifies a citizen to be put to death by the state. However, Kitzhaber is just the exposed tip of an iceberg of human emotion. Beneath him are thousands of others who have been forced by the institution of capital punishment to live with their role in an intentional death. Among that group are lawyers, witnesses and judges, but perhaps most sympathetic of all are the jurors. They are plucked from their daily lives by the government and suddenly thrust into the most important role of all -- they must vote, unanimously, after deliberation, on whether someone will live or die. If they vote for execution, they must file back into that hushed, tense room, look that person in the eye and say in the most public of ways that they have chosen him to die. I have known some of those jurors. Years later, even if they were convinced they were right, they revealed deep and dark emotions related to what they had done. At best, that service was seen as a difficult but worthwhile sacrifice, and at worst as a moment they too often relived while filled with doubt. Kitzhaber is right to say that the capital process is fatally flawed. It is unfair to some defendants, yes. But a system that tries many, condemns some to die and executes few is also cruel and unusual to those who work within the process. It is primarily inflicting pain on victims' relatives who wait in limbo, on jurors who relive those discussions, on prosecutors whose hearts are hardened while their efforts are frustrated and on the budgets and reputations of the states that choose to go on with it anyway. Kitzhaber is not wrong to declare a moratorium, but he would be better advised to fully commute the sentences of those on death row and urge his fellow citizens to be done with the whole mess that this process has become. That kind of bold action is not cowardice. It is leadership. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Osler.","Mark Osler: Oregon governor drew some angry reactions to convict's execution reprieve .

"(CNN) -- Stringent restrictions remain in place Monday on about 100 soldiers at a large military base in Washington state after the theft of ""sensitive"" and valuable ""military-grade"" equipment. Members of the Army Criminal Investigation Command are at Joint Base Lewis-McChord trying to find out who is responsible for the missing items, said Maj. Chris Ophardt, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's I Corps that is headquartered at the base and includes the affected unit. ""Hundreds of items"" are missing from a vault that is inside a building on the base, the spokesman said. They include things such as scopes and night-vision goggles but no guns or ammunition. ""There are no weapons, and there's no danger to the public,"" Ophardt said. After learning of the thefts, the Army decided on Wednesday to put members of the Army's 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division on lockdown, preventing soldiers from making phone calls or leaving the unit's barracks or unit office. The unit has been home from Iraq since September 2010. These measures were relaxed somewhat on Saturday, with some supervised visits allowed on a case-by-case basis to deal with personal issues and permission granted to eat at the base's dining facility. Division members, who live either on or off the base, still must sleep at the barracks. There is no timetable as to when all the restrictions will be lifted, Ophardt said, adding that decision will depend on the investigation. ""(This will) go on as long as we can gain information about the person or persons involved in the theft,"" said Ophardt, noting no timetable has been set for when the restrictions will be lifted. ""This is being taken seriously, so (the military) can get back the equipment that taxpayers paid for."" Military officials did their monthly inventory of the vault in December. They then did another after the holiday vacation and determined that ""large amounts"" of items were missing -- ""immediately"" precipitating the lockdown, said Ophardt. A $10,000 reward has been offered by the Army in the case. He explained that every unit has its own vault, which in this case has two locks -- one on the vault, and another on the door to an abutting office. It has not been determined whether the missing items were stored properly or if someone was able to get into a properly locked vault and made off with the equipment. ""There are a zillion possibilities,"" Ophardt said of what might have happened. The missing items could all ""be bought on the civilian market, just one or two generations older,"" the spokesman said. He added that they have limited use to the public, given the challenges in knowing how to use them and having the right kind of weapon to attach them to. The restrictions on the soldiers affect only a fraction of those at the expansive Joint Base Lewis-McChord, as none of the other roughly 50,000 people on the grounds about 13 miles southwest of Tacoma are directly affected.","Stringent restrictions are in place on soldiers at base in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- There's always been something about Margaret Thatcher that makes grown men go weak at the knees, particularly members of the Conservative Party. Perhaps she revives memories of stern schoolmistresses; perhaps they just grudgingly admired a strong woman telling them what to do. I suspect the same will be true of Meryl Streep's portrayal of the former British Prime Minister in the new biopic, ""The Iron Lady,"" which the consensus appears to view as a pitch-perfect performance, accurately capturing the look, sound and general aura of the United Kingdom's first female premier. For many, the movie will be a nostalgia trip, whisking viewers back to happier times when politics was politics, there were heated ideological battles and elected leaders actually believed in something. ""The Iron Lady"" plays on all of those things, although without explicitly taking sides. There's no real attempt to analyze whether she was right or wrong during any highlighted episode. So we witness Mrs Thatcher taking on striking miners in the mid-1980s, taking on the Argentinians to recover the Falkland Islands early in her premiership, and -- the most consistent theme of all -- taking on the British Establishment to reach to top of what Disraeli called ""the greasy pole"" of politics in the first place. Review: ""The Iron Lady"" Biopics naturally simplify -- how else could an eventful career be crammed into just over 100 minutes of celluloid? But the essence of the Thatcher years are certainly there and besides, the collective memory of that turbulent decade is also simplistic and broad brush. A nuanced analysis of Thatcher's economic record would hardly have kept the box office busy. That said the screenplay takes few serious liberties with historical fact. Mrs Thatcher's political love-in with the then US President Ronald Reagan is covered, albeit briefly, as is her attempted assassination by the IRA in 1984. The leadership crisis that ended her premiership in 1990 also features, as one might expect in a biopic. Thatcher, of course, remains a deeply divisive figure in the UK -- not least in parts of northern England and Scotland -- so movie audiences, like the country at large, will be divided. Maggie fans will glean reassuring glimpses of what made her great in their eyes, while those who remember her less fondly will no doubt come away with their prejudices safely intact. Gallery: ""The Iron Lady"" and other political biopics . But for the generation or so of moviegoers who have no direct memory of the events covered in the film, their perception of Mrs Thatcher -- her legacy and beliefs -- will undoubtedly be highly informed by ""The Iron Lady."" Although not really ""political"" in that it offers few judgments, Streep's performance is nevertheless useful historical propaganda for a Conservative Party grappling with many of the same issues today. More interesting will be the reaction to the depiction of Baroness Thatcher's dementia, first (publicly) revealed by her daughter Carol a few years ago. Although it has often been mentioned in the press, few in the UK are directly aware of its extent and will probably be shocked at Streep's nuanced portrait of the Iron Lady displaying more than a little mental rust. It's almost a taboo subject, looking back on Mrs Thatcher's political career through the eyes of an obviously frail old lady. How would an American audience have reacted to such a portrayal of Ronald Reagan in his dotage? I suspect not at all well. Political activists prefer to remember their heroes -- and heroines -- in their prime. Older members of the Conservative Party often indulge in the wistful refrain: ""If only Maggie was still leader of the party."" They do so because they find the thought comforting, secure in the knowledge that with a click of her heel and a firm handbagging she would sort out all the old enemies. In that respect, ""The Iron Lady"" will probably bring tears to some veteran Tory eyes.","David Torrance: Margaret Thatcher biopic ""The Iron Lady"" a nostalgia trip .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court appeared ready to give government regulators the continuing authority to regulate profanity and sexual content on broadcast television after a lively hour of arguments Tuesday. The justices and lawyers all stayed polite, not actually using any obscene words, preferring the legally acceptable ""f-bomb"" or ""s-word"" to describe the controversial content at issue in the high-stakes free speech dispute. The court will decide whether the Federal Communications Commission may constitutionally enforce its policies on ""fleeting expletives"" and scenes of nudity on television programs, both live and scripted. The agency had imposed hefty fines on broadcasters. In many televised instances, ""one cannot tell what is indecent and what isn't"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""It's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations,"" she added. But with so many programming choices on broadcast, cable and satellite TV, ""All the government is asking for is a few (broadcast) channels where you can say -- they are not going to hear the s-word, the f-word. They are not going to see nudity,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said. The court's ruling, which will come in a few months, could establish important First Amendment guidelines over explicit content on the airwaves. The Justice Department had filed an appeal, and helpfully provided the justices with a DVD of a 2003 episode of the now-canceled ""NYPD Blue"" on ABC in which a naked woman was shown. The content of that program is central to the ongoing legal dispute. Lawyer Seth Waxman representing ABC said the FCC's tough action against the network was ""a shot out of the blue."" A federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies, concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied. Pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are all parties in the case. Controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks in the past eight years, dating back to when the FCC began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. The policy became known as the Golden Globes Rule, for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" Justice Stephen Breyer dryly noted the language from the two women ""seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary."" That drew laughter in the courtroom. The CBS complaint involved dirty language on ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program. The high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of ""fleeting expletives,"" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity. The court, however, refused at the time to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, ruling only on the agency's enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a New York-based federal appeals court, which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters. The Justice Department, in its new appeal, lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together, saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one. Explicit language is heard with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of ""indecent"" language and images on broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. The commission formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. In addition, a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired. Much of the oral argument Tuesday centered around the ABC television stations fined $27,500 each for airing the ""NYPD Blue"" episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed. ""The episode is called 'Nude Awakening.' It's about the sexual awakening of a child,"" Breyer said. ""The whole thing was titillating,"" suggesting the FCC in this case could step in and declare it indecent. But Justice Elena Kagan echoed the sentiments of the networks. ""There is some amount of uncertainty, and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty,"" she said. ""Because it turns out that nudity -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed -- and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years,"" until the clampdown a decade ago. The networks complain the FCC allowed profanity in such movies as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and full-frontal nudity in ""Schindler's List"" when they aired on broadcast TV, but fined stations for other allegedly ""indecent"" material. ""Context matters,"" said Chief Justice Roberts, skeptical about what he was hearing from the networks. ""People understand that, including children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversations and use the words. And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world."" Another source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the TV networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and the CW -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins, in a content way. Most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy, and just 10% of the population receives its TV only through the airwaves. But the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite, and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children. ""What do you call it, you surf through all the (cable) channels. And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued for the FCC. ""But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television. Why is that, when there are so many other options?"" Justice Antonin Scalia: ""Sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this court. ... If these are public airwaves, the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency."" But Ginsburg interjected: ""The expletives are in common parlance today. I think that the children are not going to be shocked by them the way they might have been a generation ago."" Kagan suggested the broadcast regulatory model has been around since the 1920s. ""It seems to work and it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist anymore."" Justice Samuel Alito went further, saying the whole broadcast debate may be moot in a few years. ""Broadcast TV is living on borrowed time. It is not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track tapes,"" he told the network lawyers. ""I'm sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by Internet. But to the extent they are making money from people who are using rabbit ears (antennas), that is disappearing."" Verrilli warned that without the current regulations, viewers would see only more profanity and nudity. ""The risk of the race to the bottom is real, and I think history is showing it."" There were flashes of humor throughout. When Waxman noted viewer complaints after a recent Summer Olympics, showing a female statue -- ""very much like some of the statues that are here in this courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks"" -- several justices began looking about in search of the artwork. ""Right over here, Justice Scalia,"" said Waxman, pointing to a carved frieze atop the courtroom showing legal figures, including a bare-breasted symbol of justice. Everyone enjoyed that moment of levity. The Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin on society's taboo surrounding ""seven dirty words."" The bit had received some radio airplay. The justices said ""context"" should be applied when deciding whether words or images are ""indecent."" The major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. Time Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network and operates several cable networks. The case is Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations Inc. (10-1293).","NEW: Justice Scalia: ""The government is entitled to insist upon a ... modicum of decency""

"New York (CNN) -- Police in New York and Virginia are searching for a 22-year-old Virginia Commonwealth University student who went missing days after arriving in New York City to celebrate New Year's Eve, according to authorities. Ian Hunter Burnet left Richmond, Virginia, on a bus bound for New York on December 26, according to his father, Mark Burnet. He planned to stay with a fellow VCU student and her friend in an apartment on 139th Street near Riverside Drive in Harlem, his father said. ""He went up just to have a post-Christmas tourist visit to New York City and celebrate New Year's Eve. He was intending to have a short time there and then return back to Virginia,"" Burnet said. According to his father, his son and a friend had made plans to hang out together back in Virginia on January 2, but Ian Burnet never made it back. The last communication he had with his son was December 28. ""I received a routine type of text talking about touring in New York,"" he said. Some other news outlets have reported that Burnet told friends he was not having a good time in New York, but his father told CNN that was something he had not heard. ""I wish I knew more,"" he said, ""If I did, I might be able to understand what happened."" What investigators do know is that the friends with whom Burnet was staying say they last heard from him on December 30. ""Ian was communicating via text with them and the last bit of information that we had was that he was just stepping out to go out for the evening. And we don't have any information other than that,"" said Burnet's father. ""It's very frustrating,"" said New Kent County Sheriff Farrar W. Howard Jr., whose Virginia office is leading the investigation in conjunction with Virginia State Police and the New York City Police Department. ""Nobody has seen him since the 30th."" The NYPD is directing all media inquiries to the New Kent County Sheriff's Office. Mark Burnet said that Ian, who graduated as valedictorian from New Kent County High School and was on a full scholarship to study engineering, was looking forward to classes starting back at VCU on January 17. He said Ian had lived on his own for years, was independent and would have no reason to simply run away. According to Mark Burnet, his son's roommate from school told him that she and Burnet had planned their courses for next semester together and that he was excited to finish his degree. Authorities retrieved Burnet's phone at the apartment where he was staying, but for Burnet to be without his phone is not uncommon, according to his father. ""He didn't really like talking on the phone. He would send texts and surf the Web, but he didn't like to carry a lot of valuables on his person,"" Mark Burnet said. Authorities say Burnett did take his driver's license and credit cards with him the last time he left the Harlem apartment. ""Who knows what's going through a 22-year-old's head?"" said Burnet's father, ""but he would not want us to worry; if he was out there, he would get in touch with us."" Friends, family and supporters held a candlelight vigil in Virginia on Tuesday night for the missing Eagle Scout. Ian's ex-girlfriend, Meaghan King, attended. ""He has always had a good head on his shoulders, [he is] probably one of the sweetest people I have ever come in contact with,"" she said. Burnet's parents set up a Facebook page, which is drawing in tips for police, as well as volunteers. ""There's a lot of people out there trying to look on the streets and see what's happened, but the fact is we just don't know, and we're really trying to find someone who might know,"" said his father. ""I'm hoping that those people who know how to investigate these matters can do that; that's my hope."" Burnet's parents plan to travel with friends to New York on Thursday to be with family in New Jersey, and help in the search for their son. Police describe Burnet as a white male, who is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds. He has brown hair and green eyes and was last seen wearing a gray ""Wikipedia"" sweatshirt.","Ian Hunter Burnet, 22, left Virginia to celebrate New Year's Eve in New York .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- From the ninth floor of an office building here, Verizon Wireless executives peered out of a window at the breathtaking view of the East Bay. Behind them, baristas wrestled with an espresso maker and served up free cappuccinos to guests. The newly renovated office, located in SoMa, San Francisco's tech hub, is home to the Verizon Application Innovation Center, which opened last month. Big and small software developers are invited to work here at no charge, with unlimited access to development phones, wireless equipment, shielded test rooms and lattes. The modern workspace is part of Verizon's plan to improve its image in the technology industry and particularly with people who develop mobile phone apps, executives said in interviews. App makers often condemn carriers for monthly data caps and limits on high-bandwidth apps, which they see as stifling innovation. Cell giants, including AT&T Mobility and Britain's Vodafone, are taking approaches similar to Verizon's to deflect criticism and position themselves as friends, not foes, of developers. Vodafone, which partially owns Verizon Wireless, opened its own development center in Silicon Valley this month. AT&T cut the ribbon last week on its Foundry Development Center in Palo Alto, California. All of the furniture there is on wheels to facilitate makeshift meetings. Currently, 106 projects are under way at the foundry, many of them in collaboration with other companies. ""The purpose here was really to be right in the middle of Silicon Valley, in the heart of innovation,"" Jon Summers, an AT&T technology executive, said last week. ""The one thing that we are extremely passionate about is enabling innovation through these partnerships and within this community."" AT&T also is working with esteemed venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital to identify small companies with which the carrier should work, Summers said. Third-party developers are welcome to show up at the foundry unannounced and receive technical support from people there, he said. An AT&T spokeswoman declined to say how many workers staff its facility, but Summers said Ericsson has employees there along with AT&T engineers, and that people from Microsoft and Juniper Networks will also work there intermittently. Ericsson is also a founding partner in Verizon's innovation-center program. A Verizon spokesman said 25 engineers work at its San Francisco office. Verizon previously launched a similar facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, for hardware developers. AT&T opened two others earlier this year in Plano, Texas, and Ra'anana, Israel. Work at these centers has resulted in exclusive projects for each company, executives said. Part of the motivation for the significant investments is to avoid being seen as a ""dumb pipe,"" or as solely a conduit for data, said Michael King, a Gartner Research analyst. ""I think the long-term goal for a lot of these carriers is they don't want to become pipes,"" King said. ""When you think about it, the carriers don't bring a lot to a developer."" There may be technical limits to what developers can accomplish with these new carrier-specific app stores. Telecoms operate many parts of their business as ""a closed loop,"" rather than unlocking services such as text messaging to developers, said Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook product director. The carriers will have a tougher time convincing software makers, especially those who produce hot consumer apps, to sign exclusivity contracts, King said. ""If you've got a really compelling app, why are you going to limit yourself to half your potential market?"" King said. ""You are not going to tie yourself to a carrier."" Verizon and AT&T executives acknowledged as much in interviews. Developers who use their facilities likely will offer their apps on competitors' networks, they said. ""No one has a monopoly on good ideas,"" Verizon Wireless CEO Dan Mead said at the center's opening last month. Verizon appears to be winning good will with smaller tech companies, however, which could be a valuable asset. Some developers, who, according to Verizon tech exec Kyle Malady, saw Verizon as ""the big, bad carrier,"" changed their outlook after meetings at the new office. ""The partners started saying, 'You guys are so open,' "" he said. Apple has attributed some of its successes in the mobile industry to a massive base of support from developers. Verizon CTO David Small said in an interview last month that people in the wireless industry see Apple as the impetus for renewed interest in Silicon Valley. Apple has been holding an annual summer developers conference for more than two decades. AT&T had its fifth annual developer summit in January on the eve of the Consumer Electronics Show. Verizon wrapped up its third last week in Las Vegas. ""We recognized from the beginning,"" said Verizon's Small, ""that the potential for innovation is bigger than Verizon.""","AT&T opens a Foundry Development Center in Silicon Valley .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Hours before the first primary vote of 2012, Republican front-runner Mitt Romney tried to recover from a potential stumble Monday as his presidential rivals intensified their attacks against him. Voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary begin choosing their GOP candidates as early as 12 a.m. Tuesday in two small towns -- Dixville Notch and Hart's Location -- while polling stations in the rest of the state open at 6 a.m. and close as late as 8 p.m. ET. The final day of campaigning saw Romney under fire for a comment about health insurance that quickly became fodder for criticism. Asked about the issue in Nashua, New Hampshire, Romney said he wanted a person to be able to own his or her own policy ""and perhaps keep it the rest of their life."" ""That means the insurance company will have the incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don't like what they do, you can fire them,"" he said. ""I like being able to fire people who provide services to me,"" Romney added. ""If someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say I am going to get somebody else to provide that service to me."" Rival candidate Jon Huntsman immediately seized on the comment as an indication of Romney's political nature. ""It has become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Gov. Romney and me,"" Huntsman said in Concord. ""I will always put my country first. It seems that Gov. Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov. Romney enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs."" The Democratic National Committee released a derisive Web video and called Romney ""out of touch,"" while the campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry looped Romney's words to make a cell phone ring tone that quickly went viral. Romney spent much of the rest of the day clarifying what he meant. At one point, Romney said he expected the comment to be taken out of context to try to hurt him, and his campaign issued a statement emphasizing he was talking about firing an insurance company, not people. ""Our opponents are taking Gov. Romney's comments completely out of context,"" said a statement by Gail Gitcho, the campaign's communications director. ""Gov. Romney was talking about firing insurance companies if you don't like their service. That is something that most Americans agree with."" The latest twist in the GOP presidential race came on the eve of the first primary election a week after Romney won the Iowa caucuses by just eight votes over former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. With Romney in front in polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina, the site of the first Southern state primary on January 21, rivals stepped up their attacks by questioning the former Massachusetts governor's business background and electability. In Manchester, former House speaker Newt Gingrich tore into Romney's record in the private sector at the helm of Bain Capital. Though Romney has said his work at the Boston-based private equity firm ultimately led to the creation of 100,000 jobs, Gingrich said Romney's pursuit of wealth exacted a huge cost. ""What you have to raise questions about is, somebody goes out, invests a certain amount of money, say $30 million, takes out an amount, say $180 million -- six to one return -- and then the company goes bankrupt,"" Gingrich said. ""Now, you have to ask a question: Is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of other people and walk off with the money? Or is that, in fact, a little bit of a flawed system? And so I do draw a distinction between looting a company, leaving behind broken families and broken neighbors, and leaving behind a factory that should be there."" Romney fired back that Gingrich and others were joining President Barack Obama in attacking the free enterprise system. ""As we'll find out, free enterprise will be on trial,"" Romney said. ""I thought it was going to come from the president, from the Democrats, from the left, but instead it's coming from Speaker Gingrich and apparently others."" Gingrich had vowed earlier to run a positive campaign. But his tone has changed since his poll numbers plunged over the past month and he came in fourth in last Tuesday's Iowa caucuses. ""My conclusion after Iowa was very simple,"" he said Monday in Manchester in response to a question. ""You could not engage in unilateral disarmament when 45% of all the ads being run were attacks on me. To do that would be to get out of the race."" In Derry, New Hampshire, Santorum predicted the Republican field will narrow to a showdown between himself and Romney, ""and we'll win this race."" Responding to a reporter's question about his electability, Santorum said the country is more likely to elect a ""strong conservative"" than a man who has ""run (previous elections) as a liberal, a moderate, and a conservative."" Santorum also cautioned voters to avoid the ""establishment candidate."" ""When we've run establishment candidates, we've lost,"" he said, referring to veteran candidates in past elections who he said were nominated because of a perception it was their due after long careers. ""We lost with John McCain, we lost with Bob Dole. We lost with Gerry Ford."" Perry, meanwhile, made fun of Romney's comment over the weekend that he knows what it's like to worry about getting a pink slip, questioning whether such a wealthy man as Romney would fear losing a job. Campaigning in South Carolina, the site of the next primary on January 21 and the first Southern state to weigh in, Perry said people there were out of work ""because of what Mitt Romney and Bain Capital did."" Perry's decision to leave New Hampshire for South Carolina on Monday reflected his low poll numbers in the Granite State and hopes to revitalize his campaign in the traditionally conservative Palmetto State. Another candidate, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, said he was holding back on big spending in another upcoming key primary state -- Florida. Paul, who has consistently been among the top three in polling, told CNN that he would focus instead on caucuses that come after Florida's primary on January 31. ""We don't have a big campaign planned there, but they'll know we're there,"" Paul said in an interview. Florida was penalized by the Republican National Committee for moving its primary earlier than rules allowed, with its 99 delegates cut down to 50. Still, Florida is a critically important state for the general election. Asked about not focusing on Florida, Paul pointed out he had to prioritize spending his available campaign funding and had done well so far with a third-place finish in Iowa and polls showing him contending for second place behind Romney in New Hampshire. ""I think it tells you that we are realistic. That's the way we approached Iowa, we did pretty well there, and right now, polls are looking pretty good up here. So I think we're being realistic, we shouldn't be acting like the government and spend money we don't have,"" Paul said with a chuckle. Paul's campaign chairman, Jesse Benton, said the focus after South Carolina will be the caucus states of Nevada, Louisiana, and Maine, which offer a total of 98 delegates, and where Paul's aides hope to rack up enough to keep their campaign going all the way to the Republican Convention in Tampa, Florida. Paul also made clear that if he does better than expected here in New Hampshire and can raise more cash, his campaign might change course and compete more forcefully in Florida. ""We have to wait and see how things go,"" Paul said. Huntsman, meanwhile, has made New Hampshire his make-or-break contest. He skipped campaigning in Iowa to spend all of his time stumping the Granite State, starting Monday in Lebanon in the north before working his way south to the coast. A new poll Monday night by the American Research Group showed Huntsman's support rising, with 18% of respondents supporting him -- good for second place behind the 37% support for consistent front-runner Romney. Paul was third at 17% and Santorum fourth with 11%, followed by Gingrich at 10% and Perry at 1%. The poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters had an error margin of 4%. Romney and other GOP candidates also targeted Obama with sharp rhetoric Monday. ""I am very concerned that over the last three years you have seen, America, a very difficult time,"" Romney told an afternoon event in Hudson, New Hampshire. ""This has not been a continuation of America's greatness from the past. I think it has been more of a detour than the destiny of America. I actually think the president has tried, but he has failed."" At a luncheon with business leaders in Greenville, South Carolina, Perry attacked the Obama administration for suing to block an immigration law recently enacted there, and he chided the National Labor Relations Board for intervening in the construction of a Boeing Dreamliner facility in Charleston. ""South Carolina, you are in a state of war with the federal government,"" Perry said. In New Hampshire, the other candidates were busy. Gingrich had seven planned events Monday while Santorum scheduled six. However, Gingrich canceled his final event because of what his campaign said were security concerns over protesters at the entrance and exits. Paul started Monday by greeting a crush of voters in Manchester. ""I wonder what the fire marshal would think,"" he said as he shook hands. ""Let's keep it a secret."" Paul, who has the backing of many libertarians, predicted he will do well in New Hampshire because of his appeal among the 40% of Granite Staters who say they're independent voters. ""I think the people here in New Hampshire are very independent-minded, and I have a strong appeal because I have challenged both the Republican and Democratic Party leadership, and that means they want a message of cleaning house,"" Paul said in Meredith. CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Peter Hamby, Dana Bash, Chris Welch, Rachel Streitfeld and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman moves up in latest poll .

"(EW.com) -- The 2012 box office got off to a fine start this weekend, as Paramount's ""found footage"" (riiiight...) horror movie ""The Devil Inside,"" which the studio acquired for just under $1 million, earned a tremendous $34.5 million in its first three days, becoming the first breakout box office star since ""The Lion King 3D."" In fact, the strong debut marks the third-best January opening of all time behind ""Cloverfield"" ($40.1 million) and a re-release of ""Star Wars"" ($35.9 million). Is this a sign of things to come in 2012? Perhaps. But it's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies. Demonic tales have made a mini-comeback in the last few years -- starting with the success of 2005′s ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" which earned $75.1 million domestically. Since then, similar titles like 2009′s ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" ($55.4 million), 2010′s ""The Last Exorcism"" ($41 million), and 2011′s ""Insidious"" ($54 million) have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets. ""Insidious,"" for example, cost just $1.5 million to make. Of course, the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies (the fourth of which was just announced this week) are the biggest success stories of this whole trend. A total of $8 million has been spent making the three ""found footage"" movies, yet they have earned $296.7 million domestically. Paramount marketed ""The Devil Inside"" in much the same way the studio markets the ""Paranormal"" films. Commercials included ample shots of audiences screaming at the screen, and viewers were encouraged to use social media to chat up the film with the ""Tweet Your Scream"" campaign. Indeed, all the promotional costs -- certainly a much higher number than the budget -- helped ""The Devil Inside"" achieve a stellar debut, but where does it go from here? Well, it falls. Fast. Due to their overwhelmingly young audiences, who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend, horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office, but ""The Devil Inside,"" with its utterly terrible ""F"" CinemaScore grade (some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an ""F"" or closer to the ""C"" range), will likely plummet even more quickly. Not that it really matters, though -- the horror pic is already in the black, and it may finish with as much as $70 million. In second place, ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" another Paramount film, continued its comeback performance with $20.5 million in its fourth weekend. The action blockbuster, which became the biggest hit of the holidays, has now earned $170.2 million, and it should finish well above $200 million. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" held onto third place with a $14.1 million weekend. The sequel, which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original ""Sherlock Holmes,"" has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks. After two weekends, ""Shadows"" was trailing ""Sherlock Holmes"" by $59.7 million, but over the past two weeks, the sequel has narrowed that gap to $22.7 million, and it now has a running total of $157.4 million -- still disappointing, but not nearly the disaster it first appeared. ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" finished the frame in fourth place with $11.3 million, dipping only 24 percent, the smallest drop in the Top 10. Could the edgy adaptation finally be finding its adult audience now that the warm n' fuzzy holiday season is over? After 19 days, ""Dragon Tattoo"" has grossed $76.8 million, and if it maintains strong holds like this, it should pass $100 million. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked"" rounds out the Top 5. The kiddie threequel, which has majorly underperformed compared to expectations, dropped 42 percent to $9.5 million. It has now grossed $111.6 million total. The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing. Two of them, ""War Horse"" and ""We Bought A Zoo,"" are performing respectably, though. The films earned $8.6 and $8.5 million, respectively, this weekend, and they have nearly identical totals of $56.8 million and $56.6 million. Still, there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that ""War Horse"" (which cost $66 million) is performing admirably, while ""We Bought A Zoo"" (which cost $50 million) kind of fizzled, to which I say: Huh?! In eighth place is a movie which has actually fizzled -- at least domestically. ""The Adventures of Tintin,"" Steven Spielberg's expensive motion-capture animation, dropped 42 percent this weekend to $6.6 million and $61.9 million total. In ninth place, Focus Features' ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" which expanded into 809 theaters this weekend, performed admirably in its wider release. The well-reviewed spy drama maintained a robust $7,129 per theater average, giving the film a $5.8 million weekend and an early $10.4 million total after five weekends. ""New Year's Eve"" held onto a spot in the Top 10 for one final weekend. The ensemble romantic comedy fell 48 percent to $3.3 million. The film has earned $52 million (less than half the gross of Valentine's Day), and it likely won't make it much further. 1. The Devil Inside - $34.5 million . 2.

"(CNN) -- In Europe, the English have a reputation. They are notorious for prodigious drinking at Mediterranean resorts, a complete inability to master other languages and the habit of recalling World War Two every time England plays Germany at football -- or when it's time to remind the French of their spineless defeatism. In turn, the words ""perfidious Albion"" have for centuries been part of a deep-seated French distrust of the English. ""The English lie at mid-point between men and beasts,"" wrote the French author Robert-Martin Lesuire in 1760. Much more recently, French politicians have railed against ""Anglo-Saxon"" free-market capitalism as being responsible for the global financial meltdown. Just two weeks ago, French President Nicolas Sarkozy complained that globalization and free trade were at the root of the Eurozone crisis. For their part, Germans are puzzled by the endless fascination of the British with the wars of the 20th century. ""The older generation in particular see it as the last great act of national collective effort and self-assertion, the final episode in the history of the Empire before its imminent dissolution,"" writes the philosopher Gunnar Beck. He's not making it up. In 2010, an astonishing 850 books about the Third Reich were published in Britain. Germans are relieved that the French don't have such visceral memories of war but wish they'd have more financial rectitude and a little less flamboyance. The Germans have fond memories of the deutsche mark, which rose out of the ashes with West Germany and was sacrificed for the euro. Chancellor Angela Merkel is conscious of a growing resentment among Germans that they must constantly open their wallets to support the more profligate Europeans. This strange triangular relationship is often played out in the councils of Europe. But frequently Britain is the odd man out -- the semi-detached and half-hearted member of the European Union. The United Kingdom has always looked across the Atlantic as much as across the Channel to pursue its interests -- a sentiment only reinforced by memories of wartime Atlantic convoys that resupplied Britain and by the allied landings in Normandy. By contrast, visionaries like Jean Monnet of France and Konrad Adenauer of West Germany, looking out at the ruins of Europe in the late 1940s, sought ways to bind together former enemies. The First World War had supposedly been the ""war to end all wars."" But this time, when they said ""never again,"" they meant it. ""Make men work together. Show them that beyond their differences and geographical boundaries there lies a common interest,"" Monnet said. Last week, both Merkel and Sarkozy have summoned the ghosts of conflict to galvanize support for the European ideal, with Merkel warning the continent faces its gravest hour since 1945. The ideal they are trying to save began modestly enough, with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952: a single market for the coal and steel of six countries. But that common market was soon extended to become the European Economic Community (EEC), and gradually more aspects of national sovereignty were pooled. It was a Franco-German dream. Britain was too busy divesting itself of empire. And when it turned from colonies to Europe, it bumped up against Charles de Gaulle, who dominated French politics for much of the post-war period. De Gaulle was innately suspicious of Britain and its ""special relationship"" with the United States. He twice vetoed British applications to join the evolving common market; and pulled France out of NATO's military command. Once de Gaulle was gone, Britain -- under the leadership of the pro-European Conservative Edward Heath -- was finally accepted into the EEC. But Heath was in a minority among Britain's Conservatives, who would spend the next generation arguing over Europe. The centrists saw Europe as essential to Britain's trading and financial future in a world of titans. The ""Little Englanders"" as they were often scornfully described, thought Europeans elitist, given to endless bureaucracy and determined to undermine a millennium of English self-rule. And the Germans and the French were usually the villains. When Jacques Delors, a Frenchman who was president of the European Commission, advanced the cause of deeper union, Margaret Thatcher famously told the House of Commons, ""No, no, no."" The tabloid Sun newspaper joined in with one of its most famous splash headlines: ""Up Yours Delors."" It was no surprise, then, that Britain opted out of joining a single European currency under Thatcher's successor, John Major. The alternative was the implosion of the Conservative party. The euro (whose very name was squabbled over for months) was another Franco-German enterprise, but its backers had different motives. For President Francois Mitterrand of France, it further bound Germany into a closer European union just when German unification -- after the collapse of the Berlin Wall -- threatened to make Germany the dominant continental power. For Helmut Kohl, then German chancellor, closer integration in defense, security and foreign policy was a prize worth the sacrifice of the deutsche mark (though few Germans agreed with him.) Which brings us full circle. The euro came into being in 1999, but other targets (inflation, public debt, deficits) were at best patchily met. Europe had monetary union, but no fiscal union or convergence among national economies. John Major recently revisited the ""folly"" of the scheme in an op-ed for the Financial Times. The ""convergence of the powerful northern economies with southern Europe was unlikely,"" he wrote. Bad politics had taken precedence over sensible economics. The British, of course, usually have a sporting metaphor for these European crises. After Major won an opt-out from the single currency and a ""social chapter"" aimed at establishing, for example, common labor standards, he declared, ""game, set and match"" for Britain. The prominent Conservative politician Boris Johnson said Prime Minister David Cameron ""had played a blinder"" (a uniquely Anglo-Saxon compliment) in Brussels -- after Cameron had refused to countenance a European financial services tax. The Sun took aim at Sarkozy Friday: ""Who do you think EU are?"" screamed its headline. As one European official puts it, the Brussels summit has given the European Union a vague road map and a not terribly accurate compass. Just who is coming along for the ride is not entirely clear, but Europe's third largest economy (or second if you use sources preferred by the British) is clearly not. The words of German Chancellor Adenauer, spoken in 1954, are about to get one of those stress tests that banks are getting used to: ""The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today it has become a necessity for all of us.""","Britain, Germany and France have long had a strange triangular relationship .
Britain has often been the odd man out, not fully buying into European unity .
Just who is coming along for the latest ride is not entirely clear ."
"(CNN) -- The son of Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Joe Philbin died from ""fresh water drowning"" and there was no evidence of foul play, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, police said Wednesday. The body of Michael Philbin, 21, was pulled from a river Monday, a day after he went missing while in Oshkosh to visit friends, police said. Toxicology results from the autopsy, conducted Tuesday, will not be available for several weeks, according to a police statement. ""We love Michael so much and will miss him dearly,"" Joe Philbin said in a statement released Tuesday afternoon. ""He loved his family, friends and life. His memory will live on in the hearts and minds of all who knew him."" Philbin thanked the agencies that assisted in the search and expressed gratitude for ""the prayers and the support of our family, friends and the Packers family."" On behalf of the team, Packers general manager Ted Thompson said everyone's thoughts and prayers were with the family. ""This is an emotional and difficult time for them, and we ask that everyone respect their privacy,"" he said. ""All of us in the Packers family share in their grief."" The body was found Monday in the Fox River after Oshkosh police put out an alert asking citizens for help locate Philbin, who lived about 20 miles away in Ripon. His last known communication was at 2 a.m. Sunday, police said. ""He talked to a friend. He didn't sound like he was under duress or he had any medical condition,"" police spokesman Joe Nichols told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. ""The phone conversation ended, and that was the last time someone had voice contact."" Michael Philbin was the second-eldest of six children of Joe Philbin and his wife, Diane, according to the Packers' website. His funeral is set for Friday. His father coached for 19 years at college football programs before coming to Green Bay in 2003 as an assistant offensive line coach. He became the team's offensive coordinator in 2007 and played a significant part in the Packers' league-best 15-1 regular season record this season.

"(CNN) -- Police arrested 46 people Saturday morning after they swept through a downtown city square in Boston, Massachusetts, evicting ""Occupy"" protesters encamped there since late September, officials said. CNN affiliate WCVB broadcast images of handcuffed demonstrators being led away by police, who first offered the group the option of leaving before making arrests, according to police spokesman Eddy Chrispin. ""The city is in the process of clean-up and trying to restore Dewey Square to its prior state,"" said Chrispin. ""For the most part, it was nonviolent."" By late Saturday morning, an ""Occupy Boston"" twitter feed was abuzz with news of the eviction. ""Occupy Boston is NOT done! You can't evict an idea! :) The camp may be gone but the people, ideas & passion isn't,"" read one post. Another post promised to offer ""details about the plan as soon as we know."" ""For now, get some rest. It will be a big afternoon!"" On Wednesday, a judge ruled that demonstrators' First Amendment rights do not extend to seizing and holding areas on which they sit. Authorities are ""obligated by law to preserve Dewey Square as a space open to the public,"" wrote Superior Court Judge Frances A. McIntyre. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who in the past appeared to tolerate his city's chapter of the nationwide movement, later signaled that the area could be a safety hazard as winter weather rolled in, imposing a Thursday deadline for the group to clear out or face eviction. By Friday, however, protesters remained firmly entrenched in more than 100 tents. Saturday's arrests was the city's second large-scale action against demonstrators since the movement began there in late September. In October, 129 people were arrested during a march in which protesters allegedly blocked traffic and refused to disperse. The movement, which first sprang up in a Lower Manhattan park, seeks to highlight what it sees as corruption and growing income disparities between the nation's richest 1% and the rest of the country.

"(CNN) -- Tuesday night's tight contest for the top spot in the Iowa Republican caucuses reflects the ongoing tension that exists within the Republican Party. This struggle between the conservative religious voters -- whose voice is strong and loud in Iowa and was represented by Rick Santorum -- and the more moderate, mainstream voters, represented by Mitt Romney, is indicative of a fight for the soul of the Republican Party. What is so interesting is that four years ago, Romney's 25% share of the vote was not nearly enough to give him the victory. But this year, that same 25% is enough to keep him alive. While his campaign will spin that he was not really playing in Iowa, he cannot be totally happy, because the Iowa results cannot be read as anything than a continued rejection of Romney by conservative GOP voters. Regardless, as long as the anybody-but-Romney vote is split among several candidates, and the longer most of them stay in the race, the better it is for Romney -- who can thereby win primaries with far less than a majority. Social conservatives made very clear in Iowa that it was important for them to take a stand and vote for someone they could feel good about -- someone who in their hearts and consciences they could wholeheartedly defend -- rather than give their votes to someone they did not like and did not trust. Again, this is not good news for Romney. He is like the bitter pill that conservatives refuse to take as long as there is still a viable alternative. It also indicates that Romney still has an uphill battle to convince the majority of GOP voters that he is the one who can fully represent core conservative values and principles. He was not able to make the sale in Iowa. Will he be able to make it in upcoming states where conservatives also have an important voice? Romney has made a career of changing his stances to match the prevailing political winds. In 2008, that lack of core political values cost him the nomination. Are Republicans desperate enough this time around to support someone who has marketed himself as perhaps not the perfect conservative, but at least the best bet against Barack Obama? If that is the case, the problem for Romney will be that general election voters will see right through this farce, even as conservative GOP voters have here in Iowa. He will have a tough time making the case that he is the best candidate on the economy, since when he was governor of Massachusetts, his state was the third-worst in the country on job creation. When he was head of Bain Capital, he destroyed more American jobs than he created, while making millions for his investors -- just ask Randy Johnson, a factory worker who was laid off because Bain Capital closed the factory where he worked. Romney has also moved so far to the right on other critical issues that it will be hard for him to reconcile those positions with those of more mainstream general election voters. And what about the importance of Latino voters? Let's not forget that no GOP candidate will see the inside of ""La Casa Blanca"" without at least 40% of the Hispanic vote, according to Bush pollster Matthew Dowd. No GOP candidate even bothered to visit the Latino-rich population towns in Iowa, and Romney has already declared he would veto the Dream Act if he becomes president. So let's be clear -- the GOP can say goodbye to the Latino vote in the general election. This overall tension within the GOP between the mainstream and the extreme was in full display Tuesday night in Iowa. As such, the biggest winner of the Iowa caucuses by far is Obama. As I saw someone tweet Tuesday night -- somewhere in Iowa, the Obama campaign is smiling. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum virtually tied for first place in Iowa .
Maria Cardona says the contest shows Romney can't make the sale to conservatives .
She says he has swung right to win their votes, which would hurt him in general election ."
"(CNN) -- Syria's major opposition group condemned Bashar al-Assad's regime Wednesday for ""brutal massacres"" this week and urged the U.N. Security Council to protect civilians against ""acts of genocide."" ""The regime is using children as human shields so that tanks and armored vehicles can storm residential areas,"" said the Syrian National Council, which said that about 250 people have died over a 48-hour period. ""Incidents of gruesome murders have been recorded,"" the council said Wednesday, including the killings of four brothers and the beheading of a sheikh, whose head was hung above a mosque entrance. Both incidents occurred in Idlib, and the council says ""acts of genocide"" are occurring in Zawiyah Mountain in Idlib province in the northwest and the city of Homs in the west. It cites ""the regime's use of heavy weapons and artillery in shelling civilian neighborhoods, as was the case in the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, as well as in the villages of Kansafra, Kafar Awaid, and Mazrain, where a large number of residents were killed. Other residents were forced to flee under heavy gunfire,"" the council said. The villages are in Idlib province. The violence spiked as Syria agreed to an Arab League observer mission Monday aimed at ending the violence between regime forces and protesters that started in mid-March. The United Nations this month estimated that about 5,000 people have died in the bloodshed. ""The SNC directed letters to representatives of the 15 member nations of the U.N. Security Council, including the permanent members, urging them to convene in an emergency session to discuss the brutal and systematic killings, the humanitarian situation, and the displacements forced by the regime and its security and military apparatus,"" the group said in a news release. The council also sent ""urgent communiques"" about the violence to the Arab League; the Organization of Islamic Cooperation; the Gulf Cooperation Council; the General Secretariat of the United Nations; the U.S. Department of State; the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs; representatives from the Chinese Foreign Ministry; and the governments of France, Spain, Germany, Canada, Tunisia, Libya and Sudan. ""The SNC urgently requested that these parties support the Syrian people's and the Syrian Revolution's demands for international protection, the establishment of safe zones for civilians, and the establishment of humanitarian corridors for delivery of relief, medical, and other humanitarian needs. The SNC also demanded a prompt intervention to stop the massacres, which have reached the level of genocide and which coincide with the signing of the Arab League Protocol to send observers into Syria,"" the council said. Mohamed Hamdo, a lieutenant colonel in the Free Syrian Army, underscored the ferocity of the assaults. He said that government forces ""used military jet fighters and bombed Jabal Al Zawya, including a mosque that contained around 100 civilians who were praying or using it as a refuge."" Jabal Al Zawya is in the Idlib region in northwestern Syria. Hamdo said the military also ""destroyed the town of Idlib completely and bombed a hospital there. The problem is they are using women and children who are mounted on their tanks as they raid, making it impossible for us to hit back."" ""We have information that they are preparing an attack to control the border crossing to Turkey. We are dispersing our FSA platoons to counterattack. They are using surface-to-air missiles, mortars, military jet fighters and artillery."" Activist groups also reported a surge in killings this week. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported a higher death toll of 111 on Tuesday and 121 on Monday. The Monday figure included 72 soldiers who tried to defect. The civilian death toll so far Wednesday is at least 16, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group. And, a video surfaced on social media websites of a boy's grisly killing in Homs during a missile attack Tuesday. This violence comes as an Arab League advance team is headed to Damascus Thursday to prepare for the observer mission. There would be 100 observers in teams of 10 to investigate what is happening on the ground in a month-long mission. The league's secretary-general, Nabil el-Araby, called for an ""immediate stop"" of violence and ""swift action"" Thursday to pave the way for the observer mission. ""The Syrian government must take responsibility of protecting its citizens in accord to their promises and agreement entailed in the Arab Plan,"" said el-Araby, worried about news of increased violence. The observer protocol is part of a larger initiative that calls for withdrawing the army and militias called shabiha, releasing detainees and ending all forms of violence. But Syria and the Arab League haven't yet signed the larger initiative, only the observer protocol, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saudi Al Faisal said Tuesday. ""We expect Syria to follow a policy of buying time, delay and limit the observers' movement on the ground. We think it is a political maneuver by the Syrian regime,"" said an Arab diplomat intimately involved with the Arab League deliberations. The diplomat could not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the matter. Opposition members have criticized the Arab League for naming Sudanese Brig. Gen. Mohammed Mustafa Al-Dabi to be the chairman of the observer mission. They cite close ties between Sudan and Syria and Sudan's track record of using its own national security officials to target activists and political groups. The White House said it is ""deeply disturbed by credible reports that the Assad regime continues to indiscriminately kill scores of civilians and army defectors, while destroying homes and shops and arresting protesters without due process. ""While Syrian security forces have also taken casualties, the overwhelming majority of the violence and loss of life in Syria stems from the actions of the Assad regime, and we call on all parties to put an end to violence."" The United States, the European Union, the Arab League and Turkey have initiated sanctions against the regime. ""The Assad regime is already facing growing isolation and sanctions that are choking off its resources. We urge Syria's few remaining supporters in the international community to warn Damascus that if the Arab League initiative is once again not fully implemented, the international community will take additional steps to pressure the Assad regime to stop its crackdown,"" the White House statement said. The French Foreign Ministry called on the U.N. Security Council to speak out on a firm resolution that ends repression in Syria, and it asked Russia, a Syrian ally, to ""accelerate talks"" at the council on a plan it devised to deal with the instability. ""Everything must be done to stop this murderous spiral into which Bashar al-Assad is dragging his people deeper each day,"" ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said. ""In this serious context, France calls for a bigger mobilization of the international community."" In another incident, Abdel Azeez Al-Khair, an Alawite opposition figure from the National Coordination Body, was detained briefly at the Damascus airport before he tried to take a flight to Cairo to discuss Syria with Arab League officials, two opposition figures told CNN. He is not allowed to travel. Alawities are a minority sect that holds the reins of power in the Syrian government. Syria, an ethnically and religiously diverse society, is largely Sunni Arab. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of violence or other incidents because Syria restricts the activity of journalists in the country. The Syrian government maintains that it is cracking down on armed terrorists who attack security forces and civilians. The activists say the government's brutal crackdown against peaceful protests has led to the deaths. Meanwhile, the Iranian Embassy in Damascus has confirmed the kidnapping of five Iranian engineers in Syria on Wednesday and demanded their release, Iran's Mehr News Agency reported. They are employed by the Jondor Homs electricity plant, Mehr reported. ""These people were in Syria to provide the Syrians with technical and development help, and they should be freed as quickly as possible,"" the Iranian Embassy said. There has been opposition anger toward Iran and its support of the Syrian government.

"(CNN) -- A man who allegedly tried to break into the home of a recently widowed Oklahoma woman -- who shot and killed his alleged fellow intruder after calling 911 -- was freed Thursday on bail despite a first-degree murder charge, a court clerk said. Although he did not fire the fatal shot, 29-year-old Dustin Louis Stewart is charged with first-degree felony murder in the incident because if someone dies during the commission of certain crimes, such as burglary, an alleged accomplice can be charged in the death, prosecutors have said. A hearing for Stewart was held Thursday in the central Oklahoma city of Chickasha, five days after the incident. During that hearing, Stewart posted the $50,000 bond and was released, Grady County court clerk Jessica Pickle told CNN. Prosecutors recommended that $50,000 be set as the bail amount, according to a court document. Stewart was ordered not to have any contact with the alleged victim -- in this case, Sarah Dawn McKinley, who fired the fatal shot -- and to appear next in court the morning of January 20. A preliminary hearing in the case is set for May 23, the document signed by Stewart states. The incident has caught the nation's attention because part of the action was captured during a 911 conversation. Home alone with her 3-month-old son, McKinley of Blanchard, Oklahoma, said she decided to make a stand when the two men tried to break into her home on New Year's Eve. McKinley, who had been widowed less than a week before, placed a couch in front of one door and went to the bedroom and put a bottle in her baby's mouth before calling 911, she said on HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" on Wednesday. A 911 operator calmly spoke with McKinley, who asked if it was permissible to shoot an intruder, officials said. ""I've got two guns in my hand. Is it OK to shoot him if he comes in this door?"" asked McKinley, 18. ""Well, you have to do whatever you can do to protect yourself,"" dispatcher Diane Graham responded. ""I can't tell you that you can do that, but you do what you have to do to protect your baby."" In the end, McKinley fired a 12-gauge shotgun and killed Justin Shane Martin after he entered her home, according to a Blanchard Police Department affidavit filed in court Wednesday. Martin was armed with a knife, authorities said. ""You have to make a choice, you or him. I chose my son over him,"" McKinley said to CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV. First Assistant District Attorney James Walters told CNN that McKinley will not be charged because she acted in self-defense. ""A person has the right to protect themselves, their family and their property,"" Walters said. As for the 911 operator's guidance? ""I would agree with that advice,"" the prosecutor said. It's not uncommon for charges to be filed against an alleged accomplice in cases where two people are committing a crime and a death occurs, even that of a co-conspirator, said Trent Baggett, assistant executive coordinator at the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council. ""It's all dependent upon if the situation warrants it and the facts warrant it,"" he said. ""... If in the commission of a qualifying offense, someone gets killed, then yes, (first-degree murder charges) can and probably will be filed upon the person who doesn't die."" Even if they didn't pull the trigger themselves? ""Under Oklahoma law, it doesn't matter,"" Baggett said. And people have been convicted of first-degree murder under such circumstances, he added. Graham was the first of two 911 operators to speak with McKinley. The dispatcher told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday she learned in training that she could not tell a caller to shoot someone but, ""as a mother, I wanted her to protect her baby."" ""She did a very good job in keeping her (McKinley) calm,"" Grady County Sheriff Art Kell said of Graham. ""Her job is to make sure the person on the phone is comfortable ... to give them support."" McKinley was on the phone with a second dispatcher when she pulled the trigger. McKinley's husband died of cancer on Christmas Day, Walters said. Evidence indicates Martin and Stewart may have been looking for painkillers or other drugs taken by McKinley's ill husband, the assistant prosecutor said. Investigators found no such drugs, he told CNN. Police said Stewart told them Martin knew McKinley's husband had died, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Martin suspected prescription drugs would be inside the home, the station reported, citing court documents. McKinley said she believes the men were coming after her, rather than intending to commit a robbery. According to the affidavit, the men approached McKinley's mobile home Saturday afternoon. Martin had devised a plan to burglarize the residence, police said. Stewart told investigators he and Martin ingested hydrocodone about 30 minutes before reaching the rural home, the affidavit states. Martin ""aggressively"" knocked on the doors of the home and gained entry by hitting one of them with his shoulder, police said. Stewart said ""he heard a gunshot after Martin entered the residence,"" and Stewart then ""fled on foot."" McKinley said she had pushed the couch against the door to deter entry. ""When he busted in the door I saw something shimmering in his hand,"" the mother told HLN. ""I thought it was a pistol at first, but it was a 12-inch hunting knife. I didn't know (that) until after I shot and killed him."" Martin, 24, was found between the door and a couch with a knife clutched in his gloved left hand, police said. CNN's calls to police in Blanchard, about 25 miles south of downtown Oklahoma City, were not immediately returned. Stewart's attorney, Stephen Buzin, told CNN he would not comment on specifics of the case against his client. ""We will let the facts come out at trial and feel comfortable with his innocence,"" the attorney said. Martin recently had approached McKinley's home, saying he wanted to introduce himself, Walters said. The man said he worked for the owner of the property on which McKinley lived, she told HLN. McKinley, who in addition to the shotgun was also armed with a pistol, was on the phone with authorities for 21 minutes, Walters said. ""She remained as calm as one could under the circumstances and had the forethought and called 911, as everyone should,"" he said. McKinley was asked on ""Dr. Drew"" whether she regretted shooting Martin. ""No. We could have been in a whole different situation if I hadn't done it,"" she replied.

"(CNN) -- When the 2,455th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is laid on Monday for actor Steve Guttenberg, Ana Martinez will once again be working behind the scenes as curator-in-chief to the iconic attraction. The Walk of Fame is one of showbiz's most visible landmarks,and Martinez has been its inconspicuous producer for almost half the attraction's 51 years, making sure the constellation of stars is perfectly aligned on the Hollywood sidewalks. For 24 years, she has been the person deciding where celebrities will receive their coveted symbol of fame in the heart of Tinseltown. When a star is unveiled to the international press corps, Martinez is the field marshal orchestrating every detail of one of showbiz's alpha moments. ""If there was one phrase to describe Ana, it would be mistress of ceremonies,"" said Sam Smith, the former chairman of the board for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. ""She truly is a master of the ceremonies."" Martinez has produced 586 star ceremonies. On Monday, Martinez will be at the ready with clipboard and iPhone in hand, negotiating over an obstacle course that typically numbers 22 film crews with 39 people, 22 still photographers, eight wire photographers, three newspaper reporters, two radio reporters, two photographers from the Chamber of Commerce and sometimes a celebrity's personal photographer. ""She is a gatekeeper of the integrity of the Walk of Fame. At the same time she's responsible for promoting the Walk of Fame all around the world,"" said Smith. A star is awarded after a lengthy process in which hundreds of nomination applications are sent to the Hollywood chamber, and then its Walk of Fame committee selects the winners, with the approval of the chamber's board of directors. The names also are submitted to the city of Los Angeles' Board of Public Works Department. The chamber requires a $30,000 ""sponsorship fee,"" often paid by a studio, recording label or even a group of fans, chamber officials said. Martinez also coordinates when her boss, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and various political figures speak in honor of the star. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa recognizes the importance of the walk as a civic landmark. He said it is ""a powerful magnet which brings people from around the world to Los Angeles."" ""Ana Martinez and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce have played a vital role cementing L.A.'s reputation as the creativity capital of the world,"" Villaraigosa said in a written statement to CNN. It's clear that Martinez loves what she does. Martinez, who is 5 feet 4 inches with shoulder-length brown hair, declined to give her age, but said she started her career at the chamber as a receptionist in her early 20s after a brief stint at CBS. She assisted the then-publicist in handling the Walk of Fame. The publicist left the chamber six months later and even though Martinez was the obvious person to fill the role, management initially hesitated. ""The other staff and management said I was too nice, too shy,"" Martinez said. But Martinez eventually evolved in a way many stars do. ""I had to create a different persona for the (star) ceremonies,"" she said. ""I have to control everything."" With her staple head-to-toe black regalia to her dark shades -- green or gray depending on how bright it is outside -- she definitely controls the event. When singer Shakira received her star in November, fans turned out in full force. The emotional followers swelled to nearly a thousand and nearly spilled over barricades when they saw their idol. Martinez said she welcomes fans because it also is a big day for them, but she keeps a close eye on security. When one enthusiastic Shakira fan jumped over a barrier to meet his idol, the no-nonsense show-runner sprang into action. ""I grabbed his wrist, pushed him back and our security girl carried him out,"" Martinez said. Then of course, there is the celebrity. Martinez often already knows each family member and friend of the star by name before they arrive. She keeps a close eye on her iPhone, looking to see if the stars are on schedule in order to greet them and their entourages and lead them through the ceremony. After the celebrity gives his or her speech, Martinez quickly directs them to the star, which is then unveiled. The media, who are packed in a tightly sectioned-off sidewalk space around the star, attempt to get a shot of the celebrity. Martinez decides in advance where each media organization will be positioned. Martinez streamlines the production and cues the stars and their entourages on which cameras they should direct their gaze to and for how long. Within a few hours, thousands of the images Martinez orchestrates from the ceremony permeate the Internet. Though Martinez's career involves cementing names on the Walk, she knows the faces in Hollywood often change as quickly as the styles on the city's storefront displays. But she has been a constant in the city, a meaningful achievement in Hollywood's transient culture, where broken dreams predominate. She has also watched Hollywood drastically change from a seedier era when prostitutes and adult bookstores reigned on the streets. ""We don't have that any more,"" said Martinez. ""Hollywood has changed, even the Walk of Fame has changed."" She credits former star and honorary Hollywood Mayor Johnny Grant for the redevelopment. ""The MTA [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] money was going to go to another state -- he went and talked to the attorney general and convinced them to keep the money in Hollywood. That's why you have (the) Hollywood and Highland (Center)."" As Hollywood evolved, so did the number of stars on the Walk of Fame. Martinez said the walk she and Grant oversaw brought tourists to Hollywood. ""Every day it's mobbed with people. In the summer it's booming. They want to be near the Walk of Fame, and what is now the hub of Hollywood."" In her time at the chamber, Martinez has become a sort of encyclopedia for the Walk of Fame. She can rattle off where every star is, who was late to the ceremony and which awards of the 300-pound marble monuments caused controversy. Marlon Brando's Walk of Fame moment was one of those. Martinez said Grant dealt with the outcry. ""Marlon Brando allegedly said some anti-Semitic comments and they called Johnny Grant. ... He says, 'If we move the star for every person that might have said something, there would be no Walk of Fame,' "" she said, remembering Grant's no-nonsense business attitude. Even in a moment of panic, Martinez is the consummate businesswoman. Smith said he sees the resemblance between Martinez and her mentor. ""You get how serious she is just from her tone of voice,"" Smith said. ""And people don't cross it. When he used to run the ceremonies, people didn't mess with Johnny either."" Martinez doesn't just promote the celebrities, she promotes an entire tourist attraction that is recognized around the globe. The walk ""brings a lot of people to the community,"" she said. She recalled an earthquake that shook Los Angeles many years ago and how the tourists didn't budge. ""Nothing fazed, them. They want to be where their celebrity has stood,"" Martinez said. Not every part of the star construction has always gone so smoothly, however. Just hours before Julia Louis-Dreyfus' star ceremony took place, a CNN producer walking by noticed the star's name was missing the hyphen and the ""o"" in ""Louis."" ""I was really upset. I pride myself on everything going perfect,"" said Martinez. She now has the star installers text a picture of the lettering before they cement it into the star, she said. Even though it was one of the roughest days of her career, Martinez focuses on the positive: ""It turned out to be the best thing ever."" ""We had so much publicity we might do it again,"" she joked. There were no hard feelings over that celebrity snafu. Actress Dreyfus called it her ""Seinfeld moment."" There are several stars Martinez hopes to add to the walk. She said she is saving a spot in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater for Clint Eastwood. Including him in the Walk of Fame would be additionally meaningful, she said, because not even her mentor was able to get him. ""That's the one Johnny Grant always wanted,"" Martinez said. ""It will be an accomplished goal.""","Ana Martinez is the curator-in-chief for the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

Sixty miles southeast, in Texas City, a law enforcement officer witnessed what appeared to be a tornado strike near the Mall of Midland, the National Weather Service reported. The Houston/Galveston weather forecast office will examine the area and two other reported areas on Tuesday to confirm reported strikes, said Timothy Oram, an emergency response meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. As much as 6.3 inches of rain had fallen in the past day, nearly all of it during the previous 12 hours, Oram said late Monday afternoon. At Houston Hobby Airport, 4.05 inches of rain fell, which douses the previous January 9 record of 2.54 inches set in 1955, according to Oram. Though flash flood warnings were still in effect for Chambers County and Galveston County, the worst was over, he said. ""It's moved off to the northeast; things should be improving here,"" he told CNN. Video from Fort Bend County showed wind damage, including debris from building roofs and broken glass, and people trapped by the storm described terrifying moments. One resident said he felt the wind pushing into his home just before the garage door fell in and the front door of his home was blown open. ""It just kept getting louder and louder and louder,"" Umair Sayyed told CNN affiliate KPRC. Sayyed said he and his mother and sister sheltered inside a closet moments before the roof fell and rain poured into his home. Michael Walter, spokesman for the Houston Office of Emergency Management, said the city conducted 20 to 30 high-water rescues. The rain was falling so hard and fast in Houston that the weather service recorded 1.6 inches in just 10 minutes. No injuries were reported.

"(CNN) -- A final autopsy report released Wednesday shows that Florida A&M University drum major Robert D. Champion suffered muscle damage commonly seen in such events as car accidents, prolonged seizures, child abuse and torture, an expert said. The alleged fatal beating suffered last month by Champion, 26, during a marching band hazing must have been brutal, two experts said. ""His muscles were beaten so badly that they were destroyed like you would see in a heart attack,"" Dr. Howard Oliver, a forensic pathologist who is a former deputy medical examiner in the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, told CNN after reviewing the autopsy findings. Band bus a complex crime scene, expert says . The damaged muscles leaked out a protein called myoglobin, ""and it's too much for the kidneys to process. It causes the kidneys to fail,"" which results in death, Oliver said. The muscle damage is called rhabdomyolysis, Oliver said. ""Most of the time it's in (car) accidents or in people who freeze to death, and you get it in a lot of people who have prolonged seizures or in people who are in extreme physical activity like running in a marathon,"" Oliver said. ""You see it in torture or child abuse and severe burns when the muscles get damaged."" In the case of seizures or freezing to death, people ""shiver and it really works the muscles over a long period of time, and it damages them, and they release the protein,"" Oliver said. Lawrence Kobilinsky, professor of forensic science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said the beating must have been severe. ""This kid took a real beating over his body,"" Kobilinsky told CNN after reviewing the autopsy report. ""They're saying that the beating was so powerful, it just squashed the tissue. ""These are extremely forceful blows that this kid took, all over his back and his arms and his shoulders. It's kind of like in Egypt where they beat up that poor woman yesterday,"" Kobilinsky said Wednesday. ""It's interesting that there is no trauma to the neck or no trauma to the head. It's interesting that they are avoiding those areas,"" Kobilinsky said of the people who delivered the beating. Added Oliver: ""They just pummeled him."" Had they aimed for his abdomen, ""he would have bled to death."" The autopsy was performed by Associate Medical Examiner Sara H. Irrgang of Florida's District 9 Medical Examiner's Office in Orlando, with oversight from Chief Medical Examiner Jan C. Garavaglia. That office serves Orange and Osceola counties. The complete autopsy report follows a press release issued last week by the medical examiner's office that called Champion's death a homicide. The medical examiners said in that statement that Champion died November 19 because of ""hemorrhagic shock"" -- the result of excessive internal bleeding -- ""due to soft tissue hemorrhage, due to blunt force trauma sustained during a hazing incident."" Champion collapsed in Orlando on a bus carrying members of the Florida A&M Marching 100 band after a football game that included a halftime performance by the band. Christopher Chestnut, the lawyer for Champion's family, has charged that Champion died after receiving ""some dramatic blows, perhaps (having an) elevated heart rate"" tied to ""a hazing ritual"" that took place on the bus. Some band members have said Champion died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" No one has been charged in Champion's death; the Orange County Sheriff's Office is investigating the case. The medical examiner's office said last week that Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" The autopsy conducted after his death found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat"" -- which is the fatty tissue directly under a person's skin. Champion didn't have any bone fractures or injuries to his internal organs. The medical examiner didn't find any evidence of ""natural disease except for a slightly enlarged heart,"" nor did toxicology tests reveal signs of drugs or alcohol.","Medical examiner releases complete autopsy report of FAMU's Robert D.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have qualified for the last 16 of the European Champions League after two Didier Drogba goals helped them to a 3-0 Group E victory over Valencia at Stamford Bridge. The English Premier League side needed a victory to guarantee their place in the knockout stage and they got the perfect start when Drogba scored in the third minute -- Chelsea's fastest ever Champions League goal. Midfielder Ramires doubled their advantage midway through the half after capitalizing on some hesitant Valencia defending. Real Madrid to topple Barcelona in 'El Clasico' clash? And Drogba sealed the victory 14 minutes from time when sliding the ball home from Juan Mata's slide-rule pass. The result also means Chelsea top the group with 11 points after Bayer Leverkusen -- who had already qualified -- were held to a 1-1 draw by Genk in Belgium. Jelle Vossen put the home side ahead in the first half with a superb volley, but Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok leveled for the Bundesliga side 11 minutes from time. Leverkusen go through as group runners-up on 10 points, with third-placed Valencia going into the Europa League and Genk eliminated from Europe. There was late drama in Group F, where Marseille came back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Dortmund, a result that saw them go through to the last 16 in second place behind already-qualified Arsenal. Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski put the home side ahead from close range in the 23rd minute and Mats Hummels doubled Dortmund's advantage nine minutes later from the penalty spot, after captain Sebastian Kehl received a nasty kick in the face from defender Stephane Mbia. But Marseille gave themselves hope on the stroke of half-time when Loic Remy headed home Morgan Amalfitano's right-wing cross. The score stayed that way until five minutes from the end when Andre Ayew powerfully headed home Amalfitano's corner. And a sensational comeback was completed just two minutes later when substitute Mathieu Valbuena skipped past a couple of challenges before curling home a delightful winner. Marseille's victory was bad news for Olympiakos, who beat a depleted Arsenal side 3-1 in Piraeus. Rafik Djebbour put the hosts ahead from a tight angle after a defensive mix-up and David Fuster made it 2-0 when goalkeeper Vito Mannone's headed clearance fell to his feet -- and he found the net from outside the area. Yossi Benayoun pulled a goal back early in the second half with a fine strike from just inside the area but Olympiakos secured the win when Francois Modesto scored from close range after Olof Mellberg's header had come back off the post. Despite the win, Marseille's comeback means Olympiakos (9 points) have to settle for the Europa League. Arsenal finish top on 11 points with Marseille just a point behind and German champions Dortmund out of Europe on just four points. Surprise packages APOEL Nicosia had already qualified from Group G, but they ended the group with a defeat as Shakhtar Donetsk claimed a 2-0 away victory. The Ukrainian side had already been eliminated, but they inflicted a first defeat on the Cypriot side courtesy of goals from Luiz Adriano and Yevhen Seleznyov. Porto needed to beat Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg at home to qualify alongside APOEL, but the visitors defended solidly to secure a 0-0 draw. It meant APOEL and Zenit both qualified with nine points, with the Cypriot side top virtue of a better head-to-head record. Porto (eight points) have to settle for the Europa League. Barcelona and AC Milan had already qualified from Group H, but they enjoyed contrasting fortunes on Tuesday. Defending champions Barca thumped BATE Borisov 4-0 at the Nou Camp despite coach Pep Guardiola resting a host of key players ahead of 'El Clasico' against Real Madrid on Saturday. Real Madrid to topple Barcelona in 'El Clasico' clash? It may have been an unfamiliar line-up, but the style of football was completely familiar as Barca scored at will against the Belarussians. Sergi Roberto opened the scoring in the 35th minute from the edge of the area and Martin Montoya made it 2-0 on the hour mark with his first senior goal. The more familiar face of Pedro added a third when he flicked home a cross -- and the Spanish international scored his second of the evening from the penalty spot. So Barcelona strolled through as group winners with an impressive 16 points, while BATE are eliminated in bottom place. In the other match, Italian champions AC Milan wasted a two-goal lead as Czech side Viktoria Plzen scored twice in the final minute to snatch an unlikely 2-2 draw. Alexandre Pato put Milan ahead two minutes after the break when controlling Robinho's pass on his chest before rounding the keeper to score. And a minute later, the two Brazilians combined again, this time for Robinho to fire home. But, in a dramatic finale, Marek Bakos crossed for David Bystron to tap home from close range. Then Michal Duris burst into the Milan area in injury time to score a dramatic equalizer. Milan qualify for the last 16 in second place with nine points, while Plzen go into the Europa League after finishing with five points.","Chelsea are through to the Champions League last 16 after 3-0 win over Valencia .

"(CNN) -- Based on a true story, Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" is the kind of real-life adventure tale with which anyone who has ever dreamed of truly making a new start can identify. How often have you been looking for an apartment or a house, hoping to find that really cool, gothic deconsecrated church, cliff house with a widow's walk, Robin Hood-worthy treehouse or energy self-sufficient Hobbit hole? Whatever your dream fantasy home is, it never shows up on Craigslist, does it? Well, for Benjamin Mee and his two young children, the opportunity to make a fresh start shows up in the form of a slightly run-down farmhouse on 18 acres. It just happens to come with a rather down-on-its-luck zoo, complete with a depressed grizzly bear, an aging Bengal tiger, an African lion, porcupines, flamingos and even a binturong, a Southeast Asian mammal whose musk apparently smells like hot, buttered popcorn. Seriously. As for the humans, Matt Damon does a great job as the grieving widower Benjamin, whose wife dies before the film begins. Benjamin and Katherine (Stephanie Szostak) had one of those storybook romances that we all wish we had (theirs is told completely in still photos and mostly dialogue-free scenes pulled from Benjamin's memory), and the pain is etched clearly on his face. His kids are all he has left, but much like George Clooney's Matt King in ""The Descendants,"" Benjamin's parenting skills leave little to be desired. You see, Benjamin was an adventure writer for a newspaper, the kind of a guy who voluntarily takes assignments that land him in a hurricane hunter airplane. Kids, on the other hand, can be way worse. Benjamin's son Dylan (ably played by Colin Ford) is less than happy about, well, everything. He's recently been expelled from school and his behavior (which includes drawing very disturbing pictures) is one big reason why Benjamin thinks they all need a fresh start. Dylan and Benjamin are constantly at each other's throats, and those scenes occasionally err on the side of strident. Dylan's petulance and generally obnoxious behavior are really the film's only misstep. He's clearly a talented and smart kid, and his inevitable acceptance of his surroundings and new life come about 20 minutes too late. But it's a minor issue as far as the overall film is concerned. Benjamin's 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, on the other hand, is an absolute joy to watch. Played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Rosie lights up the screen every time she appears, and manages to overcome the potential ""too cute, too precocious"" pitfalls that so many adorable cinema tykes fall prey. Her sheer joy at the idea that the family has just bought a zoo is infectious. I dare you not to find her at least as adorable as the red fox or peacock chicks. When Benjamin buys it, the zoo is on its last legs. Kept together by a small but devoted staff, including head zookeeper Kelly Foster (a winning Scarlett Johansson), zookeeper Robin Jones (Patrick Fugit), who is rarely seen without a capuchin monkey on his shoulder, or Kelly's young cousin Lily (Elle Fanning), who takes an immediate shine to Dylan, and zoo architect Peter MacCready (played with fantastic drunken brio by Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen of ""Braveheart""). Thomas Haden Church does a spirited turn as Benjamin's levelheaded older brother, Duncan. Duncan is the voice of reason, pleading with Benjamin to do the sensible thing and cut bait when things get tough at the zoo. Lily's fascination with Dylan and the evolution of that relationship is yet another winning ingredient in the film (written by Aline Brosh McKenna and Crowe). When Benjamin and Dylan finally get around to working out their differences, the talk they have about romance is one many of us could take to heart. Yes, this film is a little schmaltzy and sentimental. Yes, it is, at times, a little precious. And no, it doesn't break any ground. But it's genuinely funny, sweet and kindhearted, and it's going to make you feel good. Considering how stressful the holidays can be, what's so bad about that? This film is like an antidote to cynicism. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is exactly what it needs to be in this holiday season. I started smiling at the beginning, and kept a smile up until the end when, I'll confess, I was also shedding a few tears. Don't mistake this for frothy, insignificant throwaway entertainment. This one comes with real emotions that are thoughtfully and carefully presented. And, for better or worse, most of us can relate. An extremely well-acted, well-written and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, ""We Bought a Zoo"" is great counterprogramming to some of the heavier (but also excellent) end-of-year releases. However, I can't be responsible if you take the kids and, instead of asking for a puppy or a pony, they up the ante and start asking for an entire zoo. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is rated PG and contains a few mild (and cutely delivered) expletives.","Matt Damon plays grieving widower Benjamin in ""We Bought a Zoo""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's judge apparently is so pleased with how well the actress is complying with her probation requirements in the past six weeks that she's giving her more freedom to travel. ""Ms. Lohan, you've actually done well and done it not only on time but early,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said during a five-minute-long hearing Wednesday. Lohan worked 12 days at the county morgue and took part in five psychotherapy sessions over the past month as ordered, Sautner said. ""The morgue seems to be pleased, as pleased as a morgue can be,"" Sautner said. The judge offered an incentive for Lohan to finish her monthly community service work early: She can travel freely around the United States after she completes her required 12 morgue shifts between court dates. If Lohan keeps up her compliance and completes 41 more days at the morgue -- 12 shifts each month -- and four sessions with a psychologist per month, the actress will have her supervised probation eased at the end of March. If she fails, she will serve an additional 270 days behind bars, the judge warned her last month. ""This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant's hands,"" Sautner told Lohan. Lohan was found in violation of her probation last month when she admitted that she failed to comply with Sautner's earlier order that she work at a women's shelter. Her punishment -- a 30-day jail sentence -- translated into just a few hours behind bars because of measures to reduce overcrowding in Los Angeles County jails. The atmosphere at Wednesday's status hearing was much lighter than in any previous appearances before Sautner. When Lohan's attorney, Shawn Holley, asked the judge if Lohan was required to be in court January 17 for the next status hearing, Sautner said, ""If I say no, she won't complete everything. I'm just saying."" The judge's next comment made Lohan lower her face into her hands, laughing. ""I think she likes to come here and see me,"" Sautner said. ""I think that's a motivation for her."" The judge said Lohan's trip to Hawaii over the past week was approved by her probation officer because of ""some confusion"" about her travel restrictions. She is permitted to travel outside California only for holidays and work, she said. ""She thought your sister's birthday was a holiday and said she could go to Hawaii,"" Sautner said. ""I don't have a problem with it."" Lohan missed her flight back home from her Hawaiian vacation Monday, causing her to miss Tuesday's taping of an appearance on ""Ellen."" The chat with talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres was the only planned interview to promote Lohan's nude photo spread published this week in Playboy magazine. The court-ordered community service is part of Lohan's sentence imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. Lohan was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007. ""From what I see of you, you need a structure,"" Sautner told Lohan last month, instructing her to return to court each month to show she is complying with the schedule. Lohan's legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunken driving arrests, have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and alcohol and drug test failures. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","NEW: Lindsay Lohan has ""done well"" on probation the past month, the judge says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani fired his defense secretary Wednesday, a move that spiked tensions between the South Asian nation's civilian government and its all-powerful military. The prime minister's spokesman confirmed to CNN the firing of Naeem Khalid Lodhi. State media reported that it was for ""gross misconduct and illegal action."" The move came after Pakistan's military issued a statement warning of ""grievous consequences"" of a Gilani interview in The People's Daily Online of China. In it, the military said, Gilani accused the army's chief of staff and the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency of violating the constitution. ""There can be no allegation more serious than what the honorable prime minister has leveled,"" the statement said. ""This has very serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences for the country."" The latest tension comes as Pakistan's Supreme Court investigates a controversial, unsigned memo allegedly drafted by the civilian leadership in which it asked the United States to help rein in the nation's powerful military. The so-called Memogate scandal has unleashed waves of political intrigue in recent weeks, and the media has described a government on a collision course with its own army. Last month, Gilani spoke provocatively of plots to topple the government. Later, he accepted an army statement pledging support for the democratic process. ""We have been trying to remain on the same page (with the military) for the last four years,"" Gilani said in an attempt to temper his comments. In its 64 years of existence, Pakistan has had to balance its civilian and military leadership. Pakistanis have lived through three military coups and decades of military dictatorship. Memogate, wrote businessman Mansoor Ijaz, whose column in October touched off the scandal, publicly exposed the tensions. A series of events have also added to the furor. The U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden during a May raid on a compound located only about a mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed the military. Relations became even more strained in November, after NATO forces said they mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in airstrikes near the Afghan border -- an attack the United States insists was an act of self-defense after its troops were fired upon. Pakistan's government has formally disputed the findings of the U.S. investigation into the airstrike, saying the bombardment went on long after it reported its troops were under fire. The United States launched its first drone attack in Pakistan Tuesday after more than a month-long lull, killing at least four suspected militants, CNN confirmed. The drone fired two missiles Tuesday at a suspected militant compound near the provincial capital of Miranshah in the North Waziristan region, located in the country's volatile tribal belt that borders Afghanistan. Abdul Basit, spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry, told CNN Wednesday that Pakistan did not allow for Tuesday's strike nor has it ever granted such permission to the United States. ""We have strong reservations on the drone strikes because this is a violation of our sovereignty. We can't accept violation of our sovereignty."" Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this story.","Defense Secretary Naeem Khalid Lodhi was fired Wednesday .

"New York (CNN) -- The parents of a missing Virginia college student plan to travel to New York on Thursday to assist in his search. Ian Hunter Burnet, a 22-year-old Virginia Commonwealth University student, went missing days after arriving in New York City to celebrate New Year's Eve, authorities said. Burnet left Richmond on a bus bound for New York on December 26, according to his father, Mark. He planned to stay with a fellow college student and her friend in an apartment in Harlem, his father said. ""He went up just to have a post-Christmas tourist visit to New York City and celebrate New Year's Eve. He was intending to have a short time there and then return back to Virginia,"" the father said. According to Burnet's father, Burnet and a friend had made plans to hang out together back in Virginia on January 2, but Burnet never made it back. The last communication he had with his son was December 28. ""I received a routine type of text talking about touring in New York,"" he said. Some other news outlets have reported that Burnet told friends he was not having a good time in New York, but his father said that was something he had not heard. ""I wish I knew more,"" he said, ""If I did, I might be able to understand what happened."" What investigators do know is that the friends with whom Burnet was staying say they last heard from him on December 30. ""Ian was communicating via text with them and the last bit of information that we had was that he was just stepping out to go out for the evening. And we don't have any information other than that,"" the father said. ""It's very frustrating,"" said New Kent County Sheriff Farrar W. Howard, whose Virginia office is leading the investigation in conjunction with Virginia State Police and the New York City Police Department. ""Nobody has seen him since the 30th."" Burnet's father said that his son, who graduated as valedictorian from New Kent County High School and was on a full scholarship to study engineering, was looking forward to classes starting back on January 17. He said Burnet had lived on his own for years, was independent and would have no reason to simply run away. Authorities retrieved Burnet's phone at the apartment where he was staying, but for Burnet to be without his phone is not uncommon, according to his father. ""He didn't really like talking on the phone. He would send texts and surf the Web, but he didn't like to carry a lot of valuables on his person,"" the father said. Authorities say Burnet did take his driver's license and credit cards with him the last time he left the Harlem apartment. ""Who knows what's going through a 22-year-old's head?"" the father said.""But he would not want us to worry. If he was out there, he would get in touch with us.""","Ian Hunter Burnet, 22, left Virginia to celebrate New Year's Eve in New York .

"(CNN) -- A friend of an elderly Arkansas couple has been charged with forcing the wife to try to rob a bank with a fake explosive device, police said Thursday. Authorities in Fayetteville arrested 60-year-old Paul Bradley on Thursday, three days after 73-year-old Betty Davis walked into a bank there and told a teller she had a bomb fastened to her ankle. Her husband, Dean Davis, said he has known Bradley for some time. ""I had coffee with him all last week,"" said Davis, whom police said had been tied up in the couple's home while his wife was forced to go to the bank by a masked assailant. ""One morning he paid for my coffee, and I'd like to see him and pay him that back."" Bradley has been charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property, aggravated robbery and kidnapping, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder told reporters. He said Bradley strapped the phony bomb onto Betty Davis and took her to the bank to force her to withdraw money from her account. Once inside, she told a teller about the plot and that she had been followed to the Arvest Bank branch. ""I felt like I needed to get out of that bank and get everyone out of danger,"" Betty Davis said. ""If he did what he said he was going to do, he would blow it up and hurt all those people."" After Betty Davis talked to police, they went to the couple's home and found Dean Davis tied up, police said. The assailant wore a mask and said little, so the couple was unable to identify their attacker at first. ""I would have never imagined that of him and never thought he would do something like that,"" Dean Davis said. Helder said that authorities ""couldn't have had better victims than the Davises."" ""They were very calm and collected, and she helped us identify the vehicle,"" he said. The FBI assisted in the investigation, Fayetteville police spokesman Sgt. Craig Stout said. Police expect to bring additional charges against Bradley, including extortion, he said. In March 2011 Bradley received a suspended sentence for his involvement in a scheme to defraud local residents of thousands of dollars, Helder said.","Police say Paul Bradley forced a friend's wife to attempt a bank robbery .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- An Islamic militant group in northern Nigeria has claimed responsibility for attacks that killed at least 25 people in a rash of violence against the country's minority Christians, officials said, after it issued an earlier ultimatum that gave Christians three days to leave the area. Gunmen opened fire on residents Friday, killing at least 15 people who were mourning the deaths of two slain businessmen, said Rev. Paul Alhamdu, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria. At least eight people were also killed on Thursday in a church shooting in northeastern Nigeria, a pastor at the church said, as sectarian violence spirals and the country is shaken by angry protests over fuel subsidies. Gunmen attacked the Deeper Life church in Gombe, the capital of Gombe state, Thursday evening as worshipers held a prayer meeting, according to the Venerable Joseph Ninyo, a pastor with the Anglican Diocese of Gombe. He said at least 20 people were being treated at a hospital, one of whom is in intensive care. ""Many tried to run but were gunned down,"" eyewitness Konson Danladi said. ""I was just outside the church when the men came and started shooting, and I ran."" Police said the militant group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for both attacks, but CNN could not immediately confirm the claims. The church targeted in Gombe is attended predominantly by Ibo Christians from southern Nigeria. Boko Haram has been blamed for months of widespread bloodshed in Nigeria, with churches and police stations among the targets. The group also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on churches on Christmas Day. The rising tide of violence led Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to declare a partial state of emergency in four northern states, in a bid to contain Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is a sin."" The latest sectarian attack comes as Nigeria also faces a nationwide wave of popular protests over the removal of a gas subsidy that had kept prices artificially low. What is behind Nigeria fuel protests? Union leaders have called for a national strike beginning Monday if the government does not reverse the decision, which resulted in the cost of a liter of gasoline more than doubling virtually overnight. Furious Nigerians have already taken to the streets this week, staging ""Occupy Nigeria"" protests and mass demonstrations across the country, and there have been calls from some quarters for the president to be impeached. Are you there? Send your images or video . Nigeria, an oil-rich nation of about 167 million people, is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world, and citizens complain that the money saved by ending the fuel subsidy is highly likely to be siphoned off by a few and salted away into offshore accounts. The government has said the money will be used to fund infrastructure projects, such as building refineries so Nigeria can produce its own gasoline rather than having to import it. Tires burn, protesters flood Lagos . Elizabeth Donnelly, with the Africa Programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, told CNN the two issues together -- the sectarian violence and the fuel subsidy protests -- present the biggest challenge yet for Jonathan, who was elected president last year after taking the reins in 2010 when the former president died. Although the government struck a blow against Boko Haram in 2009 with the capture of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf, it has since become more of a ""franchise,"" or umbrella organization, for the actions of individual groups, making it harder to manage the problem, Donnelly said. Protesters make demands known . ""We can trace these sorts of attacks to issues of underdevelopment, poverty, lack of resources and so on. The fact that it's framed in religious language is worrying,"" she said, particularly given the sectarian violence that has broken out in Nigeria in recent years. The country's leadership needs to rise above politics and use the kind of language that will bridge the growing gap between different parts of Nigerian society, she said, rather than just treating the problem as a security issue. But the challenge of restoring calm will be compounded by a widely felt skepticism toward government, from a population too used to corruption and political maneuvering. That skepticism has grown since Jonathan came to power, Donnelly said, in part because of his lack of governing experience. The fact that he is southern also plays into tensions between the mainly Muslim north and predominantly Christian and animist south. ""It's a very challenging time for Nigeria, and for Goodluck Jonathan, it's a very interesting moment. It could be when he and his team really prove themselves -- or where everybody's suspicions about his lack of ability could be proved right,"" she said. Resolving the tough times shouldn't be solely up to Jonathan's government, though, Donnelly added. State and local administrations, as well as religious leaders, must also play a part in resolving tensions. Meanwhile, the fuel subsidy protests could prove a trigger for wider violence, she warned, as the large crowds may become targets for people who want to launch attacks. Clashes could also break out between protesters and police. And while not directly linked, the two issues have common threads that must be tackled if calm is to be restored, she said. ""The reason the protests are happening is that so many Nigerians live such difficult lives. They don't have a lot of money, they do worry about putting food on the table, and the smallest change in fuel prices makes an enormous difference to them,"" she said. ""Boko Haram has grown in a region where there's very little in the way of development and public services, and not much in the way of industry or opportunity. ""Nigeria is really grappling with these issues at the moment, both political and economic. It is a developing democracy, and these issues are part of it creating this new identity."" Emira Woods, co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies, agrees that economic discontent is at the heart of the unrest, in a country where many live on less than $2 a day and are less well-off than their grandparents. ""It's people who are fed up, the have-nots seeing the haves continue to do well at their expense,"" she told CNN from Washington. ""The core issue is not Boko Haram, and Christians versus Muslims, it's economic inequality -- and unless and until the government is able to address that, they will continue to have these tensions increase."" Journalist Hassan John in Jos, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Stephanie Busari in London contributed to this report.","Sectarian violence and fuel policy protests are tests for the president, an analyst says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Death sentences plunged this year and the number of executions continued a steady decline as a result of ""growing discomfort"" felt by many Americans on the application of capital punishment. Only 78 people were sentenced to lethal injection so far this year, the first time that number has dropped below 100 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to a study published Thursday by the Death Penalty Information Center. Death sentences last year were at 112, and have declined by nearly 75% from 15 years ago, when more than 300 individuals were condemned. The center's annual report also showed only 43 people were executed in 2011, down three from last year, and a 56% decline from 12 years ago, when nearly a hundred people were put to death. ""This year, the use of the death penalty continued to decline by almost every measure,"" said Richard Dieter, the executive director of the center, which opposes the death penalty. He said executions, death sentences, public support and the number of states with the death penalty all dropped from previous years. ""Whether it's concerns about unfairness, executing the innocent, the high costs of the death penalty, or the general feeling that the government just can't get it right, Americans moved further away from capital punishment in 2011."" In January, the Illinois legislature voted to repeal the death penalty, replacing it with a sentence of life without parole. In doing so, Illinois became the fourth state in four years to abandon capital punishment. The death penalty has now been abolished in 16 states. In November, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber halted a pending execution and declared that no other executions would occur while he was in office. ""I am convinced we can find a better solution that keeps society safe, supports the victims of crime and their families and reflects Oregon values,"" he said. ""I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer."" But perhaps the loudest outcry was in Georgia, which executed Troy Davis despite serious doubts about his guilt and an international campaign to save his life. Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty. ""In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,"" the report said. A CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%. That's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely. Other polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied. The decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit. In 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%. Davis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial. Since Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate ""vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence."" A Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail. Texas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month. Thirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina. Another high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system. He will spend the rest of his life in prison. California voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty. That state has the highest death row population -- 721 people -- but no one has been executed there since 2006, when a court-ordered moratorium was declared. But one state that rarely has applied the death penalty could see two notorious killers receive that punishment. Steven Hayes was sentenced to death in Connecticut in December 2010, and a jury this month recommended the same punishment for Joshua Komisarjevsky. They were found guilty of home-invasion killings that left a mother and her two daughters dead. State legislators had contemplated abolishing capital punishment, but these defendants may have caused some rethinking, to allow the practice for only the worst of crimes. Connecticut and New Hampshire are the only New England states with the death penalty, but only one person has been executed in the region since 1960.","Death sentences in the United States are below 100 for the first time since 1976 .

"(CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has scored the endorsement of Bob Dole, who lauded the former Massachusetts governor in an ad Sunday in Iowa's The Des Moines Register newspaper. The public endorsement comes one day after the Register -- Iowa's largest newspaper -- backed Romney in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and just over two weeks before Iowa's critical presidential caucuses on January 3. In his advertisement, Dole said Romney is the GOP candidate is best suited to defeat President Barack Obama in 2012. ""I've known Mitt and his family for decades. His parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, rock-solid conservative values, and a deep sense of service to others,"" the former Kansas senator and 1996 GOP presidential nominee wrote. ""These traits -- which have shone through in both the debates and in my own visits with him -- will serve him well in the White House."" Dole also said Romney ""rescued a flailing Winter Olympics when it was mired in financial scandal."" And as governor of Massachusetts, Dole wrote, Romney ""managed to both balance the state's budget and cut taxes while dealing with an overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature."" The Register's editorial board said Romney was the most qualified candidate competing in the caucuses. While the paper didn't endorse Romney during his last run for president in 2007, the editorial board said voters now face a different GOP field and Romney ""has matured as a candidate."" ""Rebuilding the economy is the nation's top priority, and Romney makes the best case among the Republicans that he could do that,"" the editorial board wrote. The board hailed Romney for his ""solid credentials,"" saying he was the most likely candidate to see through ""knee-jerk, ideological"" perspectives and ""bridge the political divide in Washington."" Taking issue with the two other top-tier candidates, the paper claimed Romney stood out against former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom the board called ""an undisciplined partisan who would alienate, not unite, if he reverts to mean-spirited attacks on display as House speaker."" It also criticized Texas Rep. Ron Paul as someone with a libertarian ideology that would ""lead to economic chaos and isolationism."" Also significant, the board somewhat defended Romney against a line of attack taken by opponents who criticize him as a ""flip-flopper."" ""Though Romney has tended to adapt some positions to different times and places, he is hardly unique. It should be possible for a politician to say, 'I was wrong, and I have changed my mind',"" the paper wrote. But the paper still reserved questions over his changing tune on issues such as abortion and said it was up to the voters to decide ""whether such subtly nuanced statements express Romney's true beliefs or if he's trying to have it both ways."" While the paper's endorsement is highly coveted, it does not necessarily spell success for a candidate. In the last election cycle, the paper endorsed GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who didn't actively campaign in the state and took third place in the caucuses, while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee pulled off a surprise victory. The newspaper has long endorsed candidates for the general presidential election, but it began making endorsements for the caucuses in 1988. Since then, three of its choices went on to win the contest: Dole in 1996 and 1988 and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000. In addition, three endorsees eventually secured the Republican nomination: Dole in 1996, Bush in 2000 and McCain in 2008. Only one of its chosen candidates - Bush in 2000 - went on to win the White House. According to an American Research Group poll taken Dec. 8-11, Romney placed second in the Hawkeye State with 17% of support among likely caucus voters, while Gingrich took first with 22%. Paul tied with Romney at 17% . On Friday, Romney garnered a nod from South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley. South Carolina's primary, set for January 21, is the first presidential contest in the South and the third overall in the early voting season. CNN's Peter Hamby, Robert Yoon, Oliver Janney and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","The two endorsements come about two weeks before the Iowa caucus .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer and defense contractor BAE announced Thursday an ""amicable"" end to their dispute. Meyer filed a lawsuit in Texas in June claiming BAE, his former employer, had punished him for objecting to a weapons sale to Pakistan, and had prevented him from finding other work by portraying him as unstable and a problem drinker. The lawsuit against the company and his former supervisor has been dropped. ""BAE Systems OASYS and I have settled our differences amicably,"" Meyer said in a joint statement issued by the company, referring to the company by its full name. Meyer praised the defense firm's support for veterans and generosity to the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation. There were no details of any possible monetary settlement. ""During my time there I became concerned about the possible sale of advanced thermal scopes to Pakistan. I expressed my concerns directly and respectfully,"" Meyer said. ""I am gratified to learn that BAE Systems OASYS did not ultimately sell and does not intend to sell advanced thermal scopes to Pakistan."" The company faced the difficult task of a potentially drawn-out legal battle against an American hero. ""We are pleased that we reached closure in this matter,"" the company said in its part of the joint statement. ""BAE Systems has the highest respect for Sgt. Dakota Meyer, who exemplifies the qualities that make the men and women of our armed services the best in the world,"" the company said. ""We owe him and the many thousands of others who have served and sacrificed for our country our deepest thanks."" According to the lawsuit, Meyer had objected to the sale of high-tech equipment to Pakistan, which he characterized as ""giving to guys who are known to stab us in the back"" and ""the same people who are killing our guys."" Meyer was working on thermal optic equipment for snipers and detection of roadside bombs. In his lawsuit he claimed that on-the-job bullying and intimidation began after his criticism of potential sales to Pakistan. President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Meyer, a former Marine Corps sergeant, in September. He was 21 and a corporal at the time of his heroic acts in Afghanistan in 2009. ""The story of what Dakota did next will be told for generations,"" Obama said, describing how Meyer returned again and again to the killing ground of a Taliban ambush, rescuing American and Afghan troops and retrieving the bodies of fallen comrades. ""You did your duty, above and beyond, and you kept the faith with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps that you love,"" the president said.","Former Marine Sgt.

"(CNN) -- A couple of years ago, my daughter and I were playing the classic board game ""Life,"" and her little car reached the roadblock at which everybody -- absolutely everybody -- gets married. Needless to say, given a new set of striking statistics last week that showed a record low of 51% of American adults are married, ""Life"" was designed many decades ago. The study by the Pew Research Center further found that 40% of births these days are to unmarried mothers, and a similar percentage of Americans say marriage is becoming obsolete. My daughter Liliana, who was 8 when we were playing the board game, tossed off this remark as she stuck the tiny blue husband pin into her car: ""When I grow up, I don't think I'll get married. I think I'll just get some sperm."" How we reap what we sow! Liliana was old enough to know the story of her own origins, and it goes like this: When I turned 39, still single, I resolved to become a mother on my own and bought eight vials of donor sperm. But then I met her father, Sprax, and he agreed to help me have a baby the old-fashioned way. We went through many ups and downs, even splitting up for a couple of years, but finally realized that we loved each other, got back together and went on to have her baby brother. When Liliana was almost 4, we got married. So there I was -- the former single mother by choice, the typical Massachusetts type who deeply believes that there are a hundred great ways to make a family and that life can also be wonderful without one -- and I found myself responding to my daughter: ""That would be fine if you just get some sperm, sweetheart, but you know, being married is actually really nice, too."" What happened to me? What happened to the independent woman who, by the time she married for the first time at age 44, felt no particular need for a piece of paper from City Hall? It is this. Day in and out, through lunch-packing and play date-making and bath-running, I am struck by a surprising truth: Though the raising of our children constitutes the central activity of our family, it is the love between Sprax and me that constitutes its ineffable core. That sounds like a traditional religious point of view, but we are not religious. I've come to this understanding simply as an observer of my own heart and the family dance. It is, apparently, just an emotional fact of life -- at least, of our life. What baffles me is that I was perfectly able to have Liliana without being in a committed, loving relationship with Sprax, and our semi-family life was really quite happy in that formation. We all got along; Sprax would visit two or three times a week; Liliana got plenty of love and structure. But since he and I reunited, our bond has become the family's invisible center, the axis of its spokes. I did not need a husband. But I need him. LZ Granderson: Love and marriage are not the same thing . So fine, but what difference do the formal ""bonds of matrimony"" make? Usually you hear people talk about commitment, but I can't imagine any greater commitment than sharing children who are still going to need raising for quite a few years. No, what marriage means to me is acceptance, an ""absolute yes"" that makes it bearable to be seen at your worst -- exhausted or flu-ridden or carried away by an ugly bout of selfishness. That ""yes"" launches the creation of an entity, a union, that exists apart from the daily ebb and flow of difficulties and joys. It is nothing but an abstraction, but, to my amazement, it is the most beautiful thing in our lives. So this is my marital equivalent of ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus"": . ""Yes, Liliana, you can definitely stay single and you'll have loads of company. You by no means have to get married. You can definitely have a fabulous life without marriage, and it would certainly be a huge mistake to rush into anything. ""But I cannot lie: I wish you all that is best in life, and marriage, when it's good, can be one of those things. And if you do get married, at your wedding I'll cry tears of joy -- because I'll know that you're about to enter the gates of one of the most magical places in the world."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carey Goldberg.","Carey Goldberg says study shows marriage statistics down but rate of unmarried moms up .

"(CNN) -- China plans to put laboratories in space, collect samples from the moon and prepare to build space stations over the next five years, according to an ambitious plan released this week aimed at putting the country on the global map for space exploration. China also plans to launch manned-vessels and freighters into space during the coming half-decade, according to a government white paper. The country's eventual goal in the longer term is a manned lunar landing. ""With economic progress, also comes the need for scientific development and exploration,"" said Jiao Weixin, a professor at the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Beijing University. ""By investing in space exploration, China wants to contribute and be a major player in the world on more than one level."" The Chinese plans announced this week come as the United States has been scaling back its ambitions and funding for space exploration. Since 2003, China has made major breakthroughs in its space program, including becoming the third country after Russia and the United States to put a human in space. It successfully completed a spacewalk in 2008. In November, the successful automated docking and return of an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, paved the way for the creation of China's future space laboratory. The spaceship blasted off from a launch facility in the Gobi Desert in northwest China, one month after the first space laboratory module Tiangong-1 was launched into space. China says its military-run space program will be used for peaceful purposes. But its activities have set off controversy in the past, like when it shot down one of its dead satellites in 2007, for example. That move alarmed some officials in the United States and other countries and raised concerns about the militarization of the space race. Some experts say a critical gap in Chinese-U.S. space relations is the absence of regularized talks on space security, which took place between Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. ""In this regard, the Obama administration has made overtures at the military-to-military level,"" Clay Moltz, an professor in the Department of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, Calif., said in an e-mail response. ""The ball is now in China's court to respond. How it responds may say a lot about its true intentions in space."" Two more space docking missions are planned for 2012, with at least one of them manned. But despite the progress, some experts say China still has a long way to go in developing its space technology. ""China is still catching up to countries that began their space programs in the 1960s,"" said Jiao. ""It may be impressive to see what China has done in the past decade, but there is still a long way to go."" The paper also says China will develop technology to monitor space debris, study black holes and develop small satellites for environmental and disaster monitoring and forecasting.","China's ambitious new plan comes as the U.S. scales back its own space ambitions .

"(CNN) -- Jane Fonda told Piers Morgan that Michael Jackson's 1981 visit to her California ranch inspired him to purchase what was to become Neverland Ranch. The actress and author of the new book ""Prime Time"" -- which is about the last third of life -- is a guest on tonight's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""I had a ranch in Santa Barbara,"" said Fonda. ""And he came and visited me once. And I was walking him around. It's how he was introduced to that area -- where he eventually bought Neverland -- is when I had him to my ranch."" The King of Pop, who was in his early 20s at the time, spent a week on the set of ""On Golden Pond."" ""He came and he wanted to watch my father and Katharine Hepburn work,"" said Fonda. ""He was interested in becoming a movie actor."" Fonda also recalled pointing out to Jackson the spot on the ranch's grounds where she intended to be buried. ""I thought he was going to have a meltdown,"" Fonda stated. ""The notion that I could countenance the fact that I was going to die was anathema to him. He just -- he screamed."" The actress recalled Jackson insisting that he was never going to die. ""He talked about how he would get into an oxygen tank and he thought that was going to keep him, you know, alive forever."" Fonda told Morgan that she doesn't like the notion that Jackson's 2009 death was a ""Hollywood clichÃ©,"" but that ""it's hard to imagine that someone that was as tormented as he was, you know, could have sort of lived a long and peaceful and natural life."" Fonda and her father, Henry Fonda, co-starred in 1981's ""On Golden Pond,"" for which they both won Oscars. The film also won Best Picture that year. ""I feel so blessed, Piers, to have been able to have that experience,"" said Fonda. ""He died five months later. I bought the play. I made the movie, because I wanted to work with him. We knew he was dying."" The actress described her relationship with her father. ""He was a man of profound integrity,"" she said. ""He was a good man. He had good values. He had problems in the relationship department. He had problems with emotions, which is interesting for an actor, a hard time expressing emotions and being around someone who was emotional. It was absolutely terrifying to him."" Fonda also noted that while her father was difficult, ""he did the best he could; and I was able to tell him that before he died."" Fonda also stated that ""if there had been Prozac then, I think probably our lives would have been very different."" The actress also said that she believes that what her father didn't communicate directly to her, he did through the films whose values he held dear, such as ""Twelve Angry Men,"" ""Young Abe Lincoln,"" ""The Wrong Man,"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Fonda also told Morgan that she knows her dad would have been pleased to know that she married Ted Turner. ""I found out after my dad died that he was fascinated by Ted Turner,"" said Fonda. ""Dad loved the news; and he told a reporter that once interviewed me that he thought that Ted Turner was the greatest guy in the world because he started CNN."" Turner and Fonda divorced in 2001. ""We had a great time for 10 years,"" said Fonda. ""I am so happy that I got to spend 10 years with him. It ended when it was supposed to end and we're very, very close. I just talked to him today. I told him I was going to be on the show. And I'm so proud of him. He's done so much good work in the world."" Fonda told Morgan that the current crop of GOP candidates does not impress her. ""They all scare me, frankly,"" said Fonda. ""I get depressed and scared when I look at the Republican debates."" The actress stated that she's ""worried about anybody getting elected to office who says we have to do away with or privatize Social Security, we have to reduce health insurance; we have to not raise taxes."" Fonda is hoping that voters reelect Barack Obama, telling the CNN host, ""I hope he gets re-elected. I wish that he would be stronger. I think he will be in his second term. I think he's going to be reelected. I think he's a good man, but I wish that he was tougher on the issues that I care about and that a lot of people care about.""

"(CNN) -- ""Flowers of War"" has a multitude of advantages over its rivals in the Oscar race for best foreign language film. Most obviously, it stars Christian Bale, who plays an American pretending to be a priest in order to survive the brutal 1937 Japanese invasion of Nanking, China. Moreover, Bale's character, and several others, speak English, making the film much more accessible to Academy voters. Lastly, it's the official category submission from China, which just so happens to be the most promising unrealized market for blockbuster Hollywood films. But the Oscars can also be very political, in every possible way. Including the literal sense. Last week, when Bale was roughed-up on camera while attempting to visit Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist who had been under house arrest in China for documenting his country's population-control measures, the Dark Knight actor reminded western audiences of China's less-than-stellar human rights record. If that wasn't enough, Chinese authorities responded strongly to the scuffle, saying that Bale ""should be embarrassed"" by his actions. ""He was not invited to create a story or shoot film in a certain village,"" said a spokesperson for the Chinese government. ""I think if you want to make up news in China, you will not be welcome here."" Think voters might now be tempted to view ""Flowers of War"" in a different light? The Zhang Yimou film wasn't the race's favorite to begin with -- ""Iran's A Separation"" looks to be the frontrunner -- but this public-relations controversy and China's belligerent response could have a severe impact on the war film's Oscar prospects. Hollywood's interest in access to China's restrictive market is now counterbalanced by a temptation to stick up for Batman. Didn't the Chinese see the Hong Kong scene in The Dark Knight? In the real world, who cares? China has broader interests than a golden statue. But make no mistake: China covets an Oscar that would legitimize its booming movie industry -- ""Flowers of War,"" with a budget of nearly $100 million, is its biggest project ever -- and despite two previous nominations in the category, the country has never won the trophy. Now with its spotlight film's most visible star at odds with the government, the chances of a Chinese Oscar could be dead on arrival. See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- How did the makers of ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" not know that there are two insurmountable problems with their bogus chick flick about the amusing travails of a working mother? The first is that the movie is based on a 2002 novel by British journalist Allison Pearson, and we live in 2011. True, Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) is now an ""investment manager"" in Boston rather than a British hedge-fund shark. Otherwise, Kate.2011 has the same accessories as Kate.2002, including a cute architect husband (Greg Kinnear), two kids who push Mommy's guilt buttons, and various male associates oblivious to commonplace 2011 workforce realities. Into this time warp screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (""Morning Glory,"" ""27 Dresses"") adds gratuitously bitchy stay-at-home gym-rat mothers and a boss (Kelsey Grammer) who blanches at the word mammogram. Pierce Brosnan plays a fairy-tale New York businessman as princely as he is single. The second insurmountable problem is the difference between Parker's performance as a fortysomething banker, wife, and mother musing (in voice-over) at her computer and her previous performance as a single, thirtysomething girl-about-town in ""Sex and the City"": There is none.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces additional child sex charges involving two more alleged victims, bringing the total to 10, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. Sandusky was arrested Wednesday and charged with four counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and two counts of unlawful contact with a minor, allegedly involving two men who were boys at the time of the encounters. ""Today's criminal charges were recommended by a statewide investigating grand jury, based on evidence and testimony that was received following the initial arrest of Sandusky on November 5th,"" Kelly said in a news release. Each count is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and $25,000 in fines. The former coach also faces one new count of indecent assault and two counts of endangering a child's welfare, each punishable by up to seven years behind bars and $15,000 in fines. And Sandusky faces a single new count of indecent assault and two counts of corruption of minors. ""As in many of the other cases identified to date, the contact with Sandusky allegedly fit a pattern of 'grooming' victims,"" Kelly said in the news release. ""Beginning with outings to football games and gifts; they later included physical contact that escalated to sexual assaults."" Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, will face a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday. His attorney, Joe Amendola, blamed prosecutors for turning the case into ""a media circus,"" adding that Sandusky would have willingly turned himself in. Sandusky surrendered when he faced the initial charges. Amendola, who learned of the new charges from a CNN producer in his office, said he was unhappy prosecutors did not make sure he was aware of the arrest before the media. ""I had a few words with the prosecutor,"" Amendola told CNN's Kathleen Johnston. ""What I told them essentially is, if we are going to play hardball, both sides can play and I was a pretty good pitcher in my day."" ""The question begs to be asked, why would the attorney general's office decide not to tell me ... and why did they go to his house and take him out in handcuffs?"" Amendola said. ""I think the answer is self-explanatory."" Amendola said he expected his client might not be able to post the $250,000 bail before Thursday because he didn't have time to make the arrangements. The alleged victims -- identified by authorities as Victim 9 and Victim 10 -- are believed to have encountered Sandusky at The Second Mile charity, a nonprofit organization he founded for underprivileged children. Victim 9 was between 11 and 12 years old when he first met the former coach back in 2004. Sandusky allegedly gave the boy gifts and money and took him to university football games, according to the grand jury presentment. The alleged victim testified he would make overnight visits to Sandusky's home and stay in a basement bedroom. He described a pattern of sexual assaults over a period of years, the grand jury said. ""The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but no one ever came to help him,"" the report states. Sandusky allegedly met Victim 10, then about age 10, in 1997 after a counselor recommended the boy attend the charity ""because of difficulties in his home life."" That witness said Sandusky performed oral sex on him and indecently touched him in an outdoor pool on campus, according to the grand jury. A grand jury report made public last month detailed 40 charges of rape and molestation against the former coach in a child sex abuse scandal that, at the time, involved eight alleged victims. Wednesday's announcement came on the heels of an attorney's statement on behalf of a 19-year-old man who stepped forward with claims that Sandusky gave him whiskey and sexually abused him, also in 2004. The man pointed to a single incident at the university's football building, according to attorney Chuck Schmidt of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was 12 at the time and it allegedly occurred while he was staying overnight during Second Mile activities, the attorney said. It is not clear if the man can be identified as Victim 9. Schmidt says he plans to file a lawsuit against Penn State, the charity and Sandusky in coming weeks. ""He thought he was the only person this had ever happened to and when he found out there were others, that gave him enough courage to come forward,"" he said of his client. The Second Mile, meanwhile, reported Wednesday that it had ""lost significant financial support"" in the wake of the scandal and plans to reduce its staff. ""We at The Second Mile are saddened by the need to make these cutbacks; however, our foremost concerns reside with the victims of the horrific abuse reported by the Attorney General and with the children we serve,"" the charity said in a written statement. Sandusky, the longtime Penn State defensive coordinator, has said he only ""horsed around"" with the disadvantaged boys in his care. An attorney for some of the alleged victims Monday blasted Sandusky's recent interview with The New York Times in which he attempted to clarify his relationships with young people. ""If I say, 'No, I'm not attracted to young boys,' that's not the truth,"" Sandusky said, according to the interview published Saturday. ""Because I'm attracted to young people -- boys, girls."" His lawyer, who was present at the interview, spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is ""not sexually"" attracted to them. ""Right. I enjoy -- that's what I was trying to say -- I enjoy spending time with young people. I enjoy spending time with people,"" Sandusky added. ""I mean, my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young."" The former coach told the paper that prosecutors had twisted his decades of work with troubled youths as part of his charity.

"(CNN) -- The deep financial mess at the U.S. Postal Service has revealed a deep fault line in America about whether we even need the postal system. This week we heard from the ""let 'em shut down, I do all my communicating online"" group. And there are those who want to ""save the art of writing a letter by hand and mailing it."" We're going to get beyond this divide, right here, right now, with a real-life love story that gets to its destination, as most love stories do, through a route that's never been traveled before. The letter . Our love story begins with a guy in a rush. ""Gimme a ticket for an aer-o-plane. Ain't got time to take a fast train. Lonely days are gone. I'm a-goin' home."" Why is this guy in such a hurry? ""My baby just-a wrote me a letter."" The letter. That's why. His baby didn't send him an e-mail. She wrote him a letter. By hand. Put it in an envelope. Found a stamp buried in her drawer. Took it to a mailbox. Double checked, I'm sure, to make sure it dropped in all the way. ""The Letter,"" performed by The Box Tops, Joe Cocker and other artists, is one of the 500 most popular American songs. To get to the bottom of the story, I made a long distance phone call to Wayne Carson, the man who wrote ""The Letter."" The back story . I asked Carson if he could imagine the guy in his song rushing to the airport -- paying full fare to get home to his baby, who seems to have sent him packing -- if she had sent an e-mail or a tweet. He says he never thought of it. He wrote the song in 1967. Who was the guy, I asked. Was it you? No. ""My dad was in show business for 50 years,"" Carson tells me. ""He fancied himself as a songwriter. Never wrote a hit. He would get into the story. He didn't know when to quit. By the time he got the story told he had four or five pages. He didn't have a song. He had a short story."" Carson's father handed him one of those ""short stories"" called ""Her Last Letter"" and told him to see if he could do something with it. There was one phrase in there that stuck in Carson's mind that he'd one day come back to. Halfway down the third page. The phrase was ""Ticket for an aer-o-plane."" And that's the way aer-o-plane was spelled. One day, in his small kitchen, Carson swiveled his chair to his pump organ and just banged out the melody and the lyrics in one take. ""I just put the words together as they came to me. All because of that one word, aer-o-plane, that my dad wrote in the middle of that damn story."" Just a songwriter in the zone. The plot gets hot . One more question for Carson. ""Do you have a favorite among all the songs you've written? "" ""My favorite song,"" he says, ""is always the last one I wrote. ... I don't have a favorite kid or dog. I have a favorite wife. But then again she's the last one I married."" Uh oh. I guess I have a couple more questions. How many times have you been married, Wayne? Three, he tells me. His first wife died too young. His second marriage didn't work out. But this marriage... ""What brought us together was songwriting. We wrote two songs together before we actually met in person."" They did not, if you're wondering, send their lyrics back and forth through the mail. They had a friend in common, a Nashville guitarist, who was the intermediary. The messenger. And then, one night, after one of Carson's shows, a woman comes up to him and says she has a song she'd like him to look at. ""Oh no,"" he said. ""Not another one."" And then she told him. Her name was Wyndi. Wyndi Harp. The woman he'd been writing songs with. They kept in touch. ""One morning,"" says Harp, ""he called me up and said, 'Would you like to do some writing today?' "" They'd ride around for hours in Carson's blue-green Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan just writing songs. Any car can be romantic when you're making music together. Harp comes up with some priceless titles. ""My Baby's been Fiddlin' With a Brand New Bow."" That was one of their first together. ""Free Me When You Go."" ""I'm Not Really Talkin', It's Just My Heart Thinkin' Out Loud."" Carson and Harp have been married 14 years now. And writing songs together for longer than that. Delivery . Now, the final, final question. Have Carson and Harp ever gone to a mailbox and sent each other a letter? ""We've never written each other a letter,"" says Carson, ""because we've never really been apart that long since we met. ... Two weeks was about as long as I could stand to be away from her."" There's a song there. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Schulder.","The romanticism of handwriting doesn't translate to e-mails and tweets, Michael Schulder says .
""The Letter,"" a hit song, captures emotions of looking for a stamp, taking letter to mailbox, he says .
Wayne Carson, who wrote the song, met his wife through their shared love for songwriting ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The departure of U.S. troops left many questions lingering in Iraq Sunday, analysts told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""There are a lot of things here that are not finished. There are activities in the region that are still sitting on the edge of potential conflict,"" said retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Paul Bremer, a former envoy to Iraq under President George W. Bush, said President Barack Obama had ""placed a very big bet"" by pulling out troops. ""The definition of victory actually was given by the president when he made the announcement we were pulling out. He said a democratic Iraq can be a model for the region. That's right. That's what President Bush also said. And the question is, can a democratic Iraq survive if America pulls out before the job is done?"" he said. Another key question, analysts said, is what neighboring Iran will do next. ""Iran's clearly one of the strategic winners out of this. The United States managed to eliminate one of the two arch-rivals that Iran faced, and so Iran has gained a much stronger position,"" said Robin Wright, a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson Center. ""At the same time,"" she added, ""I think that once the United States withdraws, that the historic tensions between Arabs and Persians along the strategic border are likely to resurface, and that the Iranians will have influence with many of the top leaders in... Iraq, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the Iraqis are going to become the next Iranian province."" The last U.S. troops in Iraq crossed the border into Kuwait Sunday, marking the end of an almost-nine year war. According to the defense department, 4,487 service members were killed in the war; more than 30,000 were wounded. It is impossible to know with certainty the number of Iraqis who have died in Iraq since 2003. But the independent public database Iraq Body Count has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and October 2010, with four out of five dead being civilians. Obama said Monday that the end of the Iraq war means a new chapter in U.S.-Iraq relations, with a focus now on a ""normal relationship between sovereign nations."" He told visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that the two nations would build ""a comprehensive partnership"" that includes trade relations, support for building up Iraq's democratic capacity and military-to-military ties aimed at helping Iraq rebuild its air force, which was destroyed in the war against Saddam Hussein's regime. ""Our goal is simply to make sure Iraq succeeds,"" he said. Debate was raging about the nation's political future Sunday, as a political crisis erupted in Baghdad that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come. Iraqiya, a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from Sunni and more secular Iraqis, said it was boycotting parliament, a move that threatens to shatter Iraq's fragile power-sharing government. The political bloc contends that al-Maliki is trying to amass dictatorial power, and many believe that the prime minister was simply waiting for the Americans to leave before making his move. ""These old sectarian divides are in many ways deeper than they were even under Saddam Hussein, and the United States can play a certain kind of role in that,"" Wright said, pointing to the importance of diplomatic involvement even after U.S. troops leave. Cartwright said U.S. troops may return to Iraq to help train Iraqi forces. ""It will be interesting to see,"" he said. ""I think the opportunity is there for us to bring forces back in."" CNN's Moni Basu, Arwa Damon and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Gen. James Cartwright: ""There are a lot of things here that are not finished""

"Cairo (CNN) -- When Azza Hilal Suleiman saw Egyptian military pummel the veiled woman, she stepped in to help and got kicked and clubbed by security forces, a beating that was captured in a video that went viral around the world and also showed live gunfire and the violent removal of a Muslim woman's clothing. ""A veiled woman was injured and the army stripped her,"" she told CNN in an exclusive interview from her hospital bed in Cairo, suffering from painful skull fractures and facial cuts. She couldn't stand to see the repeated blows to the woman, who was dragged, kicked, partially stripped and then stomped. ""So I ran and tried to cover her body and pull her out,"" Suleiman said. ""We tried to cover her and pull her away but they beat us. I didn't feel anything after this."" Suleiman was seen in a red coat in the same video that showed the veiled woman's beating. Security forces rushed toward Suleiman and pushed her to the ground as she ran to the veiled woman's side. ""I was just trying to help her up after they exposed her body,"" she said. Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot. A CNN crew also witnessed the security force beatings and shootings and saw other women stripped of some of their clothing. The beatings took place last Saturday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, amid a five-day stretch of assaults by police and defiant protests by demonstrators demanding that Egypt's ruling military cede power to a civilian government. A Health Ministry spokesman said 16 people died, including 14 by gunshots, according to Dr. Hisham Sheeha. The military has denied the use of live ammunition. Photos of the unidentified veiled woman were plastered on the front pages of global and local newspapers and appeared on Facebook. Twitter hashtags #TahrirWoman and #Bluebra emerged. The images stirred worldwide outrage because of the beating and because she was partially stripped in a Muslim society where women cover themselves for modesty. The woman has not been identified. An activist and student, she chooses not to talk to reporters at present, two people who know her told CNN. She had been dressed in a traditional robe and headscarf, but as police clubbed her and dragged her down the street, those articles of clothing were pulled away, exposing her midriff and blue bra. The video showed one of the police officers aiming a foot at her upper abdomen and stamping squarely on it. The beatings and the use of live ammunition against protesters, particularly women, have outraged Egyptians. More than a thousand people gathered in Tahrir Square for a ""Million Woman"" march Tuesday. Women and men holding placards showing pictures of the veiled woman's beating marched through the surrounding streets to denounce the escalating violence by security forces. The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has since expressed ""great regret"" over the mistreatment of women protesters, but it has not apologized for the assaults, a fact that enrages demonstrators. But SCAF reiterated ""its respect and appreciation for Egyptian women and their right in protesting and their active positive participation in the political life."" Age 48, divorced and unemployed, Suleiman is the daughter of a deceased army general. She wanted to speak to CNN despite her agony. In an earlier visit to the hospital, she indicated how much she was suffering, saying, ""My head is going to explode."" Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil. ""Azza covered her naked body. Then we tried to pull her up to take her to the field clinic. But I was shocked with a sting in my leg, thought it was a rock. I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly,"" he told CNN. Hanna said security forces left him alone when they thought he was dead. But when he moved, he was beaten. He said he and other injured people were on the ground for about 30 minutes because ambulances weren't allowed into the area. ""I only found out I was shot in the leg when I arrived to the hospital. They told me the bullet penetrated my knee and ended up in my calf. I saw the Army officer firing his gun, but I thought it was blanks. I did not imagine they would fire live ammo at their people."" Journalist Hassan Shaheen Mahmoud also is in the video. He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they ""dragged, stripped and beat"" women and journalists. He too said he tried to come to the aid of the veiled woman, who suffered serious cuts and bruises. ""I started to run, but she froze and fell to the ground when another protester bumped into her,"" Mahmoud said. ""I tried to help her get up, but the soldiers were brutal even when I told them I was a journalist. They even continued to beat her after her body was exposed."" ""I will not remain quiet,"" Mahmoud vowed. One military official showed no sense of remorse. ""What was a woman like her doing in a conflict zone?"" asked the military spokesman, Maj. Mohamed Askar. ""She must have participated in the attacks on the military and the Cabinet."" Askar questioned why the woman has not come forward to identify herself. ""Our troops do not just attack people for no reason,"" he said. ""If she had nothing to hide then she would have presented herself. Where is she?"" The Egyptian military said it isn't aware of Suleiman's case but will look into it. ""If she comes from a military family then she reserved the right to be transferred to a military hospital even if her father is deceased,"" said Col. Islam Jaffar of the military's morals department. As Wafa Ahmed, Suleiman's sister-in-law, listened to her wailing in pain, she thought of Suleiman's father and other family members, who have served Egypt in the military and government. ""I'm glad her father didn't see this day,"" Ahmed said.","A video showed police beating a woman and others trying to help her .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A delegation of South Koreans traveled to the Communist North Monday to pay their respects to the late leader Kim Jong Il, lying in state at Kumsusan Memorial Palace. The 18-member civilian delegation was led by Lee Hui-ho -- the widow of the former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung, who received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts at nurturing reconciliation between the two Koreas -- and Hyun Jeong-eun, the widow of Chung Mong-hun, the former chairman of Hyundai Group who pushed for heavy industrial investments in the North. ""I hope this helps improve North and South relations,"" Lee said in a statement read by one of her aides prior to her departure at the border. The South Koreans arrived in Pyongyang after passing through the Kaesong Industrial Park, just to the north of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries, reported the Korean Central News Agency, the North's official news agency. North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un greeted the delegation in Pyongyang, said a statement from the Unification Ministry. The delegation plans to stay overnight. The visit comes at a delicate point in relations between the two Koreas. The death of Kim Jong Il, announced by Pyongyang on December 19, has put the region on edge, as the world waits to see how the leadership succession will play out in the secretive regime. Seoul expressed its sympathy to the North Korean people and gave the green light to Lee and Hyun's group to visit the North. But it said it will not send an official delegation to pay respects to Kim Jong Il. Pyongyang sent delegations to South Korea when the former president Kim and the former Hyundai chairman Chung died in 2009 and 2003 respectively.","NEW: Kim Jong Un greets the civilian delegation .

"(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows ""numerous requests"" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a ""important"" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the ""generosity and strength of the revolution."" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. In 2010, Castro agreed to free prisoners arrested during the 2003 crackdown on political dissidents. The Caribbean nation has released many of them, as well as other prisoners jailed for ""counterrevolutionary"" activities, ranging from hijacking to arson. CNN's Willie Lora contributed to this report.","NEW: Alan Gross is not among those who will be pardoned .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian-American ex-Marine accused of spying on his ancestral homeland helped develop an electronic translator for U.S. troops but wouldn't have been involved in espionage, a onetime colleague said Wednesday. Iranian state television aired what it called a ""confession"" by 28-year-old Amir Hekmati over the weekend. His family said Tuesday that he was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran, and that his statement had to have been coerced. ""It just doesn't sound like Amir to me,"" said Sherri Condon, a software engineer who worked with Hekmati in 2008 and 2009 on an effort to develop a two-way, hand-held electronic translator. Condon was the lead author of a 2008 paper describing the research. She thanks Hekmati in the acknowledgments. She described him as ""an entrepreneurial guy"" who sent colleagues a holiday card with a quote from Benjamin Franklin: ""Be always at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let each new year find you a better man."" ""I really like him,"" said Condon, who identified Hekmati from the images released by Iranian state television. ""He wasn't too nose-to-the-grindstone, but he really worked and put out good effort on behalf of these programs we worked with."" The work, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was aimed at improving communications between U.S. troops and local populations -- a problem with which Hekmati had grappled during service with the Marines in Iraq. He appeared in a video that touted the ""souped-up iPods,"" and he described how American troops sometimes lost hours waiting for a translator to help them pose simple questions. ""He knew enough to be very helpful for us, and he was very helpful to us in terms of understanding the context in which the devices might be used,"" Condon said. ""He had the military experience."" The Arizona-born, Michigan-raised Hekmati joined the Marines in August 2001, after high school. His four-year hitch included an assignment to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and a six-month deployment in Iraq in 2004, according to U.S. military records. In 2006, after leaving the service, he started his own linguistics company and began offering his services as an English-to-Arabic translator, according to Michigan incorporation records. He contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses, offering training in cultural competency and working with troops at military bases to promote understanding of and positive communication with people of other cultures, his family said. In 2010, he spent five months working as a research manager for defense contractor BAE, company spokesman Brian Roehrkasse told CNN. And Condon said Hekmati recently worked for a company that produced language-training material for the U.S. military. The United States and Iran have no direct diplomatic relations, but Hekmati's family said he made the trip after obtaining permission from the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. The interests section has not responded to CNN requests for comment. News of Hekmati's detention is the latest turn in a series of allegations of espionage and plotting between Washington and Tehran, following the capture of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran, Iranian claims to have arrested a dozen CIA spies and U.S. allegations that Iran sought to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. Hekmati's family said that after his August 29 arrest, Iranian officials told them to remain silent ""with the promise of an eventual release,"" but they went public after Iranian television aired the accusations and Hekmati's statement on Sunday. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday that Hekmati is being falsely accused, but had no further comment. Condon said she fears Hekmati's military history drew him unwelcome attention in Iran. ""I can't begin to imagine what must have been in their minds, but I agree he wouldn't have been involved in any spying,"" she said. She said she has worked with other people who have families in Iran, ""and it's always scary when they go to visit."" ""They're always worried,"" she said. ""You feel so helpless, because it seems like there's nothing you can do.""

"New York (CNN) -- Kim Jong Il was the enigmatic leader of the most enigmatic country on earth. Much about Kim's life was, and is, shrouded in mystery. Even the year of his birth -- 1942 -- has been contested by knowledgeable sources in South Korea and Russia, who claim Kim was born a few years earlier but that his official birth date was pushed back to make him exactly 30 years younger than his father, North Korea's founding leader, Kim Il Sung. North Koreans claim Kim Jong Il was born on Mount Paektu, along the North Korean border with China, at a ""secret base camp"" where his father was leading a guerrilla war against Korea's Japanese overlords. Almost everyone else believes Kim was born in Russia, at a Soviet military camp near Khabarovsk where his father had gone into retreat with other Korean and Chinese communist guerillas. But the myth of Kim's guerilla-base birth became full-blown propaganda when he was anointed heir apparent in the early 1980s. After seeing instability and communist backsliding in Russia and China following the deaths of Stalin and Mao respectively, Kim Il Sung chose his son as successor to ensure continuity for North Korea's political system. In some ways, the elder Kim was all too successful. Kim Jong Il led North Korea not to reform and opening, like his Chinese contemporaries, but through economic catastrophe, famine and repeated nuclear confrontations with the United States. Through all of this, the rule of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean People's Army and the Kim family has been absolute and ubiquitous. When Kim Jong Il took over the reigns of power following his father's death in 1994, he had been preparing for succession for more than two decades. After graduating from Kim Il Sung University in 1964, Kim rose through the ranks of the Korean Workers' Party, focusing on culture and propaganda. As he candidly admitted to a conference of party workers in 1996, economics was never his strong suit. He enjoyed film and the arts, fine food and drink, and kept late hours, but he was not the unstable and intellectually vacuous playboy of South Korean propaganda. He certainly lacked the charisma and outgoing personality of his father, but foreign officials who met him -- including South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- described him as intelligent, well-informed, even charming. On the other hand, his country's reputation for unpredictability and provocation was often well-deserved, as North Korea went through a series of confrontations with the United States and the international community over nuclear development, and the economic situation lurched from crisis to crisis. North Korea held two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, in defiance of international condemnation and U.N. sanctions. A year ago North Korean artillery shelled a South Korean island in a confrontation over South Korean military exercises, bringing the two sides to the brink of open warfare. At the same time, the economic situation -- though much improved since the famine years of the late 1990s -- remains highly precarious. If the outside world saw Kim as an enigma and a rogue, his reputation within North Korea is more difficult to assess. Of course, internal North Korean propaganda built up Kim as a hero of near-superhuman abilities, venerated by all his countrymen. But defectors' reports suggest the view of Kim within his own country is more mixed, and while his father is still widely revered, Kim Jong Il is associated with the trauma of famine and crisis in the late 1990s. Kim oversaw limited steps toward economic reform in the early 2000s, but these have since been scaled back. The composition and direction of the post-Kim Jong Il leadership is murky. Kim Jong Il's son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Un, is even more a mystery than his father was when he came to power. It seems likely that in the immediate aftermath of Kim's death, North Korea will be run by a collective leadership, perhaps headed by Kim's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek, as Kim Jong Un is prepared to assume official power. No one outside Pyongyang's inner circle knows what kind of leader Kim Jong Un will be and where he will take the country. If North Korea survives the post-Kim Jong Il transition and its circumstances improve, Kim Jong Il may be remembered as a leader who guided North Korea through a disastrous period and prepared the way for reform. If things go badly, Kim will be seen as the man who oversaw the unraveling of the system his father built and as the face of a failed dynastic communism.

"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating a letter bomb addressed to the CEO of Deutsche Bank that was delivered to the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, police said Wednesday. The device, which contained shrapnel, was detected in the bank's mail room around 1 p.m. local time, said New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. It did not detonate. ""The return address was listed as a European central bank, which would likely increase the chances of him opening it,"" said Browne, who urged a general increase in mail room security. ""A suspicious letter was received today at Deutsche Bank, addressed to Dr. (Josef) Ackermann,"" said bank spokesman Ronald Weichert. ""In-house departments concerned alerted the police,"" who then launched an investigation. Browne said the incident prompted New York authorities to increase security around Manhattan's Deutsche Bank offices.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Six people were killed and at least 300 were injured when pro-democracy activists clashed Friday with Egyptian security forces in central Cairo, a government official said. Two of the dead were teenagers and one was an Islamic scholar, said Dr. Hisham Shiha, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health. At least four of the fatalities suffered gunshot wounds, with one person shot in the back of the head, he said. Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor, said an investigation is under way. ""We are questioning 14 men detained at scene of clashes and we have a team now at two hospitals questioning the injured to understand how the injuries were inflicted,"" he said. A separate team was at the morgues following up on the deaths, he said. Meanwhile, people were throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks and glass. Men wearing what appeared to be military uniforms tossed bricks and concrete on protesters from atop a six-story building. A Ministry of Transportation building burned nearby, and tents in an activist encampment in front of parliament caught fire. The military fired warning shots into the air and sprayed water cannons to disperse the crowd. Shiha said nearly 100 people were hurt, including nine who were shot by live ammunition. Saeed said 12 people were charged with destroying public property. Are you in Cairo? Tell us what the mood is like. A Ministry of Interior official denied police were involved. ""This situation has nothing to do with the police or the Ministry of Interior, and we do not have forces at the site of the clashes,"" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a ministry spokesman. A doctor at a clinic said he had treated dozens of protesters for cuts and injuries caused by flying glass and rocks. ""It all started when the military arrested one man, and then an hour later he emerged from building barely able to walk from the beating,"" said activist and video blogger Walid Nada. ""His face and body and clothes (were) blotched with blood as the protesters carried him to (a) makeshift hospital."" Activist Mona Seif identified the beaten man as Aboudi Ibrahim. He ""has no broken bones, but major bruises to the face, cuts and harsh burns from electric shockers. We are filling a police report soon,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- While the visiting national news media focuses on the latest utterances of Republican presidential hopefuls in advance of the January 3 caucuses, many Iowans have found a bone to pick with a journalism professor -- from the University of Iowa, no less -- who wrote: ""Whether a schizophrenic, economically depressed, and some say, culturally challenged state like Iowa should host the first grassroots referendum to determine who will be the next president isn't at issue. ... In a perfect world, no way would Iowa ever be considered representative of America, or even a small part of it. Iowa's not representative of much."" Iowans are wondering what they did to incur the wrath of Stephen G. Bloom, who for 20 years has taught journalism at the state's flagship university and shared his observations in an article for The Atlantic magazine titled ""Observations from 20 Years of Iowa Life."" It may be a good thing that Bloom, a native of New Jersey, has been away teaching this semester at the University of Michigan because in trying to explain ""in both a real and metaphysical way, what Iowa is,"" he has drawn the ire of Iowans literally from all corners of the state -- from Sibley and Keokuk (whose mayor has invited him to visit and explain the ""a depressed, crime-infested slum town"" remark) to Decorah to Shenandoah. In the interest of full disclosure, many of my childhood vacations (including winter) were spent visiting my mother's parents in Iowa. I graduated from a college in Iowa, and my first full-time job in journalism was at a newspaper in Iowa, so I admit to a certain fondness for the state. And every four years, as the political spotlight shines on Iowa, I share with colleagues whatever helpful insights I can muster. Blitzer's blog: Turbulence in Iowa . The state is not one large cornfield, but driving along Interstate 80, it can appear that way for long stretches. Visit northeast Iowa along the Mississippi River for proof that the state is not flat. Iowa's farms not only help feed the United States, but also much of the world, connecting this piece of ""flyover country"" to a global view. Still, economists report that agriculture only accounts for roughly one in five jobs in the state. Iowans may be older (the average age continues to increase), whiter and more rural than the United States in general, but its Latino population is increasing and more of its residents are moving to urban areas. Iowa boasts being among the most literate states in the union (though some years ago state officials abandoned a plan to make ""Iowa: A State of Minds"" its license plate slogan). Politically, over the years Iowans have elected some of the most liberal and some of the most conservative members of Congress. Critics cite numerous examples of a snide tone in Bloom's writing. Consider his assessment of employment prospects in rural Iowa: ""Those who stay in rural Iowa are often the elderly waiting to die, those too timid (or lacking in educated) to peer around the bend for better opportunities, an assortment of waste-toids and meth addicts with pale skin and rotted teeth, or those who quixotically believe, like Little Orphan Annie, that the sun'll come out tomorrow."" What makes Iowa's GOP caucuses unique . And while they wait for that sun to come out, Bloom suggests, these Iowans spend their days stepping in manure from barnyard animals and stuffing their gullets with meat loaf, pork chops and Jell-O molds before heading out to a tractor pull or church. Bloom makes nary a mention of the distinguished academics at the state's universities and colleges, its art museums and orchestras nor even the obvious upgrades to the capital city of Des Moines during the past 20 years. Where he says that ""Iowa is a throwback to yesteryear and, at the same time, a cautionary tale of what lies around the corner,"" critics find many of Bloom's observations to be throwbacks to an Iowa that no longer exists. Many also say there are factual inaccuracies in the article. Sally Mason, president of the University of Iowa, which employs Bloom, objected. ""I disagree strongly with and was offended by Professor Bloom's portrayal of Iowa and Iowans. Please know that he does not speak for the University of Iowa. As president of the university, I have the opportunity to travel far and wide across this great state frequently, and the Iowa I see is one of strong, hard-working and creative people. In this cynical world that can harden even the greatest optimist, the citizens of Iowa continue to believe,"" Mason responded to The Atlantic. ""What defines Iowans are their deeds and actions and not some caricature. When I travel the state, what I see is a land that is rich not only because of its soil but because of how its people are grounded. Iowans are pragmatic and balanced, and they live within their means. This lifestyle, while not glitzy, is humble and true and can weather the most difficult of times,"" Mason said. Sports editor Pete Temple of the Monticello Express newspaper agreed with some parts of Bloom's article, but suggested that ""rather than having some good-natured fun with the quirks and traditions that make rural Iowa life so unique, Bloom's tone is condescending, apparently designed to mock rural Iowa in front of the rest of the nation."" Bloom, he wrote, ""fails to mention one of rural Iowa's greatest qualities, which is its ability to rise up and come together for someone in need. You have farmers completing a harvest for a neighbor, fund-raisers for families of ill or injured residents, and citizens filling sandbags to ward against an impending flood. Rural Iowans do these things willingly, immediately, and without question. If that's not representative of our nation as a whole, that's a shame."" Dean Klinkenberg, who writes about life along the Mississippi River, offered this scathing assessment: ""Bloom wrote a poorly reasoned article plagued by factual errors and loaded with big-city stereotypes of country folk. His essay was, ultimately, a lazy piece of incendiary rubbish, which I guess is what passes for journalism today."" Bloom shared some of his ""fan mail"" with media commentator Jim Romanesko, including this excerpt: ""First I want to apologize for Iowans who may have threatened you. I am a dental student here at the university and grew up in a small Iowa town my whole life (Palo) before coming here. I agree that we have our problems as Iowans but one thing we are is fiercely loyal. Your article is true (for the most part) about rural Iowans but anyone from here, esp us city folk, are going to be upset by that stereotype."" Bloom defended his work in a letter to the Press-Citizen newspaper in Iowa City. ""Perhaps my article gave some Iowans a moment to refocus their attention elsewhere -- from some of the real issues confronting the state -- Walmart taking over the retail-trade sector, empty storefronts, water pollution among the worst in the nation, factories shutting down, the state's brain drain, undocumented workers taking minimum-wage jobs in the state's under-regulated slaughterhouses, not to mention the tragedy that anyone can see walking into the state's casinos. ""I'm a proud journalist. I still believe in the adage, 'Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.' Today, much of the state is afflicted by a ravaged economy. Iowa's population growth has flat-lined. But I guess it's just more comforting to some Iowans to condemn me for pointing out these issues and others."" I'll give the last word to Lydia Waddington, a native Southerner who was editor of recently closed Iowa Independent. Of her adopted home state, Waddington wrote, also in The Atlantic, ""It's a way of life trying desperately to sustain itself and justify its own existence. It is battling against national stereotypes that no longer apply while facing newer and much more lethal challenges. ""It's picturesque scenes of idyllic farms and country roads glimpsed through a car window. It's everyone believing they know who and what you are before they go fishing with you and the shirt comes off. As Professor Bloom admits in his own writings, he never took up fishing. Bless his heart.""","Iowa professor questions state's first-in-the-nation role in presidential campaigns .

"(CNN) -- Sheriff's investigators in North Carolina launched a search of a turkey farm they say is owned by Butterball -- the largest producer of turkey products in the United States -- on Thursday after an animal rights organization said it infiltrated the farm and videotaped instances of purported animal abuse. ""The organization Mercy for Animals had conducted a covert operation at the farm and documented mistreatment of animals,"" said Capt. John Kivett of the Hoke County sheriff's office. ""No one has been taken into custody. It's still an ongoing investigation. Nothing has been seized,"" he told CNN. The heavily edited videotape from the animal rights group shows what appear to be employees of the farm kicking, dragging and throwing turkeys. During one section of the tape, someone clearly swings what appears to be a metal object, striking one of the birds. Investigators were trying to determine whether the videotape matches this same facility in Hoke County that they were searching. ""Veterinarians and detectives are inside the birdhouses conducting their investigation and documenting what they see,"" said Kivett. ""We have no way of knowing if the video is of the same place,"" he told CNN. Other sections of the 90-second tape show what appear to be injured, bloodied and, in some cases, dead turkeys. On its website, the animal rights group bills itself as an organization that promotes a vegetarian diet. ""Our investigation found Butterball employees kicking, throwing, dragging and beating birds. We also documented birds suffering from broken bones, bloody open wounds, and many left to die,"" said Nathan Runkle, executive director of Mercy for Animals. The sheriff's department said that Butterball was fully cooperating with the authorities, and that company officials were at the farm. In a written statement, Butterball said the company was working with Hoke County officials in their investigation. ""Butterball takes these allegations very seriously and fully supports the efforts being made on the part of officials. Butterball has a zero tolerance policy for any mistreatment of our birds or the failure to immediately report mistreatment of our birds by any associates,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are performing extensive internal and third-party audits as part of our own investigation. Employees found in violation of Butterball's animal welfare policies will be subject to immediate termination."" The company statement did not address the existence or the nature of the videotape. Butterball did not return CNN's calls for comment. The animal rights group told CNN that a female member of the organization was hired by Butterball as a driver, and as a worker in the animal sheds. The organization said the unidentified member worked there from the middle of November until the middle of December when the hidden-camera video was shot. ""These animals experience pain and suffering in the same way as dogs and cats. As a civilized society it's our moral obligation to prevent needless cruelty to animals including those raised for food,"" said Runkle. North Carolina law states that any person who intentionally wounds, injures, torments or kills any animal could be guilty of committing a misdemeanor or a felony, depending upon the level of infraction as determined by investigators.","An animal rights group says it videotaped purported animal abuse at a turkey farm .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- For David Shafter, it should have been a dream: A crush of excited people swarming his booth at the International Consumer Electronics Show, where his startup is launching its first product. But all the people hoisting cameras and raising themselves on tiptoe for a better view Wednesday afternoon weren't there to see his robot. They were angling for a peek at pop star Justin Bieber, who was making an appearance at the booth next door. ""We're pretty much shut down,"" said Shafter with a weary look of resignation, as rubberneckers squealed and shouted ""Justin!"" in the background. ""We can't run our demos."" Shafter's fledgling company, Xybotyx, is making its first appearance at CES to introduce its Xybot, a hockey-puck-shaped robotic device that zips around on little wheels, controlled by an iPhone or iPod Touch. Owners can download apps to their phone that give the robot specific behaviors, like avoiding obstacles. The gadget will go on sale this spring at the quirky price of $111.11. But none of the hundreds of people pressed up against his booth cared about that. They only had eyes for the teen singer with the sideswept hair who was greeting fans nearby at the TOSY booth, where he made an appearance on behalf of that company's new mRobo, a portable speaker that morphs, ""Transformers"" style, into a little dancing robot. Middle-aged tech execs aren't exactly Bieber's demographic, but many onlookers said they were there to get photos or autographs for their teen-age kids. Some people even asked if they could climb atop Shafter's plywood demo table to get a better view. (The answer was no.) ""It's the best of times, it's the worst of times,"" grumbled Shafter's business partner, Xybotyx co-founder Dan McShan, surveying the madness surrounding him. ""We're trying to get him (Bieber) to defect."" Shafter said he was planning to approach CES officials about compensating him for his lost booth time during Bieber's two-hour appearance. ""It's definitely costing us valuable hours of time with our target audience,"" McShan said. In the meantime, however, Shafter had another plan: If he couldn't beat them, he was going to join them. He placed one of his robots on the floor and, using his iPhone, began navigating it toward Bieber in the hopes of getting a remote-controlled picture. ""I was driving it up to the Bieb,"" he said with a grin a few minutes later. ""I made it about halfway there. But the security guard grabbed it.""","Entrepreneurs had misfortune of a CES booth next to where Justin Bieber was appearing .

"Waterville, Maine (CNN) -- Divers in Maine were scouring a river Wednesday in their search for a missing 21-month-old girl, but had found no sign of her in the frigid waters, authorities said. ""We're making progress. I can tell you honestly that as the days go on, our concern grows, as it's been 26 days. But I can also tell you that we remain hopeful that we will bring her back to her home,"" Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland told reporters. The search for Ayla Reynolds focused Wednesday on a half-mile area of the Kennebec River that stretches from downtown Waterville to the Carter Memorial Bridge. Officials said they had received more than 600 tips, but nothing that specifically pointed to that area. The river still has open water despite air temperatures in the teens. Divers in special suits to protect them in the frigid waters rotated in and out of the river, which was around freezing temperature, Maine Warden Service Lt. Kevin Adam said. ""The water is clear. When the sun is out, they can see 4-6 feet. ... We picked today because the weather's good and it was the most efficient time to do it,"" he said. The search for the little girl is in its fourth week. Police have said they suspect foul play in the case. ""All we know is that Ayla's missing. We've ruled out no scenario. We've ruled out no one. And we're not going to get into investigative details,"" McCausland said Wednesday. He described the search as the most intense investigation Maine's state police had been involved in for two decades. Ayla's parents are not married and don't live together. Her mother recently completed rehab, family members said. Investigators said both families have cooperated with police. The little girl's father, Justin DiPietro, said he put his daughter to bed at 8 p.m. December 16 and called police the next morning just before 9 a.m. to report her missing, according to authorities. DiPietro's mother, Phoebe DiPietro, told CNN she wasn't at the home the night Ayla disappeared. But she said she fully supports her son, who has said he ""would never do anything to harm"" his daughter. She said she just wants her Ayla returned unharmed. ""I'd give everything I owned if we can have her back,"" she said last week, her voice breaking.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez pledged closer cooperation on Monday, vowing to fight poverty and imperialism. The two leaders signed a series of accords in the areas of industry, science, technology and politics, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Sitting side by side in front of a room full of reporters, they presented a united front in their opposition to the United States. ""It's clear they are afraid of our development,"" said Ahmadinejad. Earlier, at a welcoming ceremony outside the Venezuelan presidential palace, the Iranian president called Chavez his ""dear brother,"" and said his nation has peaceful intentions. ""Our weapon is logic. Our weapon is culture. Our weapons are human values,"" he said. Chavez pledged to work with his Iranian counterpart to stop the ""imperial insanity"" of the United States, which he described as a ""threat for the world."" The Venezuelan president mocked concerns from Washington about his country's relationship with Iran, joking that U.S. media reports made it sound as though he and Ahmadinejad would be launching missiles and bombs at the U.S. capital. ""We are not warmongers,"" Chavez said, as the Iranian president nodded in agreement. ""Iran has not invaded anybody."" It's no coincidence that Venezuela is Ahmadinejad's first stop on a four-nation Latin America tour this week. Despite their cultural differences, Venezuela and Iran have found significant common ground: Both are among the world's top crude oil exporters, and their leaders are strong allies united by a fierce opposition to what they describe as U.S. imperialism. The Iranian leader arrived in Caracas on Sunday and is traveling with his ministers for foreign affairs, energy and economy, according to IRNA, Iran's official news agency. Over the years, the two nations have signed more than 270 accords, including trade deals and agreements on construction projects, car and tractor factories, energy initiatives and banking programs. Chavez has also helped the Islamic republic forge relationships with other members of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas, an eight-nation regional bloc Chavez founded. Even before he arrived, Ahmadinejad's plans for a Latin American tour grabbed global attention, as tensions grow between many Western powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Officials in the United States and other Western nations have ratcheted up sanctions against Iran several times since a November report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said the Iranian government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Iran's central bank. On Monday the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran. Iran says there's a medical purpose behind the nuclear program. But in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said the confirmation that Iran was enriching uranium to ""a level that's inappropriate"" is ""obviously a problem."" Not everyone in Venezuela is happy with Ahmadinejad's visit. Diego Arria, an opposition politician, described the trip as a ""provocation"" to the United States and an embarrassment for Venezuela. ""It comes at the worst moment -- at a time when Ahmadinejad is being looked at by the international community with great fear. ... It's bringing the threat to the United States closer to home,"" he said. The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador later this week as part of his five-day tour. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta and CNN's Luis Carlos Velez in Caracas contributed to this report.","Ahmadinejad says his weapons are logic, culture and human values .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian doctor Amany Sadek was treating patients in a makeshift hospital close to Cairo's Tahrir Square on Monday when the building was surrounded by armed forces. The doctors turned their lights off, kept quiet and were unable to let anyone in or out of their doors. ""It was horrible, we could hear shots outside,"" said Sadek. ""We carried on treating patients in the dark. When we opened the doors an hour or so later, we found people desperately looking for somewhere to be treated. ""I was scared and my friends were scared, but you kind of get used to it,"" she said. ""Despite the attacks, the hospital is still one of the safest places to be."" Sadek is one of the founders of the Tahrir Doctors Society, a group of volunteers that formed after spontaneously treating protesters injured during Egypt's revolution in January. Last Friday, when violence broke out between protesters and security forces after the second round of voting in parliamentary elections, the society set up its makeshift hospital for the fifth time this year. The interior ministry has said at least 100 security officers have been wounded in the clashes. CNN has not been able to independently verify this claim. The field hospital in Omar Makram mosque near Tahrir Square was still in place and stocked with necessary supplies since the last clashes in November. The doctors were able to re-open it quickly to treat victims of the new wave of violence. ""We got a call at 5 a.m. to say the army were attacking people sleeping in their tents,"" Sadek said. ""By the time we got there we found lots of casualties, so we re-opened the hospital and it was ready to go straight away."" ""We have treated over 1,000 wounded patients since Friday, and lots of people have been transferred to other hospitals for surgery. ""We are seeing all kinds of injuries, many from live bullets."" The society said on Saturday that one of its members had been shot in the stomach and others had been threatened with arrest. Tahrir Doctors Society currently has about 20 volunteer doctors on duty at any time of the day or night. It's facility is a short distance from Tahrir Square; other makeshift hospitals closer to the scene of the clashes have had more trouble continuing with their work. ""The army attacked one of the other field hospitals. The doctors were told to leave or they would be attacked, and the army took their drugs and burned them,"" Sadek said. ""Others have been surrounded to prevent anyone from entering or leaving. That happens on a daily basis, usually late at night."" Maj. Mohamed Askar of THE Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said protesters were capturing and wounding soldiers. ""The army soldiers they kidnapped and returned are now in the hospitals. The rebels also captured three officers, tortured them and released them. They were even talking about a prisoner swap,"" he said. Sadek says the violence of the last few days is the worst she has seen. At least 14 people have been confirmed killed in the latest spate of violence. Sadek said: ""This time it's more brutal than ever, more even than in January and February."" Tahrir Doctors Society was formed by a group of five doctors who met in January during the protests that led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak 18 days later. ""The five of us sitting in a cafe during the revolution. We were talking about the need to change things, and we started the Tahrir Doctors Society,"" said 29-year-old facial surgeon Amhad Farouk. The aims of the society are to provide emergency intervention during clashes or disasters, and to campaign for the right of healthcare for every citizen. Dr Farouk said: ""We do not discriminate between any groups in treating them: we will treat security as well as protesters. We are part of the revolution, and it is the revolutionary spirit to treat everyone equally."" He added: ""At first we weren't organized enough to keep records, but in the recent clashes we keep records of what happens to each patient. We treated more than 3,000 people in one week."" Volunteers coordinated thousands of public donations of medical devices and drugs through accounts such as @TahrirSupplies and @TahrirNeeds on the micro-blogging site Twitter. ""We would announce through them what we needed and people contributed millions of pounds worth of supplies,"" Dr. Sadek said. ""Normal people would buy what we needed from pharmacies or factories and bring it down to the square. It was very inspiring."" The group was able to draw on training its members had received from the international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. ""We learned that the safest place for our bigger makeshift hospital was back from the front line, so patients with major injuries could be transferred there from the front line,"" Sadek said. ""Many doctors in the front line units were injured by the gas. It went on for six days. Whenever I ha . d to go to the front line, I wore a gas mask and goggles and still could hardly breathe."" During quieter times, the Tahrir Doctors Society continues its humanitarian work providing free traveling clinics in deprived areas. A mission that Dr. Farouk said was inspired by January's revolution. ""This is the rise of Egyptian society. All sorts of groups are organizing themselves since the revolution and are getting stronger,"" he said. ""The idea of volunteering is really taking off."" Dr. Sadek agreed. ""Before the revolution people never thought about volunteering. Doctors were just trying to earn enough to make a living, not participating or sharing,"" she said. ""After the revolution people started to believe in themselves again. Now we have realized we can make a difference and have stopped thinking just on a personal level. It's so satisfying.""","Tahrir Doctors Society was started by medics who ran makeshift hospital during January revolution .

"(CNN) -- North Korea kept the world on tenterhooks Wednesday, when the funeral of leader Kim Jong Il was expected to take place in Pyongyang. On Wednesday morning, state television began broadcasting previously aired video of Kim Jong Il's son Kim Jong Un and other mourners paying respects in front of the late dictator as his corpse lay in state. The secretive nation had revealed no details about the funeral, where thousands of North Koreans were expected to file past a glass case housing the body of the elder Kim, revered as a godlike ""dear leader"" by his people. State television on Wednesday morning also showed historical footage recounting the life of Kim Jong Il, from the legend of his birth on a sacred mountain to his years as leader of the communist state. Kim's funeral likely will be modeled after that of his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994, said Han Park, a professor at the University of Georgia's School of Public and International Affairs who is also director of the Globis Center for the Study of Global Issues. However, the funeral is expected to spotlight his son Kim Jong Un, the man designated the ""great successor"" by the nation's Worker's Party. Questions have been raised about Kim Jong Un's ability to take the reins of the reclusive communist nation, given his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience. ""The system will try to make sure that Kim Jong Un, this young man, is a legitimate leader, so probably he will be spotlighted in the funeral procession,"" said Park. While there is no official religion in North Korea, the funeral will probably touch on the Confucian tradition of ancestor worship, Park said. Denny Roy, a North Korea analyst at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said observers outside North Korea will be performing ""the usual Kremlinology -- except in this case it's Pyongyangology."" They will be watching the ceremonies for clues as to where leading figures stand in the new hierarchy, comparing the event to the 1994 funeral of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung. ""What I expect to see is no sign that there's any hiccup or difficulty in Kim Jong Il's plan to have his son Kim Jong Un succeed him,"" Roy said. Among those expected to be at the side of the ""great successor"" are his aunt and uncle. The late ruler's sister, Kim Kyong Hui, and her husband, Jang Sung Taek, are expected to serve as regents for the young Kim as he builds leadership experience, Roy said. ""They will be very prominently featured in all of the public ceremonies,"" he said. ""They'll have places that are very close to Kim Jong Un. If it was otherwise, it would be a dramatic new development, but I don't expect that."" The ceremony is to be followed by a memorial on Thursday. The state-run Korean Central News Agency said when the national memorial service is held Thursday, gun volleys will be fired in the capital, Pyongyang, as well as provincial seats. ""All the people will observe three minutes' silence and all locomotives and ships (those on voyage included) will blow whistles and those units with sirens will sound them all at once,"" KCNA said. While the public ""outpouring of grief"" will be present at the funeral, it may not be as overwhelming as it was following the death of Kim Il Sung, said Park, who has visited North Korea frequently and is in close contact with high-ranking officials there. As loved as he might be among the North Korean people, he said, ""Kim Jong Il is no Kim Il Sung."" Kim Il Sung was much more charismatic, and his death was much more unexpected, he said. While Kim Il Sung was 83 to Kim Jong Il's 69, the elder Kim was thought to be in excellent health. ""Two weeks before his death, (Kim Il Sung) received Jimmy Carter,"" Park said, referring to the former American president. ""In North Korea, no one actually anticipated or suspected the coming of his death ... Kim Jong Il, his health was failing. Everyone knew that."" The glass case to house Kim Jong Il's body was ready upon his death, he said. In Kim Il Sung's case, ""it took days ... to make that arrangement preparation."" And John Park, research fellow at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said Kim Jong Un is ""following a script laid out by his father,"" who had a major stroke in 2008. ""Basically, we are seeing a man who planned his own funeral,"" he said. North Korea has said the funeral will be a ""low-key"" affair, with no foreign heads of state invited, John Park said. That's ""the one factor that Kim Jong Il couldn't control"" -- the possible embarrassment, if invitations were issued, that heads of state might not accept. One point of interest will be who is going to be in the Chinese delegation, John Park said. ""That will be done through party-to-party connection,"" with those attending likely to be a senior representative of the Communist Party of China. There have been rumors that Chinese President Hu Jintao may attend, he said. John Park believes if Hu shows up, he will use the title of party general secretary, not president. And one notable omission from the guest list is Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who fell from favor after being caught trying to sneak a visit to Tokyo Disneyland using a forged passport. He told Japan's TV Asahi in 2010 that he opposed having his family hold power for another generation, but had ""no objection nor interest"" in the matter. Roy said Kim now lives in the Chinese casino haven of Macau and is ""more or less exiled."" ""It's rather significant that in a Confucian society, the oldest son won't play a significant role in the funeral,"" he said. ""That speaks to a very strained relationship between him and the current leadership."" Han Park referred to ""government by legacy"" in North Korea. When Kim Jong Il succeeded his father, he also inherited much of Kim Il Sung's policies and philosophies, which have been ""the backbone of policy-making,"" he said. Because of that, neither he nor Roy said they expect to see drastic policy changes under Kim Jong Un. Observers say upcoming events will also provide North Korea with opportunities to reinforce the succession and provide a window on how smoothly that process is going. Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea studies and director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy for the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote Tuesday that the leader's upcoming New Year's address may already have been written, ""but can be scoured for deviations from the past and for evidence of possible rewriting post-Kim Jong Il's death."" Kim Jong Un's first birthday as leader, on January 8, may also provide some clues. So could Kim Jong Il's 70th birthday on February 16 -- still within the mourning period -- or the 100th birthday of Kim Il Sung on April 15. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Observers will be watching the funeral for succession clues, analyst says .
Kim Jong Il's eldest son is a notable omission from the guest list, he says .
Kim's funeral is expected to follow the template of his father's in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- As the leader of Malaysia's reform -- or reformasi -- movement, Anwar Ibrahim has spent much of the past decade in court defending himself against sodomy charges. Once one of former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's closest political allies -- and viewed by many as his heir apparent -- the 64-year old grew up in the politically-charged environment of post-independence Malaysia. He made his name as a student activist in various Muslim youth groups in Kuala Lumpur in the late-1960s, as the country reeled from the protracted Communist insurgency of the Malayan Emergency. Arrested in 1974 in student protests against rural poverty, Anwar was sentenced to 20 months in jail. Despite his firebrand reputation, he later confounded liberal supporters in 1982 by joining the conservative United Malays National Organization (UMNO) led by Mahathir. At the time, Mahathir's ability to bring Anwar on board was seen as a master political stroke, effectively neutralizing a potentially powerful political opponent who risked joining the opposition Parti Islam or PAS. Anwar found not guilty of sodomy . He moved quickly through the political ranks throughout the 1980s, heading several ministries until he became deputy prime minister and the favored lieutenant of Mahathir in 1993. But by the end of the 1990s, the relationship had begun to sour as Anwar became increasingly vocal about what he saw as widespread nepotism and cronyism within the Malaysian government. Protectionist policies set up by Mahathir also came under fire from Anwar, who supported the International Monetary Fund's recovery plan for Malaysia following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Anwar instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and put major infrastructure projects on hold. These mega-projects had been the cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy and his opposition further strained the relationship. Mahathir, as prime minister, reversed several Anwar decisions. Nevertheless, the tough medicine of the IMF package meant Malaysia emerged from the crisis sooner than its neighbors. It is currently moving away from manufacturing as a base for its economy, and is now a world center of Islamic banking and knowledge-based industries. In 1998, Anwar was fired from the cabinet amid police reports he was under investigation on charges of sodomy -- an illegal act in predominantly Muslim Malaysia. Anwar denied the allegations. Appearing in court with a black eye from a beating while in police custody- an injury that then Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor later admitted in a royal commission he had personally administered -- Anwar pleaded not guilty. After a two-year trial, which also involved corruption charges, Anwar was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in jail for sodomy and six years, served concurrently, for corruption. In December 2004, Anwar was cleared of the sodomy charges, and in 2006 he announced his bid to run for parliament in the 2008 elections after the expiration of a ban from public office related to his earlier conviction. In the 2008 elections, the opposition seriously dented the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority, handing it one of its worst election results since independence in 1957. In what the Malaysian media had dubbed ""Sodomy 2.0,"" the opposition leader -- just months after the 2008 elections -- was again charged with sodomy on the basis of allegations from his aide Modh Saiful Bukhari Azlan who claimed Anwar had repeatedly sexually assaulted him. Anwar dismissed the charges as a sham, saying they were concocted by the ruling coalition in an effort to discredit him. Anwar has consistently claimed that the charges were trumped up and the last desperate act of a government fighting for its political survival. The government, for its part, has denied any involvement in the case against Anwar. ""The fact that the same plot that was hatched in 1998 is being repeated reflects a certain bankruptcy and lack of creativity on their part,"" Anwar told CNN in 2010. ""They must still believe some segment of the Malay-Muslim electorate, who will likely determine the outcome of the next General Election, will be alienated by these charges. I doubt that is the case."" After a nearly three-year trial, a Malaysian court Monday found Anwar not guilty of the charges against him after the judge said there were questions over whether DNA evidence had been contaminated. Information Minister Rais Yatim hailed the verdict as a victory for Malaysia's judiciary, showing that it was free from government influence. With the government expected to call elections in the coming months, Anwar said he was ready to start campaigning again and challenge the ruling coalition's 50-year hold on power. Anwar has brought together a diverse group of opposition parties, including a conservative ethnic Malay Islamic party, a secular party mainly representative of ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities and his own multiracial party. At the heart of Malaysia's reform movement is the call for a multiracial alternative to the political status quo in the South East Asian nation. Malaysia's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a Malay term which means literally means ""son of the soil"" -- favors the ethnic Malay majority, providing them with preference in employment, business, education and housing. While proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- which was instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia in 1969 -- has lifted many urban Malays into the middle class, critics say that Chinese, Indian and the indigenous Orang Asli have been excluded from the political process. While problems with bumiputra were among the election issues, allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns. Dubbed the post-reformasi generation, educated young Malaysians in their 20s and 30s have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas. The brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms, but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education. According to Herizal Hazri, the Malaysian program director for The Asia Foundation, Anwar's acquittal will give a boost to the speed of reform. ""Anwar still represents the reform agenda,"" he said. ""The anti-corruption drives and drive towards good governance also illuminate a more welcoming view of as to how ethnicities should be treated in Malaysia."" He said both the opposition and the government were pursuing reforms, swinging the attention of the reform movement towards problems of corruption rather than issues of ethnicity and race. One of the unintended consequences of the Anwar case, he added, was that Malaysia's British-based legal system had emerged as an independent force in a political structure that critics charge has been compromised by decades of cronyism. ""I would have to say that for once I am proud of a Malaysian institution,"" Hazri said. ""The court has been strong enough to make a decision outside of politics and it needs to be applauded. ""The court made its decision based solely on the facts of the case. Today is a victory for the Malaysian judicial system and I hope that it heralds a bright new future,"" he said.","Anwar has spent more than a decade fighting sodomy charges .
The one-time student activist was once Mahathir's right-hand man .
The opposition leader dented the ruling party's majority at elections in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Good things come to those who wait. And that's exactly what viewers will be doing when TV's best midseason offering, ""Good Christian Belles,"" aka ""GCB,"" debuts March 4 on ABC. Reminiscent of ""Desperate Housewives"" in its less desperate heyday, ""GCB"" follows Amanda Vaughn (Leslie Bibb), a woman who ruled in high school but has since been humbled by life when her marriage ends in scandal and she has to return home to Dallas. Unfortunately for Amanda, a mother of two, her former ""frenemies""-turned-socialites and their husbands haven't quite evolved, and they do everything they can to make her life miserable. Emmy- and Tony-winning actress Kristin Chenoweth stars as one of Amanda's rivals, and Annie Potts steals scenes as Amanda's meddlesome mother. The show is based on a best-selling book from Kim Gatlin. While ""Good Christian Belles"" is the best, it's not the only show to look forward to this winter. NBC's ""30 Rock"" is returning at 8 p.m. ET Thursday for a sixth season, TNT's gritty cop drama ""Southland"" will be back at 10 p.m. ET January 17 for a fourth season, and the 11th season of ""American Idol"" resumes at 8 p.m. ET January 18 and 19 on Fox. There are also a slew of new offerings to sort through. For your channel-surfing pleasure, we've selected the good, the bad and the forgettable: . The good . • ""The Firm"" (debuts 9 p.m. ET Sunday, NBC): Based on the best-selling novel by John Grisham, this intense and sometimes cluttered courtroom drama, follows attorney Mitchell McDeere (this time played by Josh Lucas of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" instead of Tom Cruise) a decade after he brought down a prestigious Memphis law firm. Every week, Mitch will fight for his clients but with a twist because the mob wants him dead as does a shadowy organization behind one of his controversial cases. Don't worry. It sounds more complicated than it is, and Lucas is a treat to watch. • ""House of Lies"" (debuts 10 p.m. ET Sunday, Showtime): Don Cheadle (""Crash"") and Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"") have undeniable chemistry in this testosterone heavy, raunchy comedy about a cutthroat business consultant (Cheadle). • ""Alcatraz"" (debuts 8 p.m. ET January 16, Fox): America's most infamous prison becomes a time-travel portal in this trippy but fun new sci-fi drama from none other than J.J. Abrams (""Lost"" and ""Fringe""). ""Alcatraz"" stars Sam Neill (""Jurassic Park"") and Jorge Garcia of ""Lost"" fame. • ""Luck"" (debuts 9 p.m. ET January 29, HBO): The latest creation from David Milch (""Deadwood""), ""Luck"" stars Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man,"" ""Kramer vs. Kramer"") as a gangster of sorts. Hoffman leads a stellar cast that includes Nick Nolte and Dennis Farina in this methodical and fascinating drama about horse racing and the troubled people who inhabit that world. • ""Smash"" (debuts 10 p.m. ET February 6, NBC): Executive producer Steven Spielberg and NBC hope to steal the spotlight from ""Glee"" with this exciting new music-driven drama. ""Smash"" follows a Broadway musical from its planning stages to the big stage and stars Debra Messing and Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston (""Prizzi's Honor""). The bad . • ""Work It"" (airs 8:30 p.m. ET Tuesdays, ABC): Two unemployed men (Ben Koldyke and Amaury Nolasco) dress as women to get jobs in a sluggish economy. But ""Bosom Buddies"" was better when it debuted in 1980. • ""Are You There, Chelsea?"" (debuts 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, NBC): Based on comedic actress Chelsea Handler's best-selling and mostly autobiographical books, this mildly funny new comedy follows a 20-something (Laura Prepon of ""That '70s Show"") who parties as hard as she drinks. What's even less appealing is that Handler stars in the sitcom too but doesn't play herself. Good luck with that. • ""Rob"" (debuts 8:30 p.m. ET Thursday, CBS): This new sitcom isn't offensive because of its liberal use of stereotypes. It's offensive because it is unfunny and unoriginal. ""Rob"" follows a man (Rob Schneider) who marries a Latina and fails to fit in with her family. • ""The River"" (debuts 9 p.m. ET February 7, ABC): Bruce Greenwood (""Star Trek"" the movie) stars as an explorer and wildlife TV host who goes missing in the Amazon jungle. Leslie Hope (""24"") plays his wife, a woman determined to find him who heads to the Amazon with a reality TV crew and her son (Joe Anderson of ""The Crazies""). Instead, she finds lots of ghosts and questions. The forgettable . • ""The Finder"" (debuts 9 p.m. ET Thursday, Fox): Geoff Stults (""Happy Town"") and Michael Clarke Duncan (""The Green Mile"") star in this dull but well-intentioned spinoff of ""Bones."" • ""Fashion Star"" (debuts 10 p.m. ET March 13, NBC): In a lopsided attempt to imitate ""Project Runway,"" former supermodel Elle Macpherson has created this reality competition series that features celebrity mentors Jessica Simpson and Nicole Richie. Yawn.","It's that time again: midseason TV series .

"(CNN) -- Unlike in the death of any other world leader, reactions from the international community to the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il were somewhat muted.

"(CNN) -- Japan's 77-year-old emperor is currently in hospital, several days after coming down with a fever, a spokesperson with the Imperial Household Agency says. Emperor Akihito, a ceremonial but revered figure in the Japan, was suffering from a worsening case of bronchitis and the fever he contracted Thursday, according to the spokesperson, who declined to be identified due to the agency's media protocol. ""He appears to be fatigued and has lost some resistance to fight against sickness,"" the spokesperson said. ""To be on the safe side, he was hospitalized (Sunday night) at University of Tokyo Hospital."" It is the emperor's second time in a hospital this year, after getting medical treatment in February for extensive tests of his coronary arteries. In recent years some analysts believe Akihito's health has been affected by stress. The issues of no male heir for Crown Prince Naruhito, the continued talk of constitutional changes for females to rule and family rifts over the role of the Imperial Household Agency were speculated to be the cause. Tsugunomiya Akihito was born on December 23, 1933 in Tokyo to Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako Kuniat as their fifth child and first son. According to Japanese legend, he is a direct descendant of Japan's first emperor Jimmu, circa 660 BC. Akihito means ""shining pinnacle of virtue,"" and Tsugunomiya means ""prince of the august succession and enlightened benevolence."" At about the age of five, Akihito was separated from his parents, in accordance with Japanese custom at the time, and raised and educated by chamberlains and tutors. His youth was packed with events so dramatic that they today seem unimaginable, including Japan's brutal military invasion of China, its foray into World War II and subsequent defeat followed by an unprecedented foreign occupation. Akihito's post WWII private tutor was an American Quaker, Elizabeth Gray-Vining from Philadelphia, who also happened to be the only foreign guest at his wedding. Married to Michiko Shoda in 1959, he was the first Japanese crown prince to marry a commoner (they met playing tennis), despite the fact there was a designated list of about 800 potential candidates. The marriage produced three children; Hiro no miya Naruhito Shinno, Crown Prince Naruhito (born February 23, 1960), Akishino no miya Fumihito Shinno, Prince Akishino (born November 30, 1965), and Nori no miya Sayako Naishinno, Princess Sayako (born April 8, 1969). On November 12, 1990, Akihito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne -- the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world -- as the 125th Emperor of Japan, one year and ten months after the death of Emperor Hirohito. The position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as ""the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people."" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal. Akihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech on March 16. In it, he encouraged citizens to put forth their ""best effort to save all suffering people"" and he applauded his countrymen's handling of the crisis. ""I truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up hope, take care of themselves, and live strong for tomorrow,"" he said in a calm and poignant oration delivered from the Imperial Palace. ""Also, I want all citizens of Japan to remember everyone who has been affected by the devastation, not only today but for a long time afterwards -- and help with the recovery.""

"New York (CNN) -- Among the political threats wielded by Donald Trump in his carnival barker quest for the presidency is that if denied the Republican nomination, he would run as an independent. As an independent myself, I usually cheer the prospect of any independent campaign. It shakes up the arrogant assumption that our elections are wholly owned subsidiaries of the two major parties and their respective special interests. But Trump has already burned his bridges with most independent voters by choosing to go full birther and pander to the far right wing of the GOP. It's a shame because in his purely CEO persona, Trump could have mounted a semi-credible independent campaign. Look at what Ross Perot was able to accomplish with such an appeal nearly 20 years ago or what Mayor Michael Bloomberg has done in New York to date. An independent candidate running on a proven record of executive leadership, job creation and improving American competitiveness could be a serious presidential candidate this time around. Especially because a new Washington Post/ABC poll shows that 41% of American voters now identify as independents. We are the plurality and provide the balance of power in any election. Independent voters tend to be closer to Republicans on economic issues and closer to Democrats on social issues. In other words, they are fiscally conservative but socially liberal. They hate hyper-partisanship and special-interest gridlock in Washington, and they have been deficit hawks since at least the days of Perot. It's perhaps useful to remember that Perot campaigned primarily on reducing the deficit and the debt at a time when America was struggling to get out of a recession and many people thought that Japan was a rising power that would eclipse the United States. Now, many of those same conditions exist, with China taking the place of Japan in the ""Rise and Fall of Great Powers"" narrative. But crucially, Perot was decidedly liberal-to-libertarian in his social beliefs. He was avowedly abortion rights and even back then supported gays in the military. The CEO candidate is usually liberated from social issue litmus tests by saying that what people do in their private lives doesn't affect on-the-job performance. A guy such as Trump could embody the old libertarian line, ""I want the government out of the boardroom and the bedroom."" Many would cheer. But instead, Trump has done a 180-degree reversal on abortion (like Mitt Romney before him) in the hopes of winning the GOP nomination, because abortion-rights Republicans have become an endangered species despite the endurance of ""individual freedom"" rhetoric. (We can get into how Barry Goldwater's wife co-founded Arizona Planned Parenthood in the 1930s another time.) Even worse, he made a strategic decision to pander to the outer reaches of American politics by embracing thoroughly discredited conspiracy theories to drum up support from the fringe. This has succeeded in the short run, compounded by his already high name recognition. But it will hurt both Trump and the GOP in the long run, while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters. If Trump were to try and run as an independent, he could still win enough votes to poll in the low single digits of the popular vote, as Pat Buchanan did before him. But given his super-rich persona -- now added to his opportunistic endorsement of Obama Derangement Syndrome -- his votes would come entirely out of the Republican nominee's hide, opening the door for President Obama's re-election. In contrast, Perot's independent campaign won 19% of the popular vote in 1992 -- coming in second in terms of all-time independent presidential candidacies to Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party presidential campaign in 1912. They won votes from the vast vital center of the American electorate. Trump would not. Trump has debased himself and any ideas he had of a political career with the serial idiocies he's articulated in this flirtation with a presidential campaign. Of course, there will be a cadre of political consultants who encourage him to run because they see dollar signs in their eyes, not because they are thinking of the good of the republic. This is predictable but pathetic. Independent voters are now the largest and fastest-growing segment of the electorate. At the end of the day, we decide which party will win control of Congress or which candidate will win the presidency. But a candidate who panders to the extremes and parades his own irresponsibility cannot assume that he'll win independent votes just because he slaps the independent label on a self-funded candidacy. A credible independent candidate needs to be a consistent advocate for the principled positions independent voters care about -- reducing the deficit and debt while combating hyper-partisanship. Trump made a decision to inflame polarization in the pursuit of self-promotion. As a result, he sacrificed his right to be taken seriously as well as any claims he had to represent independent voters credibly in the 2012 election. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John Avlon.","Donald Trump changed his party enrollment this week from GOP to unaffiliated .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- In another Oprah first, the media mogul has chosen a man to join her on the cover of her ""O"" magazine: Dr. Mehmet Oz. Why him? Why now? ""The January issue is all about firsts. I met Dr. Oz in 2003 as his first guest on 'Second Opinion' -- a medical series he and his wife, Lisa, created for the Discovery Channel. Now here we are, over eight years later. ... What can I say? I adore Dr. Oz,"" Oprah Winfrey tells PEOPLE exclusively. ""As we toast to a new year and encourage readers to take the first step toward a happier, healthier life, who better to help us get on the right path than my dear friend and America's doctor, Dr. Oz."" And while America's doctor may have a great bedside manner, the cover interview reveals it's the pillow talk with his own wife that needs some work. ""I think I'm a better doctor than I am a husband,"" Oz, 51, tells Winfrey in January's issue. ""I give myself a good grade as a doctor, then the next best grade as a father, and the worst grade as a husband. I don't listen well when Lisa talks."" But he recognizes that Lisa is his greatest advocate, and has steered his career in directions he never would have taken. ""It was her vision early on to create the kind of show [""Second Opinion"" on Discovery Health] we're doing now,"" he says. ""She had a much larger vision for me than I did for myself. We actually had a big spat about this a couple of months ago. It's just one after another of things I do wrong. And I do do them wrong. But she's quick to make sure I own up to it.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona moved five points clear in Spain as manager Pep Guardiola celebrated his 100th match in charge with a 4-0 victory at home to Racing Santander on Saturday. The injury-hit defending champions brushed off the pre-match loss of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to romp into a 3-0 halftime lead as they put pressure on Real Madrid to win Sunday's home match against Villarreal. The Swede is in doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to German club Stuttgart due to a swollen ankle. Midfielder Andres Iniesta took advantage of some slack defending to pounce for his first goal this season in the seventh minute, hooking home a left-foot effort after the ball ran loose in his 300th outing for the club. France striker Thierry Henry, handed a rare start due to Ibrahimovic's absence, netted a free-kick in the 29th minute after driving a shot through the defensive wall for his first goal this year. Center-back Rafael Marquez marked his return from suspension with a similar effort nine minute later as he curled a set-piece over the wall and in off the post. Barca took their foot off the pedal in the second half, but 18-year-old Thiago scored his first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback. Captain Carles Puyol had to go off with a facial injury but is expected to face Stuttgart in the first leg of the last-16 tie. It was Guardiola's 71st victory since taking charge of the Catalan giants, and 14th-placed Racing never looked like inflicting his 11th defeat -- the 10th came against Atletico Madrid last weekend, Barca's first in La Liga this season. Sevilla moved to within a point of third-placed Valencia, who host Getafe on Monday, after coming from behind to beat fellow Champions League hopefuls Mallorca despite having two men sent off. Mallorca, who also had a player red-carded, suffered their first home league defeat this season despite taking a fifth-minute lead through Mario Suarez. Jesus Navas leveled in the 23rd minute but then Sevilla had striker Alvaro Negredo sent off soon after for his second red card in three matches. Mallorca defender Ivan Ramis also saw red on the stroke of halftime for a foul on Didier Zokora, then 11 minutes after the break home goalkeeper Dudu Aouate made his second costly error of the game to let Ivica Dragutinovic's speculative free-kick drift into his net. Substitute Diego Perotti made it 3-1 five minutes later, then Zokora was booked a second time for dissent as sixth-placed Mallorca slumped to a second defeat in six days. Deportivo La Coruna moved above Mallorca into fifth with a 2-1 win against bottom club Xerez, with a penalty from Andres Guardado and another goal by Riki in the first seven minutes. Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho extended his remarkable unbeaten run in home league matches to 130 as his Italian champions Inter Milan held on to draw 0-0 with Sampdoria on Saturday despite having two men sent off. The Portuguese coach, who hosts his former club Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday, saw his team go down to nine men with more than half the match to play after Walter Samuel and Ivan Cordoba were red-carded. Argentina defender Samuel was sent off for elbowing striker Nicola Pozzi in the 32nd minute, having already been booked. Cordoba was booked on 34 and 38 as he paid for encroaching at a free-kick and later barging Pozzi. Sampdoria had Giampaolo Pazzini sent off for a second yellow card in the 74th minute but held on for a point that put them fourth above Napoli. Inter, who also had two players sent off in the derby win over AC Milan, extended their Serie A lead to eight points from Roma, who play on Sunday. Genoa joined sixth-placed Juventus on 38 points, 17 behind Inter, with a 3-0 win at home to 10-man Udinese. Robert Acquafresca netted twice for the hosts before Cristian Zapata was sent off for swearing in the 57th minute, and Rodrigo Palacio wrapped up the victory seven minutes later.","Barcelona go five points clear in Spain in coach Pep Guardiola's 100th match in charge .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration on Monday announced a 20-year ban on new mining claims on more than 1 million acres of public land near the Grand Canyon, a move meant to protect the iconic landmark from new uranium mining. Previously approved operations will be allowed to continue, as will new projects on valid existing claims. ""People from all over the country and around the world come to visit the Grand Canyon. Numerous American Indian tribes regard this magnificent icon as a sacred place and millions of people in the Colorado River Basin depend on the river for drinking water, irrigation, industrial and environmental use,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. ""We have been entrusted to care for and protect our precious environmental and cultural resources, and we have chosen a responsible path that makes sense for this and future generations,"" he added. The administration said the move will give officials more time to monitor the impact of uranium mining on the vital watershed, and in the mineral-rich area in general. Conservation groups cheered the decision, which was slammed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Sen. John McCain. ""This is a great day for Grand Canyon National Park and all those who care about the park and the surrounding public lands and waters,"" said Sandy Bahr, Grand Canyon chapter director of the Sierra Club, a California-based environmental organization. ""Today's decision protects not only the area around the Grand Canyon, but water that helps feed the Colorado River, which provides drinking water for millions of people downstream."" Brewer similarly stressed the significance of the park, but argued the move will needlessly cost Arizona jobs and stall economic growth. ""The 20-year ban comes at the expense of hundreds of high-paying jobs and approximately $10 billion worth of activity for the Arizona economy,"" she said. ""Nobody wants to see it (the Grand Canyon) harmed. But I believe that environmental protection and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. We could and should have both."" The Grand Canyon National Park is a major tourist attraction in Arizona; close to 5 million people visit it each year. McCain, speaking Sunday before the ban's official announcement, said he had expected the decision and was disappointed. ""It's clearly another victory for the radical environmental community,"" he said.","The 20-year ban affects more than 1 million acres of public land .

"Washington (CNN) -- A congressional panel investigating claims the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary mishandled the remains of hundreds of fallen U.S. military personnel will meet for the first time Tuesday. In November, U.S. Air Force investigators announced they had found ""serious misconduct"" and ""gross mismanagement"" in the handling of remains at the base. The findings came after the Air Force conducted a year-long investigation into 14 allegations of wrongdoing made by whistleblowers involving the remains of four U.S. service members killed in action, the Pentagon official said. The panel, which is being chaired by retired Gen. John Abizaid, has been given ""full authority to review all aspects of mortuary affairs to ensure we are meeting the highest standards of care for our fallen."" Department of Defense spokesman Capt. John Kirby said. Abizaid retired from the Army in 2007 after leading U.S. Central Command the final three years of his 34-year military career. Last week, the Air Force admitted that it sent more sets of military personnel remains to a Virginia landfill than it originally acknowledged. Backtracking on initial information about how it handled the remains of American service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force said the cremated body parts of hundreds of the fallen were burned and dumped in the landfill. Earlier, the Air Force said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner. The Washington Post broke the story, and the Air Force now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the base mortuary were cremated, incinerated and buried with medical waste. That procedure was in place between November 2003 and May 1, 2008. The Air Force also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of, first by cremation, then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill. Congressman Rush Holt, D-New Jersey, Thursday accused the Pentagon of what he called ""willful blindness"" in not acting faster to identify and correct the problems and fully report them. ""For years, this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and, I would say, dishonorably,"" Holt said in a telephone interview. He said he had been asking the Pentagon for months about information about Dover, on behalf of a constituent whose husband was killed five years ago. ""They don't get it. They don't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this,"" Holt said. Last month, the Defense Department told the congressman that exact numbers could not be determined. ""Without individual case-by-case review, the exact number of Service-directed disposition of subsequent remains cannot be determined,"" said a fact sheet sent to Holt in November. ""It would require a massive effort and time to recall records and research individually."" When bodies are not intact -- for instance, in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the Air Force Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Families can elect to be notified when parts are identified or leave it up to the military to dispose of them appropriately. Since the policy was changed in 2008, the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea. Holt pointed to how the United States spends millions each year searching for the remains of service members missing in action from previous wars, for instance in Southeast Asia. ""That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that,"" Holt said. ""It is a level of response that honors our soldiers."" The mistakes at Dover send a different message, Holt said. ""It sends shudders to think that we engage in this kind of desecration,"" he said. But at the Pentagon, aides to Panetta said he is satisfied with how the Air Force responded in regard to the landfill policy and new information about how many of the American fallen were involved. ""I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this,"" said Kirby.

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal Aviation Administrator Randy Babbitt resigned Tuesday, three days after he was arrested on a drunk driving charge near his suburban Washington home. In a brief statement released to the media, Babbitt said he had submitted his resignation to his boss, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and that LaHood had accepted it. Babbitt, 65, a former airline pilot and president of a major pilots' union, said serving as FAA administrator had been ""the highlight of my professional career,"" adding, ""But I am unwilling to let anything cast a shadow on the outstanding work done 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by my colleagues at the FAA."" His statement made no mention of his arrest, although it was clearly the event that precipitated his action. Earlier in the day, Secretary LaHood told reporters he was ""very disappointed"" that he had learned about Babbitt's Saturday night arrest only after the Fairfax City, Virginia, police department issued a news release about the incident. In a statement released just minutes after Babbitt announced his resignation, LaHood called Babbitt a ""dedicated public servant and outstanding leader."" ""I'm proud to say that we have the safest aviation system in the world, and thanks to Randy's stewardship, it became safer and stronger,"" LaHood said. ""He worked tirelessly to improve relations with the labor community and bolstered employee engagement among his 49,000 colleagues at the FAA."" Fairfax City police arrested Babbitt late Saturday night after they allegedly saw Babbitt driving on the wrong side of the road. The police put out a news release on Monday morning detailing the incident. Babbitt was alone in the car, and was cooperative, police said. He was released on personal recognizance, meaning no bail was required. The police department said Babbitt failed a sobriety test, but they did not release the results of any blood-alcohol test. On Monday, DOT officials appeared to be caught off-guard when the police department, in accordance with its policies, issued a news release saying Babbitt had been arrested. DOT officials Monday afternoon issued a statement saying that Babbitt had asked for a leave of absence, and it had been granted. A court date for Babbitt has been set for February 2 in Virginia. Deputy Administrator Michael Huerta is serving as acting administrator.","NEW: FAA head Randy Babbitt resigns after a weekend charge of drunk driving .

"(CNN) -- From a distance, he appears to be taking a nap. His long, delicate eyelashes are closed as his head rests on a blanket. The 10-year-old boy, however, is not asleep. The turn of his gauze-wrapped head reveals a mass of blood. Maher al-Husseini is dead, reportedly from a sniper bullet. He bled to death. In his own home. ""What is the fault of this child?"" asks a man, whose voice rises in anger on a video posted Friday on YouTube. He kneels down and gestures to the boy, whose hands and ankles are tied. ""What did this child do that they hit him inside his house? This is unacceptable."" Friday was a day of protest, pain and sorrow in Homs, a center of demonstrations and death in Syria. At least 17 people were reported slain in the city, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group. Women, children and dissident soldiers were among those killed Friday in Syria, the group said. The United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a brutal government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. The unidentified narrator of the video starts the tour of the home upstairs, pointing to a bullet hole on a window frame, then blood on the chair beneath it. He leads the cameraman down blood-spattered stairs to the body of Maher, lying in the family sitting room. The boy wears a maroon sweatshirt featuring a comic character. ""We could not aid the child, we did not know where to take him because of the firing in the neighborhood,"" the agitated man said. ""He kept bleeding for half an hour and we could not aid him."" The speaker blamed Maher's death on ""thugs"" who fired upon the home in the Mreiji neighborhood. Another man sits in a chair, his head in his hands. ""We are not safe, this government is murderous,"" the narrator says. ""It is killing people, it is killing its own people."" Near the end of the video, the man leans down and kisses the boy. Watch the YouTube video. WARNING: Graphic content. A longer version of the video shows a woman crying over the boy. Others can be heard in background wailing. The boy is wrapped in a white sheet and carried by men in street towards a cemetery. Some of the men chant ""The martyrs blood will not be lost in vain,"" as the lifeless boy is carried. As the men walk towards the cemetery gunfire can be heard. They get to the cemetery and start digging as gunfire continues to ring out. Another video posted on YouTube features another scene from Homs, a city wracked by eight months of violence. Three shrouded bodies are being carried into a mosque to be laid out alongside Friday worshippers. One is of a boy identified as Nasser Mohammed, 12. A chorus of voices rises as they are brought in. Some shout ""Allahu Akbar!"" (Allah is the greatest). CNN could not independently confirm what was depicted in the videos. Western networks are not allowed inside the embattled country. Out on the streets Friday, Syrian tanks rolled past the wreckage of past confrontations and gunfire echoed. The street battles and demonstrations come as the United Nations and the Arab League continue to press the government of President Bashar al-Assad to allow monitors or observers on the ground. The regime continues to resist those calls -- as it maintains the conflict is with armed terrorists and its own security forces and supporters are the victims. In a rare interview this week with a U.S. television network, al-Assad said he is not responsible for the crackdown. The nation's military forces ""are not my forces,"" al-Assad told ABC's Barbara Walters. CNN's Jim Clancy reported from Beirut, Lebanon.","An agitated man describes the death of a boy in Homs .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old Filipino-American boy abducted in July by suspected Islamic militants in the Philippines is free, officials said. Kevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without offering additional details. ""It was a tough time. It was a tough five months,"" Kevin's father, Heiko, told CNN affiliate WSET, from the family home in Lynchburg, Virginia. ""I'm just so happy."" Heiko Lunsmann said the boy had plotted his escape for a while and eventually seized the opportunity some time late last week while his guards slept. He ""was spotted alone"" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said. Army officials turned him over to American forces in the southern Mindanao region, the Philippine government said in a statement to CNN affiliate TV 5. The Philippine Inquirer quoted the Lamitan city mayor, Roderick Furigay, as saying Kevin walked for two days, surviving on candies his captors presumably gave him and on coconuts that he retrieved by climbing trees. ""In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations,"" Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement. ""If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal,"" Thomas added. Fourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The abductors forced them to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan. Kevin's mother was released by her captors in October. Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency. Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants. Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings. Basilan's governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency. ""The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings,"" the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying. Thomas, the U.S. ambassador, said the crime will not go ""unpunished."" Gerfa Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen. Both she and the son, Kevin, are U.S. passport holders. Kevin's father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape, but did not say when. ""I can tell you a lot of things, but I only know that he is a hero,"" he said.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- A three-judge panel will hear motions Thursday on whether a federal court decision to invalidate a ban on same-sex marriages in California should be overturned because the judge was gay and in a long-term relationship. Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker -- who has since retired -- overturned the voter-approved measure known as Proposition 8 after a two-week trial in 2010, saying gay and lesbian couples were unfairly denied the right to marry. In June, District Court Judge James Ware upheld the ruling by his former colleague. ""It is not reasonable to presume that a judge is incapable of making an impartial decision about the constitutionality of a law, solely because, as a citizen, the judge could be affected by the proceedings,"" Ware ruled. Ware, based in San Francisco, backed the original ruling by Walker that the ban on same-sex marriage in the state was unconstitutional -- a violation of equal protection. Also at Thursday's hearing, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear a motion to release the trial video. The 9th Circuit, in a hearing about a year ago, indicated it was inclined to toss out Prop 8. Both sides of the dispute acknowledge the issue of same sex-marriage is likely headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, perhaps within the coming year.","A judge ruled the law unconstitutional and later revealed he was gay .

"Liege, Belgium (CNN) -- Flowers, teddy bears and candles mark the spot Wednesday where a gunman tossed grenades into a crowded Liege market square a day before, claiming several lives and wounding scores more. The mood in Place St. Lambert, a square which would normally be bustling with Christmas shoppers, was somber Wednesday as Belgians took stock of an attack unprecedented in their history. Workers at the Christmas market opened up their stalls, housed in wooden cabins, but trade was slow. One woman said they had been told they could start trading later, if they wanted first to pay tribute to the five people killed and 130 wounded before the attacker, Liege resident Nourdine Amrani, apparently took his own life. Market stall holder Julie Six-Bourgoin was still shaking as she talked about Tuesday's attack, calling it ""horrible"" and comparing its effect on the peaceful country to that of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Other people in the city said that Christmas would not be the same and that they could not understand why the attack occurred. Officials say Amrani, 33, who had no record of mental illness, hurled his three grenades and fired a pistol and semi-automatic weapon from an elevated walkway above a bus stop in the square. The attack seemed to have left the city's people with a new sense of vulnerability, with those waiting for buses Wednesday standing back under the walkway, as if to protect themselves from another aerial assault. Chunks missing from a granite wall testified to the ferocity of the grenade blasts, with bullet holes also pocking the hard surface. One mother who was a few yards away from the gunman when he opened fire said she now feared for the safety of her children. Another recounted how her children had left school early and passed through the bus stop only shortly before it was attacked, narrowly avoiding the tragedy. In a restaurant, near-silence replaced the usual hubbub, as people appeared to withdraw into themselves, reflecting on the tragedy just a day earlier. So far, public anger over the attack seems limited. Few questions have yet been asked about how a man convicted of weapons offenses was able to get his hands on guns and grenades. The owner of one of the city's two main gun stores, which appeared to stock dozens of automatic-style weapons, said he knew Amrani but refused to answer further questions. Police are investigating whether Amrani bought the weapons used in the attack on the black market, said Katrin Delcourt, spokeswoman for the provincial governor's office. She said Amrani, who held a French hunting license under which he bought at least one firearm before his 2008 conviction, was skilled in using and maintaining weapons. A woman, said to be a cleaner in her late 40s, was found dead in a residence next to a workshop where Amrani once grew marijuana, local police said. But he seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the area. Neighbors of Amrani who spoke to CNN said they had seldom seen him around. One man said he had realized Amrani was a neighbor only after recognizing his picture in a newspaper. Amrani, a Belgian citizen, had been released from prison on conditional parole in October 2010 but returned to the attention of police in November this year. He had been asked to attend a police interview on the day of the attack in connection with allegations of sexual offenses, the Liege prosecutor said. So far, public scrutiny has not yet turned to why he was not arrested and brought in for questioning, given his track record. But as the city's shock fades and investigations continue into what led him to launch his deadly gun and grenade rampage, such questions will likely come to the forefront. CNN's Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","Residents of Liege say they are shocked by the attack and fear for their children's safety .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina man was arrested on suspicion of attempting to carry explosives through a security checkpoint at an airport in Midland, Texas, federal authorities said. Trey Scott Atwater of Hope Mills was taken into federal custody Saturday morning after Transportation Security Administration agents spotted what they described as a suspicious item. The item was in his carry-on during X-ray screening at a security checkpoint at Midland International Airport, FBI spokesman Mark Morgan said in a statement. Neither the FBI nor the TSA identified the explosives, though a Midland spokeswoman said the items were ""wrapped in military grade wrapping"" and are in the possession of the Midland Police Department. ""At no time was there any danger to the people at Midland International Airport or the community of Midland, Texas,"" Morgan said. The airport terminal was temporarily evacuated while authorities ""conducted a sweep, and deemed all clear,"" said Tasa Watts, the city spokeswoman.

"Erbil, Iraq (CNN) -- Along the road in the semi-autonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan frozen oil bleeds out of the rock face. For Todd Kozel, CEO of the independent oil and gas exploration and production company Gulf Keystone, it was an irresistible lure at the time few were daring to invest in Kurdistan. But not all is well in Kurdistan and old arguments with Baghdad over oil power and revenue are likely to loom large as U.S. forces withdraw from the country. Kozel says Kurdistan offers opportunity. ""To be able to compete with majors we have to be able to go places and do things and try to find opportunities that are unconventional,"" he says. ""After that first visit, I never looked back. After visiting Kurdistan in June of 2006 and literally seeing oil running down rocks at a road cut, I was just fascinated. I had to be here and I had to participate."" At the site where it all began, Shaikhan 1, drill manager Michael Chisnall remembers the day they realized they had hit it big. ""As we carried on the drilling process it was one of those things where I use to say to Todd or send an email everyday with an operational update that we have a big problem. We just cannot stop finding oil."" Initially they had estimated the Shaikhan field held about a billion barrels of oil. ""It's turned out to be something that we never would have dreamed, that it would be this size. It's now an oil field of 8-13.5 billion barrels and that's one of the largest oil fields covered in this part of the world in history,"" Kozel says. The risk he took turned out to be well worth the reward. ""Our market capital was 45 million pounds (about $70 million) in August of 2009. Our market cap right now is 1.6 billion pounds as a result of the Shaikhan discovery."" Others have been just as intoxicated by the potential that Kurdistan holds. Oil rigs are mushrooming all over the hills, on the outskirts of cities. The exploration is entirely driven by and reliant on foreign companies able to shoulder the risk. Exxon Mobil, the first of the majors, recently signed its own deal for six plots. It was a deal that elated the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) but it left the central government in Baghdad fuming as oil once again ended up mired in Iraqi politics. The KRG signs profit sharing deals, much to the ire of Baghdad -- which only signs service contracts and views the KRG deals as illegal and unconstitutional. Iraq still doesn't have a hydrocarbons -- or oil and gas -- law. While both sides agree that some revenues are funneled back to the central government, the dispute is over power and authority to sign contracts and the type of contract. Both sides are so far unable to come to an agreement, and Baghdad blacklists any company that signs a deal with the KRG. On December 5, the Iraqi Cabinet approved a revised draft budget for 2012 of 117 trillion dinars ($100 billion), government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement released on Thursday. Projected income estimates exports of 2.6 million barrels of oil per day including 175,000 barrels a day from the Kurdish Autonomous Region. The heightened tensions manifested themselves at a recent oil and gas conference in the capital of Kurdistan, Erbil. The Prime Minister of the KRG, Barham Salih addressed the conference, emphasizing: ""I also say to our partners in Baghdad very clearly, Kurdistan has a constitutional right to develop its own oil resources."" Speaking on behalf of Baghdad, Moaffak al-Rubaei, former national security advisor slammed back calling the deal illegal, threatening to ban and sue the oil giant. ""In Baghdad some people view this contract to be targeting the federal government, to weaken the federal government and it has some political connotations."" But the Kurds will not be stopped. ""Development of oil resources in Kurdistan is a contribution to the Iraqi economy,"" Salih told CNN. ""But there is also one other factor. Our recent history is very instructive. There is no way that we will be dissuaded from our constitutional right to developing our resources and allow ourselves to ever again become hostages to the whims of some bureaucrats in Baghdad. We've been there before. Oil was used to strangle our people, to commit genocide."" In the late 1980s Saddam Hussein led a vicious Arabization campaign against the Kurds, forcibly displacing them from their homes and replacing them with Arabs. Entire villages were razed to the ground. Other places like Halabja were gassed with deadly chemical agents. There is a continuing territorial dispute between the region of Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq, which is under the command of the predominantly Shi'a Arab central government in Baghdad. The current Kurd-Arab tensions don't just center around land, but what's underneath it. Billions and billions of barrels of black gold are in disputed territories, like the oil rich city of Kirkuk, all of which lends to the volatility. The Kurds for their part are extremely worried about the vulnerable state that the U.S. is leaving Iraq in. ""There is one fundamental topic for Iraq, one fundamental challenge,"" Salih says. ""Where do you want to be 10 years from now? Would we want to risk another centralized dictatorship with access to oil resources and turn it into weapons and tear into the communities and the people of Iraq here again? Absolutely not."" Iraq's tantalizing oil wealth could very easily turn from a blessing into a curse.","Fight brewing over who has the rights to sign oil contracts for Iraq's Kurdish region .
Exxon Mobil signed a deal with the Kurdish regional government that Baghdad says is illegal .
Gulf Keystone says it is working an oil field of at least 8 billion barrels -- one of the largest oil fields covered in this part of the world .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people took to the streets Saturday in Moscow, braving bitterly cold weather to demand fair elections after what they claim were rigged results earlier this month that returned Vladimir Putin's party to power. The protest, organized primarily through social media and word of mouth, comes on the heels of an announcement by President Dmitry Medvedev of sweeping political reforms, an effort to address discontent following the December 4 parliamentary elections. The latest mass protest follows one earlier this month, when tens of thousands of people across Russia turned out to protest the election results that kept Putin's ruling United Russia party in power, albeit with a smaller majority. Police estimated crowds in Moscow at 25,000, while organizers said at least twice as many participated. The protests were considered -- among analysts and political observers -- the largest in Russia in the past two decades. Turnout at Saturday's protests was even greater, organizers said. Besides blasting election results, demonstrators spoke about the presidential vote scheduled next year, repeating a popular refrain: ""Russia without Putin."" Dozens of protesters were detained across Russia on Saturday, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Ten activists were held in St. Petersburg, 22 in Nizhny Novgorod, and about 20 in Barnaul, it said. Police put the number of protesters in central Moscow at 29,000, but organizers and RIA Novosti correspondents estimated the real number was several times higher, the news agency reported. Speaking this week before the newly elected parliament members in the Kremlin's St. George Hall, Medvedev proposed that Russia return to direct elections of regional governors; simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates; and establish a new editorially independent national public TV channel. Medvedev also called for lifting many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by his predecessor, Putin, Russia's current prime minister and a candidate in the March 2012 presidential elections. He also announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called for the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country. At the same time, he rejected widespread public criticism of the parliamentary elections, which critics say were marred by fraud and other irregularities, and blamed anti-Kremlin opposition figures for their ""attempts to manipulate the people and foment social discord."" ""We will not allow instigators and extremists to involve society in their reckless schemes, nor will we tolerate interference in our internal affairs from the outside,"" Medvedev said. ""Russia needs democracy, not chaos. We need to have a faith for the future and justice. It is a good sign that society is changing, and citizens are expressing their position more actively, setting legitimate demands to the authorities. It is a sign that our democracy is growing more mature."" Protest organizers said Medvedev, who announced the reforms during his fourth and final state-of-the-nation speech Thursday, failed to address what authorities are planning to do about the recent alleged voting fraud, as well as whether fair and free elections are guaranteed in the future.","NEW: Dozens of protesters are detained, RIA Novosti reports .

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Billy Graham is showing signs of improvement as he continues to recover from pneumonia in a North Carolina hospital, a spokeswoman for Asheville's Mission Hospital said Sunday. The 93-year-old Graham was admitted to the hospital Wednesday in stable condition. ""Doctors are encouraged by Mr. Graham's significant clinical progress, but have not yet set a date for discharge,"" hospital spokeswoman Merrell Gregory said in a statement. Gregory also reported progress in Graham's physical therapy, saying he is ""walking more in the private corridor outside his room."" Graham was visited over the weekend by his family, according to Gregory. He also watched on television his pastor deliver his regular Sunday sermon, she said. This is Graham's second bout with pneumonia this year. He was previously hospitalized for the infection in May. Graham, a resident of nearby Montreat, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents beginning with Harry S. Truman and is the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The Charlotte native has preached to untold millions over six decades, beginning his missionary work in 1944 when he started speaking at rallies for the Youth for Christ Campus Life ministry. Five years later, Graham was holding crusades in tents in downtown Los Angeles. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the crusades drew so many followers they were extended to seven. Graham's ""last crusade"" in June 2005 drew a total of 230,000 people. He described it as his last American crusade, but hedged his farewells during a poignant appearance in Corona Park in Queens, New York. ""We hope to come back again someday,"" Graham announced. ""I was asked in an interview if this was our last crusade and I said it probably is -- in New York. But I also said, 'I never say never.'

"(CNN) -- The picture says it all. Curtis D. Tucker was thrilled to receive a Farrah Fawcett poster for his 14th birthday in 1976. The shot of 14-year-old Curtis D. Tucker shows him unrolling one of his birthday treasures in 1976, mouth slightly agape and eyes intensely focused on the gift. The present was one he had fervently requested from his parents and a hot item for many a young, red-blooded male during that bicentennial year: a poster of Farrah Fawcett (then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors). ""I was a huge Farrah fan,"" said Tucker, now a cartoonist and entrepreneur living in Enid, Oklahoma. ""I had started collecting all of the magazines and pictures and I was basically pinning up every picture that came out of every magazine. Then along came that poster."" ""That poster"" reportedly became the best-selling of all time -- with more than 12 million copies sold -- and helped make Fawcett one of the last great pinups. A private funeral is scheduled Tuesday at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles, California, for the actress who died at the age of 62 from cancer. With her famously thick blond hair, red swimsuit, and smile as big and bright as the California sun, the actress was the epitome of the wholesome, all-American girl. ""She was full of life and so happy with that blond hair and that huge smile,"" said Tucker, who isn't sure if he still has the poster in his attic. ""Without that poster, I don't think she would have become what she was."" That freshness and beauty is what landed her poster on Tucker's, and countless others', bedroom walls. Maria Elena Buszek, the author of ""Pin-up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture,"" said pinups ""straddled the line between portraiture and pornography"" and included early stage actresses, the famed models of Alberto Vargas and the most famous pinup of all, Bettie Page. Fawcett has her place in pinup history, said Buszek, an assistant professor of art history at Kansas City Art Institute, School of Liberal Arts. ""The Farrah Fawcett poster really is one of the last iconic pinup images of the 20th century,"" Buszek said. ""By the 1970s, because of the sexual revolution and mores about sexuality becoming looser in the west, the pinup does start to become more nostalgic."" When the photo was taken, Fawcett had not yet become one of ""Charlie's Angels,"" the role which helped make her a star. She was instead better known for her commercials and ads, most notably -- and not surprisingly -- for Wella Balsam shampoo. Photographer Bruce McBroom shot the now iconic image and told Entertainment Weekly that the starlet was at the time a young innocent from Texas who did her own hair and makeup for the shoot. ""She had no idea of how beautiful and how attractive she was, I'm sure,"" McBroom recalled. ""She was just like apple-pie, girl-next-door kind of girl, and in all the years I knew her she never changed."" Now Fawcett's image, which was considered racy at the time, is a huge part of nostalgia. Ken Leicht, a manager of Hollywood Book and Poster Company in Los Angeles, said that before Fawcett's death, the poster was most in demand from production companies looking to stage the 1970s. ""That poster, that shot of her, is just one of the definitive images of that time,"" Leicht said. ""Most of the time with the posters, the teen girls are driving the market, and Farrah is probably one of the last ones that was for the guys."" Leicht said actresses today, with the exception of a few like Pamela Anderson, don't really opt to market themselves using posters anymore. iReport.com: Share your memories of Fawcett . Matt Delzell, group account director for marketing and promotions agency The Marketing Arm, said that eventually the pinup transitioned more into supermodel pictures with the likes of Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Elle MacPherson, as well as the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Fawcett had the crossover appeal that went beyond just being a model, Delzell said. ""The poster came along at a time when posters were popular and she had the right photographer and took the right photo,"" Delzell said. iReport.com: Fawcett's hairstyle was in high demand . It certainly was the right shot for cartoonist Curtis D. Tucker. He wasn't a big fan of ""Charlie's Angels,"" he said, so he wasn't that distressed when Fawcett left after only a year. After all, he was still able to keep her close. ""The poster was something you had at home that you could look at every day,"" said Tucker, who kept the image up for several years. ""I collected a few other pictures of some of the other Angels, but there wasn't anybody else after Farrah. She was the last.""","Iconic poster of Farrah Fawcett reportedly best-selling of all time .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News, coming to you from Atlanta, Georgia, where we saw some unseasonal snowflakes over the weekend...in Georgia! Some parts of the country, though, are dealing with much worse conditions than we are. First Up: Winter Weather . AZUZ: Especially the midwestern U.S. A powerful snowstorm plowed through that part of the country over the weekend. Parts of Wisconsin got more than a foot and a half of snow, the state's governor declaring a state of emergency for more than 70 counties. What that does is help free up emergency workers and resources to help deal with it. Minnesota got hit pretty badly, too. In Minneapolis, the hometown Vikings were supposed to play an NFL game against the Giants yesterday. But this before-and-after picture shows you why that couldn't happen. That is the Metrodome, the Vikings' stadium. On the left is what the roof is supposed to look like. On the right: what it looked like yesterday. The roof caved in! This is a dome that's held up by air pressure. And after it got more than 17 inches of snow, just too much extra weight caused it to fail. Some workers were up on top, trying to shovel off the snow. They're not sure how long it's gonna take for the building to open back up. The Vikings game got moved back until tonight, and it'll be played in Detroit. Holiday Wreath Laying . CORAL VIDAL, FORTMAN, MARYLAND: I took my time and then, after I laid the wreath, I said thank you for your service. And I think it's just awesome being here laying these wreaths. JOHN ROYSTER, WEST POINT, VIRGINIA: I read whose name was there and their dates and said a thank you. These are men and women who have given the ultimate. All gave some, some gave all. AZUZ: Two of the hundreds of volunteers who helped lay wreaths on the gravesites of American troops at Arlington National Cemetery this weekend. It's a tradition that's been going on for nearly 20 years, and it happened at hundreds of other cemeteries across the country. I.D. Me . APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a West African nation located between Ghana and Liberia. I gained my independence from France in 1960. My official name is Côte d'Ivoire. Many people know me as Ivory Coast, and I'm home to around 21 million people. Political Crisis . AZUZ: Côte d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, is in the middle of a political crisis. After a run-off in the country's recent presidential election, both candidates -- the current president and one of his opponents -- declared victory. That's not gonna work. The heads of other West African countries say the idea of two leaders just isn't for Côte d'Ivoire. Christian Purefoy gets us up to speed on the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT, LAGOS: Sworn in as President of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo stands defiant. The Ivorian people did not elect him president, says the international community. This man, Alassane Ouattara, who has also sworn himself in, is the true president, according to the independent electoral commission . U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: We are in full agreement that Alassane Ouattara is the rightfully-elected president of Cote d'Ivoire, and that former President Laurent Gbagbo should respect the results of the election and peacefully transfer power to his successor. PUREFOY: Since the election results were announced this month, there has been a dangerous stalemate in Ivory Coast, a standoff threatening to degenerate into civil war. In the early 1990s, Cote d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, was the economic powerhouse of West Africa and attracted immigrants from across the region. But as that economic success began to falter, people in the south of the country turned on what they saw as immigrants in the north. And in 2002, the country was split by civil war. But now, it seems that weeks of regional and international pressure are forcing Gbagbo to the negotiating table. LAURENT GBAGBO, INCUMBENT PRESIDENT OF IVORY COAST [TRANSLATED]: There's no war, and we need to sit down and talk. If there's a problem, we'll talk about it. But men don't hold discussions when things are still hot. They wait for things to cool down to start. So when it'll cool down, we'll talk. So, there won't be a war. I thank you for all that you have done for the Ivory Coast. We are together and the problems you see now, we will resolve them. PUREFOY: Whatever the discussions, other influential West African leaders say a unity government that includes both leaders is unacceptable. GOODLUCK JONATHAN, PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA: It's immediate, it's immediate. Elections have been declared, somebody has won, so he has to hand over. PUREFOY: But talks do not mean action, and for now, the uneasy standoff between the two presidents continues. Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria. (END VIDEO) Climate Conference . AZUZ: Okay, from Africa, we're heading over to Cancun, Mexico, where a two-week conference on climate change ended with an agreement. Representatives from around the world came up with a plan that Mexico's president is calling the start of ""a new era of cooperation in climate change."" Among other things, the agreement will create a $100 billion fund to help developing countries deal with climate change. You see a lot of people clapping here, but not everyone likes this deal. The government of Bolivia says the agreement won't be effective. And Bolivia claims that wealthier nations bullied other countries into accepting the deal. This Day in History . [ON SCREEN GRAPHIC] .

December 13, 2007 -- The Mitchell Report on the use of performance enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball is released . Blog Repot . AZUZ: In Memphis, Tennessee, a school's trying to get students to pull up their saggy pants by giving teachers zip ties that they'll use as belts on the students' pants. On our blog, 71 percent of you think the ""no saggy pants"" policy is a good idea. Lana likes it, but here's what she has a problem with: ""The wall of shame that shows photos of students with their pants hiked high."" Most of you don't agree with the photo board. Brandon says that low riding defines certain people, and adds ""if you don't like it, don't look at it."" And Robert argues, ""Teachers don't have the right to decide what students wear; it should be up to parents"". But Desiree writes that ""everywhere you turn, there are pants on the ground or someone's underwear showing."" She bets 80 percent of her school doesn't own a belt. Robby calls showing your underwear, ""gross. It would be so embarrassing if a girl saw your underwear."" And Katia calls saggy pants very unattractive, saying, ""I know I don't wanna see boxers."" Add your comment at CNNStudentNews.com. Remember, it's first names only! Shoutout . SHELBY ERDMAN, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Williams' history classes at Canyon Vista Middle School in Austin, Texas! What is the name of this trophy? Is it the: A) Hart Trophy, B) Naismith Award, C) Heisman Trophy or D) Cy Young Award? You've got three seconds -- GO! You're looking at the Heisman Trophy, the award for the most outstanding college football player. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Heisman Winner . AZUZ: This year's Heisman Trophy winner is Cam Newton, the quarterback from Auburn University. He won the award on Saturday night. Newton has thrown or run for 48 touchdowns this year, leading Auburn to an undefeated season and a spot in the national championship game, and that's coming up in January. But he's also been the focus of some controversy. The NCAA ruled that Newton's father was involved in a pay-for-play scandal. Essentially, he told schools that they had to pay money for Cam to play football there. An NCAA investigation determined that neither Cam Newton nor Auburn knew what Cam's father was doing, so he's been cleared to play. Original Rules Sold . AZUZ: Just how important are the rules in sports? We're about to show you a set of rules that sold for more than $4 million! It's the ""Founding Rules of Basketball,"" written by the man who's considered the inventor of the game: James Naismith. It's a 119-year-old document that was auctioned off last Friday. In the original rules, players could pass the ball, but not run with it; there was no provision for dribbling. And there wasn't any physical contact. Things have, of course, changed a bit since then. The couple who bought the rules is hoping to donate them to Kansas University, where Naismith was a coach. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, competitions aren't always fun and games. But here's one that sure seems like it is. It's a robotics competition in Maine. But here's the catch: the robots have to be built from LEGOs. 350 students participate in the event. They had to use LEGOs to build robots that could complete a series of tasks. By watching it, you'd be pretty impressed. If we had to compete, I don't even know what kind of robot we'd design. Goodbye . AZUZ: There are a few ideas we could toy around with. Not gonna share any of them, though. After all, we wouldn't want to LEGO any of our secrets. Whoo!

"(CNN) -- The man Chilean authorities accuse of sparking a wildfire that has consumed more than 31,000 acres of a national park said Sunday that he is innocent. ""It is very important to me to say that this wasn't me (who started the fire). They dropped the case on me,"" Rotem Zinger told Israeli army radio. The 23-year-old Israeli national said he was surprised by the way the case against him has unfolded. ""I was not explained what I was accused of. I did not give a testimony. I did not confess. Things rolled out the wrong way through mistranslation. I never intended to admit the blame,"" he said. Zinger is accused of lighting a fire in a prohibited area of the protected Torres del Paine National Park in southern Chile, regional prosecutor Juan Agustin Melendez said. Prosecutors also accuse him of making the situation worse by not reporting to authorities that the fire got out of his control. If convicted, Zinger could face a fine and 41 to 60 days in prison, Melendez told CNN Chile. Zinger will be required to stay in the region during an investigation, the prosecutor said. Authorities will be looking into what caused the wildfire for months, Melendez said. Fierce flames have kept investigators from reaching the location where the fire started, he added. The wildfire has been burning since Tuesday. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blaze, but authorities have said they don't know when the fire will be under control. High winds stoke the flames for most of the week, though rains in the area Saturday gave firefighters some help. ""We could be talking about a week. We could be talking about a month or more,"" said Hugo Knockaert, chief of fire management for Chile's National Forest Corporation. CNN's Guy Azriel, Claudia Dominguez and CNN Chile contributed to this report.","""Things rolled out the wrong way through mistranslation,"" Rotem Zinger tells Israeli radio .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Amir Khan has lost his International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Association (WBA) world light-welterweight titles after a controversial split points decision defeat to American Lamont Peterson in their showdown at the Washington Convention Center. Khan was given the fight 115-110 on one of the judge's scorecards. However, the other two judges awarded local fighter Peterson the decision by scores of 113-112, enough for Khan to lose his belts. The result proved contentious with referee Joe Cooper twice deducting Khan a point for pushing, in the seventh and 12th rounds, decisions that ultimately turned the fight in Peterson's favor. A stunned Khan was clearly frustrated with the decision, saying in his post-fight interview: ""It was like I was fighting two people in the ring, the referee and Lamont. ""I can see why there hasn't been a big fight in Washington in the last 20 years, because of decisions like this,"" added 25-year-old Khan -- who suffered only his second defeat from 28 professional bouts. Meanwhile, Peterson, who improved to 30-1-1 after his win, said: ""A lot of people thought I was the underdog but I followed my game plan the entire time and it worked. ""It was a long road but all the hard work paid off for me and it couldn't have been a better night."" Khan dominated the early stages of the fight, knocking down the challenger with a fierce right hand with just 28 seconds remaining of the opening round. However, the fight began to harder to call as it progressed, and the moment when Khan was deducted a point for repeated pushing with his left forearm in round seven proved pivotal. ""Every time I tried to keep him away from me he kept coming in low,"" Khan continued. ""I was the cleaner fighter. He was either going to head butt me or push me all night and the referee wasn't giving me a chance.""","Lamont Peterson becomes the new world light-welterweight champion in Washington .

"(CNN) -- At least 16 people were killed by security forces across Syria Saturday as unrest there continued, a human rights organizations said. Three people were killed in the city of Homs, where a strong military presence was reported, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Another three were killed in Hama province. The Local Coordination Committee of Syria reported that Syrian security forces were storming the Damascus suburb of Zabadany and were shelling housing and positioning snipers. The group also announced, in a separate incident, the killing of Dr. Ibrahim Nahel Othman, who they described as ""one of the most important physicians in the Syrian Revolution."" He was killed by gunfire near the Turkish border, the group said. Another group, the Coalition of Free Damascus for Peaceful Change, said that the doctor was a wanted man because he performed many surgeries on wounded protesters. The reported deaths came amid tensions in Homs -- a center of regime arrests -- as military troops manned more than 60 checkpoints inside the city and surrounded it, according to the Syrian National Council, a leading opposition movement. A feared full-scale crackdown did not happen Saturday, but activists posted a video Saturday that they said showed the military harassing residents of Homs. Mourners on Friday went to bury a 10-year-old boy, Maher al-Husseini, who was allegedly killed by a sniper's bullet in his own home. The video shows the boy wrapped in a white sheet and carried by men in street towards a cemetery. Some of the men chant ""The martyrs blood will not be lost in vain,"" as the lifeless boy is carried. As the men walk towards the cemetery, gunfire can be heard. They get to the cemetery and start digging as gunfire continues to ring out. CNN could not independently confirm what was depicted in the videos. Western networks are not allowed inside the embattled country. The United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. The regime's actions have outraged world powers and sparked sanctions by the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The council said the Bashar al-Assad regime is ""driving violent sectarian incidents to justify this potential murder."" More than 30 corpses -- all thought to be victims of sectarian violence -- were found Monday in Homs. The city of Homs is in a province of the same name.","NEW: Prominent opposition doctor killed, groups say .

"(CNN) -- Kim Jong Il was a source of misery for North Korea's impoverished people and of fear for a world wary of his belligerent rhetoric -- but as an enduringly bizarre presence on the global stage, he was also an unexpected source of entertainment. While the reputedly ruthless leader was revered by a population weaned on propaganda, outside the hermetic Asian country what were seen as grandiose attempts at myth-making were seized on by popular culture. Online, Kim's death generated Twitter trends that referenced the movies or shows that caricatured him as a villainous clown trapped in the bathos of his own cruel isolation. Kim did little to help his own international image. His eccentric appearances sporting bouffant hair, over-sized sunglasses and a succession of drab boiler suits were frequently viewed as comical counterpoints to the rights abuses of his regime. Meanwhile, as his country's nuclear activities sparked diplomatic tensions, his media mouthpieces -- such as the Korean Central News Agency -- created their own unintentional humor as they swung wildly between angry invective and surreal flatteries of their ""Dear Leader."" Kim's defining moment in recent popular culture appears to have been his portrayal in the 2004 film ""Team America: World Police,"" a satire on U.S. President George W. Bush's foreign policy. The film's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone paint the dictator as a foul-mouthed but misunderstood Bond villain whose plans for global chaos are constantly frustrated by incompetent underlings or bothersome international officials. In the hours after his death, ""Team America"" references were trending on Twitter, particularly ""Hans Brix,"" a nod to puppet Kim's mispronunciation of Hans Blix, a real-life U.N. weapons inspector who, in the film, is fed to Kim's man-eating sharks. Another key ""Team America"" moment, when Kim ruefully bemoans his isolation in an opulent palace by singing about how he is lonely -- or ""ronrey"" -- was also being heavily referenced on social media. Parker and Stone were no strangers to Kim-based satire. Their ""South Park"" cartoon series cast him as part of a villainous gang that included Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and, incongruously, magician David Blaine. In an appearance on media satire ""30 Rock,"" comedian Margaret Cho played Kim as a North Korean weatherman, delivering the disingenuously upbeat forecast: ""North Korea, everything sunny all the time always, good time, beach party."" Fellow comic Bobby Lee plays the dictator as host of the ""Kim Jong Il Show"" on MADtv, shooting dead audience members who fail to cheer and delivering punchlines such as: ""Don't cry because I kill your wife and enslave your children."" Post-death, there was renewed interest in websites that have sought to highlight the strange picture of North Korea created by its propaganda machine. ""Kim Jong-Il Looking at Things,"" is an online gallery of photographs showing the dictator staring at banal objects. The images draw unintentional bleak humor from their repeated and blatant misrepresentation of life under a dictatorship. Among recent entries, Kim can be seen looking at a pink sweater, pointing at a persimmon tree in full fruit, glumly inspecting a statuette of knights on horseback and grinning at a supermarket shelf packed with sausages. Another website has trawled news bulletins on the official Korean Central News Agency to create a ""random insult generator"" that neatly encapsulates the peculiar version of the English language favored by Kim's regime. As regular KCNA watchers can confirm, typical generator exhortations such as ""You bourgeois stooge,"" and ""You reckless human scum, you will be dealt a thousandfold retaliatory blow!"" are eerily close to the real thing.","Kim Jong Il leaves behind an unlikely legacy in popular culture .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities on Saturday identified a gunman killed by police after he opened fire at passing vehicles along a downtown street in Hollywood. But they said they don't know why Tyler Brehm, 26, went on a surreal shooting rampage captured on amateur video Friday. The video shows Brehm walking down Sunset Boulevard, wielding a handgun and firing at vehicles, seemingly at random. Brehm fired a ""significant number"" of rounds, wounding three, police said. He then returned to an intersection, where he was confronted by a plainclothes police detective and an off-duty police officer working on a nearby movie set, officials said. ""At that point the police ordered him to drop his weapon and he pointed his gun at the police and an officer-involved shooting occurred,"" police spokeswoman Sgt. Mitzi Fierro said on CNN. Brehm died at a nearby hospital, a police statement said. Christopher Johns filmed much of the five-minute scene from his apartment window and can be heard shouting at Brehm throughout. ""Why don't you come up here?"" he yelled, later describing that he intended to distract the gunman. ""If people down there at point-blank range to the shooter were going to get shot, they were helpless to avoid being killed,"" Johns told CNN. ""Me, I'm four stories up. If I can take any of his attention and divert it towards me ... I would have an opportunity to get out of the way."" ""I'm screaming anything I can"" in an effort to disrupt the shooting, Johns said. At one point, Brehm spoke with Johns, asking him for ammunition and to call an ambulance. Fierro said it appeared Johns could interact with the suspect without jeopardizing his safety. ""It appears from the video that he was able to distract the suspect and keep him from shooting at additional people before the police arrived,"" she said. Police have contacted Brehm's family back east and are talking to acquaintances. ""So far we haven't been able to piece together really why he did it,"" Fierro told CNN Saturday evening. Three people were injured during Friday's incident, including one man in silver Mercedes-Benz sedan who was shot multiple times in the face and upper torso, Fierro said. Two others suffered minor injuries. The current status of the man in the car was unknown Saturday. ""We're very fortunate that more people weren't injured during this incident,"" Fierro said. Witnesses were stunned by the shooting rampage. ""A car drove by and he just shot right into the car,"" Amy Torgeson told CNN affiliate KABC. ""He was just shooting everywhere."" Torgeson said vehicles began ""swerving and braking,"" and she sought cover at a nearby bank.","NEW: Police don't know why man fired from street .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have identified three of the four women found dead this month in two incidents in Detroit, an investigator with the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday. Three of the women have been linked to a website that accepts ads for escort services, police have said. In the latest case, one of the two women found early Christmas Day in the trunk of a car that had been set afire was identified as Vernithea McCrary, 28, the investigator said. The second victim remains unidentified, said the investigator, who asked not to be identified because he is not allowed to speak on the record to the news media. The bodies of two other women found December 19 have been identified as Demesha Hunt, 24, and Renisha Landers, 23. They were found in the trunk of Landers' Chrysler 300. Causes of death for the four women were pending toxicology results, which typically take six to eight weeks to be completed, the investigator said. The process of identification can be difficult. ""People hear of someone that is discovered that we bring down here and they call down here and inform us that someone is missing,"" the investigator said. ""They give us a description and then they come down if they can be viewed and are recognizable. If not, we ask them to bring a set of dental records for comparison."" The deaths are being treated as the work of one person or group of people, Detroit's police chief said Tuesday. ""At this point, we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects,"" Chief Ralph L. Godbee told CNN. ""There are too many common links for us not to, at this point, work this as one single investigation."" Among those links, he said, is the fact that three of the women had placed online ads dealing with ""prearranged adult dating services"" and posted on backpage.com, Godbee told reporters Monday. ""We felt it is imperative to alert the public that deciding to meet unknown persons via the Internet can be extremely dangerous,"" Godbee said. But a lawyer for backpage.com, Steve Suskin, said it was not clear that his company's website was involved. ""Our team has already provided the police with detailed information about the ads that the suspect or others posted on numerous web sites. Law enforcement authorities now have evidence that the investigation appears to connect to at least 30 different ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites, separate and distinct from ours,"" Suskin said. ""We are not aware of the existence of any evidence that would indicate which of these many sites were used by the suspect to establish contact with his victims."" Backpage representatives have been cooperating with police, the police chief said. Postings on the escort section of the website cost $1. Referring to the advertisements on the website as ""borderline prostitution,"" Godbee said that his priorities lie elsewhere. ""Right now, we want to get to the bottom of how these four individuals passed away, and who had a hand in their demise,"" he said.","One of the two bodies found Christmas Day has been identified .

"Washington (CNN) -- Voices recorded by inventor Alexander Graham Bell more than 125 years ago are being heard now, thanks to digital imaging technology. ""It's not high fidelity, but you can definitely figure out what they're saying,"" said Carl Haber of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of the scientists working on the project in a laboratory at the Library of Congress. The early audio recordings were made during an intensely competitive time, when scientists were racing to improve on Thomas Edison's phonograph, which was invented in 1877. Scientists like Bell, who worked at his Volta Laboratory in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, were looking to improve both the quality of the phonograph and the nature of the sound to make the product commercially viable. ""I think this is a very critical episode in the history of American invention and innovation and it highlights an otherwise unknown aspect of Washington, D.C., at the end of the 19th century as the center of invention and innovation,"" said Carlene Stephens, curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Bell sent recordings to the Smithsonian in the 1880s for safekeeping, and to prove his scientific finds in case of patent questions. But there was no playback device, so ""the collection has been silent,"" said Stephens. Enter modern-day scientists Haber and Earl Cornell, who took detailed photos of the discs made in Bell's laboratory and created a virtual playback machine on a computer. ""To be or not to be, that is the question,"" begins one of the recordings from a green wax disc that scientists believe was recorded in 1885. The male voice reading the famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet is muddled, but understandable. On a glass disc recording from 1884, a voice can be heard saying the word ""barometer"" several times. And on another type of wax recording from 1885, a man is heard reading a description of a cotton factory in New Hampshire. To get the audio from the discs, the Berkeley scientists put them on a turntable. As the disc slowly turned, as many as 18,000 images per rotation were recorded in the computer. The images were then stacked up to create a digital profile, which, when read by the computer, played back the sound. ""These technologies are very fast and these computers are fast,"" said Haber. ""Ten years ago, we would be struggling with computer storage and computer speed. Today, commercial technology is up to this task."" There is no physical contact with the historically valuable discs, which helps to protect them for the long term. The scientists in the 1880s experimented with a variety of experimental mechanisms, many of which the Smithsonian has in their collection. Each disc or cylinder plays differently. ""It turns out this record was designed to play from the inside-out, so that's backwards from how we normally play a record,"" said Haber, showing reporters the disc. After the Berkeley Lab scientists had photographed that record, they reversed the information in the computer to play it. Although the scientists at Bell's Volta Laboratory would have been working on a playback device as they were making the recordings, none of those made it into the Smithsonian's archives. Three times during the 1880s, Bell sent sealed tin boxes to the Smithsonian Institution with objects and newspapers to prove that his laboratory had made certain discoveries by certain dates in case a patent dispute arose. None ever did. The sealed boxes were opened for the first time in 1937 in the presence of Bell's family. Bell also donated materials to the Smithsonian during the early 1900s, when he served on the governing board of the museum. Those items, along with materials from Emile Berliner, a competitor of Bell, are stored at the National Museum of American History. Berliner is credited with inventing the gramophone, the first commercially successful disc and playback machine. The museum has about 400 early audio recordings made between 1878 and 1898.","Bell was working on improving the phonograph .

"London (CNN) -- Three one-time insiders at the defunct News of the World tabloid testified Monday before a British government-backed panel investigating press ethics and behavior. Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck -- who has been arrested in connection with a police probe into phone hacking -- said he would not talk about illegal eavesdropping because of the arrest. He has not been charged. He appeared at the Leveson Inquiry after the paper's most famous undercover reporter, Mazher Mahmoud, known as the ""fake sheikh"" for the disguise he often adopted to get stories. He described doing stories on prostitution and drug dealing, but insisted repeatedly the tabloid ""never engaged in entrapment."" He defended his methodology, saying criminals had gone to prison because of his work. ""Exposing criminality gives me great satisfaction,"" said Mahmoud, whose appearance was not televised in order to protect his identity. But he said he had never heard about phone hacking by the News of the World until royal reporter Clive Goodman was arrested for it in 2006. The inquiry was prompted by widespread public outrage this summer at the revelation that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered 13-year-old girl in 2002. Murdoch's son James, the chief executive of the News Corporation subsidiary that published the tabloid, has repeatedly denied knowing about the scale of illegal eavesdropping at his papers. James Murdoch ordered the paper shut down over the scandal. Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis also testified Monday. Like Thurlbeck, he has been arrested and released on bail in a police investigation into phone hacking. He argued that Britain's downmarket tabloids were the ""ones that people out there want to read,"" and far outsold so-called quality papers such as the Guardian and the Times. A former News of the World journalist testified last month that the editors of the tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories. Paul McMullan named Andy Coulson, who went on to become an adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Rebekah Brooks, a Murdoch protege, as editors who were aware of the practice. Coulson resigned as editor of the tabloid in 2007 when Goodman went to prison for hacking the voice mails of Prince William's staff, and he later became Cameron's communications director. Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking, saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff. The Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures since last month, including celebrities such as ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling and actor Hugh Grant, both of whom complained about press intrusion into their lives. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. It involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely.","Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck refuses to talk about phone hacking .

"(CNN) -- Huge crowds assembled in Pyongyang on Thursday at a national memorial service for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the second day of state-orchestrated ceremonies to mourn the dictator who died earlier this month. The authoritarian regime used a mixture of somber music, hyperbolic speeches, booming artillery fire and blaring horns to honor the man who oversaw 17 years of despotic rule in the secretive nation. The ceremony took place a day after a funeral procession for Kim spent three hours winding through the snow-laden streets of Pyongyang lined with thousands of wailing mourners. Once again, the regime placed Kim Jong Un, the son and chosen successor of Kim Jong Il, at the center of proceedings, proclaiming him the ""supreme leader"" of North Korea -- a fresh indication that the leadership transition is progressing smoothly. The footage broadcast Thursday by North Korean state television showed thick rectangular blocks of people gathered in the snowy expanse of Kim Il Sung Square -- named after Kim Jong Il's father, the founder of North Korea. Kim Jong Un and other senior members of the regime stood solemnly on a viewing platform overlooking the square. During the ceremony, a string of top officials took to the microphone to praise Kim Jong Il's life and reinforce Kim Jong Un's leadership credentials. ""Kim Jong Un is the supreme leader who has inherited Kim Jong Il's beliefs, leadership, courage and guts,"" said Kim Yong Nam, the president of the North Korean parliament. Read about the funeral for Kim Jong Il . ""Kim Jong Il's great achievements will shine forever,"" said Kim Ki Nam, a senior official in the powerful Worker's Party. ""Following our party's supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, we are converting our sadness to courage and we will achieve great things."" Under Kim Jong Il, the country suffered a devastating famine even as it built up its million-strong army, expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world's eighth declared nuclear power. He died on December 17, reportedly from a heart attack. News of his death, announced two days later, put the region on edge and set off speculation around the world about the country's stability and future direction. For the time being, Kim Jong Un appears to be rallying support within the regime, despite his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience. After the speeches Thursday, a row of heavy guns fired off a salute. Then, a cacophony of horns and sirens went off, drawing the service -- and the last day of official mourning -- to a close. CNN's Tim Schwartz contributed to this report.","Artillery fire and blaring horns commemorate Kim Jong Il's life .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin accused U.S. drones and special forces of involvement in the death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in comments Thursday. He also attacked U.S. Sen. John McCain over a warning that Russia might follow the same path as Libya, suggesting McCain was not of sound mind following his time as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Putin's comments were prompted by a question during his traditional year-end question-and-answer program, broadcast live by state media. Responding to a question about McCain purportedly predicting Putin would meet the same fate as Libya's leader, the Russian prime minister described the televised images of Gadhafi's final moments as ""horrible, disgusting scenes"" and pointed to U.S. involvement in his death. ""Is that democracy? Who did this? Drones, including those of the U.S., struck his motorcade and then commandos, who were not supposed to be there, called for the so-called opposition and militants by the radio, and he was killed without an investigation or trial,"" Putin said. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta acknowledged the day after Gadhafi's death that ""it was a U.S. drone combined with the other NATO planes that fired on the convoy"" in which the Libyan leader was traveling outside the city of Sirte. But the Pentagon has denied that any U.S. forces were on the ground in a combat role in Libya. When asked about McCain, Putin said he had met the senator from Arizona, but said the questioner's description of him as the prime minister's friend was ""exaggerated."" He then questioned the mental state of McCain, who ran for U.S. president in 2008, saying he ""was taken prisoner in Vietnam, and was held not just in jail, but was put in a pit where he was kept for several years -- any person under those circumstances would hardly remain mentally sane."" Shortly afterward, McCain himself jumped into the row via Twitter, posting: ""Dear Vlad, is it something I said?"" and linking to a news story headlining the Russian prime minister calling McCain ""nuts."" The senator's earlier Twitter posts had linked to news stories suggesting Russia might be in line for its own version of the ""Arab Spring"" but did not appear to suggest Putin would meet the same fate as Gadhafi. Putin's attack may be a response to critical comments made by McCain in the U.S. Senate last week. McCain said his statement was a response to ""the flawed Duma election that just occurred this weekend, and in light of my strong belief that the growing demand for dignity and uncorrupt governance that has defined the Arab world this year may impact Russia as well."" McCain highlighted ""the unfortunate issue of Russia's continued back-sliding on human rights and democracy"" and said the post-election protests were unsurprising given ""the pattern of corruption and abuse that the Russian government has perpetrated over many years."" He also criticized Russia's ""absolutely shameless"" blocking of U.N. Security Council action on President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, despite widespread concerns over human rights abuses there. ""The demand for dignity, and justice, and democracy that is shaking the Arab world to its foundations will not be confined to that one region alone,"" he said, but will spread and demonstrate that change is possible. ""And it appears that message may be resonating with people in Russia,"" he added. In his televised remarks, Putin suggested that criticism of Russia was linked to its pursuit of ""an independent foreign policy."" While his country had more friends than enemies in Europe, he said, ""some would like to sideline Russia so that it doesn't get in the way of those wanting to dominate the globe."" Putin's latest comments come a week after he blamed the United States for encouraging opposition protests in the wake of Russia's parliamentary elections. He said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had criticized the elections as ""neither fair not free -- even before receiving reports from international observers."" This had sent a signal to opposition figures, Putin said, who ""with the support of the U.S. State Department"" then began ""active work."" Clinton responded to those remarks by restating her country's ""strong commitment to democracy and human rights."" CNN's Phil Black in Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.","NEW: McCain criticized Russia's ""back-sliding on human rights and democracy"" last week .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United and their city rivals Manchester City both made embarrassing exits from the European Champions League on Wednesday. United were beaten 2-1 in Basel to leave the Swiss side and Benfica as the qualifiers from Group C, while City beat Bayern Munich 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium but went out as Napoli won 2-0 at Villarreal. It left Bayern and the Italians to go through from Group A to complete a chastening first experience of Europe's top club competition for Robert Mancini's expensively assembled side. But it was the exit of last year's runners-up United which was the biggest upset, needing only a draw to ensure their passage to the last 16, goals from Marco Streller and Alexander Frei sent them crashing. Real Madrid to topple Barca in 'El Clasico' clash? Phil Jones pulled one back in the 89th minute to set up a frantic finale but they could not force the equalizer. Streller's goal after nine minutes came as a result of defensive uncertainty with goalkeeper David De Gea parrying out a cross which fell invitingly for the scorer. Wayne Rooney wasted United best chance to level and Markus Steinhofer belted the ball against his own crossbar in the second half before Frei nipped in to head home the crucial second goal in the 84th minute. It was the first time Alex Ferguson's men had failed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League for six years and only the third time in 16 years. ""Of course we're disappointed, there's no other way you can feel,"" Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""It's part of football. You have to deal with the disappointment, and this club has used it as motivation many times.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors are investigating police actions during a protest earlier this month in which at least 16 people died, the Office of the General Prosecutor in Kazakhstan said Thursday. At least 80 people were also injured in the December 16 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the oil town of Zhanaozen, according to state media. A 20-day state of emergency was declared following the unrest, which also spilled over to a nearby village, where at least one person died as protesters blocked a passenger train in a show of support for the oil workers. A spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Virginie Coulloudon, said Kazakhstan had told fellow OSCE states Tuesday that the general prosecutor's office had started its own inquiry into police actions. Kazakh authorities said the internal security department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs had also launched an in-house investigation into claims of firearms use by the police, Coulloudon said. ""The conclusions of this investigation, according to Kazakh sources, should be available within a week,"" she told CNN via email. The Kazakh general prosecutor's office said in a statement on its website Thursday that 20 people had been detained over involvement in the unrest in Zhanaozen, with 18 of the arrests ordered by the court. A criminal case was opened Tuesday into the alleged excessive use of force by police who opened fire, it said, but some of the deaths reported from Zhanaozen were not related to the actions of law enforcement. The investigation will be headed by a special prosecutor in order to guarantee its objectivity and measures have been adopted to ensure transparency, the statement said. A separate committee has also been formed, with relatives of those detained among its members, to examine claims of unlawful detention and abuse of detainees, it said. At least one person is being investigated for giving ""false information"" to the media about events in Zhanaozen, the prosecutor's office added. The trouble came as the former Soviet republic celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence and prompted concern that unrest might spread across the oil rich Central Asian nation. The protest was part of a long-running dispute over low pay and the sacking of some workers. Video posted to YouTube appeared to show protesters in Zhanaozen fleeing a large square amid gunfire, as police advance with riot shields. An injured person is seen being beaten with a baton by what appears to be a policeman. The workers' trade union puts the number of dead at 50 to 70 and says as many as 500 were injured, according to European lawmakers. International rights groups have condemned the violence and subsequent emergency measures imposed by the government, including curbs on communications and freedom of movement, and called for a full investigation. The U.S. State Department and a group of 48 European lawmakers also expressed concern. The Kazakh authorities announced Wednesday that 1 million Kazakh tenge ($6,640) would be paid to the families of each of those killed and half that sum to those injured. Analysts say the Kazakh government is keen to prevent discontent over increasing social inequality, in a country where most ordinary people have not shared in the wealth brought by oil. Parliamentary and local elections are due to take place next month. Kazakhstan has often boasted of its stability in a region that has seen its share of conflict. The ninth-largest country in the world by area, it has the largest economy of all the Central Asian states thanks mostly to its natural resources, according to the CIA World Factbook.

"(CNN) -- The bodies of 11 more people have been recovered after the weekend collapse of a Russian oil rig in freezing north Pacific waters, a Russian news agency reported Monday. That brings the total number of dead from the Sunday disaster to 16, according to the state news agency RIA-Novosti. There were 67 people aboard the offshore drilling rig when it capsized during a storm in the Sea of Okhotsk, which lies between the Kamchatka peninsula and the Russian mainland, north of Japan. The rig was being towed from Kamchatka at the time, RIA-Novosti reported. Fourteen people have been rescued and 37 others remain missing, the news agency said. The director of the company that owns the rig, Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, promised at least 3 million rubles ($93,640) in compensation to each crewmember's family. The rig was carrying out work under a contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom, the news agency said. It was drilling a well about 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) deep, RIA-Novosti said. Taimuraz Kasayev, a spokesman for the regional emergencies service, told RIA-Novosti on Sunday the accident poses no environmental danger because the rig's fuel stocks were hermetically sealed and would not spill. The television channel Russia Today reported that the rig was being towed into position when pumps failed, causing it to take on water and sink.","NEW: The bodies bring the death toll to 16 .

"(CNN) -- Baseball legend Barry Bonds is scheduled to be sentenced Friday for his obstruction of justice conviction. The hearing at 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET) will take place in a San Francisco federal courtroom less than two miles from the ballpark where Bonds broke Hank Aaron's major league home run record in August 2007. Federal prosecutors want Bonds, 47, to serve 15 months in prison, according to a sentencing memo filed in court earlier this month. Defense lawyers argued in their filing that the judge should accept the probation office's recommendation that Bonds be sentenced to two years' probation, fined $4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service. Jurors who found Bonds guilty in April said he was ""evasive"" in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes. ""Because Bonds's efforts were a corrupt, intentional effort to interfere with that mission, a sentence of 15 months imprisonment is appropriate,"" the prosecution said in its memo to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston. But jurors, who were deadlocked on three perjury counts, said that it was not proven that Bonds lied when he testified that he had not knowingly used steroids. Prosecutors decided not to pursue a retrial. Prosecutors still argued in the sentencing memo that Bonds' denial that he was ""taking steroids and human growth hormone were patently false."" Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of the investigation that targeted Bonds' personal trainer Greg Anderson and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO). The testimony that led to Bonds' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds if Anderson ever gave him ""anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with."" Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors ""ever touch me,"" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson. Defense lawyers argued that Bonds thought the creams and ointments Anderson was giving him were made of flax seed oils. Sentences for other athletes convicted in connection with the BALCO investigation have not included prison time. CNN's Greg Morrison and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Federal prosecutors want baseball legend to serve 15 months in prison .

"(CNN) -- So you want to become a pro golfer. The top players rake in millions of dollars each year, and you want a piece of the action. Whether you're a promising five-year-old, an amateur trying to make the next step or a professional seeking to kickstart your career, the best way forward is generally to work with the people who've been there and done that. They might not always be cheap, but golf academies offer training techniques that have taken the likes of Tiger Woods, Lee Westwood and Ernie Els to the top of the tree. But fear not, CNN has some tips from one of the sport's leading instructors, David Leadbetter. There are three areas where beginner golfers struggle, he says. First off, you need to hold the club right. ""Most people grip the club too much in the palm of the hand, which creates tremendous tension and doesn't allow the wrist to work correctly,"" says Leadbetter, who helped Nick Faldo go from a nearly man to the winner of six major titles between 1987-1996. ""People who do this wear a hole in their glove. It's important to hold the club out towards the fingers, not the palm. It helps more golfers than you can believe."" Next, learn how to bow. ""So much of golf is based around how you set your foundations. It's really important that when golfers set up for the ball that instead of having slouchy round shoulders, pull your shoulders down, then your arms can actually get to your chest,"" the 59-year-old says. ""Almost like how the Japanese how bow: rear end out, slightly bend your knees, pull your shoulder blades down and arms resting in your chest, and you're in perfect position."" From there, it's all about the arms. ""Make sure your arms and chest always stay together through the swing,"" Leadbetter advises. ""Practice little wedge shots -- put a club-head cover or towel under the left armpit and make little half-swings."" Along with Butch Harmon, Hank Haney and Pete Cowen, Leadbetter is one of the most renowned coaches in the golf world. Their success with major champions such as Faldo, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Greg Norman, Darren Clarke, Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Louis Oosthuizen has helped them launch golf schools around the globe. An hour with Harmon would cost you $600, according to Golf Digest, while Haney charges $500 and Leadbetter brings in $3,500 for a three-hour tuition. But unless you are a top player, or paying hefty corporate rates, it's unlikely you'll get one-on-one time with these gurus. The next best thing is their schools, which range from short workshops to full-year programs for school-age players. These aren't cheap, either. A student accepted into Haney's International Junior Golf Academy, based on Hilton Head Island in the U.S., needs a $7,000 deposit just to reserve their place. However, there are cheaper holiday programs available. Haney, who worked with 14-time major winner Woods from 2004-2010, also lent his name to an academy in China, at the Mission Hills Haikou resort on Hainan Island, where 2005 PGA teacher of the year Peter Krause was installed as head instructor. Harmon, whose father Claude won the 1948 Masters at Augusta, took on Woods as a top young amateur in 1993 and helped transform the American into a global phenomenon -- spending a record 264 weeks as world No. 1 -- until their split in 2004. His Las Vegas-based golf school offers three-day courses with the man himself for $5,900 (including four nights' accommodation at Caesars Palace), and a similar package with his staff professionals for $2,400. Junior deals cost just $225, while video lessons are offered for $30 an hour. Leadbetter became a coach after failing to qualify by one shot at the European Tour School as a hopeful young professional. ""I went and studied with some of the top coaches at the time,"" he told CNN of his early days before making his name refining the swing of fellow Englishman Faldo. ""He was a successful player by the time he came to see me, but he realized he needed an extra gear if he was going to win the big ones,"" Leadbetter said. ""He was very much a perfectionist, and the challenge was we didn't see immediate results, it took a couple of years. We had to work through that period where we weren't getting good results, but it all worked out in the end."" Leadbetter's Florida-based academy, with 36 holes designed by former client Norman, has become the headquarters for a worldwide empire located in 13 countries including Spain and China. Former child prodigy Michelle Wie was one of his most famous students, and he has worked with four players who have reached golf's No. 1 position. ""A coach these days is much more than just a swing instructor, you're almost a part-time psychologist as well,"" Leadbetter said. He expects the trend of Asian players dominating the women's pro ranks to spill over onto the men's circuit soon. ""They have the discipline. It's a great sport for the Asian mind: they're very methodical, very even-keeled and have tremendous work ethics. Not only in golf but in all walks of life. It's an ideal sport for them to play."" Els, another of Leadbetter's success stories, is also helping to teach young players in his native South Africa. The 41-year-old, a three-time major champion and the European Tour's all-time leading money winner, set up a foundation in 1999 that focuses on kids from families with limited resources. His players take on those from Woods' foundation in an annual Ryder Cup-style match play competition. The most successful graduates so far are Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel. Oosthuizen stunned the golfing world in 2010 by winning the British Open after making the halfway cut in only one of his eight previous major appearances. ""Things weren't going that great on the farm, and we just heard of this foundation which had just started,"" Oosthuizen told reporters at St. Andrews about his early days. ""It was an unbelievable three years with what Ernie did for me, traveling around the country, helping with expenses, giving clinics, things like that. He's such a good mentor, probably without him I wouldn't have been here."" Oosthuizen has also worked with Cowen, a coach who helped Northern Irishman McDowell win the U.S. Open last year and Clarke the 2011 British Open. Cowen, who has academies in his native England and Dubai, counts eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie and Oosthuizen's 2011 Masters-winning compatriot Schwartzel among his former clients. He also helped Lee Westwood to become world No. 1 last year, and move within striking distance of overhauling Els' European money record. Westwood is another player giving back to the golfing community. The 38-year-old runs clinics at courses across England, and has branched out with sessions in Spain at La Manga. Non-residential academies cost about $235 for three days, with entrants having the chance to win equipment and a day playing with Westwood. Els believes that such schools are vital for golf's continued development. ""I don't think there's another sport that does more for its young participants,"" he wrote on Links Magazine's website. ""Tiger, myself and a lot of other guys on tour all can remember those who helped us when we were growing up. It is why we give back to the game at the junior and grass-roots level. ""The future of the game is bright, but only if we continue to make golf accessible to the younger generation. If we all do our bit, the combined effect is significant. ""I believe that introducing and encouraging a youngster in golf gives them a step up on life's ladder. If they go on to become great players, that's a bonus.""","Golf's best-known coaches have set up academies all around the world .

"(CNN) -- In a campaign to cleanse its national police force of ""rotten apples,"" Honduras has placed 176 police officers under investigation for a range of alleged crimes, from corruption to murder. All the officers belong to the same police post, which is based in a Tegucigalpa neighborhood known as ""La Granja,"" or the farm, Security Ministry spokesman Silvio Inestrosa told CNN Friday. Officers who worked at the post during the past five years are under investigation, he said. The police scrutiny comes as distrust of police officers reaches new highs, following the killing of two university students, allegedly by police officers. ""As an institution, we have to strengthen the police, but we have to remove the rotten apples,"" President Porfirio Lobo said during a speech Thursday. Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, with a rate in 2010 of 82.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. According to a recent report by the country's own human rights commission, that rate could increase to 86 per 100,000 this year. Despite the high criminality, Hondurans don't always turn to the police for help. According to residents, the police are sometimes to be more feared than criminals. This is the context under which two university students last month decided to flee from police instead of being pulled over. According to the national police, the officers shot and injured one of the students and headed toward a hospital. But along the way, police said, the officers instead decided to take the pair to a different location and execute them. The officers implicated in the killings are from the same district that is under investigation. Already, four officers who have been charged with covering up the killings have appeared before a judge. The four officers accused of actually carrying out the killings are fugitives. The investigations and possible firings of the 176 is latest of a series of steps that the government has taken since the outcry over the killings. Days after the incident, the national police shook up its top ranks. ""In these times of violence it is necessary to have new actions, vitality, energy and teamwork with the benefit of the Honduran people in mind,"" Security Minister Pompeyo Bonilla said when he announced the changes. Also, lawmakers on Thursday rewrote the country's policing laws, stripping the national police of its internal affairs department, and handing over such investigations to a new, independent force. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","In Honduras, 176 police officers are under investigation .

"(CNN) -- This Veterans Day, like the nine that preceded it, does not come at a time of peace. We are no longer saying thanks to veterans of wars past such as our grandfathers, uncles or those guys who fly black POW/MIA flags twice a year. Now we are thanking our children, our friends from high school and our younger cousins. Every day, someone new is introduced to the hardships of wartime military service or the horrors of combat. These are wars with no clean victories. There are no sailors in New York waiting to grab a passing dame to celebrate victory with a kiss. In the way that people offer their thanks, there is an echo of guilt -- just an echo -- of our country's mistreatment of its Vietnam veterans, and that only a select few have borne this generation's burden of war. That awkwardness with which the thanks is delivered, coupled with some veterans' anxieties about what they have seen or done, can make Veterans Day seem like a show of empty patriotism -- or worse, a slim bandage slapped over a gaping wound of indifference, pity or guilt. Our towns and cities throw parades on this day, often out of tradition and in an attempt to demonstrate anything but apathy toward their war fighters. Unlike parades past -- parades not held during wartime -- these gatherings do not celebrate victory. They directly celebrate service while indirectly celebrating survival. Even that is a messy, ongoing process. A returning veteran stepping off a plane onto U.S. soil is not evidence that the veteran survived the war -- about 20% of all suicides in the United States are committed by veterans. For some returnees, simply making it through another day is their new objective. Life back home can seem remote, confusing or even pointless. Now there is some discussion of restructuring the military pension system and raising the cost of health insurance for future service members to cut costs. That our country needs to get its fiscal house in order is not in question; what should be examined is the tendency of our government to view military service as something comparable to private-sector work. This perspective, when combined with a cynical political understanding that the military will accept any burden, puts additional strain upon our overtaxed fighting force. Consider how our civilian population's experiences on this Veterans Day will contrast sharply with that of the military: . In the U.S., a man will wake up, make breakfast, pack his briefcase and walk to his car worrying about traffic jams. In Afghanistan, an infantryman will wake up, slug down the same food he has been eating for months, check his equipment and climb into his armored vehicle worrying about the road disintegrating beneath him. In the U.S., a hardworking mother of three will cycle her children through the shower, make breakfast and send them off to school before she heads to work. In Iraq, a hardworking military police platoon leader will cycle her 20 soldiers through personal hygiene and the chow hall, and lead the convoy briefing before they go on patrol. In the U.S., a man will work a part-time job in a warehouse, running a forklift and hauling merchandise throughout the night, impatient to reach home. At Bagram Air Field, a soldier waiting for his leave flight back to the States will draw extra duty. His detail will move dead bodies -- dozens of them -- throughout the night, storing them carefully inside of a transport plane. He will be impatient to be done with the solemn yet gruesome task, but when he is finished, he will have to be ordered to take leave. With the images of the dead fresh in his mind, he will be disoriented and not even want to go home anymore. He won't be sure where to go, for that matter. In the U.S., politicians propose cutting military pensions and health benefits. Overseas, veterans see the potential reduction of military benefits and conclude that their service and their sacrifices -- over many years and multiple deployments -- are not a priority to the very politicians (of both major parties) that sent them to war. Like the casualty numbers in Afghanistan, the number of combat veterans keeps rising. Let this Veterans Day -- like the decade of Veterans Days before it -- be an opportunity to hear the stories of our warriors, to ask them honest and respectful questions without fearing them or projecting preconceived notions onto them. Let it be a day where we can see the falsehood in the argument that government cuts should start with those who have already given up so much. Let this holiday be spent celebrating the freedom to live our lives safely and without fear of terrorism or enemy attack. So go to work, send your kids to school, say goodbye for the day to loved ones -- while others ruck up for another mission. And remember: While the wars will not last forever, many are still in the fight and could use more than a few words of thanks when they come home. And over here, some are still, in their minds and in their wounds, over there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Raab.","Jonathan Raab: Veterans Day more about survival than victory for many of today's troops .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Two men circle warily in the center of a colorful gym mat. Each holds a three-foot long wicker stick in one hand and a blunted aluminum knife in the other. A sudden rush and surge of adrenalin. Both are engaged in a swirl of weapons. The air rings to the sound of sticks striking each other and the duller whomp of sticks striking legs, arms and torsos. The battle is engaged at full speed and full power. Punches aren't pulled. When the grueling two-minute bout is over, both combatants display an angry array of bumps, bruises and welts. The fighters embrace and depart the battlefield. Neither has been declared the winner or the loser. The idea of winning or losing is not what the Dog Brothers are about. ""We don't keep score,"" says Marc ""Crafty Dog"" Denny, one of the Dog Brothers' founders. ""No judges, no referees, no trophies. That would be contrary to the way we do things."" In 1988, Denny and 10 other martial arts enthusiasts formed the loose tribe they called the Dog Brothers. They were all drawn to an obscure form of the combat arts that originated during times of tribal warfare in the Philippines. This form of combat is primarily hand to hand using weapons that were available in the forests and jungles of the Philippines. It is a fighting discipline known in different parts of the world as Arnis, Escrima or Kali. ""In the past it had been a very, very secretive art,"" Denny said, ""a weaponry art that originated in tribal warfare in the jungles."" Dog Brothers gatherings feature bouts of stick fighting, knife fighting, fighting staffs, even the occasional use of chains and other weapons. Punching, kicking and wrestling also come into play. Combatants wear a fencing mask to protect the eyes and gloves to protect hands, but there is no other padding. Their motto is, ""Higher consciousness through harder contact."" ""There was definitely a part of me that said, these guys are way out there,"" Roan Kalani ""Poi Dog"" Grimm said with a laugh. At the same time, Grimm found the Dog Brothers' form of extreme martial arts exciting. ""They were applying it in real time and real speed and real power, "" Grimm said. ""A part of myself said, I really want to do this. I want to test myself at this level."" There are perhaps 200 full-fledged members of the Dog Brothers pack. Members receive a ""Dog"" nickname after they are voted into the pack. The nickname is meant to describe each member's fighting style or personality. However, to become a full member, other members must reach a consensus that the individual has developed his skills and represents his true potential as a martial artist. There are many who have more than a passing interest in the extreme form of martial arts the group represents. That is what attracted Tobias Gibson to a recent Dog Brothers gathering in Los Angeles. Gibson is a 39-year-old political science professor from Missouri's Westminster College. He is a studious looking guy with a scraggly goatee and more than a few extra pounds. Although he had trained for eight years in martial arts, Gibson had never engaged in this kind of all-out combat. ""It's really scary,"" Gibson confessed before his bout, ""I was trying to untie my shoes and I couldn't. My hands were shaking."" Gibson's bout lasted two minutes. He had been paired with a much more experienced fighter who took care to look after the newcomer's safety. Even so, the professor emerged with a series of welts on his arm and back, a bleeding knot on his forehead and at least one broken finger. The injuries did not dampen his spirits. ""Once you get into the ring it's all good, "" Gibson said. ""I'm in the moment. I was in the moment."" To Marc ""Crafty Dog"" Denny, the idea is to push your fellow members to be their best but to also know when to stop. ""In a fight of this nature, things can go wrong too quickly to count on a referee to jump into it. And so fighters are within the code of the tribe,"" Denny said. ""We could make this a padded pillow fight but then it would lose its meaning. The danger and risk are necessary to the transformative nature of the experience."" Denny said he realizes this form of fighting involves a concept that is not for everyone. He said it's not something everybody understands. Grimm certainly understands the calm that can exist at the center of a storm. ""It's never malicious. And people who display that kind of temperament are very quickly weeded out, "" he said. ""I'm completely aware of everything that is going on. Nothing beyond the exact moment exists."" Grimm laughed at the suggestion that it is a moment of Zen, with an added element of pain. ""A lot of pain if you find yourself a little too Zen and not paying attention to your opponent's stick,"" he said. Whatever the attraction is to this form of extreme fighting, Denny said safety is still paramount. ""The underlying rule is to be friends at the end of the day,"" Denny said. ""Which means that our goal is that no one spends the night in the hospital. Our goal is that everyone leaves with the IQ that they came with.""","Dog Brothers fights feature stick fighting, knife fighting and using other weapons .

"(CNN) -- Jeremy Poincenot can no longer read, drive a car or even recognize faces. But the 20-year-old, who lost his central vision two years ago, can successfully hit a small white ball into a slightly larger hole from considerable distance. Chipping from off the green at a tournament in August, the American won a nerve-wracking playoff to officially become the world's best blind golfer. Poincenot, a college student from San Diego, has an extremely rare disease called Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). And not long ago, he feared he'd never play golf again. He woke up the day before Thanksgiving in 2008 to notice his formerly perfect vision was a little blurry. A routine trip to the optometrist to pick up a pair of glasses ended up with him being diagnosed with a suspected brain tumor. The subsequent holidays were spent having an MRI scan, a spinal tap and then a catheter placed in his jugular as doctors struggled to diagnose the cause of his vanishing sight. It wasn't until his mother discovered it on the Internet that Jeremy was successfully diagnosed with LHON -- a hereditary disease with no treatment and no cure that only affects one in 50,000 people. Lissa Poincenot has since set up the website LHON.org to support fellow sufferers and their families, and to help raise funds for the USC Doheny Eye Institute, where Dr. Alfredo Sadun is researching a cure. Faced with the onset of blindness, Jeremy admits he slipped into depression for a couple of months until one afternoon he was jerked back into action. ""I saw this guy who had just lost his wife and baby daughter when a plane crashed down on his house,"" he told CNN. ""The guy was in a press conference crying, saying 'If anybody knows how to handle something this tragic, please tell me.' I just thought, 'Hey if this guy can make it through this then I can survive having no central vision.' That became my motto: 'Things could be worse.'"" So six months after losing his sight, Poincenot decided to pick up his clubs again. A keen golfer with a handicap of just four, he had played every Sunday since the age of 12 with his Dad Lionel, a club engineer at golf firm Callaway. Blind golf brought them even closer because, unlike the regular version of the sport, it's a team game. Lionel acts as his son's sighted coach on the course, describing the hole he's playing, the bunkers, the water hazards and the dog-legs -- as well as adjusting his son's feet and club-face alignment before every shot. Then he'll point in the direction that the shot should be played, while Jeremy places his chin on his dad's shoulder to get a sense of the correct alignment. ""He's the one who does all the work, lining me up and reading the putts -- I'm just the one who executes the shots,"" Jeremy laughs. They played their first tournament together in Texas, and then qualified from the nationals in California despite a few teething problems. ""He forgot to tell me about a few bunkers, and I wasn't as nice to him as I should have been,"" Jeremy recalls. But before the International Blind Golf Association's World Championships began in Britain in August, Jeremy made a pact with his dad: ""We realized that our attitude needed to improve as a team, so we decided to focus more on having fun rather than stressing out about every shot."" The new approach clearly worked, because at the end of the first day, Poincenot was tied for third out of 60 competitors and just one shot away from the leader. ""The whole second day, my stomach was in my throat -- I was extremely nervous on every shot,"" he admits. ""But I think Dad was even more nervous than me; after I take my shot he's freaking out watching my ball go towards the rough, while I can't even tell."" Nevertheless, Poincenot still managed to shoot 89 for a net score of 70, tying him with British champion Simon Cookson. A playoff hole was then required to find the winner. ""I hit my third shot short of the green. Simon also hit his second short of the green but I got a stroke on the hole because I'm a 'B2' and Simon's a 'B3',"" he said. Not every competitor has the same degree of visual impairment, so a three-tier handicap system is used to level the playing field. Those who are completely blind are B1s, while those -- like Poincenot -- with up to six percent of vision are B2s. Cookson, who has 10 percent of his vision, is a B3 -- the category of player with the most sight. Despite this potential disadvantage, however, the international business major from San Diego University had saved the best for last. ""I paced the shot to work out the yardage, and when I got to the pin there was a crowd there watching so I thought, 'You know what, I'm not going to be in this situation many times in my life,' so I waved to the crowd real quick and then got back to my shot. ""I took what I thought was a nice chip and even heard someone in the crowd say, 'That's a nice chip.' Then I heard the ball hit the pin and fall into the hole. My dad shouted, 'It went in!' so I threw my hat in the air and gave my dad a big hug."" As well as winning his first World Blind Golf Championship, Poincenot has been raising money and awareness of LHON with sponsored bike rides, half-marathons and even sky dives. He is now setting his ambitions on the next tournament in Canada's Nova Scotia in 2012. ""To be able to share being world champion with my dad is incredible, I don't know if it's hit me yet,"" he says. ""It's a great feeling and I hope it will help raise awareness of LHON, because that's the greater purpose of why I do anything.""","Young American wins World Blind Golf Championship two years after losing his vision .

"(CNN) -- Kim Jong Un, successor to his father's dictatorship over North Korea, will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long, analysts said Tuesday. Shrouded in mystery and believed to be only in his late 20s, Kim marks the third generation in his family to officially reign over the so-called Hermit Kingdom. ""It's unprecedented in modern times,"" said John Park, an expert on the region with the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. A popular expression, Park said, summarizes one central reason that third-generation dynasties don't occur. ""The first generation makes the wealth; the second generation manages the wealth; the third generation squanders the wealth,"" he said. Kim Jong Il inherited power from his father, a military leader who built a new North Korean economy. Kim Jong Il maintained a fierce grip, partly through building his country's nuclear arsenal. It is unknown whether Kim Jong Un has the skills, knowledge or training to lead his country through the next era. North Korea does not function as a ""normal nation state"" through imports, exports and taxes, Park said. ""Kim Jong Il ran a system that was based on competition among senior officials"" who controlled economic institutions such as trading companies. ""The way to view Kim Jong Un is almost as a CEO of North Korea Inc.,"" Park said. ""He either makes money on a recurring basis or he's out. The fact that he's the youngest son won't matter if he can't produce the cash."" Christian Caryl, an editor of foreignpolicy.com, said the younger Kim's lack of experience does not bode well. ""I personally put the odds fairly low"" that he will succeed in power, he said. North Koreans ""know much more about the world than they did"" when Kim Jong Il came to power, said Caryl, who last visited a few years ago. ""They've watched DVDs of South Korean soap operas. People know about China -- and China is light years ahead of North Korea."" ""You can no longer expect people to believe in the Kim name the way they used to,"" he said. The government still deprives its citizens of basic rights and freedoms, and there is little risk of any popular protest against a leader, Park said. If something were to end Kim Jong Un's time in power, it would be battling forces within the North Korean power structure. ""There are different factions and interest groups,"" Caryl said. ""I wouldn't say organized power blocs, but groups that have big business interests now because they've also been trading with China."" ""These things begin to get complicated very quickly"" for a new leader at the helm, Caryl said. Jayshree Bajoria of the Council on Foreign Relations writes that ""even with a successor, North Korean observers have for some time feared a behind-the-scenes power struggle or nuclear instability after Kim Jong-Il's death."" Still, ""some experts doubt that Kim's death will lead to chaos,"" Bajoria writes, noting that the country has shown resilience in the past. In the region, analysts and government leaders are looking at early indications in an effort to read the tea leaves. ""Over the span of some 50 hours, North Korea was very effectively able to conceal the death of Kim Jong Il, successfully make the announcement of his death. Seeing that it has gone smoothly so far without any bumps, we can relatively carefully speculate that the leadership is relatively well-grounded,"" South Korean intelligence committee chairman Kwon Young-se said Tuesday in an interview with CNN. ""But at the same time, Kim Jong Un is still very young and has only gone through a short period of time for grooming as an heir. Also, Kim Jong Il died all of a sudden without having been able to fully accelerate the process of the succession. Depending on the balance between the new people that support Kim Jong Un and the older generation that upheld Kim Jong Il, things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership,"" he said.","A third-generation dynasty has not happened in modern times, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- The longest debate since humans have been having debates is whether we are good or evil. It underlies the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Jesus and Judas. What is our human nature? Of course, the answer is we can be both good and evil. But what determines which part of our character emerges? About a decade ago, my lab made an unexpected breakthrough in the understanding of good and evil. We discovered that the neurochemical oxytocin makes people trustworthy. We then found oxytocin was responsible for many other moral behaviors, from being generous to sacrificing to help a stranger. Wait -- morality is chemical? In my TED talk, I describe how I made the unlikely discovery of the moral molecule, how I was roundly discouraged from even looking for such a chemical, and what drove me to persist in my search. In these experiments, we tempt people with virtue and vice using money (share with others: virtue; selfishly keep everything for yourself: vice). Using money to understand how and why humans make decisions is a field now called neuroeconomics. Money gives us a convenient way to measure how much someone cares about another person. For example, in one experiment we randomly matched strangers in the lab by computer and put $10 in an account for each of them. In each pair there was a decision-maker 1 (DM1) and a decision-maker 2 (DM2). All participants got these instructions: DM1 can give up some or all of his or her $10 and transfer it to DM2 by computer but cannot talk to, or meet, the other person. Whatever is transferred is removed from DM1's account but is tripled in DM2's account. Then, DM2 gets a computer message identifying how much has been received from DM1 and a reminder of the total in his or her account. Next, the software asks DM2 if she or he wants to send some of this larger pot of money back to DM1. The amount sent back comes out of DM2's account one for one and is not tripled -- it's a pure loss to DM2. For example, if DM1 transfers $8, he or she would keep $2 and DM2 would receive $24 (=3 x $8). The total in DM2's account would be $34 ($24 + $10). If you were DM2, what would you do -- keep it all or share some back with DM1? We found that 90% of DM1s send money and of the DM2s who receive money, 95% return at least some of it. Usually both DMs in a pair leave the lab with more than $10, sometimes much more. The DM1 to DM2 transfer is understood to be a measure of trust, while the DM2 to DM1 transfer measures trustworthiness. By taking blood from participants, we found that the more money denoting trust DM2 received, the more oxytocin his or her brain made. And, the more oxytocin on board, the more money was returned to DM1. All this happened without any face-to-face interactions, revealing how easily the oxytocin system activates. TED.com: How we read each other's minds . Morality has traditionally been the domain of theologians and philosophers, often providing prescriptions of what we must do. But in the past decade, neuroscientists have started analyzing brain activity while people think about, and engage in, moral or immoral acts. These findings have changed the inquiry into morals from prescriptive to descriptive. As I discuss in my talk, I have even done studies that have manipulated brain chemistry in human beings to show that oxytocin directly causes people to be moral. I also talk about what having a chemical that affects morality means for individuals, organizations and entire societies. For example, does ""my chemicals made me do it"" absolve people from legal or moral responsibility? If we have a moral molecule, where does evil come from? By the way, oxytocin doesn't only cause morality in a laboratory setting -- I've done studies in churches, on sports fields and among indigenous people to show that the biology of morality is a human universal. TED.com: The battle between your present and your future self . While neuroscience has provided new insights into our human nature, the philosophy of morality has not gone away. My talk identifies the philosophers whose insights and arguments are consistent with the way oxytocin works in the human brain. Two hit the mark: Aristotle and Adam Smith. Aristotle claimed that the reason to be a virtuous person is because it makes us happy. I found the same thing: Those who release the most oxytocin in the lab are more satisfied with their lives (watch the talk to find out why). And then there is Adam Smith. Yes, the same Adam Smith who is considered the ""father"" of economics was a moral philosopher. In 1759, Smith published a book called ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"" that nearly perfectly anticipated my findings. Smith's book caused a sensation when it came out because of his radical claim that morality comes from humans' social nature, not from God. Sociality, said Smith, means we inevitably share the emotions of others. This is just what I found: When the brain is flooded with oxytocin, people feel empathy for others. It is this emotional connection that causes most of us, most of the time, to behave well toward each other. I've also found that societies that are more moral (for example, more trustworthy and more tolerant) also have higher standards of living. Smith understood why: Morality undergirds economic exchange, opening up more opportunities for the creation of wealth that individuals in a transaction can share. And, prosperity (perhaps surprisingly) can make societies more moral. All this occurs as part of our human nature, our brains adapting to evolving social environments. So, this ancient and tiny molecule, oxytocin, has taken us from being social creatures to, increasingly, being tolerant, empathic and prosperous ones. Quite a nice trick for a tiny molecule that traces its lineage back at least 400 million years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Zak.","Paul Zak: Experiments show the presence of a chemical promotes moral behavior .

"(CNN) -- A Mexican woman -- a former inmate in Maricopa County, Arizona -- claims in a lawsuit that sheriff's officers mistreated her during and after her pregnancy, including shackling her while she was in labor and after her Caesarean section. The federal suit filed by Miriam Mendiola-Martinez this week comes days after the U.S. Department of Justice alleged the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, under the leadership of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, engaged in a pattern of discrimination against Latinos. Mendiola-Martinez's suit is against the sheriff's office, Arpaio, the Maricopa Medical Center and unidentified male and female officers, doctors and nurses. Mendiola-Martinez, a Mexican citizen, alleges in the suit she was arrested October 23, 2009, by Scottsdale, Arizona, police, and was booked into Maricopa County's Estrella Jail on charges of identity theft. She was held without bond under Arizona law. According to the police report filed at the time of her arrest, Mendiola-Martinez was accused of using someone else's name, date of birth and Social Security number to obtain work. She was arrested at her place of employment, a department store, while she was vacuuming the floor. When arrested, she was six months' pregnant and had developed gestational diabetes and high blood pressure, according to the suit. On December 10, 2009, Mendiola-Martinez pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit forgery under a plea agreement. Her sentencing was set for December 24. While incarcerated, in what her attorney, Joy Bertrand, called ""two months of hell,"" Mendiola-Martinez says in the suit that she was told by jail staff she would receive a ""special"" pregnancy diet. That diet, she claims, consisted of ""items such as two slices (of) cheese or ham, two slices of bread, indistinguishable cooked vegetables and occasionally a piece of fruit."" She also said she was given two small cartons of milk a day and a pill that she was told was a vitamin. On days when she was transported to court, Mendiola-Martinez said, she was given no food during the day. In one instance, she alleges in the suit, an officer taunted her and other inmates with his food, telling them there was no food for them. On December 20, four days before her sentencing, Mendiola-Martinez began to have contractions, according to the suit. She was shackled at her ankles and taken to the Maricopa Medical Center, where medical personnel determined she was not in labor and returned her to the jail. By the following day, however, her pain had increased. ""Ms. Mendiola-Martinez had been left in the jail visitation room, in extreme pain,"" the suit says. Guards ignored her attempts to speak to them in Spanish, so she asked an English-speaking person in the room to tell them she needed help. She was again taken to the Maricopa Medical Center, where she gave birth to a son via Caesarean section. She was shackled before and after the surgery, according to the suit. While she was recovering, a male correctional officer ""insisted that she be shackled to the hospital bed,"" and the shackles on her feet were painful, according to the lawsuit. Asked about the allegations in 2010, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Lt. Brian Lee said in a statement that Mendiola-Martinez ""was not shackled during or directly after her medical procedure. After the procedure, she did have a soft restraint attached on one leg to her bed to prevent escape."" Maricopa County sheriff's spokesman Justin Griffin referred to the earlier statement when asked about the suit. Lee said Mendiola-Martinez was treated the way any other inmate would be while receiving treatment ""in an unsecured facility. Although she was being held on a Class Three felony, MCSO would have treated other inmates in the same manner."" Mendiola-Martinez was not initially shackled, thanks to a ""guardian angel"" guard, Bertrand said, but ""she has her C-section, the guards change and this new guard comes in as she's recovering from this major surgery and insists on shackling her to the bed."" ""It's incredibly painful, it's incredibly dangerous because now she can't move around, she can't avoid clotting, and he refuses to take the shackle off,"" Bertrand said. Mendiola-Martinez was not allowed to hold or nurse her baby, the suit alleges. She was discharged on December 23, but was not given a wheelchair to leave the hospital, the suit says. ""Wearing only a hospital gown, Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was forced to walk through the hospital with her hands and feet shackled,"" according to the suit. Meanwhile, she began to bleed, the suit says. A nurse ""scolded"" the corrections officer for taking her ""so quickly and without Ms. Mendiola receiving her pain medication or discharge paperwork,"" so she was again chained and forced to walk back to the nurse's station, according to the suit. ""Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was in so much pain she could hardly walk,"" the suit says. ""Shackled at her hands and ankles, with a bleeding surgery wound, Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was returned to the Estrella jail."" She spent the nights following her discharge ""in pain and crying,"" the suit says. Maricopa County Medical Center spokesman Michael Murphy, asked about shackling inmates in labor, said hospital staff defers to law enforcement, according to the suit. Hospital spokeswoman Judy Cane declined comment on the matter Wednesday. ""I'd like to think that any woman held in that jail is going to be treated with respect and dignity,"" Bertrand said. Mendiola-Martinez declined to be interviewed, saying she fears retaliation by the sheriff's office. International standards say using restraints on pregnant women ""is cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, and given medical or other factors impeding pregnant or birthing women from attempting escape or becoming violent, the presumption must be that no restraints should be applied,"" the suit says. ""A woman's privacy and dignity must be respected during labor and birth."" International standards also say a pregnant woman in her third trimester should not be restrained while being transported, and efforts should be made ""to afford the mother reasonable access to the baby without impeding her movements by restraints,"" according to the suit. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose the shackling of women in labor or after delivery, the suit says. The Arizona Department of Corrections, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have all eliminated the practice. The suit claims officers violated Mendiola-Martinez's rights, including her right to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment. Hospital staffers' deferring to law enforcement officers regarding the shackling of women in labor and after delivery also ""demonstrates an ongoing policy of deliberate indifference to Ms. Mendiola-Martinez's serious medical needs,"" according to the suit. It also alleges that a U.S. citizen in a similar situation would be less likely to be shackled. ""Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was subject to a lower standard of medical care -- and a higher degree of danger to her and (her) fetus -- than similarly-situated women who are United States citizens,"" the suit says. ""This disparate treatment is consistent with the findings of the United States Department of Justice regarding the systemic bias towards Latinos demonstrated by Sheriff Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office."" Arpaio is known as ""America's toughest sheriff"" for his stance against illegal immigration. He and his attorneys last week condemned the Justice Department civil rights investigation as politically motivated and a ""witch hunt."" Mendiola-Martinez seeks a jury trial and damages in the suit. Journalist Valeria Fernandez in Phoenix contributed to this report.","Miriam Mendiola-Martinez was arrested for using another identity to get a job .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the United States completes its withdrawal of all military forces from Iraq by the end of the month, Iraq's prime minister made a pitch to leaders of American commerce and industry Tuesday: Iraq is open for business. In an address to American executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said his country offers ""limitless"" opportunities for American companies. Al-Maliki said his country is trying to diversify from an energy-dominated economy, to one that focuses on financial, medical, agricultural, educational and infrastructure services as well. The end of U.S. military operations in Iraq heralds the beginning of a ""wider relationship"" between the two countries where ""not generals but businessmen"" will focus on economic and political engagement between the two countries, al-Maliki told the audience. He spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum, engineering and construction, commercial aviation, architecture, maritime cargo and financial services. As U.S. investment in Iraq has increased since 2008, al-Maliki said Iraq wants to see a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of Iraqis and create more U.S. jobs in the process. Total foreign direct investment in Iraq hit $70 billion for the first months of 2011, according to the chamber. The United States has increased its investment from nearly nearly $2 billion in 2010 to more than $8 billion this year, the organization said. That figure represents 11.6% of all investment entering Iraq, the chamber said. The International Monetary Fund has projected the Iraqi economy to grow at a faster pace than China or India over the next two to three years. Despite growing U.S. investment in Iraq, the chamber continued its own pitch to U.S. businesses of the potential Iraq represents for them, and American workers, before al-Maliki spoke. ""We continue to trail our trading partners with respect to investment and economic engagement in Iraq,"" said Lionel Johnson, vice president for Middle East and North African Affairs at the chamber. The private sector stands to play a crucial role in filling the capacity void left in many sectors of the Iraqi economy following the U.S. military departure, Johnson said. Winning business for American firms in Iraq has not been an easy prospect in the past. Not a single U.S. energy firm secured a deal for oil production at an auction of contracts by the Iraqi government two years ago. Many members of Congress were outraged, and questioned the U.S. investment in Iraq to that point after lucrative multi-billion-dollar contracts went to Russian and Chinese firms instead. In the past year, the United States Business Council in Iraq was established to advance commercial interests for American firms operating in Iraq. Opportunity aside, al-Maliki acknowledged the difficulty of moving his country from the planned economy of the Saddam Hussein era to a market-based system governed by transparency laws and international regulations, not to mention convincing American businesses to invest in a country that still experiences a high volume of violence. He assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate. ""Make no mistake, this is a country that's developing, its commerce is developing, it's going to take time, it's going to take energy,"" Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides told CNN after al-Maliki spoke. ""U.S. companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that's what it is about, and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments. Iraq is no different, but we have seen huge progress."" Nides said the ""robust diplomatic staff"" still based in Iraq after the military withdrawal will include large economic and legal teams to work with U.S. companies operating in Iraq. Nearly 40 leaders from the Iraqi private sector made the trip to Washington with al-Maliki to meet with their American counterparts.","Al-Maliki talks business with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- In 1999, Heather Donahue was unexpectedly catapulted to stardom as a co-creator and costar of the indie horror film ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- who memorably filmed herself crying in terror in the genre-breaking flick. A few short years later, just as unexpectedly, her acting career stalled. And soon she was embarking on the most peculiar of second acts -- that of marijuana grower. ""I took all my stuff into the desert related to my acting career and burned it all,"" Donahue, who turns 37 on Thursday, tells the Philadelphia Inquirer. Well, she did spare one thing: the blue ski cap from the ""Blair Witch"" poster. ""That's the only thing I kept,"" she says. ""I figured if things got really bad, I could always sell it on eBay."" At the time of ""Blair Witch's"" release, Donahue told PEOPLE that her newfound fame was ""hilarious and overwhelming."" But soon she became disillusioned. ""The acting projects I was lucky enough to work on weren't always things that I felt good about putting out into the world,"" she says now in a Q&A on her website. ""I didn't see that getting better as I got older. I wanted to change my life, see what else was out there for me, what else I might become."" She ended up following her then new boyfriend into a strange new life of growing marijuana, mostly for medical purposes -- a journey she relates in her forthcoming memoir, ""GrowGirl: How My Life After The Blair Witch Project Went to Pot."" Donahue ended up living for a year in Nuggettown, California, with a bunch of growers and their ""pot wives,"" helping to build grow rooms and tending to the crops. She tells the Inquirer that she was ""always an avid gardener"" and quickly fell into a routine, becoming ""a solitary country girl"" after her years in the fast lane in L.A. She gave up growing pot after deciding to write about it -- and after a friend got busted by the feds. Donahue, who is now on a book tour, is torn about whether marijuana should be legalized. On the one hand, she's worried that corporations might run over the mom-and-pop growers. But at the same time, she thinks it's foolish to outlaw it. ""Cannabis has been intertwined with human culture for thousands of years,"" she says on her website. ""It's here to stay as medicine, as an industry, and as a component of the culture. The idea that such a hearty, useful plant could be legislated out of existence seems pretty foolish, especially in retrospect."" See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has saluted his Red Bull team after making Formula One history in 2011. The 24-year-old became the elite motorsport's youngest double world champion as the UK-based Austrian marque retained the constructors' title after winning 12 of the 19 races. ""I have had the trophy in my house all year and didn't want to give it back, so this means a great deal to me,"" the German said at the FIA Prize Giving Gala in India on Friday. ""It's hard to put into words how it feels to win again; the team stayed focused and made few mistakes and I would like to thank them for all their impressive efforts. I would also like to thank (engine supplier) Renault who worked so hard all year. ""The history of Formula One means a lot to me and it's special to know that we are now somehow a part of that."" Vettel clinched his first world title in the final race of 2010, the only time last year that he led the standings. But 2011 was a different story as he won the first race in Australia and sealed the championship in Japan with four grands prix to go. He broke Nigel Mansell's record of pole positions by winning his 15th in the final race in Brazil, where teammate Mark Webber notched his only victory. And in India in October, Vettel became the youngest driver to earn pole, win the race, set the fastest lap and lead from start to finish in one grand prix. ""It's phenomenal what the team has achieved this year,"" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said. ""To win 12 races and take 18 pole positions and 27 podiums to defend our title is something we are very proud of. ""I would like to thank every member of the team, including Mark and Sebastian for all their hard work. Receiving the award tonight is fantastic and a great end to what has been an incredible year. ""Seb's achievement of becoming a double Formula One world champion is incredible; the fact he is the youngest ever to do this is testament to the exciting young talent that he is."" World rally champion Sebastian Loeb also received his trophy after winning the title for a record-breaking eighth consecutive time. It put him one clear of Michael Schumacher's record seven F1 crowns, giving him some claim to being motorsport's most successful driver. The Frenchman and co-driver Daniel Elena helped Citroen win a fourth successive manufacturers' crown as he and teammate Sebastian Ogier both won five races out of 13 this year. ""What an incredible season! The battle with the other drivers has been intense from the beginning to the end,"" said Loeb, who clinched the title in the final round . ""After a great start to the season we really had to battle hard again at the end of the year; we lost a lot of our advantage and it was like starting from zero all over again going into the final two rounds.""

"Washington (CNN) -- NFL player Samuel Hurd has been arrested and charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Thursday. Agents say Hurd, 26, a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears, was arrested Wednesday night after a five-month investigation that began in Dallas, where Hurd once played for the Cowboys. Authorities say he was trying to set up a drug distribution network in Chicago. The complaint states that Hurd met with an ICE undercover agent at a restaurant in Chicago on Wednesday night when, law enforcement officials say, Hurd introduced himself as the person communicating with a confidential informant. Hurd stated that he was interested in purchasing 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine, at $25,000 per kilogram, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana at $450 per pound per week for distribution in the Chicago area, according to ICE. Hurd said that ""he and another co-conspirator currently distribute about four kilograms of cocaine per week in Chicago but that his supplier couldn't supply him with enough quantity,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. After they finished negotiating, according to the complaint, the undercover agent presented Hurd with a kilogram of cocaine that Hurd accepted. ""Hurd stated that he plays for the Chicago Bears and that he gets out of practice at about 5:30 p.m., after which he would make arrangements to pay for the kilogram of cocaine,"" ICE officials said in a news release, ""Hurd left the restaurant with the bag of cocaine and was arrested shortly thereafter in the parking lot of the restaurant."" If convicted, Hurd faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. CNN's efforts to contact Hurd's lawyers were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon.","Chicago Bears wide receiver Samuel Hurd arrested .

"(CNN) -- The deaths within a week of four women -- three of whom had advertised in an adult personals section of a website -- are being treated as the work of one person or group of people, Detroit's police chief said Tuesday. ""At this point, we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects,"" Chief Ralph L. Godbee told CNN. ""There are too many common links for us not to, at this point, work this as one single investigation."" Among those links, he said, is the fact that three of the women had placed online ads dealing with ""prearranged adult dating services"" and posted on backpage.com, Godbee told reporters Monday. ""We felt it is imperative to alert the public that deciding to meet unknown persons via the Internet can be extremely dangerous,"" Godbee said. But a lawyer for backpage.com, Steve Suskin, said it was not clear that his company's website was involved. ""Our team has already provided the police with detailed information about the ads that the suspect or others posted on numerous web sites. Law enforcement authorities now have evidence that the investigation appears to connect to at least 30 different ads or other postings on at least 15 different websites, separate and distinct from ours,"" Suskin said. ""We are not aware of the existence of any evidence that would indicate which of these many sites were used by the suspect to establish contact with his victims."" The most recent deaths were discovered early Sunday, when police found the bodies of two women, burned beyond recognition, in the trunk of a burning car. The victims have been tentatively identified and are believed to be 28 and 29 years of age, Godbee said. Neither body showed obvious signs of trauma, he said. Six days earlier, on December 19, the bodies of two other women were found in the trunk of a car parked at a vacant dwelling, Detroit police said. While autopsy results, including toxicology tests, are not complete, ""we are proceeding as if this is two murder scenes,"" he said. Backpage representatives have been cooperating with police, who plan to get search warrants and trace computer Internet Protocol addresses and cell phone numbers in an attempt ""to start putting this puzzle together,"" the police chief said. Postings on the escort section of the website cost $1. Referring to the advertisements on the website as ""borderline prostitution,"" Godbee said that his priorities lie elsewhere. ""Right now, we want to get to the bottom of how these four individuals passed away, and who had a hand in their demise,"" he said.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A major Darfur rebel leader and some of his top commanders have been killed, a Sudanese army spokesman announced on state-run radio Sunday. ""Our armed forces were able to destroy the renegade Khalil Ibrahim, who died along with members of (his group's) leadership that was with him,"" said Alswarmi Khalid, the army's spokesperson. Khalid said Ibrahim and members of his group were surrounded and killed in the Wad Banda area -- along the border between North Darfur state and North Kordofan state -- as they attempted to escape to South Sudan. Fighting between Darfur rebels and the Sudanese army broke out days ago in North Kordofan, as rebels announced an assault on Khartoum. Ibrahim was the leader of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), considered the most powerful Darfur rebel group. The JEM had refused to join the Doha Darfur peace document, signed between the Sudanese government and another rebel group, the Liberation and Justice Movement, this year. A statement posted on JEM's website confirmed Ibrahim's death, but told a different narrative of events. ""JEM announces the martyrdom of its chair and head of its armed forces and offers its condolences to all Sudanese people,"" the statement read. The JEM said Ibrahim was attacked from air by an unknown plane that hit with ""with accuracy unusual for the regime's army's fighters which led to his martyrdom ... which points to the involvement of and a conspiracy by some in the regional and international circles with Khartoum's genocidal regime.""

"(CNN) -- European nations could be penalized by being stripped of some powers if they fail to manage their budgets, according to a memo from European Commission President Herman Van Rompuy leaked Tuesday. The confidential memo, sent out to leaders ahead of the final European Council meeting of the year at the end of the week, comes only a day after the leaders of Germany and France agreed in Paris on a new fiscal pact they say will help prevent another debt crisis. But Van Rompuy's proposals, details of which were obtained by CNN, are perhaps even stricter than those of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The five-page memo proposes that the European Commission could perhaps be given the right to strip voting rights within the European Union from some countries who have been bailed out but are still not meeting their deficit targets . For ""member states that are under an assistance program and have consistently failed to meet the conditionality, the (European) Commission could receive exceptional power such as ex-ante approval of all major economic reforms,"" the document says. As such, the executive arm of the EU could force bailed-out countries, such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, to comply with deficit regulations, which for the entire EU currently stand at 3% of GDP. Those rules have been in place for many years but EU leaders are looking for a way to have them more tightly enforced in order to restore confidence in eurozone debt. Van Rompuy's proposals indicate continuing differences of opinion with other key decision-makers in Europe over how to handle the region's debt crisis. The proposed change of protocol Van Rompuy has put forward would not need to be fully ratified by all the member states, a person familiar with the plans told CNN. Merkel and Sarkozy, heads of the two largest economies in the 17-nation eurozone, said Monday that their pact, to be presented in detail Friday, would involve amending or rewriting the treaties that govern the EU to force members to manage their budgets in a more structured and coherent way. They are expected to write to Van Rompuy on Wednesday to find out whether their initiative would be embraced by all 27 EU countries or just the 17 that share the single currency. Ahead of that move, Prime Minister David Cameron warned Tuesday he would not sign any reworked EU treaty that does not protect British interests. ""What I'm saying is that if -- and eurozone countries do need to come together, do need to do more things together -- if they choose to use the European treaty to do that, Britain will be insisting on some safeguards, too, and as long as we get those, then that treaty can go ahead. If we can't get those, it won't,"" he told the BBC. Resolving the eurozone crisis is a priority, Cameron said, but he would be going to Brussels to ""defend and promote"" British interests, including the U.K. financial services sector. As the head of the European Commission, Van Rompuy is expected to steer discussions between the member states as they meet for the final EU summit of the year. Both Merkel and Sarkozy ruled out Monday the concept of pooling eurozone debt under so-called ""eurobonds,"" saying such discussions were premature. However, Van Rompuy's memo appears to open the door to such an idea further down the line. He recommends leaders consider ""opening up the possibility in a longer term perspective of moving towards common debt issuance in a staged and criteria-based approach,"" according to the leaked memo. Sarkozy said Monday in Paris that the debt crisis, which has shaken markets around the world, must be resolved by March next year. Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's placed 15 members of the euro currency union on review for a possible downgrade Monday, as the debt crisis in the eurozone continues to worsen. The warning applies to AAA-rated nations such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg, the U.S.-based credit rating agency said in a press release. A downgrade of France or another of the region's top-rated nations would have serious consequences for the European Financial Stability Facility. The EFSF, a government-backed bailout fund, could lose its AAA rating if the nations that stand behind it are downgraded.","NEW: British PM warns he may not sign a new EU treaty if British interests are at risk .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's Uruguay international striker Luis Suarez has been accused of giving ""unreliable"" and ""inconsistent"" evidence to the disciplinary panel which banned him for eight-games for alleged racial abuse of Manchester United's Patrice Evra. The findings of the Independent Regulatory Commission were released late Saturday night on the official website of the English Football Association (FA). The detailed 115-page ruling went over the circumstances of the clash between the pair in the match at Liverpool's Anfield ground on October 15. It concluded that Suarez had called Evra a ""negro"" no fewer than seven times during the course of the English Premier League match. The panel heard evidence from both players and also used linguistic experts to examine television footage of the game. Their investigations centered on an incident just before the hour mark after Suarez fouled the French international full-back. Dalglish defends t-shirts supporting Suarez . At a subsequent Liverpool corner, Evra was marking the striker and they became involved in a fierce row. Evra made a complaint to referee Andre Mariner and again after the game, which . prompted the FA investigation. Suarez, who was publicly supported by his manager Kenny Dalglish and teammates, argued before the panel that the use of he word ""negro"" was not offensive. But the commission rejected his arguments in handing down their lengthy ban and a $62,000 fine. ""Mr Evra was a credible witness,"" read its report. ""He gave his evidence in a calm, composed and clear way. It was, for the most part, consistent, although both he and Mr Suarez were understandably unable to remember every detail of the exchanges between them. Blog: Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 . ""Mr Suarez's evidence was unreliable in relation to matters of critical importance. It was, in part, inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence, especially the video footage,"" it added. However, the commission did not believe Suarez was ""racist"" but had used ""insulting"" words, which was the basis of the FA charge against him. ""We have found that charge proved on the evidence and arguments put before us. The FA made clear that it did not contend that Mr Suarez acted as he did because he is a racist. ""Mr Evra said in his evidence that he did not think Mr Suarez is a racist. Mr Suarez said in evidence that he will not use the word 'negro' on a football pitch in England in the future, and we believe that is his genuine and firm intention."" Liverpool have until January 13 to appeal, leaving Suarez free to play, including a . English League Cup semifinal first leg tie against Manchester City two days before. They issued a statement on their website to confirm receipt of the commission's report. ""The player, the club and our legal advisers will now take the necessary amount of time to read, digest and properly consider the contents of the 115 page judgment and will make no further comment at present,"" it read. The Suarez affair comes at the same time England captain John Terry is facing a criminal charge of using racist language against QPR defender Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's EPL game on October 23. Terry has vowed to fight the charges ""tooth and nail"" and like Suarez has received the backing of his club. The FA is postponing its action until the court proceedings are concluded early this year.","FA says Luis Suarez gave 'unreliable' evidence in race abuse case .

Jorge Martinez Boero was only two kilometers from the finish of the 57km special from Mar del Plata to Santa Rosa when he came off his Beta bike with tragic results. Organizers said the 38-year-old from Argentina, who was taking part in the annual event for the second time, suffered a cardiac arrest after his fall. He was treated by medical staff within five minutes of the accident, but died on the way to hospital.

Police in India have been cracking down recently on businesses selling the illegally-made alcohol, Ramkrishna said. In December, authorities arrested 10 people for making contaminated moonshine that left at least 168 people dead in the Indian state of West Bengal. Hundreds more were sickened by it, authorities said.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- As the year draws to a close, it's not the promise of a new year that brings us the most joy. No, it's the chance to reflect on the past year's most memorable work stories that gives us the most delight. This year's selection of workplace tales ranges from ingenious to inspiring to just plain weird, but they all left their own special mark on pop culture. So without further ado, we present you with our roundup of the weirdest and most notable work stories of 2011. 1. His ""winning"" remarks caused him to lose his job . Over the past several years, actor Charlie Sheen has made headlines for his destructive behavior, short-lived marriages and alleged substance abuse. Yet despite the steady drum of rumors and allegations, he continued to show up and dutifully film his TV show, ""Two and a Half Men."" That is until he had his meltdown. While the seedlings of chaos began to sprout at the end of 2010, things took a turn for the worse in early January, when he was rushed to the hospital for ""stomach pains."" From there, Sheen became the center of media attention, making news for his bizarre behavior, crazy rants and admittedly addictive catch phrases. There was constant speculation over whether the show would drop him, and he was eventually fired after blasting the show's creator. While Sheen has since cleaned up his act, those few months of insanity are ones we won't soon forget. [Source: People] . 2. Rubik's cube expert, prom king and other ways to stand out in your cover letter . There's no shortage of advice on how to develop an effective cover letter, but job seeker Roanald took some of that advice to the extreme. Yes, a cover letter should be attention-grabbing, but using profanity and listing one of his qualities as honorable because he is ""the son of a librarian and a Capricorn"" may be pushing it. Needless to say it's an entertaining read, and it impressed the cover letter's recipients (Chicago bar The Aviary) enough to get him a job. [Source: The Huffington Post] . 3. The homeless man with that ""golden voice"" What started as a videotaped interview of a homeless man by Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch videographer Doral Chenoweth soon turned into a widespread Internet sensation. The man in the video, Ted Williams, had a voice any radio or TV announcer would kill for. In fact, earlier in his life, before falling on hard times, he'd attended school for voice acting and did some work in radio. After the video went viral, Williams began receiving job offers and even appeared on NBC's ""Today."" Yet the sudden media attention was too much for him to bear, and he reverted to drinking and other destructive behavior. While the hoopla has since died down, the homeless man with the silky smooth voice won't soon be forgotten. [Source: The Columbus Dispatch] . 4. Playing around on the Internet really can get you a job . Sure, you've been told to ""follow your dreams"" and ""do something you love,"" but it's never really that easy, right? For one Philadelphia native, it was. The Philadelphia 76ers launched a voting contest to name the team's new mascot but didn't use social media to promote it. So self-described ""social media sponge"" Jerry Rizzo took it upon himself to create Twitter handles for the three mascot finalists. At first, the team shied away from the extra social media help, asking Rizzo to hand over the Twitter handles and back away from Twitter. But the CEO soon realized there was a real opportunity to grow the team's social media presence, and ultimately offered Rizzo a social media position with the team. He gladly accepted. [Source: Mashable] . 5. A cop who didn't want to be late . Miami police officer Fausto Lopez led other officers on a high-speed chase, all in the name of getting to work on time.

Oops i(Phone) did it again . In last year's roundup of notable workplace stories, we included the tale of the iPhone 4 prototype that went missing after its owner left it at a bar. Clearly no lessons were learned from that gaffe, because another Apple employee made the same mistake with the iPhone 5 prototype, losing it at a Mexican restaurant. And at least the iPhone 4 was sold for the worthy amount of $5,000. Allegedly the iPhone 5 archetype raked in a measly $200 on Craigslist.

Within these emails, the employees in question trashed their co-workers and expressed their general disgust for their jobs. After the disparaging emails were exposed, the employees were fired for ""excessive use of the commission's computer system for emails of a personal nature.""

"(CNN) -- Two Swedish journalists who were found guilty in Ethiopia of supporting terrorism were sentenced to 11 years in jail Tuesday, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said. ""Our belief was that the court would think they were journalists and they would be released. This is what the prime minister has said before,"" ministry spokesman Anders JÃ¶rle said. ""It is not fair that they are sentenced since they are journalists on a journalistic mission."" ""They are innocent and have been convicted because of their journalistic work,"" said Tomas Olsson, the journalists' Swedish attorney. ""We are very disappointed."" A court convicted Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye last week. Ethiopian troops captured Persson and Schibbye in July during an exchange of gunfire with a rebel group in the Ogaden, a prohibited region along the nation's border with Somalia, according to state media. Ethiopian officials accused the journalists of being accomplices to terrorism after the government declared the Ogaden National Liberation Front a terrorist group in June. Olsson said the 11-year sentence was the lowest possible one for the crimes they were convicted of. ""The prosecutor sought 18 years imprisonment, so if you look at it that way, it is a positive thing that they got the lowest possible sentence,"" Olsson said. ""But since they are innocent, they are very disappointed."" Schibbye and Persson have until January 10 to decide if they want to appeal -- a process that could take up to two years -- or if they want to seek a pardon. However, Olsson said, if they want to apply for a pardon the two have to admit the crimes, ""and since they are not guilty then this is not something they'd want to do."" Fredric Alm at the Sweden-based photojournalism agency Kontinent, for which the two men work, said they ""have a very hard decision ahead of them"" in considering whether to appeal or ask for a pardon, but that an 11-year sentence in an Ethiopian prison ""could effectively be a death sentence for them."" Alm added: ""The purpose of this verdict is to scare away all journalists from reporting in the Ogaden. But as journalists we have to continue reporting from closed areas. It's a very sad day for press freedom. It's a very sad day but it didn't come as a surprise for us. It's still a political verdict; it's not a real trial. It is the (Ethiopian) prime minister who has decided."" Persson and Schibbye were convicted on two counts: entering the country illegally and providing assistance to a terrorist organization, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Press freedom groups say the two were embedded with the rebels while working on a story about the region. Journalists and aid workers are prohibited from entering the Ogaden, where human rights organizations say human rights abuses against ethnic Somalis by rebels and Ethiopian troops are rampant. ""The Ethiopian army's answer to the rebels has been to viciously attack civilians in the Ogaden,"" said Georgette Ganon of Human Rights Watch. ""These widespread and systematic atrocities amount to crimes against humanity."" Reporters Without Borders criticized the court's decision. ""What are the Ethiopian authorities hoping to achieve?"" the international secretariat of the group asked. ""To discourage anyone from visiting the Ogaden, as these two journalists did? To send a warning signal to the national and international media about the danger of receiving a long jail sentence on a terrorism charge if they attempt any potentially embarrassing investigative reporting?"" ""Our starting point is and remains that they have been in the country on a journalistic mission,"" Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said in a statement last week. ""They should be freed as soon as possible and be able to rejoin their families in Sweden."" But presiding judge Shemsu Sirgaga said the two ""have not been able to prove that they did not support terrorism."" ""They have shown that they are esteemed journalists, but we cannot conclude that someone with a good reputation does not engage in criminal acts,"" Sirgaga said. Both journalists pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally through Somalia without accreditation, according to the CPJ, which says Ethiopian officials deny media access without government minders. ""We have documented violations of due process and the politicization of their trial,"" the CPJ said, complaining that the government pronounced the two guilty even before the trial started. Amnesty International called for their release ahead of Tuesday's sentencing. ""There is nothing to suggest that the two men entered Ethiopia with any intention other than conducting their legitimate work as journalists. The government chooses to interpret meeting with a terrorist organization as support of that group and therefore a terrorist act,"" said Claire Beston with the human rights group. In a statement issued in September, Kontinent said that its journalists do not take sides or participate in any conflict and report under international rights regarding freedom of the press, which it believes should be upheld by any government. The trial against the journalists turned into a fight for press freedom in Ethiopia, according to international journalists' organizations. In a letter sent to the United Nations, Reporters without Borders accused Ethiopia of using its anti-terrorism law to lessen press freedom and penalize free speech. ""In the name of the fight against terrorism, the government muzzles dissident and critical voices, thus abusing human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" wrote the secretary general of Reporters without Borders, Jean-Francois Julliard. CNN's Per Nyberg and Sarah Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: A long prison term in Ethiopia could be a death sentence, the journalists' agency says .

"(CNN) -- Europe, struggling under a debt crisis which has crippled the eurozone's economy, is facing a ""lost decade,"" according to the head of manufacturing giant Hilti. Bo Risberg, chief executive of Lichtenstein-based Hilti, told CNN that Europe is in a critical condition and businesses are likely to face the impact for years to come. ""We will have a very difficult decade, a lost decade you can call it,"" Risberg said. ""Fundamentally there is so much austerity needed in order to get back into a reasonable debt situation it will [continue to] impact the economy in Europe. There will be some tough times ahead."" Risberg -- head of a company which employs 20,000 people across 120 countries -- says Europe's debt crisis cannot be allowed to worsen. ""What we are seeing now in Greece is practically a default, with a 50% write down [on its debts], but we can't afford that in Italy, Spain and Portugal,"" said Risberg. ""We are just transferring from the more prudent countries to the countries that have big loans -- so it won't work."" The European Central Bank, which has propped up struggling countries through the debt crisis by buying their debt in the open markets -- thus bringing down the cost of funding -- has come under pressure to do more to save Europe. But Risberg is wary about the ECB becoming more active. ""The answer is not to print money from the ECB,"" he said. Such a move would be ""dangerous,"" he added, saying the potential for hyperinflation would be catastrophic. Risberg said Europeans need to be accept the introduction of austerity measures, noting southern Europe's economy will be ""in very bad shape"" for years to come. ""Those who are agile and flexibility will come out stronger in the crisis -- those who are not will not survive,"" he added.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Veteran sports broadcaster Jim Huber, a former CNN journalist, died Monday at the age of 67. He was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia. Huber, who spent more than 27 years with Turner Broadcasting, most recently worked for Turner Sports' TNT network, covering golf and the NBA. ""We are saddened by the passing of our colleague and friend Jim Huber,"" said David Levy, president of sales, distribution and sports for Turner Broadcasting. Before his move to Turner Sports, Huber was an anchor for CNN/Sports Illustrated, a 24-hour sports news network.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Galaxy reached Major League Soccer's (MLS) championship match on Sunday after a 3-1 defeat of Real Salt Lake in the Western Conference final. The Galaxy, two-time MLS Cup winners, reached the deciding game for a record seventh time thanks to goals from captain Landon Donovan, American Mike Magee and Ireland striker Robbie Keane in front of their home fans at the Home Depot Center. Manager Bruce Arena's Galaxy will face Houston Dynamo in the post-season's final match, after Dynamo beat Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference final. The final, which will take place at the Home Depot Center, could be midfielder David Beckham's last match for Los Angeles, with the former England captain's contract expiring at the end of the season. But Beckham, 36, is focused only on the upcoming match with Dynamo, after playing in the MLS Cup 2009 when the Galaxy were beaten by Real Salt Lake in a penalty shoot-out. ""We're happy to be winning the Western final, but we know that there is one more game to go so we're not getting carried away,"" the former Real Madrid and Manchester United star told the league's official website. ""We did that a couple of years ago and we paid for it. We didn't win the MLS Cup final, so hopefully this will be something that we're happy to win [on Sunday], but we know that we've got one more game."" Galaxy went ahead on 23 minutes when Donovan, 29, converted a penalty after Andy Williams' push on Omar Gonzalez. Dynamo responded almost immediately, striker Alvaro Saborio scoring with a close-range header to equalize after 25 minutes. Beckham, capped 115 times by England, helped Galaxy regain the lead on 58 minutes, his pin-point cross headed home by Magee. Former Tottenham and Liverpool forward Keane secured the win for Galaxy with 22 minutes remaining, wriggling free of his marker before firing a low shot beyond Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimandi. Dynamo needed second half goals from defender Andre Hainault and forward Carlos Costly to see off the challenge of Sporting Kansas City in front of a record crowd at Livestrong Sporting Park.

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- A man who killed five people and himself in a gun and grenade attack in Belgium feared going back to prison and losing the life he had built, his lawyer said Thursday. The attack on a crowded market square in Liege Tuesday by Nourdine Amrani, which also left at least 130 people wounded, shocked the nation. His defense lawyer in Liege, Jean-Francois Dister, told CNN Amrani had called him late Monday and early Tuesday after the police called him in for interview Tuesday afternoon over a sexual assault case. ""It wasn't so much life in prison that bothered him -- he'd served time already -- but it was he'd rebuilt his life on the outside, and he was worried about losing all this,"" Dister said. The lawyer said he was stunned when he heard later that day that Amrani, whom he had known for two-and-a-half years, was responsible for the grenade attack. ""It's very shocking. I don't understand the reason why he did this, and I think I will probably never understand,"" he said. Nonetheless, Dister's comments give the first real insight into what might have motivated Amrani to go on a rampage that targeted people waiting at a bus stop by a busy Christmas market. After the attack, police also found a dead woman in a residence next to a workshop where Amrani once grew marijuana, a local police spokesman said Wednesday. Amrani had previously served time in prison for rape and drug trafficking offenses, his lawyer said. He was released last year. Dister said Amrani was also convicted on weapons charges in 2008 but later acquitted. Liege authorities have not said he was cleared on those counts. Liege prosecutor Danielle Reynders told CNN Wednesday that the police interview involved a sexual assault case, rather than a rumored rape allegation. ""Because Amrani was convicted of rape in 2003, police obviously regarded him as a person of interest,"" Dister said. Dister said his client, who had a Belgian partner whom Dister had met several times, feared losing everything. ""He was someone that was integrated into society. He felt Belgian. I'm not sure if he was a practicing Muslim but he knew about his culture and his roots,"" Dister said. ""When things were going well for him he was very pleasant and good-natured. I never had problems with him. But, that said, sometimes when legal proceedings were dragging on, or he was accused of things he claimed (he) was not responsible for he could become annoyed and agitated -- but it was in words only."" Dister said Amrani did not to his knowledge take drugs and had not been charged with drugs use. Authorities will conduct an autopsy in part to see whether Amrani was under the influence of drugs during the attack, said a senior Belgian security source who has been briefed on the investigation but did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. It is not yet clear how Amrani, who Reynders said was a Brussels-born Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent, obtained the pistol, semi-automatic rifle and three grenades he used in the attack. Katrin Delcourt, a spokeswoman for the provincial governor's office, described Amrani Wednesday as having significant gunsmith and firearms skills. For a period up to 2008, he held a French hunting license under which he bought at least one weapon, she said, but that license was revoked as a result of the police investigation that led to his conviction on arms and drugs trafficking offenses in 2008. The weapons he owned then were destroyed and police are continuing to investigate whether the arms used in Tuesday's attack were bought on the black market, Delcourt said. One of the weapons he had, a light automatic rifle, is a standard weapon in the Belgian army, she said. Amrani left no explanation for his actions, investigators have said.","Amrani's lawyer says his client feared losing the life he had rebuilt after a past prison term .

"(CNN) -- Paul Nicklen makes friends with polar wildlife, photographing seals, polar bears, narwhals and others in remarkable closeups. And Nicklen, a contributing photographer for the National Geographic, is passing along a message from the creatures he sees in the Arctic and Antarctica: They're in trouble. The reason is that the sea ice is disappearing, removing a key element from the environment sustaining life. Nicklen, whose work has been recognized with multiple awards, tracked the rare spirit bear for a National Geographic cover story. From the age of 4, when his family moved to Inuit territory in Canada, Nicklen has explored the region, in later years as a biologist and a photographer. He spoke at the TED2011 conference in Long Beach, California, in March, where he was interviewed by CNN. Watch Paul Nicklen's TED Talk . Nicklen pitched a project to the National Geographic on the leopard seal, a 12-foot long, 1,000-pound creature with a ferocious reputation. He was prepared for hostility but upon spotting one, he was surprised to find it tried to feed him its prey, penguins. ""So I went there terrified of what I might meet in this leopard seal and actually was nurtured and protected and cared for,"" he said in the interview. ""It was the most incredible encounter of my career by far."" Nicklen said that polar bears could face extinction within 50 to 100 years if ice continues to recede. ""We know the science. We know that ice is disappearing and after a while it just becomes a statistic. And with my photography I want people to understand that if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.

"(CNN) -- Let me begin by saying that if Mr. Martin so much as breathes a word about George Blanda, Earl Campbell or Warren Moon, I win this debate. Seriously, they are Tennessee Titans (aka ex-Houston Oilers) and, thus, completely off limits when speaking of the Houston Texans. You may be thinking, ""That's an unsporting way to begin an argument."" Well, I'm in a pretty unsporting mood after my Cowboys -- again -- choked down the backstretch, looking more like a team playing Five-Mississippi Rush than one of the greatest sports franchises on Earth. But they are still Texas' team. Hell, they're America's team. Don't let anyone tell you differently. Since the glorious days (and hair) of Jimmy Johnson, when Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin owned the NFL -- tallying three Super Bowl victories in the '90s -- the headline has been the same: ""Playoff victory escapes Cowboys."" There are two unremarkable exceptions, of course, one being when we pounded Philly by 20 in a 2010 NFC Wild Card bout. That's irrelevant to this conversation, but I wanted to take a shot at those ornery Eagles fans so they'll write hyperbolically nasty things about me below. It's how they roll. Back to the conversation at hand ... Mr. Martin argues from a relative vantage point. The Cowboys, quite simply, suck lately. Read why Martin believes Houston is the new face of Texas football . The running backs are like delicate, porcelain dolls. The secondary and o-line look like sieves. Dez Bryant thinks wide receivers get new contracts for spending everything from their first one. Our quarterback ticked off some voodoo priest who now spends his Decembers stabbing the daylights out of his Tony Romo doll. And the team is owned by a megalomaniac who believes prowess as a college football player and oilman qualify him to be the only NFL owner with a general manager title. This, after two playoff wins in 15 years. Yet all this negativity does nothing to tilt the Cowboys' crown. It doesn't even scuff the throne. The Cowboys rule Texas, and no 2002 upstarts from Houston enjoying their first playoffs can take that away. That doesn't mean the Texans haven't done something impressive. Most fans (especially I) would be thrilled to see their team lose its top quarterback, running back, wide receiver, linebacker and cornerback for various stints yet still make the postseason. It's commendable, but I'm afraid it will come to a Cowboys-esque ending Saturday versus the Bengals. I could be wrong, but Las Vegas isn't exactly inspired when you're favored by three at home. Win or lose, Houston has a long road to rival the Cowboys, whose eight Super Bowl appearances are tied for most ever. Our five Super Bowl wins are second only to the Pittsburgh Steelers (hurt to write that). Did I mention Saturday will mark the Texans' first playoff game? Ever? The franchise isn't old enough to have a Hall of Famer. Our Ring of Honor -- What? No Ring of Honor in Houston? -- is rife with legends. In addition to the aforementioned Triplets of the 1990s, there's Landry, Schramm, Lilly, Renfro, Dorsett, Hayes, Staubach and White. Those are just the HOFers. I'm not counting Larry Allen, Drew Pearson, Chuck Haley, Cliff Harris, Don Perkins or Don Meredith (and if anyone has a clue how Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones isn't in the Ring, let me know.) Though down now, the 'Boys used to be mainstays in the playoffs. In the '70s, it was more common to see them in the NFC Championship than not. That's when they became America's Team. I know the moniker riles folks up, and it should. If you aren't a Cowboys fan, then your squad isn't America's Team. I'd be sad and envious, too. Before Packers and Steelers fans start squawking about merchandise sales or some poll their pal e-mailed to them, let me assure you that none other than NFL Films christened us America's Team. Because the Cowboys had so many fans in every city, narrator Bob Ryan was compelled to say during a 1978 highlight film, ""They appear on television so often that their faces are as familiar to the public as presidents and movie stars. They are the Dallas Cowboys, America's Team."" Ryan said later he thought it was a ""catchy highlight title"" that would never stick. But it did, and that's what we call Dallas now. Get your own nickname. It will take decades or longer before Mr. Martin and I can seriously discuss whether the Texans rival the Cowboys in the Lone Star State (which, to be sure, is a reference to the state flag and not the Cowboys' helmet). Maybe if Houston had bought the Oilers that ill-advised stadium Bud Adams wouldn't have shipped Mr. Martin's boys off to Nashville. Say what you will about our megalomaniac oilman owner, but at least he'd never leave Big D. That's because the Cowboys are part of an elite class of franchise whose brethren include the Yankees and Celtics. No matter how much hatred they inspire, there will be millions who love them. They're in Dallas, New York and Boston to stay. Can you imagine Jerry Jones threatening to move his team to Tennessee and change their name to the Memphis Cowboys? Yeah, me neither.","Eliott McLaughlin takes issue with Roland Martin's assertion that the Texans are Texas' team .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Activists say the U.S. is handing the enemy a victory the longer it allows the detention of enemy combatants at the U.S Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""When we leave them at Guantanamo, in a military prison, we give them a status they don't deserve,"" said John Hutson, a former U.S. Navy judge advocate general. ""We make them heroes and martyrs to their friends and colleagues back in terrorist camps,"" he said. Ten years after the first detainees were brought to Guantanamo from what was considered the battlefield in Afghanistan after 9/11, constitutional and judicial experts held a news conference Wednesday to say the Obama administration needs to restore American values of human rights and the rule of law. Hundreds of protesters rallied later outside the White House as part of the event, with organizers saying the rally was to ""call on President Obama to keep his promise and shutter Guantanamo Bay now."" Under the Bush administration, the United States claimed that Guantanamo Bay detainees are not on U.S. soil and therefore not covered by the U.S. Constitution, and that ""enemy combatant"" status means they can be denied some legal protections. President Barack Obama in January 2009 ordered the camp to be closed within a year, citing security concerns. But as of July of last year, 171 detainees remained at Guantanamo. Their prolonged and murky circumstances were the focus of the Wednesday event. ""There is no case that is so important that we should sacrifice our dedication to human rights and rule of law,"" Hutson said. ""It's not a rule of law unless it applies all the time, and it's not a human right unless it applies to all people."" Morris Davis, a former chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo, said political interference from back home during the Bush administration blocked any basis for a fair trial. ""Initially I was probably the leading proponent for Guantanamo, and for military commissions,"" Davis, a retired Air Force colonel, said Wednesday. But he eventually resigned after he said the Bush administration pressured him to use evidence he felt was obtained through torture. ""I believed at the time that we were committed to having full, fair and open trials,"" Davis said. ""I resigned when I lost confidence that that was our commitment."" Obama, in a 2009 speech delivered in Cairo, Egypt, acknowledged that the U.S. had acted ""contrary to our ideals"" in the time that followed the 9/11 attacks. After telling his Middle East audience he had ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture,"" Obama then said he had ""ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed,"" on a timetable that would have ended about a year ago. ""If we roll up the Constitution every time that there's a difficult factual situation, we might as well roll up the entire democracy,"" said Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Talat Hamdani, a Muslim American whose son died in the attacks on World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, spoke at the rally in front of the White House. ""We say we are not at war with Islam, yet actions do speak louder than words,"" Hamdani said. ""Guantanamo is a shame -- a disgrace for our nation and we need to set the record straight by leading by example."" Despite a steady downpour of rain, the large group of protesters -- including some in orange jumpsuits symbolizing the Guantanamo Bay detainee uniforms, marched past the White House and on to the Supreme Court following the rally.

"(CNN) -- Alabama exacted revenge and clinched the Bowl Championship Series title on Monday night, besting Louisiana State University 21-0. The Crimson Tide cleared up past problems with its special teams, kicking five field goals to become champions of college football. Alabama's stifling defense battered LSU the entire game, holding the Tigers to just five first downs. ""It was great team win. Our defense did a good job. Our offense controlled the momentum and our special teams played well,"" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. Monday's game was a far cry from the two Southeastern Conference rivals' last showdown. Both teams went into that game on November 5 undefeated. College football pundits dubbed it the game of the century and Alabama lost 9-6 in overtime. In that game, Alabama missed four field goals, including one in overtime. This time, Alabama's kicker Jeremy Shelley hit five field goals, giving Alabama a commanding 15-0 lead in the fourth quarter. Crimson Tide's star running back Trent Richardson broke a 34-yard touchdown with less than five minutes left. ""I am happy and proud of my players, the way they responded to the pain and disappointment of losing the last time,"" Saban said . Alabama's offense was dealt a huge blow early in the game. Kick returner Marquis Maze injured his leg in the second quarter after running a 49-yard punt return. Maze, who is also Alabama's big-play wide receiver, left the game and never returned. But Alabama was able to overcome the loss and moved the ball up and down the field all game long, to the chagrin of the thousands of purple-and-gold-clad LSU fans who packed the Superdome in New Orleans. By the fourth quarter, the stands seemed like a sea of crimson as Alabama fans celebrated. The loss ends LSU's undefeated streak, . ""My locker room is hurting right now,"" LSU coach Les Miles said after the game. ""We did not get it going offensively at all. Our defense was on the field a long time.Give credit to our opponents on that. It became very hard to get first downs.

"(CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman called it stupid. His rival Ron Paul denounced it. But perhaps most appalled by a ""China Jon"" ad on YouTube were Hindus in America. An amateurish video posted by self-characterized Paul supporter NHLiberty4Paul questions Huntsman's ""American values,"" shows Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, speaking in Mandarin and calls him the ""Manchurian Candidate."" So why is that so offensive to Hindus? The ad also shows images of Huntsman with his two adopted daughters -- one from China and the other, India. The Huntsmans adopted Indian daughter Asha Bharati from the western state of Gujarat in 2006. The ad asks: ""Share our values? A man of faith?"" as a photograph flashes of Huntsman with an infant Asha Bharati. Both are a wearing a red tikka, a mark associated with the sacred and often seen on foreheads at Hindu ceremonies and temples. The Hindu American Foundation objected to the insinuations made in the video. ""This deplorable ad is blatantly racist and religiously intolerant, and crosses all lines of acceptable political discourse,"" said Suhag Shukla, the foundation's managing director and legal counsel. ""Instead of vilifying Governor Huntsman, he should be applauded for being open-minded enough to raise his adopted daughter as a Hindu,"" she said. Huntsman, a Mormon, is raising Asha ""to learn about and appreciate her native culture and the faiths associated with it,"" his spokesman told CNN last summer. The advertisement was posted on YouTube earlier this week. An e-mail attempt to reach NHLiberty4Paul was not immediately successful. A description accompanying the video states that ""Ron Paul is the only authentic conservative in this race, and the only one capable of bringing authentic change to Washington. He is the only sole alternative to flip-floppers responsible for the costly mistakes of the past."" At a campaign stop Friday in Concord, New Hampshire, Huntsman told reporters that Paul should disavow the ad. ""If the group is in any way affiliated with his organization, of course he should,"" Huntsman said. ""It's just political campaign nonsense. It happens from time to time."" He described how his Chinese daughter Gracie Mei was found abandoned in a vegetable market and taken to an orphanage as a newborn. Now 12, Gracie Mei is a fixture on the Huntsman campaign. The GOP contender often endearingly refers to her as his top foreign policy adviser. In all, the Huntsmans have seven children. ""To attack a candidate's family, particularly his young daughters, is completely unacceptable and should be denounced by all Americans,"" said Samir Kalra, director of the Hindu Foundation. Paul, meanwhile, told CNN that he disavowed the ad and had no control of his supporters' actions. ""Of course I denounce it ... but people do that, and they do it in all campaigns,"" Paul said.

"London (CNN) -- A Claude Monet pastel drawing of London's Waterloo Bridge has gone on display in the Savoy hotel room where it was created 110 years ago. Monet drew the bridge across the Thames during a stay in room 618 at the hotel -- now known as the Monet Suite -- in January 1901. He had intended to paint the view from his balcony in oils, but his art supplies and canvases were delayed on their way from his home in France. On Monday, the picture -- one of 26 pastel views of the river created by the impressionist -- returned, albeit temporarily. It will be exhibited at the hotel until December 16. ""Since opening in 1889, the Savoy has played host to numerous artists, such as Whistler and Picasso,"" said manager Kiaran MacDonald. ""However Monet's views of the Thames are without doubt the most celebrated works of art associated with the hotel."" The picture is the only one of Monet's pastels of the river not in a museum collection. It is currently owned by a private gallery, Trinity House, and is for sale for a reported $2.32m. Monet (1840-1926) lived in London during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, and visited the city on several other occasions, in order to depict its buildings through the then-famous fog. ""London would be quite ugly if it was not for the fog,"" he wrote in a letter from the Savoy on an earlier stay in 1900.","Monet pastel drawing of London's Waterloo Bridge on display at the Savoy hotel .

"Washington (CNN) -- New Hampshire Republican political pros are not expecting a big surprise when the state's voters cast their ballots in Tuesday's GOP presidential primary, seeing an easy victory for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. But the race for second place is much less clear. A CNN survey of 52 New Hampshire GOP insiders found that only one thought Romney would lose the primary, and that was to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. This group included Republican leaders in both chambers of the state Legislature, local elected and party officials, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous primary campaigns, GOP political consultants and other party activists. (Those surveyed were granted anonymity for their individual responses to encourage candor. The names of the insiders who participated in this survey appear at the end of this article.) The political insiders also thought that while Romney's margin of victory would be substantial, he would not crack 40 percent. When their predictions for what percentage of the vote each candidate would receive were averaged, Romney came out with a victory of 19 percentage points over Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, followed closely by Santorum. Percentage of primary vote expected . Mitt Romney -- 37% . Ron Paul -- 18% . Rick Santorum -- 16% . Newt Gingrich --12% . Jon Huntsman -- 12% . Rick Perry -- 4% . Others -- 1 % . The CNN insiders closely mirror the most recent statewide poll of likely GOP voters from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire, which indicates a strong lead for Romney, but the same list of other candidates vying for the No. 2 position. Second place could be key coming out of New Hampshire and going into the contentious South Carolina primary January 21. ""Other than Romney right now, feels like the junior varsity on the field,"" said one New Hampshire GOP insider. Another said, ""I believe like so many (that) it's Romney's to lose."" Since finishing second in the GOP presidential primary here four years ago to Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Romney has continued to court New Hampshire Republican activists and maintained a home on Lake Winnipesaukee, about an hour north of Manchester. So far, none of the other candidates has been able to knock down Romney in a state with a tradition of humbling front-runners. All the other contenders seem to have significant flaws, at least in the eyes of local party activists. Paul: Too 'wacky'? Paul, who commands a loyal following in the state, faces two of the same hurdles that he faced in Iowa: the view among many in the party -- fair or unfair -- that he can't defeat President Barack Obama in November, and his isolationist foreign policy views, which are anathema to many Republicans. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in New Hampshire? Perception that he can't win in the general election -- 50% . His stance on foreign policy -- 48% . Paul is too extreme for New Hampshire (volunteered) -- 2% . ""He has a ceiling to grow entirely because of his foreign policy views,"" one New Hampshire GOP insider said. ""He has his bloc; they are passionate and not going anywhere."" Others said they feel that Paul's foreign policy stance feeds into a broader impression of 76-year-old congressman and his campaign. ""He's often wacky,"" another GOP insider said. ""And his supporters turn off regular voters with their messianic zeal."" Santorum: Not enough time . Hoping to build on his near-victory in the Iowa caucuses, Santorum has held town-hall meetings throughout the state taking questions from all comers. Doing so earns him points from locals who believe they have a duty to cross-examine White House hopefuls, but it also has led to a number of hard questions about Santorum's strenuous opposition to same-sex marriage, which at times put him on the defensive. Indeed, a slight majority of the New Hampshire GOP insiders said they felt Santorum's stance on social issues was a major handicap for him in the state. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Santorum in New Hampshire? His views on social issues are too conservative for many Republican and independent voters -- 52% . He doesn't have enough time or money to capitalize on his Iowa caucus showing -- 44% . Both (volunteered) -- 2% . Perception that he can't win the nomination -- 2% . Indeed, one New Hampshire insider said that brief window between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary helps Santorum because it ""minimizes the time for him to spout off on (the) social conservative agenda and turn off late deciders."" But others said they thought that if he had had more than a week to campaign, Santorum might have been able to at least partially overcome his perceived liability on social issues. ""Despite his social conservative views in New Hampshire, I believe he could gain more momentum here if he had more time because of the kind of grass-roots campaigner he is,"" one GOP insider ventured. ""Not sure he could win, but he could beat Paul."" Huntsman: Too moderate? If Santorum has a problem in New Hampshire because some of his views are too conservative, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who was ambassador to China during the first two years of the Obama administration, has to deal with the view that he's too moderate for the state's GOP primary electorate. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Huntsman in New Hampshire? Perception that he's too moderate -- 50% . Perception that he can't win the GOP nomination -- 40% . His message has been muddled (volunteered) -- 10% . ""Yes, he has appeared too moderate, and yes, he is perceived as someone who can't win the nomination,"" one GOP insider said. ""But the reason that both of those have been obstacles for Huntsman is because his message has been all over the place, with no discipline, no definition."" Another echoed, ""I think his biggest obstacle has been his campaign's confusing messaging. Within the span of a few months, they tried to convey him as the common-sense moderate and the true conservative."" Gingrich: Too much of a Washington insider? As for Newt Gingrich, it was clear what his biggest problem was in the New Hampshire -- the view that his business ties to companies such as Freddie Mac left the former House speaker open to the charge that he's part of the influence-peddling culture of Washington. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Gingrich in New Hampshire? His consulting for the government mortgage-giant Freddie Mac and other interests -- 63% . His personal life -- 27% . Weak staff and campaign in the state (volunteered) -- 8% . Consulting and personal life (volunteered) -- 2% . ""New Hampshire Romney surrogates were pounding him every chance they got,"" one GOP insider said, citing Gingrich's vulnerability on his consulting ties. The CNN New Hampshire GOP insiders were surveyed from Friday to Sunday afternoon. The survey was conducted over the Internet. The New Hampshire insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers to encourage candid responses. Half of the insiders said they were formally aligned with one of the presidential campaigns, and half said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate.

"(CNN) -- An Australian man sentenced to 500 lashes and a year in prison after his conviction on blasphemy charges in Saudi Arabia is headed home after his punishment was greatly reduced, officials said Thursday. Mansor Almaribe was arrested and convicted in mid November in the city of Medina. Australia had appealed for leniency after popular outcry followed his sentence. Saudi officials responded by pardoning Almaribe from his prison term and reducing the lashing sentence to 75 lashes, the ministry said. ""His corporal punishment was also greatly reduced and administered in a way that did not cause physical harm,"" it said. The ministry did not elaborate on how the lashing was carried out., though observers have suggested the punishment could be done in a largely ceremonial and non-harmful manner. It's unclear if that's what occurred. It's also unclear what the 45-year-old Shia Muslim from Australia's Victoria state said or did to get arrested. Australian officials said they were told Almaribe made comments ""insulting to prophet Mohammed's relatives."" ""I don't think my dad would even survive 50 lashes not 500,"" his son said last month. ""He goes to the doctor every week for checks ups. He has knee injuries and back injuries from a car accident and he also has diabetes and high blood pressure."" The family spent weeks searching for the Iraqi-born father of five after he went missing in early November while performing the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of people died as heavy rain caused flooding and mudslides in Brazil this week, officials said Tuesday. A mudslide early Monday in Sapucaia, Rio de Janeiro, killed at least 13 people, city officials said in a written release. One person died in Laje do Muriae, Rio de Janeiro, city officials said. In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, at least people 15 died amid the rain as 116 cities have declared a state of emergency, the state-run Agencia Brasil reported. Officials at the site of the mudslide in Sapucaia estimated Tuesday that at least nine people were still buried. Seven cities in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area were under a state of emergency. January is traditionally a month with heavy rain. A year ago, more than 800 people died because of floods in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

"(CNN) -- Visiting New Hampshire, it appears that Mitt Romney is well poised to sweep through the Granite State, and probably South Carolina and Florida, on toward the nomination. But the campaign here suggests that, as he looks toward November, darkish clouds loom on the horizon. New Hampshire voters love to surprise, and perhaps they will again this time. Some 37% remain undecided (according to a WMUR/UNH poll released Friday), and one can never be certain how many independents will vote nor whom they will support -- especially with Romney making several unforced errors in the past 48 hours. Still, he has been a steady front-runner for months: His Massachusetts background makes him nearly a favorite son for many New Hampshire Republicans, and far more than in Iowa, his message of job creation resonates in this hard-hit state. He is almost cruising to victory. So, the first question the press is asking is not whether he will win but by how much. If his vote total is in the mid-30s or better and he wins by double digits, the media will call it a major victory; if above 40, he will ""crush."" Only if he goes below 30, and that seems unlikely, will be he be seriously hurt. Follow developments on the CNN Political Ticker's live blog . The related question is how others will stack up behind him. If there has been real news so far in New Hampshire, it is the lackluster performance of Rick Santorum. Typically, a candidate who came out of nowhere in Iowa to nearly win (what a difference those eight votes have made) would have built on that momentum in the first primary state. But Santorum appears to have plateaued and may even be fading. That means the conservatives still don't have a darling to rally behind in South Carolina, leaving Romney once again to divide and conquer. Meanwhile, the Jon Huntsman team hopes that he can break through to second in New Hampshire or at least be in a tight cluster with Ron Paul. That would give him a chance to compete elsewhere, especially in Florida (where he first planned to have his headquarters). But the fact that no one is yet challenging Romney for the brass ring this Tuesday means he is closing in rapidly on the nomination. Only one Republican (President Ford in 1976) has ever won back-to-back in Iowa and New Hampshire, and never before has a nonincumbent Republican done it. With a victory in South Carolina, Romney would be 3-0. With most of his rivals already forced to scrimp and save, who could raise enough money to take him on after that? Even so, one cannot escape the sense in New Hampshire that if he is the nominee, Romney and his team still have serious work to do if they want to defeat President Obama. That was instantly apparent Sunday afternoon when Romney appeared with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey at a rally in Exeter, New Hampshire, drawing one of the biggest crowds of his campaign. While supportive of their guy, the crowd seemed relatively quiet, almost subdued, a sharp contrast to the electric rallies that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama held four years ago. Granted, the Democrats were locked in a much closer race. But several veterans of New Hampshire politics say that the energy isn't flowing as it has in years past. That is consistent with a Pew poll announced Monday that found only 51% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters nationwide rating this year's candidates as excellent or good, compared to 68% four years ago (and compared to 78% on the Democratic side in 2008). Another striking (and related) impression on Sunday came with the speaking lineup. Normally, as a special guest, Christie would have taken the microphone first, warmed up the crowd, and then introduced the candidate, who would turn up the juice and send people marching into the night. Instead, Romney spoke first, delivering a fairly boilerplate homily before handing off to Christie, who delivered a barn-burner (listening, one got the sense the GOP convention keynote may be in his future). Wisely, the Romney campaign prevented the narrative from becoming ""Romney opens for Christie"" by asking Ann Romney to close out the evening, which she did so with warmth and grace. Still, the odd sequencing begged the question that has been nagging the former Massachusetts governor for what feels like centuries now: Can he connect with voters strongly enough to win a general election? The other issue that arises for Romney is whether he can unite his party behind him. We have seen for some time that this is a fractured, motley field of candidates, but, listening to different campaigns (and their voters), it seems clear that, just as importantly, they may well represent a philosophically fracturing party. More than one united front, the Grand Old Party right now looks more like a group in the midst of a heated battle between at least three camps: the old-line, more moderate ""Establishment"" Republicans (a group that clearly favors Romney), the growing libertarian movement (exemplified by chief hero Ron Paul), and the more communitarian, religious phalanx of social conservatives (who propelled Santorum to near-victory in Iowa). What casts the fissures in the party in such sharp relief is how little fondness these groups seem to have for one another: Not only is it easy to imagine a typical Romney voter looking down his nose at a Ron Paul candidacy, but evangelical voters are exactly the type Romney has so singularly struggled with (as Ron Brownstein notes, he even lost ground with them from 2008 to 2012, judging from exit polls), while Paul and Santorum themselves have appeared substantially more at odds with one another in the debates than either has been with Romney. By contrast, the 2008 election on the Democratic side, while hard-fought between Clinton and Obama, was still a rivalry between two groups of voters who, in terms of policy, ultimately agreed on a great deal. Despite the fact that common wisdom deems Democrats the more diverse coalition, there was little doubt that the party's voters would stand firmly behind whichever nominee was crowned. As with the 2008 race for the Democrats, Romney's biggest advantage this cycle is that the various voters punching ballots in the GOP primaries do have one thing in common: They desperately want a new president in the White House. For many evangelicals and libertarians, opposition to Obama will ultimately outweigh distaste for Romney, if he wins the nomination -- so he is likely to be competitive as the nominee no matter what. But winning the presidency (especially against a campaigner as able as Obama, who has been shoring up his own base of late) requires generating enthusiasm from voters, and governing well requires generating even more. Which underscores a serious concern that Romney and the president should share: that either of them, winning in a squeaker, would be hard-pressed to accomplish much with the country, and their parties, as divided as they are. Both parties talk about a country in need of a level of policy change that would traditionally require overwhelming support from voters, but nothing approaching a mandate is in sight. So even if Romney is on the glide path to the nomination, he still has a lot more work to do. If he wants to challenge Obama and become a successful president, he would need to find a way to unite his ideologically fraying party, and he's definitely going to need to summon enough fire so that Chris Christie can start opening for him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","David Gergen, Michael Zuckerman: Romney appears to have an edge in GOP contest .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tipsters are coming forward with additional information regarding actress Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning death, after authorities announced two months ago they were reopening the case, a Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday. ""After the presser, we got a number of calls, and those calls were intriguing, and we're chasing those down now,"" said spokesman Steve Whitmore. Meanwhile, investigators have yet to re-interview a key witness -- Dennis Davern, the captain of yacht owned by Wood and her then-husband, actor Robert Wagner. Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had. Whitmore declined to reveal whether detectives plan to talk with Davern, saying he would ""not get into the specifics"" of the investigation. Investigators haven't re-interviewed Wagner either. Authorities have no plans to question the actor at this time, but ""who knows where things may go from here tomorrow,"" Whitmore said. ""The investigation is not closed. It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case,"" the sheriff's spokesman said. ""There are leads we're following up on and have to close them out before we say anything definitive. Sure, there is possible new information that could come out that really changes everything."" In November, homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had additional information about the actress' drowning, the sheriff's department said. ""This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case,"" Lt. John Corina said at the time. Corina declined to comment directly on statements made by Davern to some media outlets. When asked if the captain could face charges for possibly lying to authorities during the 1981 investigation, Corina responded: ""That, I can't say. We'll probably end up talking to the captain sooner or later, and we'll assess what he has to say then and now."" Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect. Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater. Her body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht, wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket, according to police reports. The autopsy report showed the actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms. ""My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,"" said Lana Wood, refering to theories that the actress voluntarily jumped from the boat. Although the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense. In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play. ""I just want the truth to come out, the real story,"" she said. Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his long silence with a detailed account of that day in ""Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,"" a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009. Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner. In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request. Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California and they invited Wood's ""Brainstorm"" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. The Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous over Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple. Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book ""Pieces of My Heart,"" also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table. After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting. Embarrassed, Davern said he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. ""They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,"" he said. A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing. Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper. Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off. Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own, he wrote. He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood. The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found. Wood's first starring role was as a child in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and Warren Beatty in ""Splendor in the Grass."" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for ""Love With the Proper Stranger"" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in ""West Side Story."" Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two popular series, ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968-70) and ""Hart to Hart"" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the ""Austin Powers"" spy spoofs.","NEW: Police receive ""intriguing"" information after recent press conference .

"(CNN) -- From his neatly-trimmed goatee to his love of fast cars and flight, it's not hard to see why Indian industrialist Vijay Mallya is often referred to as his country's Richard Branson. He's immensely rich and is frequently photographed at lavish events promoting his Kingfisher brand as a lifestyle choice for India's younger, mobile middle classes. Like Branson, Mallya's stable of businesses also includes an airline -- Kingfisher Airlines -- which risks nose-diving into a sea of debt unless the billionaire can cut costs and lighten its loans. On Tuesday, Mallya said recent flight cancellations reflected the airline's move out of loss-making routes and should not be interpreted as a sign of impending doom, despite a doubling of the airline's second quarter losses announced earlier in the day. Who is Vijay Mallya? The fast-living playboy son of one of India's most successful industrialists was just 28 when he took over the chairmanship of his father's massive beer company in the early 1980s. ""Everybody thought that I'd fritter away what I had inherited. But I was determined to prove people wrong,"" Mallya told CNN in 2007. United Breweries is now one of the world's biggest brewers. It holds about half of the market share for beer in India and claims that every single one of the country's tens of thousands of beer outlets stocks at least one of its brands. Kingfisher Premium Lager is also sold in 52 countries worldwide. But United Breweries is about much more than beer. As well as Kingfisher Airlines, the holding company includes the world's biggest spirits group, United Spirits, as well as interests in the fertilizer business, engineering, property and broadcasting. Of all its brands, Kingfisher is the most iconic. It's the name of a discontinued beer label that the young Vijay stumbled upon when he was going through the UB archives after his father bought the company in 1947. ""Something excited me about Kingfisher, you know, the bird. I saw color, I saw vibrancy, I saw movement, I saw a bit of cheekiness, you know, the kingfisher sort of fishing,"" Mallya said. He revived the beer and later put the bird on the tail of Kingfisher Airlines, which was launched in 2005 and has so far failed to fly into profit. What's up with the airline? Results released Tuesday show the airline's second quarter net loss doubled to 4.69 billion rupees ($93 million). Revenue rose 11 % as the company sought to cut costs, but it was nowhere near enough to deal with the airline's reported debt of 65 billion rupees ($1.3B). Anxious investors have been ditching Kingfisher shares, prompting the company to deny on November 11 that it had sought government aid. It admitted it had asked banks to raise its lending limits, but added that ""Kingfisher does not see any risk to its future or long term viability."" Flights have been canceled as the company tries desperately to reduce operating costs inflated by rising fuel prices. The cuts have angered travelers as well as employees whose pay was delayed. Despite soaring costs, Indian airlines have been slashing fares to compete with discount prices offered by state-owned Air India. Kingfisher has also invested heavily in the future, ordering five Airbus A380s, the first of which is due to be delivered in 2016. Is it just Kingfisher? Despite a huge rise in the number of Indians taking to the skies, the extra traffic has failed to translate into profits. Private airlines are engaged in a price war with Air India, which is being propped up by government funds. Air India is reported to have asked for another 65 billion rupees ($1.3B) in federal aid, and to have agreed with lenders to cut its annual interest payments by 13 billion rupees, according to Bloomberg. Jet Airways is also reported to be seeking to raise up to $350 million from the sale and leaseback of aircraft this quarter and other asset sales, according to Daily News & Analysis. The industry's struggles come despite impressive figures for passenger growth. According to the Centre for Aviation, India had the fastest growing domestic airline market as of September 2011, recording year-on-year growth of 18.4%. Strong growth is expected to continue as the country's young population becomes wealthier and takes advantage of the fierce competition for their cash. Outside India, high fuel prices are also taking their toll on the global airline industry. The International Air Transport Association expects the industry to make just $4 billion profit in 2011, down 78% from the figure of $18 billion recorded in 2010. What does Kingfisher plan to do? Hours after announcing the second quarter loss, Mallya again insisted the company was not seeking a government bailout. ""We have never done it, we will never do it,"" he said. He said the company had asked its lenders to help with its short-term capital needs and for concessions on interest repayments. Quoting UB Group's chief financial officer, The Economic Times reported that the airline would launch a rights issue of up to 20 billion rupees ($398M) sometime before March 2013. As one of India's richest men, Mallya has plenty of financial clout behind him. As well as dominating the drinks industry, he's a familiar face in the world of sport. He sponsors India's Formula 1 team, Force India, and owns a cricket team in the Indian Premier League. His garages house some 200 vintage cars and he owns the luxury UB City shopping mall in Bangalore, which is filled with top-notch Western brands including Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton and Gucci. It's on a street named after Vijay's father, Vittal Mallya Road.

"(CNN)  -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. A Japanese woman receives an intravenous vitamin supplement at the Tenteki Cafe in Tokyo. These intravenous vitamin ""drips"" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe. Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern. ""I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly,"" a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Café told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy. There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The ""orange"" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The ""placenta pack"" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness. Prices range from $20-$30 per injection, and nurses see about 30-40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building. ""I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy,"" a Tenteki nurse told CNN. ""Blue"" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims. Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated. ""More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses,"" particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours. Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free. According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. ""At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream,"" she said. Most of these nutrients we can get sufficient from foods, nutrients tend to be better absorbed by the body if they are consumed in foods.""","Intravenous vitamin boosts are the latest health fad in Japan .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Sony says it's not quite game over for the PlayStation 3. Contrary to reports, Sony does not plan to announce a new home video-game console at a trade show in June, said Kazuo Hirai, the company's deputy president. ""We're not making announcements at E3,"" Hirai told a roomful of reporters at the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show here Tuesday when asked about plans to announce the PlayStation 4. E3 is the annual convention in Los Angeles where game companies typically make their biggest announcements. The five-year-old PlayStation 3 will have a 10-year life cycle, Hirai said. Sony could still release a new system sometime in the next five years, of course. Sony continued to sell the PlayStation 2 system and games years after the PlayStation 3 debuted in stores. For Sony's next console, the company will not deploy a streaming delivery system like OnLive, or fully cut out disc retailers like Best Buy and GameStop, Hirai said. While Sony has increased the number of games and other media available for download or streaming through its networks, most people cannot be expected to frequently download several gigabytes worth of data, which can be a time-consuming process, he said. Sony Computer Entertainment president Andrew House said earlier that Sony is not planning to discuss a new console, the website ComputerAndVideogames.com reported on Monday. He also said that physical media, like Blu-ray discs, are currently the optimal way to deliver full games. Sony released a new hand-held game system, the PlayStation Vita, in Japan last month. It plans to start selling the Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G versions of that system in the United States on February 22. Like Microsoft has done with the Xbox 360 through Kinect, Sony is trying to extend the life of the PlayStation 3 through new accessories, like the Move controller wand, and initiatives like 3-D games. There are dozens of 3-D games now available, Hirai noted. ""We are definitely, from a Sony perspective, very committed to 3-D,"" Hirai said. ""It's going to take a little while."" Sony CEO Howard Stringer, who also attended the gathering on Tuesday, compared the uptake of 3-D gaming and video to that of color television. ""3-D is waiting to happen,"" he said. ""It's an inevitability. So be patient.""","Sony's deputy president says the PlayStation 4 will not be announced at E3 .

"Falls Church, Virginia (CNN) -- It's a Tuesday night at Nell and Matt Dillard's suburban Washington home, and the family of four is watching ""Glee,"" a scripted Fox television program. Ninety seconds into the comedy, one of the teenage female characters makes mention of Asian men and their sexual prowess. Nell Dillard immediately looks over at her 13- and 11-year-old boys watching next to her, but she sees no immediate reaction they have gotten the veiled sexually suggestive ""joke."" ""What's up with that,"" says father Matt Dillard, shaking his head at what he's just heard. ""Why throw that in this show?"" Such are challenges many families face when trying to control the video material their children receive from a range of content providers: TV, radio, Internet, mobile devices, and interactive video games. Now the Supreme Court is poised to take a fresh look at a key aspect of multimedia regulation -- ""indecent"" material aired on the broadcast networks during the supposedly ""family friendly"" prime-time hours of 8 to 10 p.m. Oral arguments in this key free-speech dispute will be held Tuesday. At issue is whether the Federal Communications Commission may constitutionally enforce its policies on ""fleeting expletives"" and scenes of nudity on prime-time television programs, both live and scripted. The agency had imposed hefty fines on broadcasters for separate incidents. An expected ruling by summer could establish important First Amendment guidelines over expressive content on the airwaves. A range of competing interests are at stake: Free speech versus censorship; regulation versus responsibility; art versus indecency. For the Dillards, the specific questions raised by this appeal are just the tip of digital iceberg. ""It's not (like) when we were kids, when there was three networks and PBS,"" Matt Dillard told CNN one recent evening. ""We've had to do the controlling over anything coming over a screen -- a TV screen, computer screen, telephone screen -- anything where there is video content or streaming. We lump all that together. ... ""It feels like the Wild West out there, where there is no rating system. We're not asking for a clampdown on free speech. They (media) have every right to that. We're just looking for the tools to help us make the best decisions for our kids."" The Case . ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are all parties in the case challenging the FCC regulations. A federal appeals court in 2010 for a second time struck down the government's policies, concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied. Pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed. The government then appealed to the high court. Controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks during the past decade, when the FCC began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. The changes became known as the Golden Globes rule, for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""Really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" The complaint against ABC involved ""NYPD Blue,"" a scripted police drama, and the CBS complaint involved ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program. The high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of ""fleeting expletives,"" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity. The court, however, refused at the time to decide whether the commission's policy violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, ruling only on its enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a New York-based federal appeals court, which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters. The nine-member bench is now ready to take a broader look at the questions presented. In fact, the government helpfully sent to each justice a DVD copy of the ""NYPD Blue"" nudity scene. There has been no word on whether they have watched it. The Justice Department, in its new appeal, lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together, saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one. Explicit language is heard with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when ""indecent"" language and images reach broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. The FCC formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. In response, a voluntary rating system used by all television networks was revised to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired. The Arguments . Family rights groups say the TV networks and their cable cousins need to be sent a strong message. ""You turn on television today, and the amount of bleeps of profane words, almost sounds like a Morse code signal. There hardly are any safe harbors today, on broadcast television, for children and families,"" said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, which helps families make ""informed television viewing decisions."" ""How does more shock, more f-bombs, more indecency serve the public interest, especially when they know children are watching,"" he said. But the networks and their programming partners worry the FCC policies are ""chilling"" their speech, forcing them to make creative compromises, for fear of sanction. ""When preparing scripts or song lyrics, they now have to concern themselves with whether something can get airplay, whether their best lines can make it on the screen. That inhibits artistic creativity,"" said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, who heads the Media Access Project, a law firm representing actors, producers, writers and musicians. ""The FCC's attempt to broaden its scope has created uncertainty, has created circumstances that force broadcasters to censor themselves needlessly and at the expense of the First Amendment. Time Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network and operates several cable networks. The Stakes . For families like the Dillards, there are no easy answers. Nell and Matt admit they sometimes disagree on what their boys should be watching. ""He, as a typical guy, may think it's OK -- some of the potty humor and guy humor -- that I think they don't need to be exposed to quite yet,"" Nell said about certain shows. Matt adds, ""We do have blockers in place that prevent the worst cases, but there are ways to get around that, from the kids' perspective and by the content providers."" The couple says parental controls and program ratings are not tools that are comfortably reliable and dependable. The Dillards say they maintain ultimate responsibility, but appreciate the fact the government maintains some regulatory control over broadcasts, supplementing their own monitoring. ""It's a business and they (broadcast networks) want advertisers and viewers. They have these cable stations they're competing with, so I think they're are going to push it as far as they can,"" Nell said. ""If you expect a show is going to be rated TV-14, you want to know there is an institution standing there to make sure the network will provide that kind of show, and if they don't, then the FCC can come in and do what they do."" But, she admits, ""It's hard for us sometimes, and you find you're sort of giving in a little bit with each time you let them (the children) watch something a little different."" The case is Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations Inc. (10-1293).","Parents face more challenges when trying to control what children see on TV .

"(CNN) -- Asian champions Al Sadd have qualified for the semifinals of the Club World Cup after beating African champions Esperance of Tunisia 2-1 in Toyota, Japan, in a match marred by crowd trouble. Esperance fans repeatedly clashed with police and stewards, with one supporter also running onto the pitch before being dragged to the ground, after their side had two goals disallowed for offside, and penalty appeals rejected, in an enthraling match. Al Sadd's victory, the fifth successive time the Asian champions have beaten their African equivalent in the tournament, means the Qatari side have secured a dream last four clash with European champions Barcelona on Thursday. Al Sadd went ahead in the 33rd minute when Khalfan Al Khalfan headed home a rebound after goalkeeper Moez Ben Cherifia failed to deal properly with Abdul Kader Keita's long-range drive. And they doubeld their advantage four minutes after the break when Lee Jung-Soo headed a free-kick across goal for captain Abdullah Koni to knock in from close range. Both teams were making their debut in the competition, and Esperance gave themselves hope on the hour mark when Ousama Darragi headed home a set-piece. But, helped by a couple of contentious decisions, Al Sadd held on and will now pit their wits against tournament favorites Barcelona. Meanwhile, in the other fixture played on Sunday, Japanese champions Kashiwa Reysol beat CONCACAF champions Monterrey of Mexico on penalties, after their match had ended 1-1. Ryohei Hayashi netted the winning spot-kick to see Kashiwa through 4-3 on penalties and seal a date with South American champions Santos of Brazil in the other semifinal on Wednesday.","Asian champions Al Sadd beat African champions Esperance 2-1 in Club World Cup .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) -- While the average American's understanding of the conflict in Kosovo is a simple, two-sided Sneetch-battle between the mountainous region's dominant Serbian minority and oppressed Albanian majority, the reality is a lot more convoluted than a Wikipedia page or morning radio parody of the Beach Boys' ""Kokomo"" can accurately convey. In addition to the Serbs in the north and Albanians in the south, Kosovo is host to a pizza pie of smaller ethnic groups like Gorans, Illyrians, and Roma scattered in enclaves throughout the entire country. During the 1998-1999 war, as the Serbian Yugoslav Army and NATO-backed Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army vied with each other to see who could rack up the most atrocities, these sub-minorities were victims of a disproportionate amount of collateral brutality. Especially the Kosovo Roma, more widely known as ""gypsies."" Of the 250,000 people displaced from their homes by the fighting, an estimated 90,000 were Roma, a figure which is a little more jarring when you realize the region's total Romani population is just a little north of 100,000. To help them deal with the refugee problem, the United Nations invited Paul Polansky, an American activist for gypsy rights, then working in Prague, to the city of Mitrovica to act as a liaison for the burgeoning community of Roma's so-called Internally Displaced People. ""The UN were having gypsies running into schoolhouses seeking shelter from the Albanians who were chasing them out of their homes,"" says Polansky from his house in Southern Serbia. ""And so they opened a few Internally Displaced People camps, but they didn't know how to work with the gypsies, so they needed an expert to actually move into the camps to live with them and advise them. That's what they brought me to Kosovo to do."" Polansky was immediately unimpressed by the conditions at the camp he moved into an old French army barracks called Osterode. See the rest of The VICE guide to the Balkans at VICE.com . ""There were about 1,800 tents put up by the 23rd Pioneer Regiment of the British Army. They were put on toxic wasteland. The land itself was lower than the road coming into the camp and so when it rained there was water in all the tents. The only food they were given was flour and beans. They needed water to cook with but there was no water for cooking, no water for cleaning, and when I complained to the UN they said, 'Well, these are gypsies, they know how to look after themselves.' It was a constant fight just to get them to deliver water. We were not guaranteed any security. The Albanians were attacking the camp. We had children die because UN police refused to take them to hospital"" Despite Polansky's efforts, conditions at the Osterode camp continued to deteriorate. The British regiment in charge of protecting the camp was withdrawn and children began to show symptoms of health effects from the campsite's proximity to dumping grounds for industrial waste. ""In 1999, some Danish soldiers on patrol in Mitroviza had shown symptoms of lead poisoning,"" Polansky told us. ""So their blood was taken, and it came back they had extremely high levels of lead poisoning. So in the summer of 2000, a UN medical team took blood tests all over Mitrovica. They found the highest lead levels were in the gypsy camps because they had been built on the tailings stands of the mines and the pollution from the smelter drifted right over their camp. Their blood samples were sent to a lab in Belgium and it was found that the children in these camps had the highest lead levels in medical literature."" Eventually Polansky got fed up with the UN's administration of the camps (or lack thereof), cut his ties with the organization, and led a large group of gypsies on a protest march to the Macedonian border. The UN responded to his accusations of negligence, saying it was investigating the matter and that they ""do not think that it would be useful to discuss the matter at this time, given that the the review of this matter is ongoing."" We were curious how this ""matter"" was going, so we decided to stop by the camp and talk to some of the residents who still haven't been evacuated from the site that is killing their children. Twelve years down the road.","American Paul Polansky investigated treatment of gypsy refugees of the Kosovo war .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Tariq al-Hashimi, Iraq's Sunni vice president, disputes the government's charges that he organized a death squad targeting government and military officials, saying the false claims are politically motivated and he has never and will never be involved in violence. ""Today it is al-Hashimi, tomorrow it will be someone else,"" al-Hashimi told reporters Tuesday in the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil, where he discussed a warrant issued for his arrest by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government. Iraqiya, the Sunni-backed but cross-sectarian political bloc to which al-Hashimi belongs, has accused al-Maliki of consolidating power, saying the Shiite-backed political leader has refused to give up control of Iraq's Interior and Defense ministries. ""I have said there is a purpose behind this and there is political assassination and today there is a fabrication to embarrass this man after all he has done over the years and despite all the sacrifices made,"" al-Hashimi said, referring to himself and his efforts to bring about political consensus in the diverse country during the post-Saddam Hussein era. ""After eight years I am rewarded with this."" The warrant issued for al-Hashimi's arrest is the latest in a series of events that have threatened to destroy Iraq's fragile power-sharing agreement between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, raising fears about the stability of the country even as the last of U.S. troops are withdrawn. The arrest warrant was issued just days after Iraqiya suspended its participation in Parliament amid claims it was being cut out of the political process. The charges appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as security guards for al-Hashimi. Iraqi state-run TV aired video of the men's confessions. CNN cannot independently verify their identities. An official in al-Hashimi's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the three men in the videotaped confessions were security guards for al-Hashimi. The official said the men did not look distressed, though they believe they were under some sort of threat to make such confessions. Among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009. The person speaking said orders at times came directly from al-Hashimi and at times through his son-in-law, Ahmed Qahtan, who is also a senior member of his staff. The man said the improvised explosive devices were produced and kept at an abandoned house belonging to al-Hashimi in the al-Yarmouk neighborhood. He also alleged that the vice president personally thanked him after a number of attacks, and that he was rewarded $3,000 after the first IED attack against a senior Ministry of Health official. The man in the video said al-Hashimi ordered him to map out security locations and checkpoints for the Baghdad Brigade, which protects the Green Zone. He said he was speaking out to ""clear his conscience"" and ""expose this criminal."" Al-Hashimi said he had been warned to adopt certain political stances or the confessions would be aired. He said foreign political agendas and other countries moved this case against him but didn't elaborate. Iraqiya members and others have said al-Maliki is backed by Iran. Addressing reporters in the country's Kurdish region, al-Hashimi indicated that the claims and the accusations that he engaged in these activities are absurd. He said the case should be transferred to the semi-autonomous Kurdish territory because of its neutrality. He also called for Arab League observers and attorneys from the Arab Lawyers Union to guarantee the fairness of any proceeding. That's because at present, he said, the country's ""judiciary has been politicized and lost its independence years ago and is controlled by the executive authority."" ""I have big question marks over these confessions they made,"" al-Hashimi said. ""They can be easily disproved and refuted. But despite that, justice must take its course and everyone must resort to it, but on the condition that the requirements for justice are available."" ""I am ready, along with my security guards, to stand in front of any judge as long as the basic requirements for justice are available,"" he said. Al-Hashimi questioned the legal procedure in the case and said airing confessions violates Iraqi law. He said federal court, and not the criminal courts, should handle charges against an Iraqi vice president. He also raised the issue of political immunity. Parliament members have immunity and cannot be prosecuted in crimes unless their immunity is lifted by the country's Council of Representatives. Al-Hashimi questioned why he doesn't have the same immunity. ""It is strange that an investigation into various, complicated and old crimes committed over the years is concluded within 48 hours,"" said the vice president. ""This proves that the confessions were ready before the arrest of some of my security guards who are suspects; they have worked with me over the past years with the utmost professionalism and no violation or acts punishable by the law were recorded against any of them."" When asked who is responsible, he said he directs ""the blame ... to Mr. Maliki."" Since October, Iraqi security forces have rounded up hundreds of people accused of being members of Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath Party or terrorists. Iraqiya says the majority of those people are members of its political bloc and that the prime minister is simply taking out his opponents. The political turmoil in Iraq is raising concerns in Washington, with officials saying they are closely monitoring the reports about the arrest warrant. ""We are talking to all of the parties. We've expressed our concern regarding these developments. We're urging all political sides in Iraq to work out their differences peaceably, politically, through dialogue, and certainly in a manner that is consistent with democratic political processes and international standards of rule of law,"" said Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department. Ambassador James Jeffrey has been in contact with all of the parties in recent hours, she said Monday. Al-Hashimi left Baghdad Monday for the Kurdish region for emergency talks with Shiite Vice President Khudayyer al-Khuzaie and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. The Interior Ministry said al-Hashimi has been banned from leaving the country. The vice president questioned statements from U.S. President Barack Obama, who recently said that U.S. troops were leaving an Iraq he described as democratic. He didn't understand if Obama is being misled or ignoring ""the reality on the ground."" ""I am a vice president addressing him today and my home is surrounded by tanks.

"(CNN) -- ""Carlos the Jackal,"" once among the world's most wanted fugitives, has been sentenced to life in prison for his role in a series of fatal bombings in the 1980s, a French court said. The 62-year-old, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was on trial for his role in the attacks on two trains, a train station and a newspaper office in France in 1982 and 1983. The bombings killed 11 and injured more than 100. He was sentenced late Thursday. The Venezuelan-born revolutionary has been serving another life sentence in France since 1997, when he was convicted for the shooting deaths of two French secret agents and an informant in 1975. Ramirez, who was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, first made headlines in 1975 when he led an attack on an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting in Vienna that took at least 60 people hostage, including 11 oil ministers. He was nicknamed ""Carlos the Jackal"" by the press, a reference to the principal character and assassin in Frederick Forsyth's novel ""The Day of the Jackal."" After two decades on the run, Ramirez was captured in 1994 in Sudan and taken to Paris in a sack. The seven-judge terrorism panel ruled after the trial that began in November.","This is a second life sentence for ""Carlos the Jackal""

"(EW.com) -- ""Joyful Noise,"" a squeaky-clean pop-gospel fairy tale featuring Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah in canned catfights, reflects the inspiration of ""Glee"" and God, in that order. The ""Glee"" side, at least in my book, doesn't exactly amount to a recommendation, but it does mean that the movie's musical numbers are catchy and rollicking and, in their bright sunshiny way, rather soulful. In the small town of Pacashau, Georgia, times are hard -- every other storefront is empty -- but the Divinity Church choir has lifted local spirits by rising to become a semifinalist in the National Joyful Noise Competition. Can these spunky vocalists go the distance? Not until they learn to work together in harmony. Which means that Vi Rose Hill (Latifah), the choir's new director, has to stop feuding with G.G. Sparrow (Parton), widow of the former choir leader, over the direction of the group's music. Vi Rose, feisty and smart-mouthed, favors tradition, while G.G., whose grandson Randy (Jeremy Jordan) is the new songbird on the block, is out to shake things up. Parton now looks like a ""Spitting Image"" puppet (the film makes plastic-surgery jokes about her so that we don't have to), but she still has a way with lines like ''I'd call you stubborn, but that'd be an insult to mules!'' ""Joyful Noise"" also finds room for a teenager with Asperger's syndrome (Dexter Darden) who loves one-hit-wonder songs (but can he learn to love himself?), as well as a romance between Randy and Vi Rose's daughter Olivia (Keke Palmer). These two are pretty -- and as bland as balsa wood. But each time the innocuousness starts to get to you, you're woken up by Randy and Olivia's swooning ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' duet, or a kid-choir rendition of Billy Preston's ''That's the Way God Planned It,'' or the final ''I Want to Take You Higher'' blowout.

"(CNN) -- Former ""Frasier"" star Kelsey Grammer and wife Kayte Walsh Grammer are expecting twins, the actor said Sunday. He made the announcement backstage at the Golden Globes after winning the award for best actor in a TV drama series for his roll in ""Boss."" ""I'm really looking forward to meeting these new arrivals in our lives, I really am,"" he said. Grammer, 56, married the 32-year-old former flight attendant in February in New York, just after Grammer's divorce became final from his third wife, Camille Donatacci, who appears on ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" He predicted Sunday that Kayte will be an ""extraordinary"" mother. ""She's one of the most loving, amazing, warm human beings I've ever met,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was sworn in for a second four-year term Saturday, extolling her country's economic stability during a time of global crisis. ""We are a new Argentina, but we are also in a new world with more challenges and more decisions to be made in the best interest of our people and society,"" she said. A bulk of her long speech focused on specifics of the Argentine economy that are impressive against the backdrop of a global downturn. Industrialization has created more than 5 million jobs during her administration and minimum wages are the highest in the region, she said. Argentina's economy could see growth of 9% in 2011, she said. Internal growth in the country was one of the main drivers that kept the economy afloat, she said. ""I don't have to read you the consumption statistics. It's enough to go to the streets in any place, in any town ... to know that the domestic market is precisely what permitted us to survive the crisis of 2008 and 2009,"" she said. While she talked a lot about specific economic indicators, Fernandez did not abandon her populist side. ""I am not the president of the corporations,"" she said. ""I am the president of the 40 million Argentinians."" Fernandez ranks as one of the most popular candidates in Argentina since its return to democracy. She won re-election with more than 54% of the vote. Her presidential campaign was also the first she had to wage without her late husband and former president, Nestor Kirchner. He was president from 2003 to 2007, when Fernandez succeeded him. He died in October of 2010. In an apparent symbol of mourning, Fernandez wore black at her swearing in. And when she took the oath of office, she asked God, country and ""he"" -- referring to her husband -- to hold her to account. Her eyes watered as she said those words. ""As everyone can imagine, today is not an easy day for this president,"" Fernandez said. ""Despite the happiness, despite the overwhelming votes, something -- and someone -- is missing."" Her second term as president extends to 2015.","Fernandez won re-election with 54% of the vote .

"Panama City (CNN) -- His fate uncertain, Manuel Noriega is being returned Sunday to Panama, nearly 22 years after the former dictator was forcibly removed from office by U.S. forces. Now 77, Noriega is being extradited this weekend from France, which got Noriega in April 2010 after he spent two decades in an American prison. Panamanian officials want him to face justice in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora, a doctor and political opponent of Noriega. Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985. After a stop in Spain, Noriega is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon in Panama City. For almost two decades, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, a key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke. Authorities have strengthened security to guarantee Noriega's safety in prison, Panamanian Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez said. ""We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects. Noriega inspires very big emotions, and Noriega's life could very well be at risk in Panama,"" Henriquez said. Judicial officials in Panama will determine whether Noriega can stand trial, Henriquez said. Interior Minister Roxana Mendez said Noriega will receive the same treatment as other inmates at the Renacer prison complex. ""The Panamanian state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex,"" Mendez said. ""However, based on our laws, and if there's a valid request from his attorneys, they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate, being over 70 years old, may face risks inside the prison complex."" Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering money through French banks. He also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. During the trial, defense lawyer Yves Leberquier tried to paint Noriega as the victim of larger geopolitical forces, accusing the United States of placing and moving pawns to serve its interests. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. Born in 1934, Noriega was abandoned by his parents at the age of 5 and raised by an aunt in a rundown district of Panama City. After failing to get into medical school, Noriega joined the army, studying at Peru's Military Academy of Chorrillos and quickly rising through the ranks. In the 1970s he served as head of military intelligence to Gen. Omar Torrijos, who had seized power in a military coup in 1968. Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega emerged as his de facto successor. By 1983 he controlled both Panama's armed forces and civilian government. In 1988 Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. Amid growing unrest in Panama, U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, claiming that Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He surrendered in January 1990 and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. During his 2010 trial in France, Noriega said, ""I received high praise from the U.S., Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs.""

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Angry protests are a common sight in Pakistan. Crowds often gather to denounce the United States or the Pakistani government, which critics accuse of being an American puppet. AntiTaliban protesters in Lahore. But in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore this week, several hundred protesters gathered on a scorching day to take on a very different target: the Taliban. ""I will fight them to my last breath and the last drop of my blood in my body. I'm not scared,"" vowed newspaper publisher Jugnu Mohsin. She was leading a crowd of several hundred students, artists, writers and others, chanting ""the Taliban is the enemy of Islam"" in Urdu. Public protests against the Taliban started cropping up in various Pakistani cities after a video emerged showing militants publicly flogging a teenage girl. The Taliban's recent declaration that the Pakistani government and judicial system are ""unIslamic"" has also outraged many educated Pakistanis. Neha Mehdi moved to Lahore to study. Now, she fears her way of life is being threatened by the Taliban. ""I cannot give up my education, and I cannot give up the way I'm living,"" the 23-year-old student said. ""These Talibans have ruined the reputation of Islam."" ""There were threats here also from the Taliban that if we gather they might just bomb us,"" Mehdi said.  Watch how the anti-Taliban movement is growing » . More than 250 miles away, Pakistan's military continued its assault against Taliban militants who want to impose a radical interpretation of Islamic law in the country's northwestern tribal regions. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the tribal belt as long as the law was imposed in accordance with the country's constitution. Mehdi and others in Lahore fear that the Taliban's version of sharia -- which forbids girls from attending school, as well as music, poetry and dance -- is slowly creeping into Lahore, the center of Pakistani culture. ""Our way of life is being threatened,"" said Kamiar Rokni, a fashion designer who took part in the protest. ""And if we don't do anything about it, then you're just going to be sitting around and one day the way you live and what this country's all about is going to stand for nothing."" Rokni said he fears the Taliban ""want to change the way we exist."" Lahore may be hundreds of miles away from the Taliban-held areas outside Islamabad, but it is no stranger to militant attacks. ""Last year we lost 39 people in acts of terrorism and this year we have lost 17 people in Lahore alone,"" Lahore police Chief Parvez Rathore said. As he speaks, a heavily armed escort is one step behind the police chief even as he walks outside the walls of the city's police headquarters. In March, gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lankan national cricket team in Lahore, killing six Pakistani police officers and the team's driver. Weeks later, militants dressed in police uniforms stormed a police training center in the city, prompting an eight-hour stand-off with police. Eight cadets were killed during the March 30 siege, which the government blamed on Pakistan's Taliban. Police in Lahore said the attacks would not have been possible without local support. Residents say there is no doubt that the Taliban have support in Pakistan's second largest city. ""They're here in Lahore, this is the thing,"" said Jamal Rahman, who plays guitar for the Lahore-based band, ""Lal"" which means ""Red."" ""Little groups of the Taliban are going around and intimidating people, causing fear, telling women to cover up and if they don't they'll shoot them."" Rahman and his cousin, Aider -- who plays flute for ""Lal"" -- are using their music to rally society against what he says is a growing threat by the Taliban. ""We want to try to get people aware, and try to get people activated and motivated to fight against this militancy,"" he said. It is unclear if the protests and rallying cries from Rahman and the others in Lahore are the start of a mass movement or simply the swan song of Pakistan's wealthy, urban elite who could be the first to leave if the suicide bombers and insurgents succeed in further destabilizing the country. Either way, their message is a sign that more Pakistanis believe the Taliban's threat is directed at them, and not just a reaction to the so-called U.S.-led ""war on terror."" Mehdi said she fears her life as a student could come to a violent end if the people of Lahore do not stand up to Islamic extremists. ""If the Taliban take over then I'll be on the road being flogged by one of them like they did in Swat and I don't want that,"" she said. Some Pakistanis are resorting to violence to defend their turf. More than 30 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi this week as members of the city's Mahajir ethnic majority group engaged in deadly clashes with ethnic Pashtuns. The Taliban is a mostly Pashtun movement. The government in Karachi has issued a ""shoot on sight"" order to security forces, to try to maintain calm in the city. A week before the clashes erupted, a leader of the MQM political party, which represents the Mahajir community in Karachi, said his supporters would fight back against what he called the ""Talibanization"" of his city. ""You have to take the nasty decisions now,"" Haider Abbas Rizvi told CNN last week. ""You have to take effective measures to control these Taliban ...otherwise the Taliban will take over.""","Protests in Lahore, Pakistan, against Taliban .

"Washington (CNN) -- Long before people posted their thoughts and feelings on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, millions of people were doing just that on a different sort of wall. It might have been something as simple as a baseball, a playing card or a walking stick. Or perhaps a more personal item, like a poem, photograph or diploma. And then there's the occasional letter, like the one dated November 18, 1989, that began: . Dear Sir, . For twenty two years, I have carried your picture in my wallet. I was only eighteen years old that day that we faced each other on that trail in Chu Lai, Vietnam. Why you did not take my life, I will never know. ... These are among the more than 100,000 objects that have been left at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall. Since its dedication in 1982, nearly 4 million people a year have visited the memorial's polished black granite wall, many to leave a personal item or note in memory of the more than 58,000 people whose names are engraved there. No one is sure who started the custom of leaving items at the wall, curator Duery Felton said. The first items began showing up even before construction on the memorial was complete. A park ranger started collecting the items, thinking people might come back for them someday. By 1986, as the objects continued to pile up, the National Park Service decided to establish an official collection. Thus was born the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Collection. The items are catalogued 12 miles away at the Museum and Archaeological Regional Storage facility in Maryland. Though it's not open to the public, traveling collections are often on display at museums both in the United States and abroad, Felton said. ""You had, for the first time that we've been able to ascertain, people coming to a public site for a protracted period and leaving unsolicited objects,"" Felton said. There is seemingly no limit to the types of artifacts that are part of the collection, from G.I. Joe action figures to crutches, dog tags, combat boots -- even a motorcycle. On any given day, the wall might be adorned with artwork, prayers, a diploma marking a missed milestone or a picture of a young child born too late for a loved one to meet. Occasionally, a note accompanies an item, but most times an object's meaning is left to interpretation. Felton, a Vietnam veteran himself, says he's wary of making assumptions about an item's meaning. Many may seem like ordinary objects, but often they hold deeper significance to either the donor or one being remembered. Felton likes to use a bag of M&Ms to make his point. The candy, which gained popularity among World War II soldiers looking for a chocolate treat that wouldn't melt, may have been left at the wall because it was a loved one's favorite, he says. More likely, though, it had something to do with the little-known fact that military doctors used M&Ms as placebos for injured soldiers when no aspirin was available. ""I look at us as being voyeurs in many ways, because we don't know the full story,"" he said. ""Outside of donor information, I can't tell you why [an] item was left."" On a more comprehensive scale, the collection serves as a record of social history, he said. The egalitarian nature of the memorial and the unprecedented public outrage that resulted from the controversial war are not unrelated, Felton said. ""This is a study. This is tangible evidence of a major epoch on the psyche of the American public,"" Felton said. ""For all intents and purposes, this collection is being curated by the public. ... It's uncensored."" And as Vietnam veterans age, it even more important to preserve these artifacts for future generations, he said. ""Almost 60 percent of today's population was not alive during Vietnam,"" he said. ""You can't tell where you are until you understand where you've been. ... We're preserving the past for the future.""","More than 100,000 objects have been left at Vietnam Veterans Memorial .

"Rio De Janeiro (CNN) -- The death toll from devastating flooding in Brazil continued to climb Tuesday, surpassing 700, the government said. A helicopter rescued 18 people from a city in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state after rains caused devastating flooding and mudslides in the mountainous region. Four children -- including a 30-day-old baby, were among those lifted to safety Monday. The Air Force said one of them -- 6-year-old Guilherme Carvalho -- summed up the feelings of the group with a simple exclamation: ""Relief!"" But rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and many more people are feared dead. Forecasters predict rain will continue for several days in areas already submerged in water. The death toll from flooding in Rio de Janeiro state has climbed to 710, according to government figures released Tuesday. And thousands are homeless across the state. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. In Rio de Janeiro state, flooding and mudslides turned the once-picturesque tourist town of Teresopolis into a wasteland. Bodies and belongings remained strewn amongst fallen boulders Monday as family members searched for loved ones in the rubble. Outside a makeshift morgue in Teresopolis -- where the government said at least 292 people had died in flooding -- a crowd of people waited for their turn to identify loved ones. Marco Antonio Siqueira Costa said the last time he saw his brother, sister-in-law and niece was a few days ago, before mud buried their house. ""I think that last meeting was God's way of granting us a farewell,"" he said. Residents in the city donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city searching desperately for missing loved ones. Meanwhile, experts and officials tried to pinpoint what caused the catastrophe. ""Combine a weather event and environmental irresponsibility and the sum equals a tragedy,"" said Carlos Minc, Rio de Janeiro's environment minister. Minc said he wants to stop construction of homes in high-risk areas, such as river banks or steep mountain slopes -- a practice that he said was encouraged by previous governments. He pointed to Nova Friburgo -- the hardest-hit city, according to government figures, which list 335 deaths due to flooding there. ""We are monitoring river levels, but it isn't enough. In Nova Friburgo, for example, we had warned six hours in advance that the river was overflowing, but...there is no emergency plan or drills with the population so they know what to do in a situation like this,"" he said. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning, and for allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016.

"(CNN) -- The man police say kidnapped and brutally murdered a 7-year-old Georgia girl pleaded guilty Tuesday and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ryan Brunn entered the plea at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse, during which he described in detail how he enticed, molested and killed Jorelys Rivera. The girl's mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing on December 2 from an apartment complex in Canton, which is about 40 miles north of Atlanta. Brunn, 20, who worked as a maintenance man at the same apartment complex, was arrested on December 7 and charged with the crime. He told the court he had never talked to Jorelys before the day of her murder. He said he devised a plan after he found one of her skates. Brunn took a picture of the skate and approached her with it, asking if the skate was hers. She said yes, and Brunn promised to take her to it. Instead, he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants. He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor. At this point, she was still alive, he told the court. So Brunn took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate. He said he did not have sex with the girl. Next, Brunn put Jorelys' body in a plastic bag and loaded it into his maintenance golf cart. He put the body in the trash compactor and operated the machine. He then went home and hung out with friends. Later, he again operated the compactor. Increasingly, Brunn told the court, he grew concerned about what he had done. So he took a receipt, wrote on the back of it, ""She is in the trash can,"" and taped it to the compactor. He admitted lying to investigators who had questioned him about the case. Brunn said he knew right from wrong. During his testimony, relatives of the slain girl were visibly upset, crying and shaking. ""I would like to apologize for everything I have done,"" Brunn told her family in court. Last week, he was indicted on 13 counts including murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to children, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes, false imprisonment, abandonment of a dead body, making a false statement and sexual exploitation of children. According to the indictment, Jorelys was severely beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the face, neck and chest. Brunn's attorney had said previously he planned to plead not guilty. Brunn had no known criminal history, authorities have said.","NEW: Ryan Brunn is sentenced to life in prison without parole .

"(CNN) -- World number two Rafael Nadal beat Milos Raonic in the second round of the Japan Open for the second successive year on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Tokyo tournament. Defending champion Nadal, top seed for the Ariake Coliseum event, completed a straight-sets 7-5 6-3 triumph without conceding a break of serve against his Canadian opponent. ""His serve was impressive, especially at the beginning of the match,"" Nadal told the ATP Tour's official website of his 20-year-old opponent. ""It was an important victory for me and now I am in the quarterfinals. Physically I feel fine and I have the motivation to keep going and keep practising hard.""

Meanwhile at the China Open in Beijing Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga moved into the quarterfinals by knocking out Chinese wildcard Ze Zhang. World No. 7 Tsonga, top seed for the tournament, continued his quest for a seventh career Tour title with a 6-3 6-4 success in 77 minutes.

"(CNN) -- Struck by lightning, caught up in the smell of gas, braving two-inch hail and relentless rain: None of it could stop hundreds of firefighters, police officers, medical personnel, National Guardsmen and more from heading into the devastation around Joplin, Missouri, in a desperate search for survivors. Nor could the fact that many of the first responders searched through the rubble of buildings at the same time many of their own homes had been eviscerated. Amidst the struggles, there were victories: 17 people were rescued Monday, city manager Mark Rohr told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. ""They've lost their homes, but they have been out there for 40 hours saving lives,"" Richard Serino, deputy administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said from Joplin. ""The work they have done ... to say it is to be commended is an understatement."" Not much more than 12 hours after the tornado touched down, Rohr said that between 400 to 500 firefighters, public works personnel and other municipal employees showed up Monday morning, unasked, hoping to help. The city manager said that the turnout, and the fact many others who have pitched in in other ways, is no surprise in Joplin, a city of 50,050 residents in southwest Missouri. ""Joplin is a city of neighbors helping neighbors,"" he said. ""And with this spirit, we will overcome the hardship."" Yet the continually confounding weather Monday proved a major challenge. Rohr said that two first responders were struck by lightning while looking through debris -- he did not detail the victims' conditions afterward -- with persistent thunderstorms prompting a temporary halt to the searches. And even by Monday evening, a full day after the twister struck, Rohr said there were ""gas leaks all over the city."" ""When we drive around, we can smell the gas,"" the city manager said. ""And there are wires down everywhere. You have just got to be careful, as you navigate through the city."" The challenge doesn't appear likely to get any easier Tuesday. The National Weather Service has said there is a 45 percent chance of another tornado outbreak between 4 p.m. and midnight Tuesday over a wide swath that includes cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City and -- yet again -- Joplin. Those assisting in the rescue effort weren't just from Joplin. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon noted that some of the more than 1,000 first responders came from Kansas City and other locales. That doesn't include the 110 highway patrolmen and 250 National Guardsmen -- with another 450 on standby -- also on the scene. Dr. Jim Roscoe told CNN that doctors, nurses and others rushed to help, after the tornado ripped through St. John's Regional Medical Center. Even with often impassible roads and treacherous weather, he said that, ""within a matter of hours, we had almost more help than we could put to use."" ""I just can't begin to tell you,"" said Roscoe, who is heading the hospital's triage unit as it treats and redirects patients coming in for help. ""We've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away, grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get, and threw it in their car and came."" Whether treating patients and searching for bodies, those on the frontlines in Joplin also face a significant psychological toll of dealing with devastation that most of them have never seen before. Nixon said they would likely have ""very difficult shifts, (because) there are going to see things out there that are hard to see and hard to stomach."" Still, voicing a sentiment echoed by officials and residents in Joplin, the governor said it wouldn't prevent the first responders from heading out again, looking for survivors. ""We are going to cover every foot of this town, and we're going to make sure that every person is accounted for,"" Nixon said.","Hundreds hit the streets of Joplin, despite thunderstorms, looking for tornado survivors .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan is prepared to gradually reduce the amount of oil it imports from Iran, Finance Minister Jun Azumi said Thursday, as the United States seeks to muster international support to put fresh pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program. Japan imports 10% of its crude oil from Iran at the moment, Azumi said at a news briefing after meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The country is ready to decrease that level ""in a planned manner,"" he said. ""What I told the secretary is that we have already reduced Iranian oil imports by 40% in the past five years,"" Azumi said, standing next to Geithner. ""The nuclear development issue is an issue that the international community cannot overlook, so we very much understand the U.S. action."" The United States is exploring ways to cut off Iran's central bank from the global financial system and reduce the country's oil revenues, Geithner said at the briefing. Washington is in ""the initial stages of consulting with allies around the world about how best to achieve those goals,"" he said, adding that Japan's support was appreciated. ""We are working very closely with Europe and Japan and countries around the world to substantially increase the pressure we bring on Iran,"" Geithner said. The announcement is a plus for Geithner, after his efforts on Iran were rebuffed by senior Chinese officials during his visit to Asian countries this week. ""I think 'small victory' is a fair categorization,"" said Michael Levi, a Council on Foreign Relations' expert on energy policy and national security. From January to September 2011, Iran exported 13% of its crude oil to Japan, according to the International Energy Agency. Levi said Iran is likely to absorb this and find alternatives -- unless those drop out as well. ""As long as Iran has a substantial set of potential buyers, it's going to make as much money as it made before,"" Levi said. Levi said Japan wants to phase out its imports from Iran slowly so it can smoothly transition to other sources. ""That same slow speed gives Iran the opportunity to transition to other customers,"" he said. Geithner had made a similar push for China to reduce its Iranian oil imports. But Beijing said that its imports have nothing to do with Tehran's nuclear program and rejected new U.S. sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct business with the Iranian central bank. There was notably little mention of Iran in the comments made by Geithner and Chinese leaders Wednesday. China relies on imports for half of the oil it consumes. Iran exported 22% of its crude oil to China from January to September last year, the IEA said. Japan's government faces a difficult balancing act, trying to meet the needs of its closest ally and at the same time fuel its energy-strained country. Japan has been facing an energy crisis since last March's earthquake and tsunami, which triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Nuclear Plant. While making the announcement of plans for a gradual decrease in Iranian oil imports, Azumi did not specify how quickly his country would carry out the action. He said that Japan also needed more time to deal with how to reduce non-crude oil imports. Iran threatened in late December to block the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports. France, Britain and Germany have all proposed such sanctions to punish Iran for lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. Those countries and others believe Tehran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons, but Iran says its nuclear program is solely for civilian energy production. The strait is a critical shipping lane, through which 17 million barrels of oil passed per day in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Japan imports 10% of its crude oil from Iran .

"(CNN) -- A Russian tanker carrying fuel arrived in the Alaskan town of Nome on Saturday night, the Coast Guard said, as officials started preparations on delivering the much-needed supplies. U.S Coast Guard ice breaker Cutter Healy accompanied the fuel tanker Renda as it made its way through the frozen waters carrying 1.3 million gallons of petroleum products. ""The first step is to ensure the ice is safe for the personnel to walk on,"" said Chief Petty Officer Kip Wadlow. ""Then they will work to connect the piping and check for leaks. Safety is our primary concern."" The cutter has broken through almost 300 miles of ice for the tanker on a journey that took them through southern Alaska's Aleutian Islands. The voyage is the first-ever attempt to supply fuel to an Arctic Alaska settlement through sea ice. A company in Nome contracted the Renda to deliver the fuel after ice formed over the Bering Sea following a ferocious November storm that prevented the last delivery of the season via barge. The Coast Guard urged Nome residents not to go out on the ice to watch the operations, saying the behavior of the ice is unpredictable and ice conditions could change. Nome is not in immediate danger of running out of fuel, said Coast Guard Capt. Craig Lloyd, who is coordinating the mission. The town has enough fuel to last until about March, but the delivery was attempted now because it would have been more difficult then, he said. Officials considered flying in fuel, but it would have taken more than 300 flights, each carrying 4,000 to 5,000 gallons, to meet the town's needs, said Jason Evans, chairman of Sitnasuak Native Corp.","It is the first-ever attempt to supply fuel to an Arctic Alaska town through sea ice .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the cruise ship that wrecked off Italy's western coast will be questioned by authorities Tuesday at a hearing, his attorney said. Francesco Schettino is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter, shipwreck, and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, according to Italian prosecutor Francesco Verusio. Schettino could face up to 15 years in prison, he said. At the closed hearing, a preliminary investigation judge will decide whether Schettino will remain detained. The captain has not yet been questioned, but more than 100 witnesses, including passengers and crew, have been interviewed, the prosecutor said. The captain's attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday that Schettino was ""shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed."" But, he said, Schettino is ""nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters."" That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a ""grave error."" Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario strikes . Late Monday, the head of Italy's coast guard said 29 people remained unaccounted for from the partially sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia -- a sharp spike from earlier estimates of the missing. Coast guard chief Marco Brusco said the whereabouts of four crew members and 25 passengers were unknown, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. Authorities earlier believed that 16 people were unaccounted for. The Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night just off Italy's western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene to evacuate and the deaths of at least six people. On Monday, rescue efforts were ongoing in and around the mammoth vessel, which was listing on its side off the island of Giglio. The search had been suspended earlier in the day because the vessel began to move, said the island's mayor, Sergio Ortelli. Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said efforts had resumed, adding that rescuers will focus on retrieving the body of a man, presumably a passenger, discovered earlier in the day. However, he said the weather forecast has rescuers worried, as it calls for rising winds. The head of the company that owns the ship said Monday he has not given up hope of finding survivors. ""Hope is the last thing to die,"" said Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi. He addressed journalists at an emotional press conference Monday, apologizing repeatedly for the accident. Prosecutors are examining the ship's data recorder and expect to have results within days, Verusio said. They are also considering whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Foschi placed blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, however, saying Schettino had deviated from frequently traveled routes. ""The captain decided to change the route and he went into water that he did not know in advance,"" Foschi said. He said the company was limited in its ability to investigate the incident because it did not have the data recorder. Schettino, who has been with Costa since 2002, had never been involved in an accident before, Foschi said. He downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. The company had said earlier that Schettino may have made ""significant"" errors that led to the wreck. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" Costa Cruises said in a statement Sunday. The ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck, Foschi said Monday, adding that so far there was ""absolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea."" Divers have been searching the skyscraper-sized ship, working underwater in pitch blackness, in hopes of finding the missing. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground. Among those unaccounted for were two Americans. The U.S. State Department identified them Monday as Gerald and Barbara Ann Heil. The U.S. Embassy has requested information from ""anyone with information"" regarding the Heils' whereabouts, the State Department said. The Heils live in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, according to CNN affiliate WCCO, and have four children and 15 grandchildren. Their daughter, Sarah, told CBS Radio in Chicago that the couple was planning to travel after retiring, WCCO said. The disaster's impact on earnings will cost the ship's owner at least $85 million to $95 million in the fiscal year to November, parent company Carnival Corporation said Monday -- not including ""other costs to the business that are not possible to determine at this time."" Foschi said passengers would get ""material compensation for their loss,"" but declined to go into details. The ship is expected to be out of service ""for the remainder of the current fiscal year if not longer,"" the company said. Schettino joined Costa Cruises as a safety officer in 2002 before being appointed captain four years later, the company said. Even with its admission that mistakes were made, the Genoa-based cruise company defended the ship's crew in the face of criticism on the part of some passengers, who said the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed as passengers rushed for lifeboats. ""It is becoming clear that the crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation,"" the company said, adding all crew members are trained and the passengers earlier took part in an evacuation drill. Survivors have described the scene -- after the ship hit rocks near Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, and turned over on its side -- as chaos. ""There was no one taking command,"" passenger Lauren Moore told HLN's Mike Galanos. She said she was having dinner with a group of friends when she heard the crunch of the ship hitting the rock and the crash of plates and glasses falling to the floor. ""It was a terrifying sound and we knew it wasn't normal,"" she said. Moore ran to her cabin and then to board a lifeboat. ""It was so chaotic ... Everyone was basically fighting for his or her own life,"" she said. Some passengers braved the chilly water, with a temperature of about 57 degrees, and swam to safety. Others had no choice and fell in. Nighttime temperatures on Giglio have recently dipped below freezing. Authorities have said at least 20 people were injured, in addition to those killed and missing. There were fears the death toll could rise as rescuers searched the ship, which was nearly 50% submerged and had a gash in its hull, authorities said. Questions and criticism continue about what caused the shipwreck and the adequacy of the response. Speaking on Italian television, the ship's captain insisted the rocks that the Concordia hit were not marked on his map. ""On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,"" Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 328 yards (300 meters) from shore. But Coast Guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. Nicastro said the Coast Guard was investigating why the ship took the course it did. ""We know where the ship was,"" he said. ""We know it was too close to the island. ... We don't know why."" Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. The ship was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground. The dead include two elderly people found Sunday, two French tourists and a crew member from Peru, port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, authorities said. The Spanish Foreign Ministry named one of the victims Monday as Guillermo Gual Buades, 68, saying his family had identified him. CNN's Livia Borghese, Hada Messia, Jim Boulden, Al Goodman and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Captain Francesco Schettino will appear before a judge Tuesday .

"New York (CNN) -- As the world mourns the untimely conclusion of professional famous person Kim Kardashian's marriage to professional tall person Kris Humphries, how are you coping? Probably not very well, particularly if you watched their televised $20 million wedding (for which they allegedly spent $0 -- various sponsors took care of the costs for this impoverished but hardworking young couple) on August 20. They were so in love. Sports fans and sex fans alike have shed countless tears over the breakup of a man who bounces a ball for living and a woman who once videotaped herself making sexy time with Brandy's little brother. But while we all acknowledge that Kim and Kris are the greatest living beings on Earth or any other planet, we may not all agree on what lessons to take from this sad state of affairs. Fortunately, as the Voice of My Generation, I'm available to explain the five most important things you and your friends ought to learn from Kim and Kris' impending divorce. 1. Providing $400,000 of Perrier-JouÃ«t at one's wedding does not ensure the success of a marriage. You need Cristal for that. 2. Fish and relatives stink after three days, but spouses can last 24 times as long. Have you ever been stuck in a car with your beloved family for more than three hours? It's awful, and you probably love them more than any other folks in the world. Kim and Kris made it work for 72 whole days. That's 1,728 hours of uninterrupted togetherness! Rather than tear them down, let's salute them for their longevity. Considering that they probably ran out of new words after the first day, it's pretty amazing they lasted as long as they did. 3. Contrary to popular belief, it's a bad idea to marry a dude with the same first name as your mom. Especially when Mom describes herself on Twitter as ""MOM, MANAGER, MOMAGER, LOVER OF LIFE, LOVER OF CHRIST."" 4. If at first you don't succeed ... you'll probably also fail the second time. Like many other members of her generation, Kim fell in love and launched a starter marriage that didn't last so long. I'm talking, of course, about her first marriage -- she married producer Damon Thomas when she was 19 and divorced him four years later. Just remember, third time's a charm. Maybe. 5. One's posterior-to-waist ratio does not correlate to one's marriage-to-divorce ratio. 'Nuff said. And now, let the healing begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sara Benincasa.","Sara Benincasa: Many are trying to cope with news of the Kardashian/Humphries split .

For another, don't marry someone with the same first name as your mother ."
"(CNN) -- A British report issued Thursday called for ""decisive action"" to contain the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. ""We conclude that for too long there has been a noticeable gap between the government's rhetoric and its action,"" said the 210-page report, issued by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Despite nine U.N. Security Council resolutions and three multinational naval operations, the counter-piracy policy has had limited impact. The number of attacks, the costs to the industry and the price of the ransoms have all increased significantly since 2007."" Over the past four years, the average ransom has risen from $600,000 to $4.7 million per vessel, with 2011's total outlay reaching $135 million, the report said. Those payments ""should be a matter of deep concern to the British government and to the entire international maritime community,"" said the report, which described the government as ""disappointingly slow to track financial flows from piracy."" Though some ships have begun taking ""more robust"" measures to defend themselves, pirates still face few repercussions for their actions, it said. In those cases where pirates are detained, some 90% are released without charge, it said, noting that there is no reason why Britain could not assert jurisdiction over suspected pirates. Simply returning suspected pirates to their boats or to land ""provides little long-term deterrence and has demonstrably failed to prevent annual increases in both the number of pirates going to sea and in the number of attacks."" The report cited Saferworld, a nongovernmental organization that works with grass-roots organizations in Somalia, in estimating that 1,500 to 3,000 pirates operate off Somalia's coast. They typically range in age from 15 to 30 and are almost all male, uneducated and unskilled -- many of them from rural areas, it said. They often carry small arms and travel in one or two skiffs, the report said, citing Capt. David Reindorp, head of the Defense Crisis Management Center at the Ministry of Defense, as its source. ""They will maneuver one of the skiffs to come alongside the vessel and they will throw up a line on a hook, a grappling rope or some form of apparatus by which they can climb up on to the freeboard of the ship. If they are detected during that, they will usually fire at the ship, generally in and around the bridge, aiming either to get the master to slow down or to clear their way on to the freeboard. Once they have got on to the ship, they will proceed to the bridge and take it over."" Negotiations are typically carried out by satellite phone and usually take three months to a year, it said. Pirates have begun working from larger vessels, mother ships, which are stocked with food and fuel and have extended the areas vulnerable to attack, it said. Though most hostages are released unharmed, 15 died last year, it said. Over the past four years, 3,500 seafarers have been taken hostage and 62 have been killed, it said. The report applauded the government's practice of using a number of different departments to tackle the problem, but said it ""lacks clear leadership"" and urged the government to ""provide a statement clarifying which department has the overall lead on countering piracy."" There is no lack of targets. Some 90% of the world's traded materials are shipped by sea, and 40% of that -- 28,000 ships per year -- goes through the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea, the report said. The report put the annual cost of piracy -- including insurance, prosecutions, security and ransoms -- at $7 billion to $12 billion. In a statement, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the report will be discussed next month at a meeting in London. ""We will use the London Conference on Somalia to chart a way forward on the future political direction of Somalia, the vital humanitarian effort and the international community's approach to tackling piracy.""","There is ""gap between the government's rhetoric and its action,"" the report says .

"(WIRED) -- Motorola is taking another shot at the tablet game with the Droid Xyboard, the company's latest Android device to hit Verizon stores. After getting our hands on one yesterday, we found that it's a solid, well-performing slate that's easy on the eyes. Too bad it has such a stupid name. The 4G Xyboard is Motorola's follow-up to its pricey, not terribly popular Xoom tablet, which was released in February. Available in 8.2-inch and 10.1-inch versions, the Honeycomb-powered Xyboard enters the market hot on the heels of the super-hot Kindle Fire. It's on sale today for $430 (for the 8.2-inch) or $530 (for the 10.1-inch) with a two-year contract from Verizon, with options for 16GB or 32GB of memory on the smaller version, and up to 64GB on the larger one. The first thing that struck me about the Xyboard is its industrial design. Rather than being perfectly rectangular in shape, the 8.2-inch slate has clipped corners, which actually makes it fit more comfortably when you hold it one-handed. The back, too, shows some stylistic creativity. A rubberized outer rim houses a power button and volume rocker, while centered in the back of the tablet is a sheet of dark gray brushed metal held in place by six visible screws. Think robot chic. The positioning of the device's only two buttons makes for a clean appearance, but leaves your fingers searching when it's time to crank up the volume or send it to sleep. The 8.2-inch size, however, is a great compromise between the 7-inch 'tweeners and 10-inch stunners. It's small enough to wield in one hand with ease (the 0.86-pound weight helps with that too), yet large enough that watching a full-screen, HD YouTube video or a movie on Netflix is pleasant. Pair that with Verizon's 4G speeds, and you've got great streaming video quality. The overall experience is smooth, an improvement over many of the past buggy iterations of Honeycomb (perhaps the longer lead time gave Google the room to stabilize). Powered by a dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB of RAM, app loading times are reasonably swift, and swiping from one screen to another on its Honeycomb interface is stutter-free. Unlike HTC and Samsung devices, it's not overly skinned, so you can actually experience the Android OS for what it is, rather than a bogged down, bloated mess. The Xyboard will be eligible for an Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade at some point in the future, but for now, it runs Honeycomb very well. Both the 8.2- and 10.1-inch models have a 1280 x 800 resolution display. After turning up the brightness from auto to full, the tablet's battery life dropped from around 20 percent to around 5 percent in less than an hour, so it looks like you'll need to be conscious of your 4G and brightness settings if you don't want your tablet to die on you quickly. If you're one of those people who likes to take pictures with their tablet (read: you are a dork), the Xyboard has a 5-megapixel back-facing camera and a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera on its face. The rear camera's quality is relatively sub-par compared to what you'd get from other comparable cameras, and definitely shoddier compared to the 8-megapixel standard of most 2011 handsets. The colors are bright and close to true to life, but the overall image lacks sharpness. The camera does have some variable settings though, for white balance, color effects, and scene mode. Video quality was also just 'meh': a video taken indoors at the Wired offices was noticeably grainy. Overall, the Xyboard seems like a decent tablet. The slate looks slick and feels good in your hands, and is powerful enough to provide a successful tablet experience. It's a bit of a shame that it's shipping with Honeycomb instead of ICS, but that's certainly not a deal breaker. What's a real shame, though, is that it's available now, and not six months ago.

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- It wasn't until five months after Army Staff Sgt. June Moss returned from the Iraq war in 2003 that her real battle began. The horrors of the war -- witnessing decapitated and burned bodies amid mass destruction -- led to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I do notice when I'm stressing out that I start having dreams about what I saw and how I felt,"" says Moss, now 40 and retired from the Army. ""It does come back as if to haunt you."" The percentage of women in the military has doubled in the last 30 years, with more than 350,000 serving as of 2009, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs' latest figures. With more female troops in combat, there has been an increase in PTSD diagnoses: One in five female veterans suffer from PTSD, according to the VA. As a light-vehicle mechanic, Moss drove across Baghdad and provided security at checkpoints during her combat tour in Iraq. When she returned home, she became overly protective of her two children, fearing that someone was going to kidnap or harm them. At the same time, she hunkered down inside her home, staying in bed, because she says it was too hard to face the most mundane tasks such as shopping. ""It was crazy. I couldn't even do crowds. It reminded me when we were in a marketplace (in Iraq), and we didn't know if somebody was out there to kill us,"" Moss explains. ""I'm back home, and I didn't have to worry about a suicide bomber, but I still felt as if there was one lurking in the mall or the grocery store."" Six years ago, she cut her wrists to end the pain. Today, Moss has progressed significantly after specialized therapy provided by the local Veterans Affairs in Palo Alto, California, where the focus is on female vets like herself. ""Women tend to be diagnosed more often, at least with our recent returnees, with depression, whereas men are being diagnosed more often with substance abuse,"" says Natara Garovoy, program director of the Women's Prevention, Outreach & Education Center at VA Palo Alto Health Care System. Garovoy says recent studies show the percentage of women veterans suffering from PTSD is on par with the percentage of men: 20%. ""Women are exposed to combat now more than ever before, and they're proving to be just as resilient to those exposures as men,"" she said. There is no cure for PTSD, only treatment. ""It takes a lot to live with PTSD,"" Moss says. ""I hate to compare it with being an alcoholic, because I'm not one, but that's the best description I can give. You're always one incident from spiraling out of control back to where you were -- being depressed, not coming out of the house, not being able to sleep, having night terrors, night sweats, all those kinds of things."" Moss attributes an angry outburst in her workplace last year to PTSD, after she says she had become complacent with her treatment. Moss physically struck a fellow employee with whom she was romantically involved. ""I just went off. It went from verbal to physical. And, thank God, I didn't lose my job over it. But I did get in trouble,"" says Moss, who was suspended for three days without pay. ""Those feelings came out of nowhere."" Moss says she realized that even years later, she needed to actively engage in her weekly therapy. She also turned to her boss, the chaplain at the Palo Alto VA, to focus on her spirituality. ""I'm constantly working on how I'm thinking,"" Moss says of her regimen today, which includes morning meditation, listening to gospel music and exercising. Her new mantra: ""Staying positive and keeping negativity out of my life!"" Moss has lost 40 pounds in the last two years and is pursuing a degree in human resource management at San Francisco's Golden Gate University. Moss beams with pride when she discusses recent steps in her therapy made within the last six months. She went on a trip by herself to Philadelphia while her teenage children went away to camp. She says technology, like video chat, helped her make such a stride. Moss also took her daughter to a concert in October, braving a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. ""It's a big deal to know that from then to now, I've come a long way,"" Moss says with a smile. ""From head to toe, I'm a better me."" CNN's Linda Hall contributed to this report.","Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Finally. That's all that needs to be said about President Barack Obama's decision this week to stop playing footsie with GOP senators and push through the recess appointments for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and members of the National Labor Relations Board. Republican are in a tizzy, saying he is establishing a bad precedent with the moves. But frankly, they need to shut up. It has been their shameful and callous actions in holding up countless presidential nominees that has led us to this precarious moment in political history. But let's not act like the Democratic senators are standing on firm moral ground. They were also obstructionists during the final few years of President George W. Bush's second term, and they played the same game of hideaway as the Republicans are doing now, even though the GOP has taken stalling to extraordinary heights. As for President Obama, he has played nice for far too long, unwilling to load up the administration with his nominees through the constitutionally protected avenue of recess appointments. It's hilarious to listen to strict constructionist conservatives talk about the U.S. Constitution as a hallowed document, only to hear their chagrin when someone actually follows it. Every president has the right to make recess appointments, and if you hear the GOP critics, you would swear Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush didn't use the power of recess appointments to fill vacancies. But they did, specifically with the National Labor Relations Board, the same group that now has three open slots that the GOP has been blocking President Obama from filling. This is a silly, partisan game that I can't stand. Every president should be able to appoint a team to his liking. Yes, the U.S. Constitution says the U.S. Senate gets to ""advise and consent,"" but it says nothing about holding up appointments in perpetuity. It's shameful when a president makes an appointment and that person goes six months to nearly two years before they get a hearing or an up-and-down vote. The U.S. Senate should be able and willing to move a lot faster when filling vacancies, but the partisan divide keeps that from happening. With President Obama in office, the GOP doesn't want to see what they describe as liberal judges appointed to the federal bench. And when there is a Republican in the White House, Democrats voice their anger at conservative judges being appointed. Folks, that's what happens in elections. There are consequences to winning and losing. President Obama's willingness to take on the Congress directly is a welcome departure from the reach-out-and-touch someone philosophy he operated by the last three years. Look, I get bipartisanship -- we should have folks from both parties acting like grownups and getting along -- but if you look at the overwhelming number of Obama appointees being held up, it's clear that this system is broken. Weakness is nothing to be happy about. And too often, President Obama has operated more on the weak and meek side when dealing with Congress rather than as a strong leader with conviction. This decision, coupled with the far more aggressive tone he has taken with his critics, has led to an increase in his poll numbers, and is the kind of fire in the belly his supporters are happy to see. The fear is that the president will fall back into the mode of walking softly with a big stick. Sorry, when folks are misbehaving, you have to whack them upside the head with that big stick in order for them to get the message. The GOP can crow all day about these appointments. They are likely to lose if they challenge the president in court. Maybe their continuing intransigence will keep President Obama operating with a short fuse, ready to explode on the opposition when warranted. Now that's a change in attitude we can believe in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","President Obama filled several key posts through recess appointments .

"(CNN) -- Don't be confused, Las Vegas. You did not wake up in a fraternity house. You are not still in college. Those celluloid-ball-throwing, beer-chugging patrons invading the Flamingo Hotel and Casino are not trying to scare you. They are probably just members of Seek and Destroy -- Wednesday night's winners of the annual World Series of Beer Pong. Matt White and Ross Hampton came out on top after 22 games to take home the $50,000 prize, money that the recent Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville graduates will certainly be able to use. ""It'll get me by for now,"" Hampton said after the win. He said the secret to his team's success in the tournament was ""staying sober to play well consistently."" Not always an easy task in a game with ""beer"" in it name. Beer pong, or Beirut as it is called on many college campuses, is played with two teams standing at opposite ends of a table. At each end of the table, ten 16-ounce cups, filled with roughly 4 ounces of beer or another liquid, are placed in a bowling-pin formation. Each team takes turns tossing beer pong balls (similar to table tennis balls) at their opponent's cup formation. If a ball goes into a cup, the cup is removed from the game, and its contents are usually imbibed by the opponent. The first team to knock out all of their opponent's cups wins. White and Hampton learned to play beer pong the same place most people do -- in college. It wasn't until recently that the two started playing competitively and realized they were actually pretty good. Their move from casual beer pong players to tournament competitors mimics that of National Beer Pong League co-founder Duncan Carroll's decision to establish a competitive beer pong league. But he insists he and his business partners weren't the first ones to think of organizing it. ""We're just the only people to actually carry it out,"" he said, laughing. The world series, in its seventh and largest year, has drawn more than 1,000 players (450 teams) from 48 U.S. states and 14 countries. Organization of a sport which for many college students is nothing more than a mindless drinking game may sound a little far-fetched, but Carroll said it actually came quite easily to him and his college buddies, all members of the Carnegie Mellon swim team in the late 1990s. ""We played a ton of beer pong,"" he said. Despite the popularity of the game on his campus and others, Carroll said there was never really any way to measure a player's skill level. ""There were no organized tournaments,"" Carroll said, ""We figured a lot of people thought they were pretty good, but might wonder, 'How good am I really?'"" After graduating from college with a history degree, Carroll said, his desire to become an entrepreneur paired with the game's widespread popularity made for a perfect fit for the formation of a National Beer Pong League. The league established rules for the game, a regulation-size beer pong table, as well as a national ranking system similar to that for chess. Competitors can move up and down in the rankings based on the ranking of those they beat. No surprise to Carroll, his friends think his job is ""pretty cool,"" but overcoming stereotypes about the game has proved to be one of his greatest challenges. ""People who didn't play beer pong in college don't really get it,"" he said. ""It's tricky trying to convince them it's something that people take seriously."" Even his own parents have mixed emotions. ""My dad loves it,"" Carroll said. ""My mom thinks it's debauchery."" Carroll said the tournament attracts a ""mixed bag"" of people who all ""happen to be good at beer pong."" The National Beer Pong League's latest development is an app for the Android smart phone that he says will bring competitive beer pong to even larger crowds. The most casual backyard beer pong player can log on and track their wins on the league's website. At the end of the day, Carroll said, ""It's really just a sport that happens to involve alcohol.""","Matt White and Ross Hampton win 22 games to take home the prize .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- In India, milk is used in holy ceremonies, it is offered to the gods, poured over deities and generally considered the healthiest of drinks. But a first-of-its-kind government survey reveals that a stunning 68.4% of milk sold in India does not meet basic government standards. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India tested milk across the country. It took 1,791 samples -- and of of those, 1,226 were found to be ""non-conforming."" In seven Indian states, 100% of the samples failed to meet standards. Some samples contained water and milk powders; others included potentially toxic ingredients. ""We found about 14% of the samples which found traces of detergent,"" said V.N. Gaur, the chief executive officer of the food safety authority. In lesser percentages, the tests also found hydrogen peroxide and urea -- a substance found in fertilizer and urine. ""There is a problem and they need to face it head-on and they have to kind of really take some strict action against those people who are violating simple consumer rights of getting a clean glass of milk,"" said Savvy Soumya Misra, the food safety and toxins deputy program manager with the Center for Science and Environment. Doctors say ingested over long periods of time, chemicals like detergent can eat away the lining of intestines, stomach and affect the liver and the kidneys. Just adding water to the milk can pose a real danger in India where waterborne illnesses are commonplace. ""What you get is diarrhea. Vomiting. What we call gastroenteritis,"" said Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant for internal medicine at Delhi's Apollo hospital said. ""You can get something like cholera. You can have jaundice. There are infections like typhoid fever, which are all part of water-borne infections in this part of the world."" At a dairy on the outskirts of India's capital, a worker dilution is widely practiced -- but that his plant does not participate. ""A lot of people do it. They add water and take the milk and sell it,"" Ram Prasad said. ""They add water because it increases the quantity of milk and there is more to sell."" The milk industry in India is a chaotic mix of producers and sellers. Milk comes to the market in many different ways. It can be carried in on the heads of farmers in pails, put in containers which are strapped to a train or a bicycle, or delivered in a massive milk truck. In many places, including the capital, fresh milk is still delivered to homes. The sources also vary: from a family with three cows, to farms with more than 30 cows and buffaloes, to huge dairy plants. Government authorities say 70% of the milk on the market comes from small to medium farms that operate in, what is known, as the ""unorganized sector."" In the government test, less than a third of the milk samples came from large producers. While India has strict regulations in place to ensure milk safety, consumer advocates say enforcement is so lax it's laughable. ""Well it does reflect that there is a need to strengthen our implementation machinery, Gaur said. ""That need is definitely underlined by this study."" But, he said, his office has been granted new powers recently and it plans on more surveys. He expects there will be better enforcement in the coming weeks, months and years. Food safety watchdog groups say milk dilution has been around for decades. They hope the milk survey will mean good news for consumers because -- for the first time -- the government itself has revealed the true scope of the problem and pledged to do something about it. CNN's Sumnima Das contributed to this report.","In seven Indian states, 100% of the samples failed to meet standards .

"(CNN) -- Here's a 21st-century art object if ever there was one: a Japanese film by a French-Vietnamese writer-director based on a 1987 international best-seller named after a 1965 Beatles' song about Scandinavian pine. Well, that's not all the song is about. According to John Lennon, it was conceived as a deliberately opaque reference to an extramarital flirtation (he didn't want his wife to know about it) that went nowhere. The narrator sleeps in the bath, then torches the place in the morning. Tran Anh Hung's lovely but overly languorous film of the acclaimed Haruki Murakami novel catches at the sexual longing and consternation that both the book and Lennon's song evoke: the tantalizing co-mingling of desire, mixed signals and cross purposes that can derail a tentative relationship. Tran (who also wrote the screenplay) follows Murakami's slender plotline with respect bordering on devotion, but fails to find a correlative to the complex, overlapping perspectives that allow the novel to live in both the present and the past -- to enter into the mindset of adolescent angst, and to contemplate it from afar. Instead the film flails between too many lengthy, numb exchanges and a handful of spectacular but histrionic set pieces. Toru Watanabe (Ken'ichi Matsuyama) is a freshman at Tokyo University in the late 1960s. He's largely impervious to the political upheaval going on around him, still struggling to come to terms with the sudden suicide of his best friend, Kizuki, on his 17th birthday. In their grief, Watanabe and Kizuki's girlfriend, Naoko (Rinko Kikuchi of ""Babel""), spend many hours consoling each other, and on her 20th birthday they finally sleep together. The next day, Naoko quits school and retires to a sanatorium, leaving the confused Watanabe to muddle his way through classes. While he and Naoko correspond in long, intimate letters, Watanabe takes up with another girl (or should I say, she takes up with him?). Midori (Kiko Mizuhara) is as self-confident and assertive as Naoko is vulnerable and timid. Watanabe, meanwhile, is a distinctly passive and bewildered protagonist, unsure of what he wants or what his obligations might be to the broken, suicidal Naoko. The performances are credible enough, but neither the passive, vacillating Watanabe nor the neurotic, grief-stricken Naoko are easy figures to identify with, and it's hard to understand why so many women keep throwing themselves at Matsuyama's clay feet. Only Mizuhara's assertive Midori offers any energy, and she's sidelined for much of the movie. While the movie has moments to savor and artistry to spare, these elements don't cohere into a satisfying whole. Tran doesn't speak Japanese, but in other respects he's well-suited to Murakami's world. A Vietnamese brought up and educated in France, best known for ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" and ""The Vertical Ray of the Sun,"" Tran is a cinematic aesthete, very much attuned to melancholy and introspection. ""Norwegian Wood"" features a tumescent score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood and stunning cinematography by the Taiwanese Mark Lee Ping-bin (""In the Mood for Love""). It's so gorgeous to look at that spectators are in danger of swooning in their seats. It's rather irritating that the characters prefer to wallow in misery than admire the natural beauty all around them -- including each other, of course. And that's the trouble. The film feels like a fetish object; almost a series of screen prints, it's a beautiful illustration of the text, but somehow the text itself is lost in translation.","Critic: Director follows Haruki Murakami's slender plot with respect bordering on devotion .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant is just weeks from operating at full capacity, the country's top nuclear official said Saturday. Feireidoun Abbasi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, also said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made centrifuges to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Bushehr plant, located along the Persian Gulf coast, will reach its full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1, Abbasi said, according to the country's official news agency, IRNA. The plant was connected to the country's electric grid in September with a capacity of 60 megawatts. At 1,000 megawatts, Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5% of Iran's current electricity consumption, the IAEA said. Abbasi made the announcement about Bushehr while attending a meeting on Iran's nuclear achievements held in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas. He told the meeting that Tehran had shown the new generation of its homemade centrifuge machines to the IAEA ""in a bid to demonstrate the ability of Iranian scientists,"" he said. Abbasi said the centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, were shown to the deputy of IAEA, Director-General Yukiya Amano, but he did not say when. It was not immediately clear whether an IAEA representative had in fact been to Iran and seen the centrifuges. The new centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5%, according to experts cited by the news agency. Uranium enriched to between 3% and 5% is necessary to make fuel for reactors. Uranium enriched to 93.5% is considered weapons-grade. The construction of Bushehr -- a civilian, not military, plant -- started in 1975 when Germany signed a contract with Iran. Germany, however, pulled out of the project following the 1979 revolution that created the current Islamic republic. Iran then signed a deal with Russia in 1995, under which the plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 1999, but the project was delayed repeatedly. Bushehr finally opened in August 2010. The United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes. The IAEA said in a November report that it has ""serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions"" to Iran's nuclear program. The agency said it has information indicating Iran has carried out ""activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device."" Iran has denied such allegations, saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the concern is not the Bushehr plant, but other nuclear facilities like Natanz, in the middle of the country; a facility at Qom, south of Tehran; ""and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program.""","Bushehr plant will reach full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1, IRNA reports .

"JACKSON, Mississippi (CNN) -- It's triggered an emotional controversy. The pardons of convicted killers by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour has forced Mississippians to take a look at an ageless program that employed violent men -- including convicted murderers -- inside the governor's mansion and put those men on a fast track to a full pardon -- and freedom. The program, known as the Governor's Trusty program, is now front-and-center at the Mississippi capitol. No one seems to know how long the program has been in effect, or how it got started. ""It's almost closed,"" said Mississippi state Rep. Bobby Moak, a Democrat who's helping to spearhead legislation to change the program and the governor's power to pardon. ""You can't go into this capitol dome and ask somebody to tell you about that particular program ... to tell you how they're (inmates are) vetted, who is chosen, why they are chosen or anything else,"" Moak told CNN. What is known is that in his final days in office, Barbour signed full and complete pardons for five violent offenders serving life sentences -- including four men who had committed murder. These men were trusties -- selected by the Mississippi Department of Corrections because of their exemplary behavioral record while in prison to work at a variety of jobs, including as servants and handymen in the governor's mansion. CNN was able to track down one of the pardoned murderers in Mississippi. Almost 11 years to the day that he shot his wife in the back and killed her, in front of a room full of witnesses, Anthony McCray spoke with CNN's Martin Savidge. Savidge: ""What kinds of things would you do at the governor's mansion?"" McCray: ""I did housekeeping. Shined door knobs. Washed cars and stuff like that. I cooked with the chef. That's it."" Savidge: ""How long were you there?"" McCray: ""Three years."" Savidge: ""What was the change like for going from prison to the governor's mansion?"" McCray: ""Well, first I had to get used to it because I had been in prison so long. I had to adjust to it, but down the road it was OK. Everybody was nice to you, treat you nice. You just do your chores."" Savidge: ""Better living conditions?"" McCray: ""Yes, sir. Savidge: ""You'd have your own room?"" McCray: ""Yes, sir. You'd have your own room. There was six rooms. You'd have your own room. You'd get up and it's time to go to work. You eat your breakfast and go to work. Savidge: ""And this was always at the governor's mansion?"" McCray: ""Yes, sir. Savidge: ""Could you leave?"" McCray: ""No. you couldn't go nowhere."" That prison inmates like McCray -- who pleaded guilty in the death of his wife, Jennifer -- were afforded such a situation is the very thing that infuriates Ronald Bonds. His sister was McCray's wife, gunned down after the couple had argued at an after-hours club. Bonds helped raise his sister's two young children. ""How do you get a convicted murderer ... to go work at the governor's mansion?"" he asked incredulously. ""I don't know what he could have done. You've got some folks that can do some pretty devious things to get what they want,"" he told CNN. ""The governor must not have no grandkids coming in ... cause I wouldn't trust them folks,"" added Bonds, referring to the trusties. Barbour has defended his decision. Barbour says he believes in second chances and that men who committed crimes of passion are least likely to repeat their crimes. ""I have no doubt in my mind that these men have repented, have been redeemed, have come back hard-working to prepare themselves to go out in the world. I have no question in my life,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""When my grandchildren are over at the governor's mansion, we trust them to play with and to be looked out for by these people. If I trusted them to be around my grandchildren, I think that makes a pretty plain statement,"" he said. According to the state Department of Corrections, prisoners selected for the program cannot have a drug or a sex-crimes conviction. They must also show that they are interested in bettering themselves while in prison. Women generally are not selected to be a part of the trusty program, because the Corrections Department forbids mixing men and women together. But opponents of the program say it shows tremendous leniency by taking violent individuals out of prison and into the confines of the governor's mansion, where they have their own rooms -- and a path to that fast track to freedom with a pardon. ""It takes 12 people to put somebody in prison and one man (the governor) gets to release him because he gave him a good car wash or served dinner right. It's wrong,"" says Tiffany Ellis Brewer. One of the recently pardoned trusties, David Gatlin, was given a life sentence in the shooting death of her sister. Gatlin was convicted of shooting Tammy Brewer in the head as she held their 6-week-old son. ""It astounds me. I can't even fathom ... because he (Gatlin) lives in his mansion, and he speaks to him, and gets to sit down and talk to the governor, that this man (Barbour) doesn't take into consideration that he shot Tammy in her head with a child in her arms."" According to the Department of Corrections Inmate Handbook, found online, inmates convicted of murder, and those serving life sentences are ineligible for the program -- raising the question of how and why McCray, Gatlin and others managed to be in the program. A Department spokesperson did not return CNN's calls for an explanation. The men are constantly surrounded by the governor's security staff at the governor's mansion -- considered a secure location. The men who are selected are put through a further background check by the Mississippi Highway Patrol, the agency assigned to protect the governor. According to a law enforcement source, security is very tight. ""One strike and you're out. So they (inmates) are on their best behavior always. Whatever they tell the inmates to do has to be followed. They better be toeing the line,"" the source said. ""They wouldn't choose anyone that might grab a kitchen knife and do something. They have to be people they feel they can watch."" But the program appears to give these men direct access to the governor -- a privilege that most prison inmates obviously do not enjoy. McCray told CNN he saw Barbour practically every day. ""He'd ask me how my children were doing and stuff like that,"" McCray told CNN's Savidge. ""He'd ask how everybody was doing and I said everybody was doing just fine. And we'd move along. He'd go and do his work and I'd go and do my work. ""If you want to go talk to him, he'll talk to you,"" McCray added. Savidge asked, ""Really, you could just walk up to him and say, 'How are you?'"" ""How you doing, Mr. Haley Barbour?"" McCray responded. ""That's it. He had his work to do, too."" McCray described the outgoing governor as ""Nice ... nice ... really nice individual guy. Down to earth."" Asked if he discussed a pardon with Barbour, McCracy responded: ""No. I never asked nothing about that."" ""It was just assumed that eventually, by working in the mansion you'd get that pardon,"" said Savidge. ""Tradition,"" responded McCray. ""That's what they call it. Before he got into office. It's been going on for years."" The Department of Corrections said research was still under way to determine how long the trusty program has been going on, but department officials could not say how many inmates have gone through the trusty program, or how many of those trusties were eventually pardoned. But now there's a new governor in town. Former Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant was sworn in last week. Bryant has said the road to a pardon will no longer run through the Mississippi governor's mansion. Bryant would not consent to an interview with CNN, but his director of communications said in an e-mail that changes have already begun. ""The day Phil Bryant was sworn in, the Mansion trusty program ended in its antiquated 50 year old form,"" wrote Mick Bullock. ""Governor Phil Bryant, on Tuesday (last week) discontinued the practice of convicts spending the night on the Mansion grounds and the tradition of pardoning the mansion trusties. Further, he is currently working towards phasing out the use of violent offenders at the Mansion."" McCray, meanwhile, says he deserves his pardon, despite only serving 11 years of a life sentence for killing his wife. ""Well, it's by the grace of God. That's what God does -- God opens doors that no man can close. I'm a child of God. That's what I believe,"" he told CNN. He also says that Barbour, as governor, had the right to let him go free, as McCray put it, ""When the Lord touched his heart.""","It's not clear how long the Governor's Trusty program has been going on .

"(Mashable) -- Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) will not support the Stop Online Piracy Act, according to a statement released by his office Monday. In the statement, Ryan calls the Internet ""one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history"" and says ""it should stay that way."" According to Ryan, SOPA is an attempted solution to the ""legitimate problem"" of digital piracy, but the bill ""creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse."" Congressman Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, became a target of the Reddit community last month. Reddit users considered Ryan's previous stance on SOPA too vague -- and took issue with the $288,600 that the Congressman had accepted from pro-SOPA groups. Mashable: Fears of SOPA unfounded, bill's sponsor says . Redditors began ""Operation Pull Ryan,"" a grassroots campaign to prevent Ryan's re-election in 2012. The community embraced Ryan's opponent, Rob Zerban, who is running for Congress in November of this year. Zerban returned Reddit's affection, hosting an ""AMA,"" or ""Ask Me Anything,"" where he fielded questions directly from Reddit users. Zerban credited Reddit with influencing Ryan's decision on SOPA. In a statement posted on the social media site, Zerban said: ""Reddit was able to force the House Budget Chair to reverse course -- shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in Washington today, and other lawmakers will take notice."" Mashable: U.S. wanted a Spanish SOPA . In fact, Reddit may not have had an impact on Ryan's SOPA decision. Paul's position on the bill was unclear until now. As a conservative Republican who favors smaller government, it makes sense that Ryan would oppose a bill which gives more authority to the Federal government. On the other hand, the bill was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith, a conservative Republican from Texas, so party labels are not a reliable indicator of SOPA support.

"(CNN) -- Brazil turned on the style to defeat their South American rivals Chile 3-0 on Monday and set up a World Cup quarterfinal against the Netherlands. The five-time world champions, who showed little of their usual dazzling play during the group phase, sent an ominous warning to their rivals as they comprehensively outplayed Chile in Johannesburg, with Juan, Luis Fabiano and Robinho all on target. ""We have to improve in all sectors of our play, but it was a nice game against Chile,"" Brazil coach Dunga told AFP. ""We have already said we are trying to play the open football which everyone wants to see. The players did well and we got forward a lot. Dutch outclass Slovakia to reach quarters . Brazil, who welcomed playmaker Kaka back from a one-match ban, took the lead after 34 minutes from a straightforward corner routine. Right-back Maicon crossed for central defender Juan, who rose above the Chilean defense to power his header into the net. Brazil's second goal, four minutes later, was more characteristically Brazilian in its style and execution. Robinho carried the ball down the left flank before squaring to Kaka, who cushioned a pass into the path of Luis Fabiano, who rounded the goalkeeper and scored. The third goal, after 60 minutes, stemmed from a swift counter-attack, with Ramires charging down the center with the ball and passing to Robinho, who curled his finish around the goalkeeper. Chile, who reached the semifinals on home soil in 1962, struggled to break down a well-drilled Brazilian back line and were restricted to half chances for Humberto Suazo and Jorge Valdivia. Robinho came close to adding a fourth when he was released down the right, but his low shot was tipped around the post by goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. The victory was Brazil's eighth in a row over Chile, who became the first South American side to go out of the tournament. Brazil will play the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in Port Elizabeth on Friday, July 2. ""We know the Netherlands are a very difficult team to beat and they are very able technically, they play their football like South Americans,"" said Dunga. Meanwhile, the president of the French Football Federation Jean-Pierre Escalettes said he will resign following the country's disastrous World Cup showing. France, the 1998 winners and 2006 runners-up, were eliminated in the group stage after collecting just just one point and scoring one goal in a campaign marred by infighting. ""After a weekend of reflection during which I consulted my elected colleagues and those close to me, I have decided that I must resign,"" Escalettes said in a statement on the federation website.","Brazil beat Chile 3-0 in Johannesburg to reach World Cup quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- It has now been certified officially: Germany is special, at least in the eyes of ratings agency Standard & Poor's. According to Standard & Poor's, Germany is the only country in the eurozone which still deserves the prized AAA rating with a stable outlook. Nine other countries, together accounting for more than half the euro area's GDP, were downgraded at least one notch. Given that these countries also provide more than half of the financing of the eurozone bail out fund (the European Financial Stability Facility) it was only logical that this institution also lost its AAA rating. One could be tempted, following the downgrades, to conclude that most euro countries just cannot get their fiscal houses in order. But the opposite is closer to reality. The average fiscal deficit for the euro area was only about 4% of GDP in 2011. This is projected to fall to about 3% in 2012. This is much lower than the double digit figures for the U.S. and UK fiscal deficits for 2011, which are expected to persist through this year. Italy -- hit with a two-notch downgrade -- is actually expected to structurally balance its 2012 budget. ""Excessive"" deficits are thus unlikely to be the root cause of the problem (at least apart from Greece). The motivation for the downgrades given by Standard & Poor's actually cites the excessive attention given to fiscal austerity as one principal reason for the downgrading of a whole swath of euroland. Greek debt talks to resume . So why the downgrade? Is there really such a lack of capital that the remaining deficits, which look modest in comparison to other developed countries, cannot be financed? The answer is surely no. There are enough savings within the monetary union area to finance all public deficits of the eurozone's members. This is because euro area savers are usually loath to invest in foreign currency; and most regulated intermediaries such as investment fund have little choice but to invest in government securities in euro. Further, Europe's investment funds and insurance companies cannot all put their money in a bank account where yields are close to nothing. This is a key reason why reaction in the markets was so muted after the downgrades. So what is Standard & Poor's afraid of? One major problem is Europe's regional split of savings habits. Those in the north -- Germany and the Netherlands, for example -- have an excess of savings. But the area's investors dare not cross the Alps to spend their money in the southern countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece (and maybe soon France). This is why Italian funding costs have gone up so dramatically while the same time, the German government can collect money from investors when it issues short term paper. The collection of savings within national pools means the capital markets have ceased to function in the euro area. The European Central Bank is the only institution able to recycle northern European savings through the euro area. The ECB has thus become the ""central counterparty"" to most north-south lending in Europe. By doing so it has prevented a collapse of the banking system. But the ECB has its limits too. The ECB cannot single-handedly substitute for all private cross border lending. The downwards spiral will continue until these markets begin to function again. This should be the main priority of Europe's leaders. The fiscal compact might be useful to prevent the next crisis a generation down the road, but this will not be very useful if the euro does not survive the present one.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid piled the pressure on Barcelona by moving six points clear at the top of Spain's La Liga with a 5-1 thrashing of Granada on Saturday. Barcelona, seeking a fourth successive league title, now cannot afford to slip up in Sunday's trip to city rivals Espanyol. Jose Mourinho's Real made the perfect start after the Spanish winter break as Karim Benzema netted twice and Cristiano Ronaldo extended his leading goal tally to 21. It was Real's 14th win in 17 league games for a total of 43 points from a possible 51, with 61 goals for and 16 against. Benzema opened the scoring after 20 minutes after Ronaldo and Mesut Ozil combined well inside the box, but 14th-placed Granada surprisingly leveled soon after as Mikel Rico headed in a cross by Nigeria forward Ikechukwu Uche. Who will be January's top transfer targets? Spain defender Sergio Ramos restored the home side's advantage as he powerfully nodded in Ozul's 34th-minute corner, and Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain made it 3-1 straight after the break with his 13th league goal this season after fullback Marcelo was allowed to surge into the box. Benzema made it safe in the 50th minute as the France forward controlled Xabi Alonso's lofted diagonal pass and fired in a low shot for his 10th in La Liga and 16th overall. Ronaldo finally got on the scoresheet with a minute of regulation time remaining, as the world's most expensive player -- who is on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award to be named on Monday -- fired in from the edge of the penalty area. That took the Portugal captain four goals clear of Barca's Lionel Messi, who is hoping to win his third successive world player of the year title. Fourth-placed Levante face the prospect of losing ground on Valencia after being held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Real Mallorca. Valencia, who trail Barca by four points, can move six clear of their local rivals by winning at third-bottom Villarreal on Sunday. Levante did, however, stay four points clear of fifth-placed Osasuna, who also played out a stalemate at Real Sociedad as both those sides extended their unbeaten runs to six matches. Sevilla can leapfrog the Pamplona-based side with victory at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Malaga also had the chance to claim fifth by beating Atletico Madrid in Saturday's late match, but there were no goals in that game either and the home side had to settle for going a point above Sevilla into sixth. Racing Santander moved above second-bottom Sporting Gijon, Villarreal and Vallecano with a 1-0 victory at home to Real Zaragoza that lifted the Cantabrians out of the relegation zone. Bernardo Espinosa's winner in first-half injury time left Zaragoza five points adrift at the bottom of the table.","Karim Benzema scores twice as Spanish league leaders Real Madrid beat Granada 5-1 .

"Taquaritinga, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's orange harvest is nearing its end as workers in the state of Sao Paulo pluck late-blooming fruit from the trees. The yellow-green oranges will be shipped off to nearby juice factories and then shipped around the globe. Those exports rake in $2 billion for Brazil, the biggest orange juice exporter in the world, accounting for 85 percent of global exports. But now, it is not clear if Brazilian orange juice will be allowed into one of its key markets: the United States. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration temporarily halted all orange juice imports after low levels of the unapproved fungicide carbendazim were found in some juice shipments from Brazil. More recently, the FDA said the juice is safe for consumption. Growers in Sao Paulo say they have been using carbendazim for some 20 years and point out that it is allowed -- in low levels -- across Europe and Latin America. It is also allowed in trace amounts in other food products, like nuts, in the United States. ""We didn't even know that it had been banned in orange juice in the United States in 2009,"" Marco Antonio dos Santos, a third generation orange grower, told CNN. Dos Santos, also the president of the Citrus Department at the Agriculture Ministry, says there are alternatives, however. In fact, he and other growers already rotate the use of carbendazim with other fungicides and techniques for preventing diseases like black spot, which make the oranges fall from the trees before they are ripe. He says Brazilian growers don't want to lose the American market, which is their second biggest after Europe. The United States currently buys 15 percent of BrazilÂ¹s orange juice exports. ""If we have to, we'll eliminate this product completely,"" he said as he walked, showing off his 60-acre grove. ""We want to supply the American market, we don't in any way want to lose it. We can adapt to the American system with other products."" Growers here would take a hit if this latest crop were barred from America. Global orange juice prices would rise, too. But Dos Santos says producers can adapt quickly and could produce the next crop carbendazim-free if it were necessary. While Brazilian farmers and industry leaders don't see a threat to consumers' health, they say the most important thing is that people aren't afraid to drink orange juice.","Brazil is the biggest orange juice exporter in the world .

"(CNN) -- Nate Ball, an MIT-trained mechanical engineer, wants to find out how things work -- even when they're inside his throat. A two-time NCAA All-American pole-vaulter, former host of a PBS show, entrepreneur and co-founder of a company -- Atlas Devices, which creates powered rope ascenders -- Ball is also a beatboxer. He manipulates his voice to make deep, baritone sounds and robotic noises. He fluctuates from quick staccato beats and deep bass to buzzes and record-scratching sounds. ""Beatboxing is one of the most natural things I can imagine a person doing,"" he said. ""We're rhythmic beings through and through. We walk in rhythm, our hearts beat in rhythm."" Ball's philosophy is that human bodies are ""incredible machines capable of amazing beauty. ... The possibilities are endless,"" he said at TEDMED, a conference about great ideas in health care in October. ""When I'm beatboxing, it's fun to add elements: scratching like a record, there's beats, talking while you're doing a beat -- which is not easy to do on the fly,"" he said. ""That's what beatboxing is all about. It's about putting together all the crazy noises you can possibly manage and making it sound cool."" Other than being fun, Ball wondered: How does it all work? To figure out what's happening inside his brain, he went inside an fMRI, an imaging machine that can show brain activity through blood flow. When he performed a beat from memory, his brain activity was different from when he improvised. When he created a beat on the fly, the brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in self-monitoring, shut down. But other networks in his brain activated, including the cerebellum, which handles motor coordination, and and the temporal lobe, which is involved in auditory perception and emotional response. But Ball wanted to find out more -- What's happening inside his throat to form those sounds? To get a closer look, he had a fiber optic camera lowered through his nose to investigate at TEDMED. This wasn't his first time getting a laryngoscopy. With the camera inside his body and an image projected onto the big screen, Ball continued to beatbox. The camera showed it wasn't only the vocal cords that help to create sounds. ""Making the robot voice, I thought my vocal cords were vibrating, flapping at a low frequency,"" Ball said. When he growled or let out a deep hum, his arytenoid cartilage and other tissues nearby his vocal cords also vibrated. ""It's fascinating and captivating and gross,"" he said. The video is not for the squeamish, since you can see lots of human tissue and saliva. But it shows how the human body works. ""It's this thrilling edge of discovery,"" he said -- even when it's inside your own body.","Nate Ball wanted to see how his body is able to beatbox .

"New York (CNN) -- The young New York student whose tale of hard work and endurance in the face of homelessness has captured many hearts -- and whose recognition in the prestigious Intel science competition has already given her much to celebrate -- will be attending the president's State of the Union speech. ""Well, you know the SOTU attracts the most powerful people in the world, and I think Samantha can teach them a lesson in perseverance,"" New York Rep. Steve Israel said. Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has extended his plus one to Samantha Garvey, a 17-year-old homeless science superstar from Brentwood, New York. Garvey was told last week at the shelter her family had been staying in that her study on the ribbed sea mussels of Long Island's salt marshes had earned her semifinalist recognition in Intel's science talent search and a potential $100,000 scholarship. Two days later, after county officials heard Garvey's story, they announced that a three-bedroom home in Bellmore would be rented for the Garvey family as part of Suffolk County's affordable housing program. The Garveys were living in a shelter after being kicked out of their home on New Year's Eve. Israel called Garvey ""an inspiration,"" and said he thought her presence would be an important influence on attendees of President Barack Obama's address on January 24. ""The same people that will praise Samantha with one hand might be the same people that will slash budgets for science and education on the other,"" Israel said. Her story, he said, was one of staying steadfast in the face of adversity. Israel said he had plans for himself and Garvey to meet with multiple White House officials before the speech. The next day, Garvey will find out if she made it to the Intel finals.","New York Rep. Steve Israel invites homeless science scholar to speech .

"(CNN) -- Actor Robert Pattinson dropped the f-bomb and singer Justin Timberlake grabbed the breasts of co-star Mila Kunis, who returned the favor by grabbing the pop singer's crotch. And so went the 2011 edition of the MTV Movie Awards, where the outrageous and often sophomoric antics of the ceremony's featured performers tend to grab, so to speak, more attention than the awards themselves. Between the gropes, the profanities and the off-color humor at Sunday night's 2011 version of the annual awards show, actors dispensed trophies to other actors. ""Eclipse,"" the third installment in the teen vampire saga ""Twilight,"" carried the night with five awards. That included honors for Best Picture as well as the Best Male and Female Performance awards, which went to co-stars Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. The movie also carried MTV's Best Fight and Best Kiss awards. Meanwhile the award for best villain went to Tom Felton for his seventh outing as the churlish, bad boy wizard Draco Malfoy in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" Ellen Page claimed the dubious Best Scared-As-(expletive) Performance prize for a supporting role in ""Inception,"" and Emma Stone took top honors in the comedy category for her role in ""Easy A."" MTV gave actress Reese Witherspoon, who at 35 was likely the most senior award recipient of the bunch, a ""Generation Award,"" in recognition of her career in movies. However, the moment was marred or immortalized -- depending on your point of view -- by an apparent failure of impulse-control by presenter Pattinson. Pattinson, who played Witherspoon's lover in ""Water for Elephants,"" told the audience ""I did (expletive) you,"" uttering a profanity broadcast over the air without a bleep. Pattinson didn't stop there. Moments later he quipped that that Witherspoon might be ""33 percent lesbian."" Witherspoon wasn't the only celebrity to get ribbed for her fictional or real-life romantic pursuits. Awards host Jason Sudeikis told the audience that actress and singer Selena Gomez had already swallowed three of boyfriend Justin Bieber's baby teeth while kissing the teen singing star. Bieber, by the way, won Best Jaw Dropping Moment Winner for his biopic movie, ""Never Say Never.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police said Tuesday that they would seek court permission to extend the detention of a Lebanese man they have charged with illegal possession of explosive materials. The move comes amid tension after the United States and Israel warned their citizens in Bangkok on Friday of the possibility of an imminent terrorist attack. The police charged the man, Atris Hussein, on Monday after finding ""initial chemical materials that could produce bombs"" in an area just outside Bangkok. The police said Hussein, who also holds a Swedish passport, led them to the location. The authorities are accusing Hussein of trying to attack spots in Bangkok that are popular with Western tourists and say he is believed to belong to Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the United States views as a terrorist organization. Hussein will be brought to the criminal court Tuesday, so that the police can request authorization to continue to hold him as they pursue their investigation, said Piya Uthayo, a police spokesman. The charges of illegally possessing explosives carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Thai authorities said Sunday they were still looking for another suspect of Middle Eastern origin in the case, providing a sketch of his face. The materials found Monday in Samutsakorn, southwest of Bangkok, included 400 boxes of fertilizers weighing a total of more than 4,000 kilograms and 1,500 liters of liquid ammonia nitrate, together with 400 electric fans, according to CNN affiliate MCOT. They were found in a shop house, a type of store common in Southeast Asia that gives onto the sidewalk and also serves as the owner's residence. Based on comments from Hussein, the authorities believe that ""Thailand is only a transit point to send these initial explosive materials to other regional countries,"" said Police General Priewpan Damapong. A U.S. Embassy statement on Friday spoke of ""foreign terrorists"" who may be planning attacks ""in the near future."" It urged U.S. citizens to exercise caution when visiting public areas where large groups of Western tourists gather in Bangkok. Israel issued a similar alert later Friday. Thailand is a highly popular tourist destination, and Bangkok serves as a major transport hub for the Southeast Asian region. The country has undergone periods of unrest in recent years. It experienced a spate of political violence during anti-government demonstrations in 2010. And Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces in a country that is overwhelmingly Buddhist, with a number of bombings taking place last year.","Thai police have charged a Lebanese man with illegally possessing explosives .

"(CNN) -- The video of four U.S. Marines urinating on three dead Taliban fighters has ricocheted around the world with viral speed, rightly provoking moral outrage abroad and shame at home. The act is a violation of professional military conduct and the fundamental moral requirement in war of showing dignity and respect to the dead. But the desecration shocks, not because it involves any sadistic mutilation of body for prize or trophy, but because the act is so primitive and regressed: Urinating marks territory. The sigh heard in the video is the vanquisher's exuberance in being top dog. Perhaps the Marines felt a need to do something with the enemy bodies that lay at their feet-- to kick them, to spit on them, to urinate on them while they waited for the proper authorities to collect them. But vengeful impulses need to be checked. Command culture, especially in small units like this sniper platoon, sets the tone and helps prevent these lapses of character and the awful consequences that ensue. Desecration of bodies in war is nothing new nor is the public condemnation of it. In Homer's Iliad, Achilles' raging grief at the death of his beloved Patroclus leads to an ugly enactment of revenge. Achilles vanquishes Hector, Patroclus' killer, and then lashing the body behind a chariot, drags his corpse face down three times around Patroclus' tomb. The act transgresses fundamental Greek decorum in war. Homer leaves no doubt about this: ""That man without a shred of decency in his heart."" He outrages ""even the senseless clay in all his fury."" The desecration offends the gods, too, and they intervene to insure that Hector's body remains intact despite Achilles' brutality. And all this comes after Hector pleads to Achilles with his last breath: ""I beg you, beg you by your life, your parents, don't let the dogs devour me... give my body to friends to carry home again"" for ""honor with fitting rites."" The soldier's fear that his body may be despoiled by the enemy or never repatriated is universal and is at the heart of the Geneva conventions and customary international law that prohibit ""outrages against personal dignity."" Anyone who has watched over the body of a loved one knows that humanitarian treatment has a proper place both toward the living and the dead. Yet we have not always respected that dignity toward our own war dead. Consider the recent reports that the Air Force, in charge of the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, shipped and incinerated remains from hundreds of troops over the past decade and dumped them in a Virginia landfill. In one report from The Washington Post, Gari-Lynn Smith was, in her words, ""appalled and disgusted"" when she learned the fate of her husband's remains: ""My only peace of mind in losing my husband was that he was taken to Dover and that he was handled with dignity, love, respect and honor,"" she said. ""That was completely shattered for me when I was told that he was thrown in the trash."" Why worry about remains? I suspect it is simply because the living return to us -- however war-torn their bodies and souls -- and we want something of that for our dead, so that we can mark an honorable passage from this world. We demand that respect both from others who find our dead and from those explicitly entrusted to the care of their bodies. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is emblematic of that very need for a return home. Urinating on fresh corpses is repulsive mockery of the dead. This case is one of collective behavior, the act of a foursome or fivesome, where someone should have known better, among them and higher up. The incident brings to mind one that Tim O'Brien recounts in ""The Things They Carried,"" his fictionalized memoir of his Vietnam years. His platoon took sniper fire and ordered an airstrike in response. Shortly after, the unit went to the scene of the strike and found an old man, lying face-up with flies already buzzing around his corpse. They propped the body up against a fence, and one by one, the unit members shook his hand and faked introductions and a toast as part of a mock funeral. Tim is the only one who refrains, sickened by the indecent sport. He's berated for not joining in, but one buddy is admiring: ""You did a good thing today,"" he said. ""That shaking hands crap, it isn't decent. ... Should've done it myself. Takes guts."" Tim demurs: ""It wasn't guts. I was scared."" It doesn't really matter whether what he did was an act of moral courage or moral disgust. The point is that he's moved by empathy, in this case toward a civilian, but it could just as well have been an enemy fighter. We shouldn't underestimate the power of that empathy and the responsibility military leaders have to keep it alive and well in their troops. I've heard of soldiers finding photos in the pockets of those they've killed and seeing in the face of a daughter or a son or a wife the bitter loss they will suffer. An Israeli who fought in the 1967 Six-Day War told me recently that the thought that raced through his mind when he killed a young Egyptian who was aiming his weapon at him, was ""He has a mother. ... What will she do?"" It is that empathy that checks ugly revenge impulses in war. It is at the core of humanitarian rules of war and their constraints.

"LAREDO, Texas (CNN)  -- Rosalio Reta sits at a table inside a Laredo Police Department interrogation room. A detective, sitting across the table, asks him how it all started. Gabriel Cardona, who shows his tattooed eyelids, worked as a hit man for a Mexican cartel. Reta, in Spanish street slang, describes his initiation as an assassin, at the age of 13, for the Mexican Gulf Cartel, one of the country's two major drug gangs. ""I thought I was Superman. I loved doing it, killing that first person,"" Reta says on the videotape obtained by CNN. ""They tried to take the gun away, but it was like taking candy from kid."" Rosalio Reta and his friend, Gabriel Cardona, were members of a three-person cell of American teenagers working as cartel hit men in the United States, according to prosecutors. The third was arrested by Mexican authorities and stabbed to death in prison there three days later. In interviews with CNN, Laredo police detectives and prosecutors told how Cardona and Reta were recruited by the cartel to be assassins after they began hitting the cantinas and clubs just across the border.  Watch how the teens turned into drug cartel hitmen » . CNN has also obtained detailed court records as well as several hours of police interrogation videos. The detective sitting across the table from Reta and Cardona in those sessions is Robert Garcia. He's a veteran of the Laredo Police Department and one of the few officers who has questioned the young men. ""One thing you wonder all the time: What made them this way?"" Garcia told CNN. ""They were just kids themselves, waiting around playing PlayStation or Xbox, waiting around for the order to be given."" Over a nearly one-year period starting in June 2005, the border town of Laredo, Texas, saw a string of seven murders. At first glance, the violence looked like isolated, gangland-style killings. But investigators started suspecting something more sinister. Then Noe Flores was gunned down in a clear case of mistaken identity. Investigators found a fingerprint on a cigarette box inside the suspected shooter's get-away car. That clue unraveled the chilling reality and led police to arrest Gabriel Cardona and Rosalio Reta. Prosecutors say they quickly discovered these two teenagers were homegrown assassins, hired to carry out the dirty work of the notorious Gulf Cartel. ""There are sleeper cells in the U.S.,"" said Detective Garcia. ""They're here, they're here in the United States."" The cases against Cardona and Reta -- both are in prison serving long prison sentences for murder -- shed new light into the workings of the drug cartels. Prosecutor and investigators say Reta and Cardona were recruited into a group called ""Los Zetas,"" a group made up of former members of the Mexican special military forces. They're considered ruthless in how they carry out attacks. ""Los Zetas"" liked what they saw in Cardona and Reta. Both teenagers received six-month military-style training on a Mexican ranch. Investigators say Cardona and Reta were paid $500 a week each as a retainer, to sit and wait for the call to kill. Then they were paid up to $50,000 and 2 kilos of cocaine for carrying out a hit. The teenagers lived in several safe houses around Laredo and drove around town in a $70,000 Mercedes-Benz. As the teens became more immersed in the cartel lifestyle, their appearance changed. Cardona had eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids. Reta's face became covered in tattoo markings. (Prosecutors say during his trial Reta used make-up to cover the facial markings.) And both sported tattoos of ""Santa Muerte,"" the Grim Reaper-like pseudo-saint worshipped by drug traffickers. ""These organizations, these cartels, they function like a Fortune 500 company,"" Webb County, Texas, prosecutor Uriel Druker said. ""We have to remember that the United States is the market they are trying to get to."" In Cardona's interrogation tape, there are clues that ""Los Zetas"" are reaching deeper and deeper into the United States. Cardona is asked, ""Where else are the Zetas?"" And Cardona responds, ""I've heard in Dallas and Houston."" And that's why the cartel recruited these young Americans. Cardona and Reta could move freely and easily back and forth across the border with Mexico. Just hours before they were arrested, federal authorities taped a phone conversation between them in which Cardona brags about killing 14-year-old Inez Villareal and his cousin, a Cardona rival. Cardona laughs as he describes torturing the two boys and dumping their bodies in large metal drums filled with diesel fuel. He says he made ""guiso,"" or stew, with their bodies. As the call ends, Cardona says, ""There are three left to kill, there are three left.""","U.S. teens are accused of acting as Mexican cartel hit men in Laredo, Texas .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice is leading a U.S. delegation to Juba for Saturday's ceremonies marking the independence of South Sudan, the White House said Wednesday. Members of the delegation will include Rep. Donald M. Payne, D-New Jersey and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights; former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of African Affairs Johnnie Carson; U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan Princeton N. Lyman; Deputy National Security Adviser Brooke Anderson; Donald K. Steinberg, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development; Gen. Carter F. Ham, commander of United States Africa Command; R. Barrie Walkley, U.S. consul general in Juba; and Ken Hackett, president of Catholic Relief Services. Two senior administration officials said they expected the Obama administration to announce its intention to name an ambassador to the new nation. Lyman has already traveled to the region to foster a smooth transition between the two countries. He is visiting Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and is expected to join former South African President Thabo Mbeki in support of ongoing talks between officials in Khartoum, Sudan, and Juba -- a fast-growing city soon to become South Sudan's new capital. The two men are expected to lend support to a peace agreement that ended Sudan's second civil war, and help moderate potential conflicts over resource sharing, disputed border areas and citizenship matters, the State Department said. Lyman is expected to travel to Khartoum for meetings with senior Sudanese officials, the statement said, and then to Juba to attend South Sudan's independence ceremony. The flurry of U.S. diplomatic activity comes as satellite images released Wednesday reveal a heavy north Sudanese military presence in an oil-rich border region. Images from the U.S.-based Satellite Sentinel Project showed an apparent Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) convoy of ""significant size"" traveling through the town of Kadugli. The monitoring group, started by actor George Clooney, said the convoy was 2 kilometers in length and included about 1,000 troops and heavy trucks carrying artillery. ""Less than a week after signing yet another agreement, the Sudanese regime appears to be ignoring its commitment, holding to form, and positioning military assets for intensified offensive operations,"" said John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project, which aims to end genocide and war crimes. ""This cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for Sudanese civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the Khartoum regime continues to fuel."" The Satellite Sentinel Project combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with mapping technology in hopes of deterring the resumption of the bloody and bitter civil war north and south fought for decades. The monitoring group said fighting between the Sudanese forces and the south's Sudan People's Liberation Army has been reported in the city of Kadugli in the past week. Southerners voted for independence in a January referendum, and with the scheduled July 9 date of separation looming, many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full-scale war. Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan, a state that lies north of the border but where many people, especially in the Nuba Mountains, are allied with the south. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes, and many fear that, after strict borders go into place with independence, they will not be able to return home. ""South Sudan will be born into crisis,"" predicted Susan Purdin, who oversees International Rescue Committee aid programs in South Sudan. ""Widening violence is triggering more displacement, threatening the lives of vulnerable civilians and hampering access to communities in need while an existing humanitarian emergency grows worse,"" she said. Critical issues -- including oil and the final status of Abyei -- remain unresolved. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States applauded talks between north and south but remained concerned about the unresolved matters. ""The United States also calls on the parties to end the fighting in Southern Kordofan, and to facilitate unfettered access for aid workers to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict,"" Nuland said. Discussions are under way on how to shape the post-independence U.N. mission in South Sudan, created in 2005 with a peacekeeping mandate. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has intervened in pushing the parties to accept U.N. peacekeepers. And the United Nations Security Council will meet next week to discuss whether to recommend a new member state's entry into the global body. Peter Wittig, the U.N. ambassador of Germany, which holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month, said council members will meet July 13 to talk about U.N. admission. If granted, South Sudan would become the first state since Montenegro in 2006 to become a U.N. member.

"(CNN) -- What's to become of me? Eliza Doolittle asks in ""My Fair Lady,"" one of the most successful and popular musicals of all time. That same question is fitting when it comes to Sarah Palin. Because like Doolittle, Palin has and is undergoing quite a transformation before our very eyes. Doolittle's metamorphosis happens on a Broadway stage. Palin's on a political one. And as the plot thickens the audience is captive, wondering if either ingÃ©nue will meet the challenge: flower girl or presidential candidate? But unlike Eliza Doolittle, who was a malleable and willing subject, in the ongoing musical that is Sarah Palin, the student has become the teacher. Instead of ruing her lot as an outsider, she embraced it. And by doing so, in just a few years Palin has outmaneuvered, even leapfrogged her Professor Higgins, John McCain. So, regardless of her decision about a presidential run, Palin has positioned herself as the kingmaker of conservative politics. How did she do it? Perhaps by sheer shrewdness or sheer luck, Palin spotted an opportunity early on with a growing chorus of other self-proclaimed outsiders, the tea party, and seized on it. Now, while the Republican straw polls, caucuses and debates play out, Palin simply orbits around it all, eclipsing her show's extras, the supposed front-runners. In fact, it can be argued that some of the front-runners ascended to their current positions because Sarah Palin helped them get there. Because of Palin's celebrity billing, her raising money and campaigning for Michele Bachmann's congressional re-election in 2010 helped to elevate Bachmann's national profile. Just before Palin joined her on the campaign trail last year, Bachmann wrote, ""There is absolutely no one more in tune with the hearts and minds of everyday Americans than Gov. Palin."" Around that same time, when a politician with barely any name recognition above the Mason Dixon line needed a big name endorsement and some publicity to help get him re-elected, he called on Sarah Palin and she responded. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said then of Palin, ""If there's a bigger endorsement in the Republican universe, I don't know who it is than Sarah."" That same year, in a stunning display of role reversal, when her former presidential running mate, John McCain, faced an unexpectedly tough senatorial re-election bid, Palin once again became his leading lady. After Palin accepted McCain's invitation, he wrote, ""I'm looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail with my former running mate."" He went on to say Palin ""energized our nation and remains a leading voice in the Republican Party."" Bachmann, Perry and McCain aren't the only current or former presidential hopefuls to lavish praise on the former Alaska governor. In what some call a cringe-worthy moment, in 2008 at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, Jon Huntsman nominated Palin as his party's vice-presidential nominee. On the verge of losing his voice from speaking over a crowd yelling, 'Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,' Huntsman said, ""Hockey moms of the world unite. History will be made tonight and her name is Sarah Palin."" (Applause) ""We are looking for a beacon of light to show us the way. We are looking for an American who represents every one of us, who can relate to the needs of our families and the struggles of our country. We are looking for Sarah."" That was quite a ringing endorsement. In fact, all of them are. With her accolades caught on video, Palin needn't toil in creating campaign ads against most of the current GOP presidential candidates. ""Just roll the tape,"" could make for another simple yet effective Palin catch phrase -- one of her specialties . And let's not leave Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich out of this cast. While a bit more muted in his praise of Palin, Romney has supported her in the past. In a 2008 CBS News interview, Romney told Harry Smith, ""She's been a positive addition to the ticket. I think she's fired up the base and is drawing out volunteers."" And that same year Newt Gingrich told NBC News, ""She has a stronger resume than Barack Obama. She's been a real mayor. He hasn't. She's been a real governor. He hasn't."" That was just the beginning of his supportive monologue about Palin live on cable television. It will be hard for the current field of GOP hopefuls to walk back what came out of their own mouths. They said it but Palin is using it to write her own script and lyrics in just what might turn out to be the presidential campaign of the future. How does it all end? Will she run? Only she knows. But one thing is for sure: Palin loves the drama and the spotlight. And they appear to love her, too. So, the finale of this musical depends on none other than the star, the writer, the producer and the director of the show, Sarah Palin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Don Lemon.","Sarah Palin has transformed from obscure governer to GOP kingmaker .

"Toyota City, Japan (CNN) -- The head of Toyota Motor Corp. told his employees on Friday that the company must begin again if it is to regain its legacy of quality that helped make it the world's largest automotive company. ""We must make February 24, the day of U.S. congressional hearing, as the day of restart for Toyota,"" said Akio Toyoda, referring to his appearance in Washington before a U.S. congressional committee investigating the recall of Toyota vehicles for problems related to stuck brakes and accelerator pedals. ""We should throw away all our past success and review our value of existence once more,"" he told an assembly of 2000 employees, while 7000 more watched by video. ""I'd like to revisit, not only with words but with action what our real duties are. We must go forward step by step. We must unite and do our best."" The speech was part of an aggressive charm offensive by Toyoda to bolster the company's image after 8.5 million cars were recalled in North America, Europe, China and Japan in recent months. Toyoda was widely criticized for not appearing in public for two weeks in January as the global recall crisis spiraled. The morale-boosting talk to employees comes a week after his trip to Washington and a visit to Beijing earlier this week to apologize to customers there. ""The quality problems we face now have not been solved yet. And a mountain of work has to be done,"" he said. ""But what I can reconfirm (through the U.S. visit) was not only remorse, but also our strength ... the strength of the bond that all of the Toyota family share,"" he said. The meeting was dubbed ""Urgent meeting for all Toyota --towards the new start of Toyota"" and was organized by Toyota's middle managers, many of whom packed the hall of Toyota's world headquarters wearing their gray work uniforms. They applauded often during the speeches by all five Toyota executives who participated at the U.S. congressional hearings, including Jim Lentz, head of Toyota Motor Sales USA. ""We are confident that Toyota vehicles are safe, and we will do everything we can to ensure that our customers are satisfied with repairs that we are making,"" Lentz said. Lentz added, ""We are going to continue to face with criticisms, and that's going to be a long road ahead."" Mitsuru Kawai, a Toyota factory head who has worked for the company for 44 years, said after the meeting that it was good ""we could share what the executives went through in their own words. We would like to work as one to serve the customers' demands.""","Employees applaud often during speeches by all five Toyota executives .

"(CNN) -- Fred Wiseman has been at the forefront of the American documentary scene ever since his bombshell of a first film in 1967. ""Titicut Follies"" may sound like a burlesque extravaganza, but in fact the film was a deeply disturbing expose of life inside a correctional institution for the criminally insane. Since then, Wiseman has built up an extraordinary body of work. It includes nearly 40 feature films, many of them more than three hours long, largely preoccupied with examining the apparatus of social institutions: hospitals, high schools, parks and zoos. All of them are framed according to Wiseman's own rigorous observational style, which involves sustained scrutiny, no voice-over and no interviews. He's into process, not personality. With a Wiseman film, it's up to the viewer to supply the commentary. That's easier when the subject concerns alleged inadequate welfare programs or dysfunctional government institutions. In his last few films, the septuagenarian director has turned his gaze on less overtly political matters: the esteemed Ballet de l'Opera company in ""La Danse"" (2009); an Austin, Texas, training facility in ""Boxing Gym"" (2010); and now, a Parisian cabaret, in ""Crazy Horse."" In this loose-limbed documentary, Wiseman is more like an impressionist painter -- Degas is the obvious example -- than a social activist or a reporter. He's looking at the human body, at model physical specimens and at perceptions of beauty. ""Crazy Horse"" can be viewed as a series of nude studies built around the contrast between the dancers' casual nakedness backstage and the highly fetishistic, filtered nudity on stage. Surprisingly (and disappointingly), Wiseman foregrounds the latter; we scarcely learn the dancers' names and rarely hear them speak. You might expect marked differences between a distinguished ballet company and a glorified strip club, but Wiseman seems to see them in much in the same light (not literally; the chromatic effects at the club are designed to dazzle, and they do). The Crazy Horse, or ""Le Crazy"" for short, aspires to art with almost comical sincerity. This is Paris, after all, and intellectuals are a prime target audience. Like ""La Danse,"" the new film dedicates most of its running time to rehearsal and performance, interspersed with sometimes tense exchanges behind the scenes involving the creative personnel (in this case, primarily director/choreographer Philippe Decoufle) and management (managing director Andree Deissenberg). The ""artistes"" always want more time, and the shareholders are invariably fixated on the bottom line. Which is understandable at the Crazy Horse, where dancing cheek to cheek means something very different from what Irving Berlin had in mind. (Or did he?) At various points, the people who work there describe it as the best chic nude club in the world, and the classiest. A better description might be the kitschiest. In one routine, Decoufle's dancers enact a ""Barbarella"" number as if it were ""Solaris."" In another, they parade around in Beefeater bearskin hats and not much else. (If the club had a uniform, it would be a thong -- though high heels and fishnets also feature strongly.) The music is mostly a cheesy mix of classic bump-and-grind and '70s Italian sex comedy. Once or twice, the choreography does break the mold -- to push into the exploratory eroticism of modern interpretative dance -- but at heart, the sensuality celebrated here is as safe and conventional as a Playboy bunny. Does Wiseman disagree? Of course he never says so, but the film is laced with enough subtly suggestive ironies to prick all that oh-so-French pomposity and pretension, without ever undermining the discipline and commitment of dancers and choreographers. ""Be pretty, classy, relaxed -- and calm -- and push your buttocks out,"" recommends a stage manager to a group of new girls before their audition. ""American Idol"" this ain't. Wiseman may be the one documentarian on Earth uninterested in revealing who makes the cut. Still, it's clear this is excellent advice; maybe all you need to know to get by in Le Crazy. Brightly photographed in high definition, the movie is an eyeful all right, but at 134 minutes, it's also a rather lengthy tease.","In this loose-limbed documentary, Fred Wiseman is more like an impressionist painter .

"(CNN) -- Speculation about the future of American Airlines has been swirling for months. Still, many travelers were stunned Tuesday to learn that the carrier and its parent company have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. American, American Eagle and all other subsidiaries will honor all tickets and reservations and operate normal flight schedules during the bankruptcy filing process. CNN airline and aviation correspondent Richard Quest weighed in on some of the basic questions about the airline's decision. Why has American Airlines decided to make this move? Richard Quest: They're doing it for one simple reason: The American Airlines cost base is considerably higher than United, Continental, and Delta, which merged with Northwest. Those other airlines did go through Chapter 11 during (past) recessions and they managed to slash their costs. So now American has been struggling for the last few years trying to negotiate, trying to get agreements, trying to get its costs down. But frankly, with oil prices high, with growth slowing down, and with so many other competitive disadvantages, incoming CEO Thomas Horton told me a short while ago they really had no choice. It was time to push the nuclear button. There's no doubt it is a dramatic development for a company that has several billions of dollars in cash. It has good strong hubs. All in all, this is being done purely and simply not because American is going bankrupt -- the planes are still flying, the champagne is still being served in first class, all things will be normal -- it's being done to get down the costs. If I have a ticket now or for six months from now, should I be worried? Quest: There is no danger that American Airlines is going to stop flying. Let's be absolutely crystal clear about that. For the traveling public, this has absolutely no effect. I think many travelers are used to this. They flew United in Chapter 11, they flew Delta, US Airways and all the others in Chapter 11 during those times. Horton told me he hopes the Chapter 11 will last less time than the others, the average being 16 months. If you're flying American, don't worry . Are any changes coming to the airline? Quest: The people who I think perhaps will be watching and be concerned are American's employees. No changes immediately, but longer term, they can expect to see some significant changes in their benefits and in their conditions of employment.","American Airlines files for bankruptcy; says it will operate normal flight schedules .

"(CNN) -- Lately it's hard to tell the difference between a presidential debate and ""The Jerry Springer Show."" Yeah, I know. Some of you have been saying this for months. But my comment isn't a criticism of the candidates, but the live audience. I was hoping this audience ""whoop"" factor would go away over the long debate season, but it has only grown worse. Are they serving alcohol at the debates? It seems like it. In last night's Republican presidential debate, held in the Myrtle Beach Convention Center in South Carolina, the chaotic audience once again played an awkward role in the questions and answers. Why does this matter? On these presidential debates, the vocal live audiences have shown themselves to be more disruptive than productive. And I've seen debate judges (people who should know better) in intercollegiate tournaments have their decisions influenced by a noisy audience â€” even judges trained to be impartial and objective. In this case, the judges are you, the audience. I know everyone believes they can't be swayed like this, but it still happens (even to me, which is one of the reasons I watch the presidential debates alone. I don't want anyone influencing my analysis). There is even a name for it in the literature. Emotional contagion. And it was apparent Monday night -- fanboys (and fangirls) who were every bit as rabid as a football crowd. The only people missing were face-paint girl and shirtless guy. (Of course, it's hard to tell on television how much of the crowd participated in the cheering and booing.) It was especially annoying because the live audience was booing their disapproval at inappropriate times. Two examples. Juan Williams, one of the moderators, was asking Mitt Romney about his immigration policies when he was interrupted in mid-question. Williams had begun the question by stating that Mitt Romney's father was born in Mexico. ""Boo!"" came the shouts from the audience. What? What in the world were they booing? I still have no idea. It could have been Juan Williams, the question, Romney's father, or Romney's position on immigration. It made no sense. Then the live audience ganged up on Ron Paul. Remember, Paul has some of the more unconventional foreign policy positions for a conservative Republican audience. And Paul was not at his best last night (I've heard him defend his argument much more effectively) when explaining his position on the military operation that killed Osama bin Laden. But the audience mistimed its reaction and used most of its vitriol immediately after Paul said the American people wouldn't like it if the United States were treated the same way it treated other countries. Paul reiterated his stance that we should use the golden rule -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you -- when the boos rang out. I couldn't believe it. I was indeed hearing this correctly. The crazed audience at the presidential debate actually booed the golden-freaking-rule. What's next? Helping old women cross the street? ""Boo! ... Villain!"" Puppies? ""Hiss ... Shame!"" And the audience was equally annoying when applauding. Remember: Cheering should prove nothing to you in a debate except that some candidates are better than others at stacking the live audience with supporters. I'm also beginning to wonder if there is an ""applause"" sign that lights up so some of the slower audience operatives will remember when to react. For their part, the candidates handled the live audience pretty well. After all, politicians are used to verbal feedback in public speeches and town hall meetings. My advice today is for the general viewing public at home. Simply keep in mind that the opinions of the live audience are not necessarily reflective of anything, including logic. And try to resist being influenced by overzealous fools watching the debate from the cheap seats. If this continues, we're in danger of letting the loud few influence the silent many watching at home. I certainly hope we can reverse this trend. Because I'd hate to see the next step: Measuring presidential debates by audience noise-meters with a needle that moves up and down. After all, higher decibel levels must indicate better policies.

"(CNN) -- In the Hezbollah militia strongholds in southern Beirut and south Lebanon, they set off fireworks and fired guns in the air. In the northern Israeli city of Haifa, people waved Egyptian and Palestinian flags. But when Egypt's vice president read President Hosni Mubarak's resignation statement Friday, patrons watching TV in Tavelino Cafe in Amman, Jordan, suddenly turned quiet. The cafe's Egyptian manager ""clearly is not happy about the news,"" said CNN iReporter Johnny Colt. ""Just last night, the man spoke to me at length about Egypt and why Mubarak needed to stay until September. When I asked him how he felt about the Mubarak news, my new friend suddenly told me he cannot speak English and that I should use my computer to find English news."" Such was the disparity of opinions that could be heard in the Middle East about the events unfolding in Egypt on Friday. So, too, were the responses from world leaders and political organizations -- some of whom ascribed starkly different reasons for the historic significance of the moment. To British Prime Minister David Cameron, Mubarak's departure was an important first step for a nation yearning for democracy. ""Today has been a remarkable day,"" Cameron said, ""particularly for those people in Tahrir Square and elsewhere, who have spoken out so bravely and so peacefully for change in their country."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Egypt's ""historic moment"" and paid tribute to Mubarak's decision to resign. He called for steps leading to free elections and reforms and urged Egyptians ""to continue their non-violent march to freedom."" For the government of Iran, Egypt's political earthquake meant something entirely different. ""A new Middle East is taking shape, not the Mideast the West had planned for but one which has been created based on Islamic awakening,"" said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast in an interview with state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency called it ""joyful coincidence"" that Egypt's revolution culminated on the 32nd anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution victory. Elsewhere in the region, political groups, some of which are hostile to Israel and the West, were quick to attach the success of the Egyptian revolt to their own aspirations. Mohammed Al-Qubati, a spokesman for Yemen's biggest opposition coalition, the Joint Meeting Parties, said ""the map of the Arab nations will change as a result of the revolution."" ""Mubarak's fall,"" Al-Qubati said, ""proves that oppression and use of force cannot add life to the current regimes, and time for change has come."" The Joint Meeting Parties is primarily a coalition of Islamists and Socialists. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called Mubarak's ouster ""a victory for the Palestinian people."" Hamas, said Zuhri, ""calls on the new Egyptian leadership to lift the siege of Gaza and to open the Rafah crossing and assure the free movement between Egypt and Palestine and to start the development construction process of Gaza."" Zuhri's remarks reflected the sentiments of Palestinians in Hamas-controlled Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza, revelers spilled into the streets, honked car horns and fired guns in celebration. Israel's two major TV channels carried the announcement of Mubarak's departure live, with images from Cairo's Tahrir Square supplemented by their political and Arab affairs commentators debating what the development means for Israel. The headline on the website of Israel's largest newspaper, Yedioth Aronoth, read, ""Mubarak Quits -- Masses Elated."" The Israeli government said little about the fall of Mubarak. The Anti-Defamation League in New York issued a statement expressing concern about how the political transformation of Egypt will affect Israel and ""what role the Muslim Brotherhood will play in the transition and beyond."" In Lebanon, public reaction appeared muted. Diners in small cafes watched Arab satellite coverage of the Egyptian street celebrations. For some, it brought back nostalgic memories of the 2005 uprising that kicked the Syrians out of Lebanon. However, a Hezbollah spokesman told CNN, ""this is the true path when the people believe in their resolve"" and it makes all their sacrifices worthwhile."" The spokesman applauded the ""the steadfastness and unity of the Egyptian people, young and old, men and women, which showed that blood was stronger than the sword."" Mubarak frequently accused Hezbollah cells of infiltrating Egypt at the behest of Iran. Western leaders have expressed concerns that a post-Mubarak Egypt could become another Iran. Egypt's pro-Western neighbors fear their governments could suffer similar fates if popular uprisings spread to their countries. Few, if any, representatives of those governments publicly uttered such fears on Friday. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh called Egypt ""a pillar in the region"" and sent along ""wishes for stability, security and prosperity."" A statement from the United Arab Emirates said its government ""is always keen to foster brotherly, distinguished historic ties with Egypt in a way that serves the interests of the two brotherly countries and their peoples."" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan released a statement expressing his government's ""hope for a peaceful transition to a participatory and pluralistic order in full respect for human rights."" Erdogan called on Egyptian military officials to exercise ""common sense and restraint"" in the transfer of power to a new democratically-elected government. So did officials representing Western governments. In the United States, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said ""it is crucial that Mubarak's departure be an orderly one and that it leads to true democracy for Egypt, including free, fair and open elections."" ""We caution all sides against violence during this transition, and we will be watching the situation closely,"" Reid said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for an Egyptian government ""that will continue to respect peace treaties and seek peace in the Middle East."" Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others, said their governments were ready to help Egypt make the transition to a democratic society. Merkel said her country would ""support as much as we can the justified requests of the people in Egypt."" China's government won't be joining Germany. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said, ""China understands and supports Egypt's efforts to maintain social stability and restore normal order and that the affairs of Egypt should be decided by itself independently without intervention from the outside."" ""China cherishes the traditional friendship and strategic cooperation with Egypt, and believes that the friendly relations between the two countries will continue to develop in a sound and steady manner,"" the official said. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Hada Messia, Mohammed Jamjoom, Tim Lister, Kevin Flower and Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","NEW: Turkish prime minister urges Egyptian army to show ""common sense and restraint""

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho is hopeful that star striker Cristiano Ronaldo will return for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Lyon. The Portugal captain will not feature in Saturday's La Liga game at home to Hercules, having sustained a thigh injury during Real's 7-0 defeat of Malaga on March 3. ""I am pretty sure he will play, but I do not like players who are not at 100%,"" Mourinho told reporters at a press conference on Friday. ""If Cristiano had to play tomorrow he wouldn't because he is not fully fit, but I am sure after training on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday he will play next Wednesday."" Real are looking to qualify for the quarterfinals of the European competition for the first time since 2004, having drawn 1-1 with the French side in the first leg of the last-16 tie on February 22. However, despite recording a 3-1 win over Racing Santander last weekend -- and having an unblemished home record this season and Mourinho with any club for the past nine years -- Real remain 11 points behind defending champions Barcelona in the Spanish league. Mourinho hit out at his arch-rivals, saying that he did not think that the two clubs were receiving the same treatment in terms of their match schedules. ""It's not fair for everyone. One team plays the Champions League on a Tuesday and La Liga on Sunday, and another play on a Wednesday and Saturday,"" he said. ""Real Madrid is not being given the same chances to compete. I am not stupid. We all know that the moment the lead increases the championship is lost."" Nevertheless, Mourinho said his side would not be taking anything for granted against 18th-placed Hercules, and hoped for a positive result before the home clash with Lyon -- who knocked Real out at the same stage last season before reaching the semifinals. ""Whoever's season is at stake isn't worried. It's not an easy match for us. Their players have a lot of personality and they will expect to earn a positive result,"" the Portuguese coach said .

This Suffolk, Virginia, house was destroyed by an apparent tornado Monday. At least 200 were injured in Suffolk where a twister destroyed several homes and businesses, said Bob Spieldenner of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The storm hit the 138-bed Sentara Obici Hospital, though Spieldenner said the facility was still operational and accepting patients. A second tornado struck Colonial Heights -- about 60 miles northwest, near Richmond -- injuring at least 18 people, he said. A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes. Gov. Tim Kaine declared a Virginia-wide state of emergency as hazardous weather continued through the central part of the state.

"(CNN) -- Verizon has been touted as having the biggest, baddest, fastest 4G around. It's been this way since the carrier debuted its LTE network in late 2010. But now that AT&T has joined the LTE game, consumers looking for top speeds might consider turning their focus to AT&T instead. If only for a while. Metrico Wireless, a firm that does network and mobile device analytics, took a look at 4G LTE service in the U.S., focusing on two of the nation's largest carriers, Verizon and AT&T. The company's latest report shows that AT&T's average LTE speeds are better than Verizon's (for now at least), and that LTE provides more than five times the performance of the carriers' respective 3G offerings. Metrico used five 4G LTE handsets for its tests: two on AT&T, three on Verizon. On AT&T, the HTC Vivid and Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket were measured. The HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Droid Charge and Motorola Droid Bionic were tested on Verizon's network. In stationary download speeds, AT&T's 4G LTE handsets outperformed those on Verizon, but Metrico believes this disparity is likely due to the fact that Verizon's LTE service is more established and has significantly more subscribers using data on it. Indeed, as of April, Verizon had over half a million LTE subscribers. AT&T, meanwhile, just launched its LTE network in five markets this summer. But while AT&T's data speeds were better, web pages actually loaded faster on the three Verizon smartphones tested. ""In general, the subscriber experience is not simply driven by the network or the device, but by the combination of the two,"" the report states. ""Even devices with similar specifications connected to similar network technologies still demonstrate variation in performance."" This was especially true with regards to video performance. Of the smartphones tested, the Samsung Droid Charge (on Verizon) consistently yielded the highest frame delivery rate, while the Motorola Droid Bionic (also on Verizon) had the lowest. Also, if you're really concerned about web page load times, consider this: All carrier-to-carrier comparisons notwithstanding, both AT&T and Verizon handsets delivered web page load times that were 80 to 85 percent shorter on LTE relative to 3G. What about battery life on an LTE device, notoriously reported as being poor? Well, depending on how you use your device, you may be able to squeeze out a few more hours, as the report found that battery life was heavily related to app use. On the AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket, you're going to get 300 to 350 minutes of use out of your device, whether you're a power user or someone who's making calls all day long. On the Verizon Droid Bionic, though, those who primarily use their phones for voice calling will gain about 150 minutes of usage over those who spend most of their time on Twitter and Facebook. Verizon's LTE network is currently the largest in terms of nationwide coverage, but AT&T's is set to rival it as it expands. And, indeed, we're finally beginning to see LTE infrastructure build-outs, industry-wide. Joining Metro PCS, Verizon and AT&T in the LTE game is Cricket Wireless, perhaps best known for its budget mobile phone and prepaid plan options. Cricket will offer speeds up to 6 Mbps with a 5 GB data cap. Sprint will begin rolling out its 4G LTE network in mid to late 2012.

"Alhambra, California (CNN) -- At first, the pool builder thought his Bobcat bulldozer struck garbage as he dug a hole in a residential backyard. After all, in the older neighborhoods of San Marino, California, people used to bury their garbage. But the plastic bag didn't contain trash. Jose Perez, operating the Bobcat with his father as a co-worker, asked his dad what was inside. His father grabbed an 18-inch piece of reinforcement bar to poke around. ""He looked inside it, and he mouthed to me that there were bones in it,"" Perez testified Wednesday in a Los Angeles County court. ""He thought it was a dog, but it didn't look like a dog. ""I told him to drop it, and he did,"" Perez continued. ""It was a human skull."" As the prosecution witness referred to the plastic bag and the pool digging project in a photograph on a big screen in court, defendant Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, in a blue jail jumpsuit, stared intently at the scene where prosecutors accuse him of murdering a man in 1985. The skull was found nine years later, on May 5, 1994, Perez testified. The testimony was evidence that Los Angeles County prosecutors began presenting during a preliminary hearing for the German-born Gerhartsreiter, who has garnered renown for impersonating a Rockefeller and inspiring a movie about the caper. He is now accused of killing a Southern California man who has been missing since the mid-1980s. Frank Sheridan, a forensic pathologist, testified the skull suffered at least one blow to the forehead and at least two blows to the right side. The several fractures were made at or about the time of death, said Sheridan, who is also the medical examiner of San Bernardino County in California. The shape of two fractures also indicated an object with a curved surface, such as a baseball bat, was used to deliver the blows, Sheridan said under questioning by a prosecutor. ""This individual was alive when these fractures occurred,"" said Sheridan, who examined a reconstructed version of the skull. In his career, he has performed 8,000 autopsies, he said. ""There's a lot of force involved in these blows,"" Sheridan added. ""Each one of them would have rendered the person unconscious. ""The injuries we're talking about here would have very clearly been fatal in the absence of medical care, and they could have been fatal even with medical care,"" he said. At the pool construction site, investigators eventually found nearly the entire skeleton of a man whose height was between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 7 1/2 inches, testified Judith Daye, a physical anthropologist who worked for the Los Angeles County's coroner office and reviewed the bones at the site. The missing bones included a kneecap, four fingers and a few toes, a common occurrence with buried remains, ""especially the hands and feet because the bones are very small,"" Daye testified. Many discovered bones were inside clothing that was wrapped in plastic, such as the pelvis inside jeans and the upper torso bones inside a shirt, Daye testified. The preliminary hearing, to determine whether Gerhartsreiter should be bound over for trial, is expected to last six days, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Gerhartsreiter, 50, is accused of killing John Sohus, who was 27 at the time of his 1985 disappearance. His mother once owned the San Marino home where the remains were found. During the Wednesday hearing, Los Angeles County Judge Jared Moses rejected a defense request that Gerhartsreiter be referred to as ""Mr. Rockefeller"" in court. The defense attorney said he and other attorneys on the team knew Gerhartsreiter as ""Mr. Rockefeller."" But the judge said: ""I get individuals in court who have a number of akas,"" a police term meaning ""also known as,"" but ""I have never seen a circumstance in court where a person is referred to by one of his akas."" Gerhartsreiter, who has led a life of multiple identities, has denied involvement in the Sohus case. At one point in his life, Gerhartsreiter assumed the identity of ""Clark Rockefeller,"" a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job. A Boston tabloid dubbed him ""Crockefeller."" A Lifetime movie, ""Who Is Clark Rockefeller?"" starred Eric McCormack as Gerhartsreiter. Gerhartsreiter, who is being held without bail, is serving a Massachusetts sentence for kidnapping his daughter; he was transferred from a prison in that state to California in July, authorities said. In July, one of his attorneys, Jeffrey A. Denner of Boston, said he wasn't aware of any breaks in the 26-year-old Sohus case that would warrant a charge against his client. ""I was personally surprised because there was so much time, and what new evidence could have arisen? We don't know anything,"" Denner said in July after Gerhartsreiter's arraignment. ""Old case, new case -- he didn't do it. We maintain his innocence. He maintains his innocence."" Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian was the prosecutor at Wednesday's hearing, held in Los Angeles County's Alhambra courthouse. The case involves 9,000 pages of investigative documents and 83 CDs, DVDs and videotapes. The whereabouts of the dead man's wife, Linda Sohus, are unknown. Except for a few postcards that appeared to have been mailed by the couple from Paris in 1985, her friends and family have not heard from her. Gibbons said last summer that her disappearance was still under investigation. Gerhartsreiter has been serving a four- to five-year sentence in Massachusetts for kidnapping his 7-year-old daughter in 2008. That prison term will end in mid-2012, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter will receive credit for that Massachusetts sentence while being incarcerated in California, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter came to the United States from Germany in 1978, according to testimony at his trial for kidnapping. After spending a few years in Connecticut, he moved to Wisconsin, where he married in a green card arrangement using his true name. Gerhartsreiter then relocated to California. He settled in San Marino, a wealthy community near Pasadena, where he lived under the name Christopher Chichester from 1983 to 1985. He posed as a film student and boasted that he was of English royalty, according to Vanity Fair magazine, which profiled him in January 2009 and quoted several people who knew Chichester at the time. As Chichester, he rented a guest house from Ruth ""Didi"" Sohus. Her son John and his wife, Linda, came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. It is unclear what his relationship was with the couple. Didi Sohus told investigators she believed that her son and daughter-in-law were in Europe. She filed a missing person report in July 1985, according to the Pasadena Star-News. Didi Sohus and one of Linda Sohus' friends received postcards postmarked from Paris in mid-1985, purportedly from the couple, but investigators were suspicious of their authenticity. Sohus sold the house in late 1985 after suffering a stroke. She died three years later. Through luminol testing of the guest quarters where Chichester lived, investigators found what appeared to be a large amount of blood. (Luminol causes a glow when it comes in contact with blood.) It is not clear when the luminol testing took place, but police thoroughly searched the house when the remains were found and again after Gerhartsreiter's arrest in the kidnapping case. A former neighbor quoted by Vanity Fair reported that Chichester borrowed a chainsaw from him at about the time the couple went missing. An acquaintance, Dana Farrar, said she ""saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in"" at the time, according to the Pasadena Star-News. When she asked him why, Chichester told her he was having plumbing problems. Sheriff's detectives from Los Angeles County sought Chichester for questioning in early May 1985, but he had disappeared in a pickup truck registered to John Sohus. He resurfaced under yet another identity, that of Christopher Crowe, in Connecticut in the late 1980s. In late 1988, Crowe tried to sell Sohus' pickup truck to a man in Connecticut. When he couldn't produce the proper paperwork for the truck, the prospective buyer reported him to police. Connecticut police soon learned that Chichester and Crowe were the same person, although at that time, no one knew that his true name was Gerhartsreiter. Crowe disappeared before police could question him. He resurfaced in Manhattan in 1993 as Clark Rockefeller. On May 5, 1994, the workers digging in the backyard of the San Marino home to install a swimming pool for the home's new owners discovered the remains. It was not until 2010 that the remains were identified. The investigation heated up again when authorities learned shortly after the 2008 kidnapping that Gerhartsreiter was not Clark Rockefeller. He was arrested in Baltimore, where he was hiding out with his daughter. He had already assumed a new identity: a ship's captain named Chip Smith who, with his daughter Muffy, was relocating to Chile. His second wife, Harvard-educated financial executive Sandra Boss, testified at the kidnapping trial that she spent more than a dozen years with him before growing suspicious that Rockefeller was not who he said he was. They met in New York and were married in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Their daughter, Reigh, was born on May 24, 2001, and her father nicknamed her ""Snooks."" The couple divorced in 2007 after Boss hired a private investigator to conduct a background check, according to testimony at the kidnapping trial.","NEW: Almost entire skeleton found after skull's discovery, anthropologist testifies .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's foreign ministry condemned Texas Gov. Rick Perry Tuesday for saying that Turkey was a ""country that is being ruled by what many would perceive to be Islamic terrorists."" Perry made the statement during a spirited debated between Republican presidential candidates in South Carolina Monday night. Most of Turkey was fast asleep during the live broadcast, and Turkish newspapers had already gone to print by the time Perry declared that Turkey had moved ""far away from the country I lived in back in the 1970s United States Air Force. That was our ally that worked with us, but today we don't see that."" The Texas governor also argued that it was time for Washington to cut foreign aid to Ankara. A spokesman for Turkey's foreign ministry fired back Tuesday, accusing Perry of making ""baseless and improper claims."" In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Selcuk Unal said presidential candidates should ""be more informed about the world and be more careful their statements."" ""The unfortunate views of Perry are not shared in any case by Republican party supporters, considering the weak support he has received in public polls and primary elections,"" Unal concluded. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the State Department ""absolutely and fundamentally"" disagrees with Perry's statements. Turkey is ""Islamic democracy in action,"" Toner added, calling Ankara a ""stalwart ally"" with which the United States has a ""strong partnership."" ""I am disappointed and concerned that Turkey and its time-tested ties of alliance, partnership and friendship with the United States became the object of misplaced and ill-advised criticism during last night's Republican candidates' debate. Needless to say, the Turkey described in the debate simply does not exist,"" Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Namik Tan, said in a statement Tuesday. He also rejected the idea that Turkey receives significant sums of foreign aid from the United States. ""Indeed, Turkey is a strong and growing trading partner with the U.S. in general, and with Texas in particular, creating thousands of jobs throughout that state,"" Tan added. Top Turkish government officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday, with many of them in Northern Cyprus for the funeral of veteran Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, but the country's largely-tabloid press wasted no time in responding to the comments on websites early Tuesday morning. ""The debate that the Republican candidate Rick Perry attended on American Fox TV turned into a scandal that contained very ugly statements about Turkey,"" announced TRT state television. ""Rick Perry: what an idiot,"" tweeted Mustafa Akyol, a columnist with the English-language Hurriyet Daily news. The Hurriyet newspaper also posted a video on its website of Perry drawing a blank in the middle of a prior debate, forgetting in mid-sentence which was the third of three government departments he would cut if elected president. Perry's remarks came on the same day a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman announced that a new NATO radar station, manned by Turkish and American military personnel, went online this month in the Turkish province of Malatya. The radar station is part of a controversial U.S.-led missile defense shield that both Russia and Iran have publicly opposed. For more than 50 years, Turkey has been the only Muslim member of the NATO military alliance. Ankara's relationship with Washington has been turbulent over the last decade, with sharp divisions emerging after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. But that relationship has improved dramatically over the last several years. Turkey has commanded the NATO mission in Afghanistan four times over the last decade, and the United States shares real-time intelligence from aerial drones for the Turkish military's ongoing war with rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, who operate along the mountainous border between Turkey and Iraq.","NEW: Turkey is ""Islamic democracy in action,"" State Dept. spokesman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Tuesday said federal officials need to ""keep harping"" on personal responsibility in the wake of the latest claim of inattention by an air traffic controller -- this one reportedly was watching a movie while on duty -- and inaction by his supervisor. The controller has been suspended, pending an investigation, for watching a movie on a portable electronic device while he was working at the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center in Oberlin, Ohio. His front-line manager, who was aware of it and didn't stop him, also was suspended, LaHood confirmed. The incident occurred early Sunday morning, when the audio from the Samuel L. Jackson thriller ""Cleaner"" was transmitted over a radio frequency for more than three minutes. ""The problem was brought to air traffic control's attention by the pilot of a military aircraft using an alternate frequency,"" according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration. FAA policy prohibits the use of portable DVD players and other devices from being used in radar rooms. Stories of derelict controllers keep piling up, even as the head of the FAA and the leader of the controllers' union started a cross-country tour to spread the gospel of professionalism to the rank and file. There have now been incidents in Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; Reno, Nevada; Seattle; Lubbock, Texas; and Miami in just the past couple of months. Scheduling rules have been adjusted and staffing beefed up to mitigate fatigue among controllers, but in the Ohio incident, fatigue does not appear to have been the issue. Personal responsibility ""really needs to become much more part of our training,"" LaHood told CNN, ""much more of what our (FAA) administrator says to controllers as he travels the country and meets with them. ""I meet with controllers a lot, too, when I travel the country. I visit air traffic control towers and I guarantee it will be part of my message."" Pressed to explain why such incidents keep happening in spite of officials' insistence that the situation will not be tolerated, LaHood said, ""Well, it won't be."" ""We've done some things here in the short term like extending rest time from eight to nine hours. We've moved supervisors into positions where we think it's more important to have more supervisors,"" ""And we will continue to do what we have to do to make sure the controllers understand they have to take personal responsibility for this most important safety job they have,"" he said,. CNN Jeanne Meserve, Mike Ahlers, Carol Cratty and Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.","NEW: LaHood says officials should ""keep harping"" on personal responsibility .
