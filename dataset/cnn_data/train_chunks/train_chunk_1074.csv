"A man accused of 'marrying' and having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse. The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. A 27-year-old man, pictured at Burwood Local Court in May, has pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse . He has been ordered not to contact his victim for two years, and a date for sentencing will be decided next week. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier this year. The girl's father will face trial next year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly arranged the illegal marriage. The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child . The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 27-year-old student at a mosque last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl’s legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now living in an immigration detention centre.","Man pleads guilty  to persistent sexual abuse of a child in Burwood court .

"A new study has found memory loss in Alzheimer's patients can be reversed. File picture . Memory loss in Alzheimer's patients has been reversed for the first time, scientists say. A small study of 10 patients found nine showed improvements in their memories within three to six months of treatment. The findings, from the University of California, Los Angeles, are the first to suggest that memory loss in patients can be reversed. Six patients taking part had stopped working, or been struggling with their jobs at the time they joined the study. All have since been able to return to their jobs or continue working, with improved performance. The patients all suffered memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. One, who had been diagnosed with late stage Alzheimer's did not improve. Dr Dale Bredesen, of the university's Centre for Alzheimer's Disease Research, hopes the new study could pave the way for the first effective treatment for the disease, since it was first described more than 100 years ago. The treatment involved a complex, 36-point therapeutic programme, combining comprehensive diet changes, brain stimulation, exercise, sleep optimisation, specific drugs and vitamins, and other steps affecting brain chemistry. Dr Bredesen said the findings are 'very encouraging', but added the results are anecdotal, and a more extensive, controlled clinical trial is needed. No single drug has been found to stop or even slow the progression of Alzheimer's, and drugs have only had modest effects of symptoms. He said: 'In the past decade alone, hundreds of clinical trials have been conducted for Alzheimer's, without success, at an aggregate cost of over $1 billion.' While other chronic illnesses including cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV have been improved through the use of combination therapies, they have not been explored for Alzheimer's and other memory disorders until now. 'That suggested that a broader-based therapeutic approach, rather than a single drug that aims at a single target, may be feasible and potentially more effective for the treatment of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's,' Dr Bredesen said. 'The existing Alzheimer's drugs affect a single target, but Alzheimer's disease is more complex, he added. 'Imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well,' he said. 'The drug may have worked, and a single hole may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much.' Dr Bredesen said his approach is personalised, tailored to each individual patient. Nine out of 10 patients saw memory improvements within three to six months of a therapeutic treatment programme, combining comprehensive diet changes, brain stimulation, exercise, sleep optimisation, specific drugs and vitamins, and other steps affecting brain chemistry. File picture . It is based on extensive testing to help determine the best therapies for each patient's brain. But he admitted there are some limitations to the study. It is complex and the burden falls on patients and caregivers to follow it. In this study, no patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. Their most common complaints were the diet and lifestyle changes, and having to take multiple pills each day. Dr Bredesen added: 'It is noteworthy that the major side effects of this therapeutic system are improved health and an improved body mass index, a stark contrast to the side effects of many drugs.' He said while the findings suggest memory loss can be reversed and improvements sustained, the results need to be replicated. The findings are published in the current online edition of the journal Aging.","UCLA study found nine out of 10 patients saw improvements in memories .

"The North Dakota State University student found slain in Moorhead was laid to rest Monday as authorities search for his killer. About 1,250 mourners attended a funeral Mass for 18-year-old Thomas Bearson at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in his hometown of Sartell. Family and friends remembered Bearson's humor, caring personality and love for athletics, the St. Cloud Times reported. About 1,250 mourners attended a funeral Mass for 18-year-old Thomas Bearson at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in his hometown of Sartell . The family has been in the community for 20 years and said they've grateful for the strong show of support as they laid their son to rest in this photo from Monday's service . 'We've tried desperately to make sense of this tragedy,' Bearson's father, Greg Bearson, told mourners. 'The only thing we can come up with is the basketball team in heaven needed a point guard.' The family has been in the community for 20 years and said they've grateful for the strong show of support. Thomas Bearson's body was found Tuesday outside a recreational vehicle store in Moorhead. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office says Bearson died as the 'result of homicidal violence.' Police say Bearson had last been seen at a party early on Sept. 20 in Fargo, North Dakota, about six blocks from his dorm. NDSU officials are encouraging students to walk with others on and off campus at night. Police have made no arrests and have no suspects or motive, Moorhead Police Lt. Tory Jacobson said Monday. Authorities are asking for the public's help to locate Bearson's cellphone and a shoe. Video courtesy of Inforum.com . Thomas Bearson's body was found Tuesday outside a recreational vehicle store in Moorhead . The Ramsey County medical examiner's office says Bearson died as the 'result of homicidal violence' Police described the missing items as a white Nike Air Jordan left-foot tennis shoe, size 9 1/2, and a silver iPhone 5. At Monday's service, family and friends recalled how a toy basketball hoop given to Thomas on his first Christmas - followed with a Little Tikes version after his third birthday - started a lifelong love of basketball. He worshiped former Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan and played for the Sartell High School basketball team. 'He played basketball for hours,' Greg Bearson said. 'He played in the rain and in the cold. He played in the morning and at night. I'm sure he even played in his dreams.' His cousin and pallbearer Ryan Walsh also said he had fond memories of playing with Bearson. 'Even last Christmas when it was 20 below, he was still out there playing,' he said. 'Being his older cousin, I always wanted to show Tom that he wasn't as good as he thought he was. Now that he is gone, I have to admit, he was much better than I or my brother.' Police have made no arrests and have no suspects or motive, Moorhead Police Lt. Tory Jacobson said Monday . His former basketball coach Dave Angell remembered how Thomas missed a game-wining shot only to come back a year later and score the game-winning basket against Albany. 'I told him in the locker room, 'You have to fail in that situation to eventually be successful,' he said. Sister Maddie Bearson said she trusted her brother to proofread when writing sports stories as a journalism student. 'Being the older sibling, I should have been the role model, but he was a role model to me,' she said. 'Tom didn't have to try hard to be good at something. I admired him growing up. I still do. 'I'm proud to be Tom Bearson's sister.'","Thomas Bearson was found dead outside a recreational vehicle store in Moorhead .

"Breakthrough close: Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, World Health Organisation assistant director general, said trials are planned or underway for two an Ebola vaccine . An Ebola vaccine breakthrough could be just weeks away, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official has announced. Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, an assistant director general for WHO, said that an experimental version of the vaccine could be ready for mass distribution in Africa early next year if current trials are successful. She said the trials planned or underway in Europe, Africa and the U.S. are being accompanied by a push among governments for immediate 'real-world use' of an approved Ebola vaccine. Speaking to reporters in Geneva today Dr Kieny revealed that, if the vaccines are deemed safe, tens of thousands of doses would be used in a West African trial in January. She said there are two leading candidates for a vaccine. One of them, developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee cold virus and an Ebola protein, is in clinical trials in the U.K. and in Mali. It will be used in clinical trials in Lausanne, Switzerland, by the start of February. The second front-runner, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV, has been sent to the U.S. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers, with results expected by December. The next stage would be to test it more broadly, including among those directly handling Ebola cases in West Africa. Meanwhile, the organization's emergency committee on Ebola will meet tomorrow to review the scope of the outbreak and whether additional measures are needed. 'This is the third time this committee will meet since August to evaluate the situation,' WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing. 'Much has happened, there have been cases in Spain and the United States, while Senegal and Nigeria have been removed from the list of countries affected by Ebola.' If tests currently underway show the experimental vaccines are safe for humans, a large-scale trial could be rolled in Africa as early as January, Dr Kieny said . WHO's emergency committee on Ebola will meet tomorrow to review the scope of the outbreak and whether additional measures are needed to halt the spread of the deadly virus in West Africa . The Ebola virus has already claimed more than 4,500 victims, according to the WHO . The 20 independent experts, who declared that the outbreak in West Africa constituted an international public health emergency on August 8, can recommend travel and trade restrictions. The committee has already recommended exit screening of passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ms Chaib also promised a thorough public audit of the agency's early missteps in responding to the Ebola outbreak that has already killed over 4,500 people. Yesterday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf claimed that the international community's initial reaction to the Ebola outbreak was 'inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency'. Tens of thousands of doses of an experimental vaccine could be ready for distribution in Africa by January if testing currently underway show that it is safe for humans . Health workers such as these volunteer nurses from Germany's Red Cross, pictured being trained in Ebola protection measures before being deployed in West Africa, would be among the first be given a vaccine when it is approved . Yesterday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf claimed that the international community's initial reaction to the Ebola outbreak was 'inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency' She said that although the world had now woken up to the global health risk posed by the epidemic, the outbreak still risks unleashing an economic catastrophe that will leave a 'lost generation' of West Africans. 'We all have a stake in the battle against Ebola,' President Johnson Sirleaf said . in an open letter read on the BBC World Service. 'It is the duty of all of us, as global citizens, to send a . message that we will not leave millions of West Africans to fend . for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and . against whom they have little defence.'","Two experimental vaccines are being tested as safe for humans .

"A flight attendants' union is trying to overturn rules allowing airplane passengers to use cellphones and other device during take-off and landing. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) changed its guidance last year, allowing passengers to use their devices freely while flying. But the Association of Flight Attendants says the agency didn't follow procedure when they made the change - and also that letting passengers keep cellphones on is distracting and could be dangerous. Bring back the ban? The Association of Flight Attendants wants passengers to put away their phones again . But their arguments made little impression at the U.S. Court of Appeals, who said that the call is - and always has been - one for airlines to make, rather than the government. Although the three-judge panel, sitting in Washington, D.C., has yet to deliver a written warning, they seemed to suggest the union, which has 60,000 members, will not succeed. Judge Harry T. Edwards told one of the union lawyers: 'Airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this.' The FAA announced late last year that it was changing guidance that had for years resulted in passengers stowing cellphones, tablets, and music and video players during takeoffs and landings. Under new guidance, airlines can let passengers use them at any point as long as the plane is protected from electronic interference and the airlines get the FAA's approval. Restrictions: The FAA relaxed its guidance last year, freeing millions of passengers to use their phones . Cellphones still must be in airplane mode when in use. Since the announcement, the FAA has cleared 31 airline operators to let their passengers use the devices they want. Between them the operators carry around 96 per cent of U.S. fliers. Union lawyer Amanda Dure told the judges that 'anyone who has been on a plane in the last year has seen a huge change.' But she argued that in relaxing the rules, officials violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Other devices: Items including tablets, music players and video players are also covered by the rules . The act requires government agencies to give the public notice and the ability to comment when a rule is changed. That didn't happen properly, the union argues. Judge Janice Rogers Brown asked about the flight attendants' concern that allowing passengers to keep out electronics leaves 'more things to fly around' the airplane cabin during turbulence. But a lawyer for the government, Jeffrey Sandberg, told the judges that cellphones and other small devices are no more dangerous than books that passengers have always been allowed to keep out. The government argued in court documents that the judges hearing the case don't have authority to review the issue and that the FAA's action didn't trigger public notice and comment requirements. The FAA did request and receive public feedback before updating its guidance, and considered 1,000 responses including one from the union, attorneys wrote. Still, the government said the FAA merely told the airlines its opinion on the matter - which has always in fact been a decision for the individual companies.","FAA changed rules this year to let passengers use devices throughout flight .

"Popular former postman Alan Johnson has refused to come to Ed Miliband's rescue, as a poll reveals the Labour leader is facing an uphill battle with female voters. Mr Johnson has been the subject of mounting speculation that he could be installed as a caretaker leader if Mr Miliband is ousted, but he insists he will play no part in Labour's frontline fight from opposition. Amid rumours of a possible Labour defection to UKIP and growing fears he is turning off voters, a new survey shows just one in 10 women think Mr Miliband is good enough to be prime minister. The former Home Secretary said he would not consider taking over as leader of the Labour party if approached . Mr Miliband has so far failed to win over women as he campaigns ahead of next year's general election, with only 12 per cent describing him as a good leader. His popularity among female voters pales behind that of David Cameron, who was backed by 31 per cent of women in a recent poll. The 19 point gap is among latest indicators the Labour leader may cost the party next year's vote, sources say. Concerns among MPs are so rife, some have suggested drafting in Mr Johnson, the  former Home Secretary, to take the reins. But Mr Johnson today rejected the claims, and even refused to join Mr Miliband's frontbench to fight for power ahead of the election. Asked if he had been approached about becoming Labour leader, Mr Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'No. First of all, the question doesn't arise. Anybody who suggested to me — and no one has, incidentally — that there should be a change of leadership, I would say, ""Get a grip.""' But he also made clear he would refuse any request from Mr Miliband to join the shadow cabinet. He served as shadow home secretary and briefly shadow chancellor, before resigning when he learned of his wife's affair with his police protection officer. He said he 'hated' being on the frontbench in opposition and wishes he quit Mr Miliband's team sooner 'because if you're not enjoying it and your heart's not in it then it shows that you're not going to do it properly'. It is a fresh blow for Mr Miliband who is facing fresh claims he is failing to convince voters he is up to the job of running the country. Fifteen per cent of the 1,005 adults polled as part of the research by ICM said Mr Miliband would be a good prime minister. Critics blamed Mr Miliband's forgetting to mention the deficit in his party conference speech. David Cameron was more popular among women, with 31 per cent saying they think he is a good prime minister . More than double that (32 per cent) put their support behind David Cameron, with experts citing the Labour leader's failure to mention the deficit during his party conference speech as the reason for his ailing popularity. In 2009 former prime minister Gordon Brown received 32 per cent while the Conservative party leader had 48 per cent of voters' support. 'If any doubt remained about Ed Miliband's prime ministerial attributes, reaction to his conference forgetfulness probably ends it,' Martin Boon, director of ICM Research told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Despite Mr Cameron falling to Brown-like levels of disdain in this poll, Ed Miliband is patently written off as twice as bad.' 'It's hard to think how a leader could do much worse than this and any lead that Labour does still hold in the polls must be thought to be despite its leader, rather than because of him,' Mr Boon added. In a previous poll female voters described Mr Miliband as 'weak', 'useless' and 'an idiot'. 'Untrustworthy' and 'trying' were other adjectives offered, while David Cameron was seen as 'posh' and 'out of touch'. Nick Clegg was described as a 'follower' in a separate poll. Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) was not included in the research, but said yesterday at the Rochester and Strood by-election he thought his party could win in May . Forty-one per cent of women who took part in the poll by Tory chairman Lord Ashcroft said they supported Labour in March. When asked about Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg, respondents considered him a 'follower' and some didn't know who he was. The poll did not ask voters about Ukip, to which two Tory MPs have defected since it was carried out. Yesterday it's leader Nigel Farage said the party was in with a shot of winning as he supported Mark Reckless MP in the Rochester and Strood by-election. MPs concern over Ed Miliband's ability to lead the party to victory in seven months was voiced by Andrew MacKinlay. The former MP for Thurlock referred to Mr Miliband's campaign as 'a complete disaster,' pleading: '  ‘Ed – for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.'","One in ten women said Labour leader would make good prime minister .

"Liverpool defender Kolo Toure believes unbeaten Premier League leaders Chelsea will have to prove their mental toughness if they are to match the achievement of the Arsenal 'Invincibles' side he was part of 10 years ago. Jose Mourinho's team have a four-point cushion at the top of the table and could extend the gap further in Saturday's early kick-off at Anfield. The season is only 10 matches old and Toure said there is a long way to go before the Stamford Bridge club can think about emulating the Gunners' formidable 2003-04 season. Kolo Toure impressed during Liverpool's defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League . Karim Benzema scored the winner for Real Madrid as they eased into the knockout stages . 'They have a good team and with the squad they have of course they can do it,' he said. 'But it's not the only quality. It is about mentality. Every game is challenging and sometimes things don't go well for you but you need to be able to come back and carry on fighting. 'The season has just started. We will see. It's a great chance (for Liverpool to end the unbeaten run) but the most important thing is we want to win the game.' The roles were somewhat reversed last April when Chelsea arrived at Anfield, with Liverpool top of the table and seemingly on course for their first title since 1990. However, things quickly unravelled as Mourinho's tactical masterclass saw the visitors stifle their free-flowing opponents with a disciplined defensive display which centred around getting men behind the ball and hitting on the counter-attack. Steven Gerrard's slip to allow Demba Ba to race through and break the deadlock just before half-time has been translated into a song which far from being a Chelsea fans' favourite is sung at grounds around the country when the former England captain is in town. Willian added a late second to spell the beginning of the end of the Merseysiders' title dream and Liverpool are looking for revenge. Chelsea continued their unbeaten Premier League run against Queens Park Rangers last weekend . Arsenal went a whole season unbeaten in 2003/04 and Chelsea have been tipped to follow suit . What may help them this time around is the expectation Chelsea, as league leaders and with summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas in sparkling form, will not come to kill the game. 'It is a very important game when you think what they did to us last season,' said Toure, whose defensive performance in the 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Bernabeu has put him in contention to start at the expense of £20million summer signing Dejan Lovren. 'That cost us the league and now we have the chance to beat them. I can't wait for that honestly. 'Every game for Liverpool you want to win and Chelsea are playing well now. 'When you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams. Chelsea attack and Liverpool attack as well. I think you are going to see a great game. 'This season they will attack, with the players they have they can't defend (all the time). 'I think they will just try to score goals and we will try to score goals.' Most of Liverpool's big names are expected to return at the weekend but Rodgers was impressed by the performance of some fringe players in the Bernabeu and suggested those who were benched should not automatically assume they will earn a recall.","Chelsea have started the season in blistering form .

"Senior Conservatives today sought to insist David Cameron's plan to claw powers back from Brussels remain on course after Germany refused to 'tamper' with freedom of movement laws. The Prime Minister has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his renegotiation with the European Union, reassuring voters he will act to control the UK's borders. But German Chancellor Angela has made clear she will not allow Britain's calls for reform to 'interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in Europe'. Scroll down for video . Angel Merkel has made clear she is not open to renegotiation on the free movement of people across the European Union . Mr Cameron is under growing pressure to announce a radical new approach to tackle soaring immigration from Europe. The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Some senior Conservatives are considering a proposal to impose a quota on 'time-limited national insurance numbers' to limit the numbers of people able to move to Britain for work. Others want an 'emergency break' to limit numbers coming from countries which suffer an economic collapse. Mr Cameron promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but the figure has topped 200,000 after a surge in the numbers using freedom of movement laws to move from elsewhere in the EU. But Ms Merkel appears to have dismissed any hopes from Britain of radical change. She told The Sunday Times: 'Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU.' There is agreement between London and Berlin on the need to limit access to benefits across the EU, but Ms Merkel is not open to negotiating the right of people to travel without restriction in member states. A Romanian migrant took the German government to court to claim unemployment benefits despite not having had a job in the country. Mrs Merkel added: 'I spoke to David Cameron and we agreed to assess the verdict together. These are controversial issues that are debated also in our country. 'I am of the opinion that they need to be resolved in a way that tackles abuse.' But she warned: 'On the other hand we must not interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in Europe.' David Cameron had indicated  migration reforms as key to mooted renegotiation of the UK's membership terms . Downing Street insists that Mr Cameron wants to limit the number of people who can come to Britain from the EU, not end freedom of movement altogether. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon denied that Mr Cameron's efforts to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU were already foundering. 'The negotiation itself hasn't started yet,' he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. 'We've set out the outlines, giving national parliaments more say over European legislation - who would disagree with that? 'Stopping people moving around Europe to claim benefits, that is extremely important. 'Having an open trading Europe that has less bureaucracy makes it easier to create jobs and wealth as we've done in this country.' Damian Green, a former Tory immigration minister, insisted that negotiations with the EU were at the very early stages. 'I think what you get at this stage, the stage before the negotiations starts, are people setting out positions from which they will negotiate. 'Because we know that when we get to the details of the negotiations, there are always things that we want to do, actually that the Germans want to do, and other countries want to do. That seems to me to be the fruitful area where we can have a successful negotiation.' Ms Merkel's comments come after Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker this week said freedom of movement in the EU should be made easier. Mr Juncker, who became European Commission president despite the fierce objections of Mr Cameron, told one of his new commissioners to 'promote freedom of movement' within the EU. The revelation came as new polls suggests the public would vote to stay in the EU – even if Mr Cameron manages to secure 'modest' changes to Brussels rules. If the PM could not secure any renegotiation at all, people say they will vote to leave the EU by 42 per cent to 36 per cent. National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . If Mr Cameron manages to secure 'substantial' changes people say they would vote to stay in by 55 per cent to 23 per cent. But if he can only get 'modest renegotiation' a majority of the public say they would still vote to remain in the EU, by 44 per cent to 36 per cent. The polling gave Mr Cameron hope that even small reform to European immigration rules could be enough to win public backing to stay in the EU. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election. He had set to outline plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources – and was considering an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts. Ukip leader Nigel Farage this week congratulated Mr Juncker as his new team of 27 commissioners was approved - despite Mr Farage and other eurosceptic MEPs voting against him. Further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants' rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers could also be introduced. Outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso insisted last week that an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law. Mr Juncker's call for EU migration to be made even easier was a further blow to the Prime Minister. In a letter sent last month, Mr Juncker told Ms Thyssen, a Belgian MEP, that she should be 'improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across Europe'. He cited the EU-wide job exchange website EURES. Wednesday's row came after Mr Cameron was urged by veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke to ignore backbenchers using the public 'hysteria' over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe. The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to 'common sense'. He said: 'We mustn't compete with ignorance and bigotry.'","Chancellor says she agrees on tackling issues such as migrant benefits .

"A former pilot has launched a gadget that transforms the humble paper aeroplane into a remote controlled aircraft that can be steered by a smartphone. Called PowerUp 3.0, the battery-powered unit has a propeller on one end and a receive on the other. It can be fitted to any paper aeroplane and then controlled by a smartphone app, letting users adjust the direction of the plane by tilting their phone. Scroll down for video . A former pilot from Israel has created a gadget for paper planes. The plane is driven and controlled by a mobile phone app (shown). Entrepreneur Shai Goitein came up with the idea after spending 15 years behind the controls of aeroplanes as a cargo pilot . Entrepreneur Shai Goitein came up with the idea after spending 15 years behind the controls of aeroplanes as a cargo pilot. Mr Goitein, 44, says he had a eureka moment while teaching youngsters the basic principals of aerodynamics using paper aeroplanes, and set about inventing a device to control them with. The result is the PowerUp 3.0, which can fly for 10 minutes at a time, and has a range of 180ft (55 metres) using Bluetooth technology. Fold It: Simply fold a piece of copier paper into a paper airplane . Attach It: Attach the Smart Module to your paper plane with the patented clips underneath the Smart Module. Connect It: Start the app to connect to the Smart Module with your iPhone. Fly It: Push throttle to full and launch the paper airplane high up into the sky. Tilt your smartphone to the left or to the right to steer your plane, increase or reduce throttle to go up or down. Mr Goitein, from Haifa, Israel, said: 'PowerUp 3.0 combines the simplicity of classic hand-folded paper aeroplanes with state-of-the-art Bluetooth technology. 'It transforms a paper glider into a high performance and easy-to-fly remote-controlled aircraft, capable of flying for more than 10 consecutive minutes. 'PowerUp 3.0 allows enthusiasts to enjoy all the features of more expensive remote-controlled gadgets, but with their own folded creations - all made from standard paper, no less,' Mr Goitein explains that with a smartphone and the PowerUp app, users can alter the engine thrust and change the pitch of the upgraded paper plane. They can also move the rudder of the plane left and right to steer it through the air. The PowerUp 3.0 is a simple battery-powered unit with a propeller on one end and a receiver on the other than can be fitted to any paper aeroplane. The plane can then be controlled by a smartphone app which allows the user to adjust its direction by tilting their phone. It can be charged via a USB cable (shown) 'All over the world, paper planes are a source of joy, yet they have their own limitations - they can't fly for more than a few seconds, and there's no way to control their flight path,' he continues. 'PowerUp Toys connect past time origami classics with cutting-edge technology. 'They create a gravity-defying experience that takes flight to its roots. 'In the age of 50-tonne airships it's easy to feel like flight is something that's best left alone to pros and to engineers but it's not. 'Our goal is to make you feel like the Wright brothers when Flyer I took to the skies. 'Our mission is to bring the magic of flight to everyone by combining timeless home-made toys with cutting-edge technology.' The £30 ($49.99) toy can fly for 10 minutes at a time, and has a range of 180ft (55 metres) using Bluetooth technology. Mr Goitein said: 'PowerUp 3.0 combines the simplicity of classic hand-folded paper aeroplanes with state-of-the-art Bluetooth technology'","A former pilot from Israel has created a gadget for paper planes .

"In the era of selfies, Instagram and over-sharing, new research has revealed that one in three Aussies have rejected a video call from loved ones because they didn't think they looked good enough. Research by the Belong Broadband group has found that almost 10 million Australians use video calling applications like Skype and Facetime to connect with friends and family both interstate and overseas. But what actually has our attention during a video call and is the technology really making us vain? Almost 10 million Australians use video calling applications like Skype and Facetime to connect with friends and family interstate and overseas . The research found that a quarter of the 1000 people surveyed spend more than five minutes preparing themselves for a single call, while over 10 per cent take 15-30 minutes. As every experienced selfies taker knows, there's a lot that goes into looking good on a screen. Almost 40 per cent of people surveyed said they fix their hair before a video call while 30 per cent not only have a quick glance in a mirror but also check if their background is suitable. One in five people take it a step further by making sure the angle and lighting is flattering, while another handful admits they take a selfie to ensure they are screen ready. Belong Broadband surveyed 1000 Australians nationally who used video calling in the past 18 months . A change of clothes just for a video chat is also not out of the question for 15 per cent of people, although one in 10 said it was only the top half of their outfit that concerned them. On the contrary, one in three people admitted they had at one stage been forced to scramble to put anything on after receiving an unexpected video call. But even after all the effort of ensuring a perfect appearance, a quarter of respondents admitted they are more focused on watching themselves in the preview screen than the person they are speaking to. 'The internet has made us all feel like we're minor celebs and video calling only adds to it – we never want to be caught off-guard, or in the situation where we choose to answer the call and someone uploads a screenshot to Facebook or Instagram,' Carli Alman,  make-up editor at beauty website beautyheaven.com.au told Belong. 'This research shows just how much effort we all actually put into looking 'effortlessly' chic for something as simple as a video call! Make-up and hair touch-ups used to happen before meeting a friend or going a date, so it's interesting to see how much our habits have changed.'

"Islamic State militants are luring innocent American teenage girls into their violent and war-hungry terror network with 'Disney-like versions' of life under extremism, a terror expert has warned. The claims were made as three American schoolgirls were arrested in Germany as they apparently travelled to Syria to join Islamic militants. The girls — two sisters ages 17 and 15, and a 16-year-old friend, from Denver, Colorado — were stopped in Frankfurt by F.B.I. agents trying to board a plane last weekend after stealing $2,000 from their parents and running away. They were arrested and sent home to their families in the Aurora suburb of the city. And today Mia Bloom, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, claimed they were likely doing the bidding of ISIS predators who are preying on increasingly younger women through social media with the promise of dream homes, husbands and happy endings - just like in those portrayed in Disney movies. Scroll down for video . Happy ending? ISIS predators who are preying on increasingly younger women through social media with the promise of dream homes, husbands and happy endings - just like in those portrayed in Disney movies . Arrested: The apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, which police say is the home of one of the three teenage girls who, according to U.S. authorities, were en route to join the Islamic State group in Syria . At least one of the girls was communicating with someone online who encouraged the three to travel to Syria, said Tustin Amole, a spokeswoman for the Cherry Creek School District where the girls attend high school. Fellow students told school officials that the girls had been discussing travel plans over Twitter, Amole said. The girls were detained at an airport in Frankfurt, Germany, and sent home over the weekend. They were interviewed by the FBI and returned to their parents in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Those in the tight-knit east African community where they live said the sisters are of Somali descent and their friend is of Sudanese descent. 'There's no indication they had been radicalized in a way that they wanted to fight for ISIS,' Amole said. Back home: This is where the two sisters live. Those in the tight-knit east African community where they live said the sisters are of Somali descent and their friend is of Sudanese descent . Disney-like? It was claimed they were likely doing the bidding of Islamic State recruiters who prey on increasingly younger women through social media with 'Disney-like versions' of what it is like to live under Muslim leadership . A U.S. official said evidence gathered so far made it clear that the girls were headed to Syria, though the official said investigators were still trying to determine what sort of contacts they had in that country. Another U.S. official said investigators were reviewing evidence, including the girls' computers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name. Foreign fighters from dozens of nations are pouring into the Middle East to join the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations. U.S. officials are putting new energy into trying to understand what radicalizes people far removed from the fight, and into trying to prod countries to do a better job of keeping them from joining up. They include 19-year-old Shannon Conley (pictured) of Arvada, Colorado, pleaded guilty to charges that she conspired to help militants in Syria. Conley said she wanted to use her American military training with the U.S. Army Explorers to fight a holy war overseas, authorities said. If she could not fight with the extremists, she told agents, she would use her training as a nurse's aide. Agents, who had been overtly trying to stop Conley, arrested her in April as she boarded a flight she hoped would ultimately get her to Syria. She could face up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine when she is sentenced in January. 'Social media has played a very significant role in the recruitment of young people,' said FBI spokesman Kyle Loven in Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali community in the U.S. Authorities there have been concerned about terror recruiting of the young for years. 'What we've experienced here in Minneapolis is that young, disaffected youth who exist primarily on the fringes of society — they seem to be more susceptible to this type of propaganda, unfortunately,' Loven said. Terror recruiting has been a problem for years in Minneapolis. Since 2007, roughly 22 young Somali-Americans have traveled to Somalia to take up arms with al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked group. Those were all men. Within the last year, a handful of people from the community left Minnesota to join militant groups in Syria, and this time, there are fears that women might have been targeted. Loven said the FBI is working with the Somali community to establish trust and help identify young people at risk for radicalization. In Colorado, Amole said the three teens had no prior problems at school, aside from unexcused absences on Friday. What is still unknown is how they managed to get to Germany. The U.S. government doesn't have restrictions on children flying alone, domestically or internationally. Airline policies vary. Most U.S. airlines allow children 12 and older to fly alone but often with restrictions on international flights, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. The girls' parents reported them missing Friday after they skipped school. They had taken passports and $2,000 in cash from the home of the sisters' parents. At some point, the U.S. informed German authorities at the airport about the girls arriving alone on their way to Turkey, German Interior Ministry spokeswoman Pamela Mueller-Niese told reporters Wednesday. She said the three were detained by German police, with approval from a judge, and returned voluntarily to the U.S. on Sunday. Once home, the girls told a deputy they went to Germany for 'family' but wouldn't elaborate. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Denver would not say whether prosecutors plan to charge the girls with a crime. State prosecutors said they have no imminent plans to charge the girls. Amole said they will not face school discipline. 'Our biggest concern is for the safety and well-being of these girls,' Amole said.","Two sisters, 17 and 15, and a friend, 16, were arrested in German airport .

"A trio of 'greedy' middle-class women have been sentenced over a £21 million pyramid scheme which fleeced more than 10,000 people out of their savings. The group used emails and 'champagne celebration nights' to cajole victims - mainly women -  to 'beg, borrow or steal' £3,000 to invest in the scam, Bristol Crown Court heard. Their targets were reeled in by the promise of a  £24,000 payout once they reached the top of their pyramid chart, with organisers promising they 'could not lose'. Mary Nash (left) and Susan Crane outside Bristol Crown Court, today. They have been jailed for their part in a £21 million pyramid scheme which fleeced more than 10,000 people out of their savings . Charts co-ordinator Nash, 65, and committee secretary Crane, 69, (pictured) wept today as they were jailed . They were shown photos of the scheme's success stories rifling through heaps of money or lying in cash-filled bathtubs. The scheme, called Give and Take (G&T), quickly spread from Bath and Bristol to areas of the UK including London, Yorkshire and Wales between May 2008 and April 2009. The promise was that once the payout target was reached the pyramid would split into two and the process would start again. Games co-ordinator Hazel Cameron, 54, was handed a six-month custodial sentence suspended for two years . But whereas committee members behind the scheme pocketed up to £92,000 each, almost 90 per cent of their victims lost between £3,000 and £15,000. When the flow of new members dried up the pyramid leaders continued accepting money knowing there was little chance of the scheme ever paying out. Eleven women aged between 34 and 69 became the first in the UK to be prosecuted for such a scheme, under legislation from the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Act 2008. Six of the group were convicted of operating and promoting the scheme, while three others were convicted of promoting the scheme. Charts co-ordinator Mary Nash, 65, and committee secretary Susan Crane, 69, wept today as they were jailed for six months, while games co-ordinator Hazel Cameron, 54, was handed a six-month custodial sentence suspended for two years. In April last year three were each jailed for nine months after they were convicted of operating and promoting the scam. They were Laura Fox, 69, the mastermind of the Give and Take scheme, Jennifer Smith-Hayes, 69, the treasurer, and Carol Chalmers, 68, who organised venues. All have now served their sentences and been released. Other members Sally Phillips, 34, admitted promoting the scheme and received a three month jail term suspended for two years and a three month curfew. Rita Lomas, 49, and Jane Smith, 50, admitted promoting and got four month and four-and-a-half month jail terms respectively, both suspended for two years. Two others, Rhalina Yuill, 33, and Tracey Laurence, 58, were cleared of all charges. Sentencing Nash, Crane and Cameron today, Judge Mark Horton said: 'Many people will wonder how so many mature women of good character and unblemished careers got involved in such a large, destructive and socially corrosive illegal investment scheme. Sally Phillips (left), 34, and Rita Lomas (right), 49, were given suspended sentences for their roles in the group . 'The sad answer, I regret to give, is one of financial greed, deceit and selfishness overall which in their turn led to a catastrophic loss to a large number of innocent members of the community duped by one of the oldest investment deceptions of all time. 'You knew no one would join a scheme where there was a risk you could lose. 'You knew the precise mood and desperation of those who were drawn into the web of this deceitful scheme.' He added: 'You did nothing to stop the scheme or protect those very vulnerable, but were solely concerned that you were not personally identified as committee members. 'This was undoubtedly directed at ordinary members of the public who were encouraged to beg, borrow or steal to get on to the scheme where they couldn't lose.' Jude Horton said none of the women showed remorse for their actions and victims, including nurses, had to take up two jobs after applying for loans to join the scheme. Bristol Crown Court heard the defendants, all from Bristol and Somerset, promoted the scheme through 'pamper' parties where they would seduce others to join. Cash promises: An image from the promo material used by the group . Miles Bennett, prosecuting, told the court: 'People were simply lead to believe that by joining they just couldn't lose. 'In these schemes it is always the case that 86 to 88 per cent of all people that get involved always lose their money - people were caught up in these meetings, sometimes 180 people at any one time. 'The irony is that none of these defendants needed the money from this scheme at all. 'Many of the women who joined borrowed from friends and family and high interest credit because they believed there was no chance of losing.' Laura Fox, 69, from East Harptree, Somerset, was one of the ringleaders of the get-rich-quick scheme . During the trials, jurors heard how the scheme operated around pyramid charts. Each of 15 spaces was filled with a participant who paid £3,000 and introduced two friends, who also paid that amount. Once the chart was filled, the eight people on the bottom of the chart paid their £3,000 to the person on the top, called the 'Bride'. Participants collected their winnings at specialist prize-giving pamper parties, where they would be asked a series of simple questions before being handed the £24,000. A set £1,000 fee from the payout was deducted, with £600 shared between charities and £400 used to pay costs the committee occurred. Miles Bennett, who prosecuted both trials, said potential recruits were invited to the parties at the Battleborough Grange Hotel in Burnham-on-Sea, owned by Carol Chalmers. The 'champagne evening celebrations' were attended by up to 300 people, who paid £2 entry for games and drinks. Mobile phone footage recorded at one of the parties showed Laura Fox shouting: 'We are gambling in our own homes and that's what makes it legal. 'This is Carol's home, we have been friends since we were 11-years-old. We are going to do these games, that's what makes it legal and tax free.' After games were played, the winnings were handed over to the Brides at the top of their charts in cash - with as much as £240,000 handed out in one evening. But Mr Bennett said the celebration evenings were a 'commercial practice', with the committee holding meetings and entrants writing their names on a signing in book before entering. 'This wasn't a bunch of ladies sitting around playing bridge,' Mr Bennett said. 'This was a committee and Laura Fox ruled those nights with a rod of iron.' 'This wasn't a kitchen hobby, this was a scheme that sucked in a lot of people and which worked on the promise of them receiving riches way beyond their initial investment.'","Mary Nash, 65,  Susan Crane, 69, and Hazel Cameron, 54, pleaded guilty today to promoting and operating the UK-wide scheme .

"An old Romanian woman sparked a police investigation after confessing on her deathbed to selling off one of her son's identical twin boys the day after they were born. Teodora Maria was just 19 when she gave birth to the twin boys Nicolae and Alexandru at local hospital in Slatina, in south-west Romania's Olt County. But a day later she was told by her mother-in-law, Maria, that Alexandru had died. Teodora Maria holds up pictures of her son after her mother-in-law, Maria Maria, confessed to selling off his twin a day after he was born. She and her husband Gheorghe have launched an appeal to find the missing boy . Maria's son Gheorghe, the father of the twins, said he was shocked by his mother's confession . She told local media: 'I was only 19 and perhaps didn't understand things as well then as I do now, but I did think it was strange that I wasn't given any paperwork or the body. 'My mother-in-law Maria told me she was taking care of it all and she never handed anything over.' But last week Maria Maria, 73, made a tearful confession to a priest and her family that the baby had not died, and that in fact she had sold him at birth to a childless couple. She said that she had arranged it with her other daughter-in-law Niculina Maria, who worked at the hospital and helped forge the adoption documentation. The remaining twin, Nicolae Maria, now a priest himself, said: 'I have often spoken to people who told me they had seen me somewhere that I never was. I believe they must have seen my twin brother and mistaken him for me. 'It means that even now we must look similar and I'm hoping that if he sees my picture, he will recognise himself and get in touch. Or if not at least somebody that knows him will contact me.' The family have posted pictures of the remaining twin, Nicolae, on social media in the hope that if his twin Alexandru is still in the country he will recognized. They fear he may have been adopted abroad however . The family have posted Nicolae's picture on social media and released it to Romanian newspapers in the hope Alexandru will be recognised. But they accept it's likely he might have been adopted abroad. Many Romanian babies were adopted by wealthy foreign couples before the practice was stopped under pressure from the EU. After Maria Maria's confession, her son and grandson raced to question her more, but she died before she could provide any more details. When the family spoke to police officers confirmed none of the documentation for Alexandru's death was in order and it seemed clear that the baby had not died on November 1, 1984, as they had been told. In fact hospital records showed he was still at the hospital and being breastfed on November 4. Denials: Niculina Maria, 51, Maria Maria's other daughter-in-law who she accused of being complicit in the sale of the boy. She has denied the allegations says she was as shocked 'as everybody else' A police spokesman said: 'It seems that both babies were still there although the parents didn't know about it, and because they were identical twins who were only ever given to the teenage mother one at a time she didn't realise that they were both still alive.' Niculina Maria, 51, Maria's other daughter in law who worked at the hospital and who she implicated in the sale of the child, denied any involvement. 'I am as shocked by my mother-in-law's confession as everybody else, and I can assure all of my family that I knew nothing about what she claimed,' she said. At the time Niculina had been named as the godmother of the twins. She is allegedly the person who made sure Teodora was only given one twin at a time so she didn't realise both were still alive. Maria's son Gheorghe, the father of the twins, said he was shocked by his mother's confession and is now leading a campaign to find his missing son. Launching the appeal to find out if the boy is still alive he said: 'Alexandru, if you see your photo and your brother on television, please look for us so we can explain what happened.' 'We want him to find out the truth. We never gave him away, he was taken from us,' he said . Nicolae Maria with his family: Now a priest, he says he's praying every day for his brother to be found . Nicolae now lives in Spain with his family. He said that he is praying every day for his lost brother to be found. 'My family have now filed a missing person report even though it is 30 years too late,' he said. Local police spokeswoman Claudia Radu said: 'I can confirm that the police have started an investigation and this will result in legal consequences.' She declined to give more details.","Maria Maria told a priest about selling the boy off, then promptly died .

"Serving the aristocrats of Blenheim Palace had been the work of the Hine family for generations. And while Sir Winston Churchill’s fate in the First World War became renowned, the remarkable story of one of his lowly clerk’s has remained undisclosed. Young estate clerk Arthur Hine became the spy for Sir Winston - the First Lord of the Admiralty and later battalion commander on the Western Front - after volunteering to go to the front line in 1914. Arthur Hine, who worked as a spy for Winston Churchill in the First World War, circled above. He is pictured with the Woodstock Branch of the Queen's Hussars alongside other staff members fro Blenheim Palace . Sergeant Hine left his job at Blenheim, the home of the Duke of Marlborough and the Spencer-Churchill family in Oxfordshire, where his work involved ‘drawing plans and plotting land’. It was during training camps at the palace, where Sir Winston was born, that the pair met and Hine was chosen to be his ‘eyes and ears’. When the Siege of Antwerp broke out in October 1914, Sir Winston was sent to personally assess the damage as part of his duty as First Lord of Admiralty. Hine was dispatched to the Belgian city as a ‘dispatch rider message carrier’ and motorcycled through Antwerp while it was being bombarded by Germany as he gathered information for the intelligence department. Military historian, Chris Baker, said that during the war Hine had been attached to the future prime minister's parliamentary private secretary. ‘I don’t think there is much doubt that Arthur was given some kind of special mission,’ he said. Winston Churchill was the First Lord of the Admiralty in the First World War until the Gallipoli Campaign . During the siege he helped a Belgian girl from a burning cellar where her parents had both been killed and took her back to England to live with his family. Hine survived the war, suffering shellshock, but never returned to Blenheim. His story was uncovered by Lord Julian Fellowes, the creator of Downton Abbey, in a new television programme about how the First World War affected Blenheim Palace. The writer delved into the archives to find out the war stories of a ‘real’ Downton Abbey from those who lived both upstairs and downstairs. In the programme he meets with a relative of Hine who had no idea about her ancestor’s heroic past. Life for the noblemen and 80 servants at Blenheim Palace, which was built in 1722, was disrupted following the outbreak of war. The ITV documentary, which is due to be broadcast on Thursday, also revealed the story of Lady Sarah Wilson – the sister of the 9th Duke of Marlborough. When war was declared she volunteered to help the effort travelling to France to set up a hospital, while her husband Colonel Gordon Wilson went to fight on the front line. Lord Fellowes said: ‘Before the war I don’t think she was a nice person. ‘It seems to have transformed her really.’ Also uncovered in the programme is the tragic fate of the palace’s decorator, Albert Farley, who volunteered for service before conscription. But documents reveal that he acquired a bad disciplinary record and received one of the most controversial penalties served out to errant men on the front line – Field Punishment No1. It involved tying the man to a fixed point for two hours a day for 21 days.

His documentary unveils the lives of those living in the palace during the First World War . British troops move up to the trenches 2.5 miles East of Ypres in Belgium during the First World War . Blenheim Palace, built in 1722,  was the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill and home of the Duke of Marlborough and the rest of the Spencer-Churchill family. It is the feature of Fellowes' documentary . Winston Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911 and held this position as the First World War began. He pushed the idea of attacking Gallipoli in 1915, which turned out to be one of Britain's most disastrous military campaigns. It had been intended to clear a relief route to Russia by securing a route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. But fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster. The campaign cost the lives of 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen - and Churchill became a scapegoat for it, later resigning. He then returned to the Army and was appointed Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. He led by example, often venturing into No Man’s Land on night patrol. During a visit to the frontline with his first cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, he had his own lucky escape. A large piece of shrapnel fell between the two men. They were unharmed in the blast and each took a shell fragment to remind them of their lucky escape. Mr Churchill's stint in the trenches came to an end shortly after when, because of high casualties, his battalion was merged with another and he was told to return to Britain and resume his work in the Commons. Six weeks later the war was over but Farley was reported missing and it was accepted that he had died. Lord Fellowes added: ‘It’s rather sad isn’t it. You think he volunteered to protect his country and went off brave and it hasn’t gone well from the beginning so the question is what happened to him?’ Farley was one over a million people who died in the war, and while the Great Depression followed, the 9th Duke of Marlborough refused to accept the change to life at Blenheim. He spent money on the house and gardens – a legacy which is continued today by his ancestors. The First World War also had a great effect on Sir Winston, who wanted to make his mark, but as first Lord of the Admiralty he was held responsible for the disastrous invasion at Gallipoli. He was forced out of office and his reputation was ruined – and his response was to go to the Western Front as an ordinary battalion commander. ‘He decides to go to the front to face the danger and to be with the men who are fighting and very possibly to be killed. He was enormously brave in the face of whatever happened to him,’ said Lord Fellowes. ‘I think Winston Churchill was one of those people who were changed for the better by the First World War. ‘That very aristocratic sense of entitlement, unquestioned, rather arrogant really, seemed to develop into something kinder and more modern. The First World War made him the man to win the Second World War.’ King Albert I (above) of Belgium ordered the  army’s remaining 65,000 troops to retreat to Antwerp in siege . German forces bombarded Antwerp in Belgium on October 7, 1914, as Belgian troops and their British allies struggled to resist the ambush. After the fall of the forts at Liege in the opening weeks of the First World War, King Albert I ordered the Belgian army’s remaining 65,000 troops to retreat to Antwerp. The city was protected by a ring of 48 inner and outer forts and 80,000 garrison troops. Belgian forces conducted sorties designed to distract the German First Army, led by General Alexander von Cluck, from its attacks against the British and French over the French frontier. A German bombardment with heavy and super heavy artillery of the Belgian fortifications began on September 28. The famous Big Bertha – a 420mm siege howitzer gun – made an immediate impact and aroused the concern of the British War Office. The German’s succeeded in penetrating two of the city’s forts on October 2 and Winston Churchill, as the first Lord of Admiralty, was sent to personally assess the damage. His telegraph to Minister of War Lord H. H. Kitchener on October 4 stated that the Belgian troops were ‘weary and disheartened’ and the ground was so waterlogged it was impossible for Belgian’s to dig trenches. On October 5, 8,000 troops of the British Royal Naval Division arrived in Antwerp transported in London city buses. The next day 22,000 more British troops arrived but were unable to withstand the German onslaught in a fierce bombardment on October 7. The next day, Antwerp was evacuated and its military governor, General Victor Deguise, formally surrendered to the Germans on October 18. German forces occupied the city for the rest of the war until it was liberated in late 1918. Source: History.com .","Arthur Hine, a young estate clerk, was made spy for Sir Winston Churchill .

"Britain looks set for another warm and dry weekend and could also enjoy temperatures of 21C in the first days of October - eight degrees hotter than the monthly average. And forecasters at the Met Office say the last weekend of September will be largely dry with temperatures in London reaching 23C on Sunday. The unseasonably warm weather has proved a boon for gardeners, who are seeing flowers grow much bigger and last much longer than usual. In Cornwall, caretakers at Trebah, near Falmouth, say the climate has produced their biggest hydrangeas ever and has left their garden looking like a Monet painting. Scroll down for video . The Met Office has predicted a weekend of warm, dry weather for most of the country, with the first days of October set to be up to eight degrees hotter than usual. The unseasonably warm weather has proved good for gardeners, such as those at Trebah, near Falmouth in Cornwall (pictured) For most people the weekend will be cloudy, dry and warm with the chance of scattered sunshine, perfect for taking a walk in the countryside . Caretakers  say the wet spring conditions followed by a warm summer have lead to their biggest hydrangeas ever, with some growing to the size of a human head . Masterpiece: The large blooming flowers alongside the arched bridge have left the gardens looking like this famous Monet painting Les Nympheas Blancs . The combination of heavy rainfall over winter followed by prolonged sunny spells and warm temperatures has produced the most colourful season for the flowers. Head gardener Darren Dickey said: 'This year has been one of the best flowering displays ever and with more flowers still forming the hydrangeas will continue to light up the valley for weeks to come. 'The older flowers also bring added interest during the autumn with the whites taking on pinkish tinges and the blues going a lovely emerald green.' The news of warm, dry weather will also come as great news to golf fans watching the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, in Scotland, this weekend. A spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'The average temperature for England in October is 13.8C, but towards the end of next week we are predicting temperatures to be between 21-22C in the south. 'That's a huge difference. And Glasgow, which has an average October temperature of 11.5C could see temperatures of up to 19C. 'As for the weekend, it will be very windy in Scotland tomorrow but staying dry. It will be a cloudy start for most but brightening up for a sunny afternoon. By the end of next week, forecasters predict temperatures in the low twenties for England, well above the October average of 13.8C, which has allowed flowers to flourish much later than usual . Long-range forecast show that the UK could experience above average temperatures all the way into November, meaning more time to enjoy the outdoors . Tourists enjoy the warm weather at Trebah Gardens in Cornwall while taking pictures of the hydrangeas which have grown bigger than usual thanks to perfect conditions . 'There is an area of high pressure prevailing over the south, but with clearer skies there could be a frost overnight from Saturday to Sunday in exposed northern areas. 'Saturday will be mostly dry and cloudy for everybody but on Sunday there will be more sunshine with possible temperatures of 23C in London and the south. 'Temperatures in Scotland could be between 17C and 20C. That's five degrees higher than normal. 'Sunday will be a similar day, a cloudy start with a sunny afternoon, although the winds will be lighter which will be good news for the Ryder Cup. 'Monday will also start cloudy with scattered sunshine. There is also chance of rain overnight in the south and south east, which mat spread further north. 'Temperatures at the start of next week will remain in the low teen and high twenties in most towns and cities, with 17C or 18C possible in Scotland.' The three-day weather forecast from the Met Office - who say that Britain can expect temperatures of up to 23C in the south this weekend . The news of warm, dry weather will come as a relief to hundreds of golf fans enjoying the opening day of the 2014 Ryder Cup in Scotland today . The first day of play at the Ryder Cup got underway today in dry, sunny conditions, although high winds may pose problems as they arrive tomorrow . The Met Office has also predicted unusually warm overnight temperatures during the weekend - making it perfect weather for barbecue lovers hoping stay outdoors into the evening. Ms Young added: 'Overnight temperatures in most of England are going to be between 13C and 14C going from Saturday into Sunday. That's very warm considering an expected daytime temperature of around 20C. 'And it's not just England, Scotland will also see some warm nights. Even in the Shetland Islands, where Saturday overnight temperatures are expected to be around 11C. This is very unusual.' Long-range forecasts say Britain could also be in for above-average temperatures until the end of November. The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states: 'The latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for September-October-November as a whole.' The Met Office has also highlighted that a split in weather between the north west and south east of the UK will develop more in the next few weeks, with rain and wind effecting northerly parts of Scotland and the south east remaining generally dry.

"Adolf Hitler's personal copy of Mein Kampf which was found in his Munich apartment after his death in 1945 is to go up for auction. The book, a 1932 version of the Fuhrer's autobiography, is believed to be the only of Hitler's personal copies in existence. Auctioneer Craig Gottlieb, who has sold Nazi memorabilia in the past, believes it could fetch more than £62,000 in the online sale. A copy of Mein Kampf found in Adolf Hitler's Munich apartment in 1945 is expected to fetch £62,000 as it goes up for auction online . While it is likely that Hitler owned many copies of his own autobiography, he almost certainly read this one as it was found in his personal library - making it one-of-a-kind . Mein Kampf – or My Struggle - is the autobiographical manifesto by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, where he outlined his political ideology and future plans for Germany. The book was written by Hitler following the failed Munich Putsch in November 1923 and was first published in July 1925. Hitler's personal copy was part of a group of the German leader's belongings that were liberated from his Munich apartment in 1945 by US soldier Joseph Ben Lieber. The book, along with others from his library, was sold to Gottlieb last year along with Hitler's hat, shirt, medals, and other items. The manifesto, which Hitler wrote in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, even has the German leader's own bookplate on the inside cover . The text was found in the Fuhrer's Munich apartment after the defeat of Germany in 1945 by US soldier Joseph Ben Lieber who kept it until now . Mr Gottlieb added: 'The chain of custody of the book is unbroken since 1945. 'This particular artifact is one of the most profound in the group, which makes the provenance that supports the artifact so crucial to its value.' 'This artifact is historically significant and I would love to see it go to a museum. 'However, market realities are such that it will probably find a home with a book collector who appreciates its historic significance.' The book is described and mentioned in several key documents that Gottlieb has, copies of which will be included in the sale. Another book from Hitler's personal collection, which was liberated from his Munich apartment in 1945 . The book, along with others from Hitler's library, was sold to Gottlieb last year along with the leader's hat, shirt, medals, and other personal items (file image) Mr Gottleib has attracted criticism for his sales of Nazi artifacts in the past, which have included two oil paintings of Hitler's parents, likely commissioned by the Fuhrer himself. He added: 'I am acutely aware of the controversial nature of some of the things I sell but controversial or not, they're a part of history and shunning them is like shunning the history they represent. 'For some, a museum or a book does it, but for me, I have to hold an artefact in my hands - they're like little time machines.'","Book liberated from Hitler's personal Munich library by US soldier in 1945 .

"Southampton are in the midst of their worst losing run of the 21st century yet remain fifth in the Premier League - a situation Ronald Koeman would have snapped your hand off for at the start of the campaign. Saints' impressive start to the campaign made a mockery of those predicting a campaign of woe in the wake of the unparalleled summer talent drain from St Mary's. However, Saints' best-ever top-flight start has gone off kilter in recent weeks and they enter Saturday's match against Everton looking to end a run of five successive defeats in all competitions. Ronald Koeman looks on after his side lost 1-0 to League One team Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup . Defender Florin Gardos (centre) was sent off in Southampton's defeat in Sheffield on Tuesday . It makes Roberto Martinez wary of a backlash from Saints, with the Toffees manager judging them on this season's displays rather than their recent defeats - a wise assessment in Koeman's view. 'Always you have to look until now,' the Saints boss said. 'If somebody said to me in the pre-season 'after the middle of December you are the fifth in the list' I would have said 'give me the paper and I will sign it now'. 'I understand the defeats because that's always the difference with players. They need confidence and sometimes now you see that. 'I know my players, how they can play football, and it's difficult because of maybe freshness, maybe about more changes in the team. 'Confidence you can show them, you can tell them, The answer in always on the pitch Saturday at three o'clock and then you have to show it. Koeman welcomes Roberto Martinez's Everton side to St Mary's on Saturday . 'There are always ways to lose a game but not how we lost last Tuesday.' That defeat to Sheffield United was comfortably the worst of Koeman's reign, given the manner in which they bombed out of the Capital One Cup to League One opposition. 'I was very disappointed but it all is the past and sometimes that's the nicest part in football,' the Dutchman said about the 1-0 loss. 'You get always the next game and can change a lot of things. 'Looking back to last Tuesday, we have to change our teamwork, our belief, our spirit and that's the key in my opinion for the Saturday game.' Koeman will also have to make changes himself as injury and suspension has decimated the Saints squad. Dusan Tadic (left) is one of ten players who could be missing for Southampton's game against Everton . Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Florin Gardos are all banned for the visit of Everton, while long-term absentees Jay Rodriguez, Jack Cork and Sam Gallagher are joined on the sidelines by Jake Hesketh and Dusan Tadic. Furthermore, Steven Davis and Graziano Pelle are doubts for a match which Koeman will have to blood in some of Southampton's young talents. 'The problem for Tadic is tiredness built up about playing a lot,' he said. 'That's the difference between outside and playing in the Premier League. Graziano Pelle has been a revelation for Southampton since joining in the summer from Feyenoord . 'These are players who normally need a break and they don't have a break - a little bit the same for Steven Davis and the same for Graziano Pelle. 'We have to understand that we have more international players than the club ever had in the past and you have to get used to that problem. 'That is in my opinion one of the difficulties for us and one of the problems. It's a new situation. 'With a lot of changes in the team that's part of football and it's a little bit the problem.'","Southampton lie fifth in the Premier League at the halfway point of season .

"Apple could be facing fines of more than £1billion today over ‘sweetheart deals’ allegedly made to minimise its tax bills. The European Commission is set to criticise Apple’s tax arrangements following a probe into whether the firm made illegal arrangements with the Irish government. Apple and Starbucks are among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax through elaborate networks of subsidiaries. Other big names in the spotlight include Google and Amazon. Scroll down for video . Computer and phone giants Apple could be facing fines of more than £1billion today over ‘sweetheart deals’ allegedly made to minimise its tax bills . Apple paid just £11.4million in British corporation tax last year – despite sales of a record £10.5billion, it was revealed in July. European regulators opened a formal investigation into the tax practices used by Apple – as well as Google and Starbucks – in June. The Commission said it was concerned authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg may have given the firms preferential treatment, in breach of EU rules. The results of a preliminary stage of the probe are expected today. If the Commission finds Apple benefited from ‘sweetheart deals’ to cut tax bills in Ireland, it could face huge bills covering the past 10 years. Last year, a probe by the US senate found that Apple had sheltered £18billion in profits from tax by using ‘ghost companies’ registered in Ireland. This allowed Apple to pay no corporation tax on international profits, including those in the UK. Before this year Starbucks paid corporation tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales. The Commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Fiat’s financial arm, which is registered in Luxembourg. The Commission said it would examine whether generous tax deals granted to Apple in Ireland, Fiat Finance and Trade in Luxembourg, and Starbucks in the Netherlands, amounted to illegal aid. Apple has denied receiving selective treatment and Starbucks said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules.’ Too little too latte? Before this year Starbucks paid corporation tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales . Ebay paid just £620,000 in corporation tax on sales of more than £1billion last year, its latest accounts show.

"The family home of the man most associated with Sydney's famous Luna Park has been put up for sale. One of the most important figures in the history of the famous Sydney attraction, Ted Hopkins worked his way up to be park manager in 1957 after the death of original manager, David Atkins. Now Hopkins' former Wollstonecraft home, not far from Luna Park, is on the market after being in the family for the past 75 years. Ted Hopkins' former Wollstonecraft home will go on the market for A$1.7 million . Hopkins' lived in his former home in Wollstonecraft for years when not working at Luna Park . The cottage on 800 square metres at 15 Milner Crescent has been listed through Danny Grant of Ray White Lower North Shore with a hefty price tag of A$1.7 million. After replacing Atkins as park manager Hopkins continued in the role until 1969, when Leon Fink took over. Hopkins chose the house to be close to his work and his family . Luna Park opened on 4 October, 1935, just as the Great Depression was lifting, on the site used by contractors who built the Harbour Bridge. The 1896 Gavioli organ was bought in 1950, around the time the ageing Phillips brothers from America sold Luna Park to Hopkins and Atkins. For three quarters of a century Hopkins and his family lived in the house, but now it's up for sale . He had chosen the house to be close to his work and his family. They lived there for three quarters of a century. The auction for the house will take place on November 9. Hopkins worked as an electrician at Adelaide's Glenelg fun park in 1930 when he was given the job of dismantling the roller coaster and bringing it by barge up to Milsons Point, Sydney where, in 1935, Luna Park was established. Hopkins' second home was Luna Park in Sydney where he worked for most of his life . Hopkins would head overseas to buy a new ride every winter when the park closed for maintenance. ""It was my life,"" he said in 1989 about one of the most famous landmarks in Sydney.","Iconic home of the late Ted Hopkins goes on the market for A$1.7 million .

"Pre-election pledges to boost NHS funding are not enough to keep the health service free at the point of use, leading medical experts have warned. In the run up to the general election next year, the Tories, Lib Dems and Labour have all vowed to increase spending on the NHS. Ed Miliband promised the biggest boost to health spending of the main three parties - vowing to hike the NHS budget by £2.5billion a year. But an influential coalition of doctors, nurses and medical charities has warned that the promises are nowhere near enough to fill the £30 billion black hole which has left the health service at ‘breaking point’. The NHS needs an extra £30billion a year to keep it free at the point of use for everybody, medical charities have warned . In an open letter to the leaders of all three parties published by the Independent, the leading organisations said ‘the longest, and most damaging budget squeeze’ in NHS history had left the service in crisis. Health spending has been protected from the austerity cuts imposed across most of the rest of Whitehall but had not risen enough to prevent the hospitals and surgeries ‘buckling under the twin crises of rising demand and flatlining budgets’, they wrote. The letter was signed by the heads of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of GPs and four other royal colleges, the Alzheimer's Society, the Anthony Nolan Trust, the MS Society, the Royal National Institute of Blind People, the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Family Doctor Association and the Faculty of Public Health. They said: ‘Savings have been made, and despite the best efforts of nurses, doctors and other staff, patients have not been insulated from these cuts. Too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients. ‘A shortage of GPs means that patients are struggling to get an appointment to see their doctor. Pressures on maternity services mean that many women are not getting the high quality care they deserve.’ Accident and emergency unit targets were being missed - in some cases for an entire year - patients faced ‘unacceptable’ waits for cancer diagnoses, and patients requiring emergency mental health support were being moved to hospitals hundreds of miles away from home. Social care shortfalls meant dementia sufferers ‘have been cut adrift, reliant on unpaid and unsupported carers to live from day to day’ and problems were being stored up for the future by a failure to invest properly in children and young people's physical and mental health, they suggested. David Cameron announced that a future Tory government would increase spending on the NHS every year . Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (left) and Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) have used the party conference season to promise an increase in NHS spending . ‘The NHS and our social care services are at breaking point and things cannot go on like this. An NHS deficit of £30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled. ‘While we welcome the fact that the NHS has risen to the top of the political agenda, and some new spending commitments have been made, we need a comprehensive, fully costed, long-term spending plan if an NHS true to its founding principles of universal healthcare, provided according to need not ability to pay, is secured for future generations. ‘It must also take into account the need for vital social care. This will also require a guarantee that the NHS will be protected from another top-down reorganisation which is not in the best interests of patients, and distracts from the severe, long-term funding pressures facing the health service. The NHS, social services, health and care professionals and above all, the British people, deserve no less.","Tories, Lib Dems and Labour have pledged to increase spending on the NHS .

"For centuries mermaids have occupied the world of fantasy and fairy tale. This illustration was published in Hans Christian Andersens Fairy Tales around 1900 . For thousands of years they have occupied the world of fantasy, fairy tale and folklore. The half-human, half-fish creatures first appeared in ancient Assyria, now Syria, when the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame, having accidentally killed her human lover. In history the seductive creatures have been linked to perilous events in European, African and Asian culture, including floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. And they are associated with Greek mythology, Homer having referred to them as sirens - dangerous, yet beautiful creatures, who lured sailors to shipwreck. Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale The Little Mermaid, was transformed into a Disney classic and mermaids have also been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics. But could the concept actually have been derived from a real medical condition? Sirenomelia, also known as 'Mermaid syndrome' is a life-threatening illness, marked by the rotation and fusion of a sufferer's legs. The rare congenital deformity causes what looks like a single limb, resembling a fish tail, in the womb. Medical historian Lindsey Fitzharris, who has a PhD from Oxford University, told MailOnline the condition occurs from a failure of the normal vascular supply, when the umbilical cord fails to form two arteries. As a result there is not sufficient blood supply reaching the foetus, she said. The single artery 'steals' the blood and nutrition from the lower body, diverting it back up into the placenta. Suffering malnutrition, the foetus fails to develop two separate limbs. The condition is extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 babies, but is 100 times more likely to occur in identical twins. Babies born with the condition rarely live beyond a few days with more than half of  cases resulting in stillbirth. Dr Fitzharris, author of the blog The Chirurgeon's Apprentice, said: 'Over the course of my research, I've found very little about the disorder's history. 'There are snippets here and there which claim that foetuses born with sirenomelia were sometimes preserved in jars and put on display in 'freak shows' during the 19th century. 'But these sources are frustratingly vague. 'There is a brief mention of the condition in a four-volume atlas published in 1891 titled Human Monstrosities, but nothing that hints at how medical practitioners understood sirenomelia in earlier periods. 'Perhaps because the disorder is so rare, it's also been hard for me to locate specimens in anatomical collections. 'My search in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London came up cold. But medical historian Lindsey Fitzharris said the inspiration for the mythical creature could come from a real medical condition. Sirenomelia also known as 'Mermaid syndrome' is a fatal illness, marked by the rotation and fusion of a sufferer's legs. Pictured are specimens on display at the Vrolik Museum in Amsterdam . Walt Disney transformed Andersens fairy tale into one of the most iconic animated films, The Little Mermaid, released in 1989 . A statue of Hans Christian Andersens's the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark, and right an illustration from Andersens Fairy Tales, right . 'I did, however, find an early 20th-century example at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington D.C. 'There are also three foetuses in the Anatomical Museum of the Second University of Naples, which have undergone 3D bone reconstructions.' But Dr Fitzharris said by far the largest collection of foetuses is to be found in Amsterdam at the Vrolik Museum. Another of the sirenomelia exhibits at the Vrolik Museum in Amsterdam, which has a vast collection of more than 5,000 human and animal anatomy . They stand in jars among more than 5,000 specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology and congenital anomalies. Dr Fitzharris added: 'Sirenomelia is extremely fatal. 'There are no accounts of anyone with this condition surviving in the past. 'Most died within days of being born due to kidney and bladder failure. 'Even today, the odds are against those with sirenomelia, though there are a handful of examples of children living past infancy.' In 1988 Tiffany Yorks underwent surgery to separate her legs before her first birthday. She still suffers some mobility problems, because of her fragile bones, and uses crutches and a wheelchair to get around. At the age of 26, she is the oldest known surviving sufferer of the condition. Another notable survivor of the rare disorder is a Peruvian girl, nicknamed the Little Mermaid. In 2006 a team of eight specialists successfully carried out a second operation on the then two-year-old Milagros Cerron. The youngster, whose first name means 'miracles' in Spanish, was born with the rare congenital disorder. Her legs were fused from groin to ankles and her feet splayed, in the characteristic form of sirenomelia. Most of Milagros's internal organs, including her heart and lungs, were in perfect condition. But she was born with serious internal defects, including a deformed left kidney and a very small right kidney located very low in her body. Her digestive, urinary tracts and genitals also shared a single tube. Peruvian Milagros Cerron, known as the Little Mermaid, was operated on in 2006. Surgeons completed a second operation to separate her legs, fused together after she was born with sirenomelia . In June 2005 doctors successfully performed the first in a series of risky operations to separate Milagros's lower legs, to above her knees. The second operation was carried out to separate the remaining fused tissue, from her knees to groin. Surgeon Luis Rubio, who led the specialists, said after the second surgery: 'There were no problems, no complications from anaesthesia or from haemorraghing. ' He said Milagros had developed the ability to stand alone without help and take small assisted steps. In 2012 the then seven-year-old required a kidney transplant, part of surgery to reconstruct her urinary tract. Rubio said at the time that Tiffany Yorks,  was the only other person known to have undergone successful surgery to correct the rare congenital defect. In 2006 the surgeon calculated Milagros would need at least 16 more operations over the course of the next decade to reconstruct and repair her digestive, urinary and sexual organs.","Mermaids have dominated fantasy and folklore for thousands of years .

"Calgary Police were notified of a similar case investigated last year in Dublin which led to Azzopardi's identification . Australian woman Samantha Azzopardi, who duped Irish authorities last year into thinking she was an Eastern European child sex slave, has allegedly attempted a similar story in Canada. Azzopardi, 26, from Sydney, walked into a Calgary health centre on September 16 alleging she was a 14-year-old who was the victim of an abduction and prolonged sexual assault, Canadian authorities said on Monday. Azzopardi, using the alias Aurora Hepburn, allegedly told investigators she'd endured years of violent sexual abuse and torture. It was not until last Thursday that the Calgary Police Service was notified of a similar, world headline-making case investigated last year in Dublin. Canadian police released images of Australian woman Samantha Azzopardi (pictured) after charging her with public mischief to mislead a peace officer . After liaising with Irish authorities, it was determined the woman in Calgary was Azzopardi. Azzopardi is charged with public mischief to mislead a peace officer and faces up to five years' jail. Due to her multiple aliases, Calgary police have released a photo of Azzopardi in the hope the public can provide information about her movements in Calgary. Irish authorities last year also took the rare step of releasing her photo after she was found wandering Dublin streets and led Irish police to believe that she was a teenage sex-trafficking victim. The 26-year-old walked into a Calgary health centre in Canada on September 16 alleging she was a 14-year-old who was the victim of an abduction and prolonged sexual assault . Azzopardi drew pictures apparently showing herself being raped, forcing Irish police to release the photo of her in a bid to find her identity. Azzopardi was subsequently sent back to Australia, where she had a history of fraud-related charges. The Australian Federal Police declined to comment on the case, saying it was a matter for Canadian authorities. In Novemeber last year, Azzopardi was found wandering Ireland in a dazed state and unable to communicate. Calgary Police were notified of a similar case investigated last year in Dublin which led to Azzopardi's identification . Initially it was feared that she was a teenage victim of human traffickers as she had drawn pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution. She was described as vulnerable and was put in a Dublin hospital after concerns were raised that was she an Eastern European teenager who had been trafficked into the country. However she was later identified as an Australian with around 40 aliases. The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English. In November 2013, Irish police feared Azzopardi may have been child sex slave from Europe after she told them she was '14 or 15' and drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men . It was announced that Irish police were considering charging Miss Azzopardi with wasting their time after it emerged the worldwide appeal for her identity cost has cost them £200,000. The huge police investigation into her case involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry. Irish police spent £200,000 on a world wide appeal for her identity . She had been in the care of health authorities in Dublin as a psychiatric patient but the High Court in Dublin soon heard from psychiatrist Brendan Kelly who found she is not suffering from a disorder classed under the Mental Health Act in Ireland. 'She has a particular condition,' said Tim O'Leary, a lawyer for the Health Service Executive. 'That condition is specified and makes her vulnerable.' Azzopardi had been in Ireland visiting a relative before going missing and being found on Dublin's O'Connell Street - the Irish capital's main shopping thoroughfare - in a distressed state on October 10. Azzopardi was known to 'easily assume' the persona of an adolescent teenager, so was able to fool police into believing she was just 14 or 15 years old, the Irish Independent reported. It was also claimed that Azzopardi was convicted in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in 2010 on two charges of making false representations, one charge of possession of a thing with intent to forge documents and one charge of contravening directions. She was fined $500, to be paid if she reoffended in the following 12 months. Azzopardi was convicted the following month of four separate charges relating to false representations and given the same penalty. It is understood she was last year convicted interstate for defrauding or deceiving to obtain welfare payments and sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. And in June last year she pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court to three counts of opening an account with a cash dealer in a false name, one count of inducing a person to act and three counts of intent to defraud by deceit. She was sentenced on October 2 last year to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.","Samantha Azzopardi, 26, told Canadian authorities she was a 14-year-old victim of an abduction .

"The winning contestant on last week's Take Me Out worked as a prostitute, it has been revealed. Wen-Jing Mo won at date with Aaron Withers on the hit ITV show last Saturday and the pair were whisked off to Cyprus in the hope that romance would blossom. However, now it has emerged that Wen, 28, became a £200-an-hour prostitute aged 18 to help make ends meet. 'A matter of survival': Take Me Out winner Wen-Jing Mowho has admitted to being a £200 per hour prostitute . It follows revelations earlier this week that Mr Withers, 32, is a £50-an-hour escort - and has a criminal conviction for punching a girl in a pub. Embarrassed show producers have now decided to axe follow-up footage of the couple on holiday when the show airs again on Saturday night. Wen told the newspaper she didn't tell producers about . her past as she said she wanted to find love on the show. She had also hidden . her dark secret from her friends and family. Match: Aaron was seen on Saturday night's show picking 28-year-old Wen for a date. Seen here with Wen and host Paddy McGuinness . She joined a central London escort agency aged 18 and was turned down by her first client - a rich businessman - for not being thin enough, she said. Wen, who grew up in care, said: 'Looking back now of course I regret . doing it – but at the time it was a lifeline for me. 'I think a lot of . other people in my position would do the same if it meant they could eat . properly – I saw it as a matter of survival.' Escort past: Take Me Out contestant Aaron Withers has been revealed as a £50-an-hour male escort . She said she had only been earning . £120 a week as a trainee hairdresser in London and had huge bills to pay . when the salon folded. However, she claimed she managed to save £3,000 a . week working as a high-class escort and said being able to pay her bills was 'like a massive . weight lifted off my shoulders'. The money meant she could afford to go to hairdressing college and take a job in property. But the memories of her time as a prostitute are 'unpleasant', she said, and she tries to block them out. Selling his wares: Aaron's escort profile page on the Platinum Select website . She recalled 'rude and obnoxious' clients and said it was 'very scary sometimes'. The revelations are the latest scandal to hit the popular show hosted by Paddy McGuinness. Yesterday, it was reported one contestant organised a 48-hour long sex party at a £4.5million . mansion in south Wales to celebrate the new series. However, it was reported that the 90 revellers caused thousands of pounds worth of damage. ITV said it was 'relaxed' about the event. Mr Withers is signed up to the Platinum Select escorts website. On . his profile page on the site, which advertises the services of more . than  5,000 escorts, Withers states his charges as £50 for an hour, £500 . for an overnight visit or £1,500 for the whole weekend. His profile states that he is happy . to entertain 'mature clients', adding: 'I have an awesome personality . and will never struggle to hold conversation.' Referring to his other job, tarmac . worker Withers said: 'I was really skint and needed to earn cash.' Sex party: Grade II listed Wyelands House in Chepstow, south Wales where the Take Me Out party took place . However, he insisted that he never offered any more than an escort service, . unlike many of his competitors who provide 'X-rated extras'. He added to the paper: 'I certainly didn't offer any more than that.' Withers . was convicted of hitting Amy Kerr and her boyfriend Simon Edwards with a . pool cue during a brawl in a pub in Somerset last summer. He was fined £200 and told to pay both victims £50 compensation each after pleading guilty to the attack. A spokesperson for show producers TalkbackThames said Mr Withers's date with Wen would not feature on this weekend's show as he had failed to disclose his criminal record. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'During the application process we ask . contestants to declare any convictions and background checks are carried . out on each individual, in line with industry practice.  Aaron’s . criminal record did not come to light. 'We will be reviewing procedures . going forward.'","Wen-Jing Mo became a prostitute aged 18 and earned £3,000 a week .

"The British public have 'fallen out of love' with Nick Clegg and there will be no return to 'Cleggmania', a frontrunner for the Lib Dem leadership has claimed. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the best Mr Clegg could hope for at the next election is earning the 'respect' of voters after five years of coalition government. The remarks come amid a slew of polls showing support for the Lib Dems at chronic lows. But the party's predicament did not appear to be of much concern to a host of delegates pictured bored and asleep at the conference in Glasgow today. A sleeping delegate at the Lib Dem conference caught the mood of many activists in Glasgow today . A number of party supporters were seen nodding off at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre on the banks of the river Clyde . A Liberal Democrat  delegate texts in the audience during MP Norman Lambs speech, while another supporter appears to have dropped off . A Lib Dem delegate  appeared keen to catch up on his sleep in a sparsely-populated auditorium this afternoon . Mr Davey's move to highlight the Deputy Prime Minister's dire personal ratings will be seen as fresh evidence of his own leadership ambitions. But Mr Clegg today appeared to anoint Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander as the party’s leader in waiting. Mr Clegg said he would not ‘go on forever’ as Liberal Democrat leader – adding that not a ‘Duracell rabbit’. He said: ‘I think there are other things to do in life, and I'm thankfully not one of those people who's so obsessed with politics that I want to be in politics forever. But I would like to see the Liberal Democrats in government after next May,’ he said. ‘Tony Blair said the problem with politics is you start popular but inexperienced and as you become better at your job you become less popular. I suppose that's happened to us and to me.’ Mr Clegg added: ‘I'm 47, I've got three little kids, I've got lots of interests outside politics and lots of friends outside politics. I'm frankly too busy to do that. You should be dedicated to your job but not obsessive about it.’ The Deputy PM also shrugged off speculation that Mr Alexander was angling for his job, saying it was not a ‘sin’ to be ambitious. ‘Danny is a fantastically close friend and colleague. I don't see what's wrong with ambition,’ he said. An ICM survey for The Guardian today showed just 17 per cent of voters think Mr Clegg is doing a good job, down by eight points since June, while 59 per cent think he is doing badly. This gives him a dire net rating of -42 per cent, -35 per cent for Labour's Ed Miliband and only -7 per cent for Tory PM David Cameron. A separate ComRes poll for ITV News last night showed 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree. Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges. Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Mr Clegg. Energy Secretary Ed Davey suggested Mr Clegg could hope for the 'respect' of voters in 2015 . Most Lib Dems are resigned to the fact that Mr Clegg will lead the party into the next election. But several senior figures are said already to be positioning for their own leadership bids, including Mr Davey, Treasury minister Danny Alexander and party president Tim Farron. In a damning assessment on his leader's appeal, Mr Davey told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don't think we're going to see the repeat of the last election where you in the media had what you called 'Cleggmania' when everyone fell in love with Nick Clegg. 'Because we had to go into Coalition with the Conservatives, that's what people voted for, because we've had to take some hard choices, because of the financial mess that Labour left us with, people have fallen out of love with Nick Clegg, that's what the opinion polls show.' He went on: 'But I tell you what, I think nearer to the election when people look at what he's delivered and what the Liberal Democrats have delivered, he'll get respect. I think we'll move from the 'Cleggmania' of the last election to Clegg-respect. 'He deserves that respect. If you look at his record, how a really courageous British politician, taking on the Conservatives, delivering a stronger economy and a fairer society, focusing on the opportunities we want to give to all people. 'I think Nick Clegg will win that respect and will win votes at the next election.' In a separate poll by Lord Ashcroft, just 7 per cent of people say they plan to vote Lib Dem next year. Of those, just a third - or 2.2 per cent of all voters - say they will definitely vote for Mr Clegg's party. Overall, the Tories are ahead on 32 per cent - after their successful conference last week - with Labour on 30 per cent. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will hope to revive the party's support with set-piece pledges to cut tax in his speech tomorrow . Lib Dem minster David Laws and the Business Secretary Vince Cable appeared less-than enthused at the party's conference in Glasgow today . The Lib Dems are languishing in fourth place in the polls - equal with the Greens, but behind UKP . UKIP are on 17 per cent, with the Greens on 7 per cent - the same as the Lib Dems. Mr Clegg yesterday played down his party's struggles in the polls. He told ITV: 'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'oh isn't it going to be a disaster? Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?' And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year. 'I'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold. All I can tell you is what I believe, what our values are and the pride that I have in what we've done over the last four and a half years.'","Ed Davey says there will be no repeat of 2010's 'Cleggmania'

"These are the heart-rending postcards sent by a solider fighting on the front line during the Great War to his sweetheart back home. Brave Fred Eason penned the cheery missives to his loyal wife, Annie, as he fought in the trenches in north-western France during the First World War. The Royal Engineer was wounded, but survived the conflict to be reunited with his family in Cardiff, Wales. Love letter: Fred Eason sent this postcard from a WWI training base in north-western France  to his wife, Annie . Touching message: Mr Eason told his wife 'not to get downhearted' while he was so far away from home training to go into battle in north-western France . The touching postcards have been kept by the Eason family as a reminder of what their grandparents went through. 'When my nan died in 1973 my father inherited the house and they were in a box in the room,' said Mr Eason's granddaughter Heather Eason, 44. Loving couple: Fred Eason pictured with his wife, Annie, after the war and Mr Eason posing proudly in his full military uniform . 'From time to time we would get them out but as a child you don't fully understand their significance. 'Reading them now, my grandfather must have known what he was going into but never showed it through his postcards to my nan. 'We're reading them with hindsight but when they arrived at the house my nan must have been worried especially getting the letter that he was wounded.' The couple married in 1913 and in early 1915 their first child was born. The young father  joined the Royal Engineers aged 24 and was sent to a training base in France. Mr Eason's first postcard to his wife, who he called Nance, is of a picture of the beach at Étretat - on the back he wrote: 'Dear Nance, Just a P.C. to say that I am leaving here for the base, so you can see that my chance of coming home is all up, but there dear, do not get downhearted for, dear, one cannot have all their own way in the army. 'Darling, do not write again until you hear from me. So, darling, I must wish you goodbye for the present. 'I remain your loving husband Fred. Dear, I do hope that you and the baby are all right. xxxxxxxxxxx.' He was then sent to the base near the Belgian border at Bac-Saint-Maur. Another is a picture of the village of Bac-Saint-Maur on which he has written: 'Darling, what do you think of this place? I will tell you all about it when I come home again. xxxxxxxxxxxx.' A further postcard, which has a picture of the Tissage Gille mill building in Bac-Saint-Maur,  reads: 'Darling what do you think of this place? xxxxxxx.' Treasured postcard: The front of another message sent from a small French hamlet on the Belgian border by the young soldier .

The back of another postcard from Mr Eason in which he promises to tell his wife all about his experiences . In September 1915  Fred was wounded and his commanding officer sent a letter home to Mrs Eason. Dated September 16, 1915, it reads: 'I am very sorry that your husband received a bullet wound this morning whilst at work. 'He has been taken into hospital and the doctor says he should go on all right. 'He was working behind an old parapet repairing and strengthening it, and a bullet passed through the top sandbag and passed downwards, hitting your husband in the chest, well to the left side and obviously clear of any vital part. 'The bullet is lodged in his side, and has of course made a Big Bruise, but our doctors are now so good at wounds of all sorts and rifle bullets have been proved to be so clean in the wounds they inflict, that I hope he will be fit and well in a month or two. 'When he does get well and is ready for work, I hope you will spare him to come out to us again as he is a really good worker and I should be very sorry not to get him back. 'He will be taken back to some base hospital and very likely back to England; I cannot tell you where - but he is sure to write to you at first opportunity. 'I hope you will let me know when you manage to see him; and tell me how he is getting on. 'Believe me, yours very truly, R H Shillimore, (Major R.E.)' Dear Nance, . Just a P.C. to say that I am leaving here for the base, so you can see that my chance of coming home is all up, but there dear, do not get down hearted for, dear, one cannot have all their own way in the army. Darling, do not write again until you hear from me. So, darling, I must wish you goodbye for the present. I remain your loving husband Fred. Dear, I do hope that you and the baby are all right. xxxxxxxxxxx.' After a period of convalescence, Mr Eason did go back to the trenches but came safely home at the war's end. He went on to work  as an industrial blacksmith in Cardiff Docks and the couple had five children, before his death in 1954. His granddaughter said: 'My aunts and uncles spoke of Fred as 'lovely, quiet man - calm and gentle' and although he died before I was born, his stories and memories have come down to me through these interesting documents and photos.' Annie Eason received this letter from her husband's commanding officers informing her he had been shot in the chest while working in the trenches . Mr Eason's commanding officer said that he would be 'very sorry not to get him back' in a letter from the front to Annie Eason .","Fred Eason signed up at 24 and served with the Royal Engineers .

"The Reign of Cats and Dogs has arrived, as both Saturday and Sunday saw a huge success for our four-legged friends . The Reign of Cats and Dogs has arrived, as both Saturday and Sunday saw a huge success for our four-legged friends at an event that aimed to adopt out dogs and parade famous cats. The two day event took place at  Bicentennial Park on Glebe Foreshore, in the inner west  Sydney, New South Wales, where dogs from RSPCA and 12 other animal shelters were matched with their perfect owner on Saturday and rulers of the cat world strutted their stuff on Sunday. On Saturday 1,500 people travelled to Bicentennial Park for the Rescue Me canine event that began at 10am till 2pm. A spokeswoman for RSPCA told Daily Mail Australia said it was a huge success that saw a lot of foot traffic. 'There was a Yum Cha stand, a New York pastrami deli, Mr Whippy and a coffee truck... everyone was really happy.' 'It was a great day - in total 50 dogs were adopted - we had 10 dogs from the RSPCA that were adopted,' she said. The spokeswoman said a lot of the dogs were cross-breed but some breeds did particularly well with the crowds. 'The grey hounds did really well-  five of them were adopted,' she said. 'Cattle dogs also did well - adopting out four of them.' As for the rest of the dogs that were left behind, they will be going back to their rescue shelters waiting for someone to take them home. Cats have also been celebrated by New South Wales RSPCA, with the International Cat Film Furstival in that park on Sunday night at 6pm.

"To play darts at the Sixpenny Pint you have to throw from outside the front door, but there's no room for such games here, where beer is taken seriously and space is at a premium. The humble little watering hole, at 68 square feet, is one of the smallest in the country and can be found in deepest Dorset between Salisbury and Blandford Forum. It has been named in the Good Beer Guide for the third consecutive year, not bad for its five-year history after it opened as an offshoot of the Sixpenny Brewery. Pint-sized: The Sixpenny Pint in Dorset can fit no more than 17 people inside at any one time . Patience required: The pub, despite its size, has been named in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide for the third year . The farm's former milking parlour, the Tap can fit just 17 people inside with a single bar tender manning the eight foot-wide bar. While it is open year-round, the Sixpenny Tap does its best business in the warmer months when locals and visitors can spill into the outside area. Up to 80 drinkers can be found at the pub at one time, a stretch for the sole staff member, but they have a fine solution for that too - a communal self-service tap away from the bar for those unwilling to wait to be served, with an honesty box system for payment. Kevin Patrick, who helps run the piddly pub under Brewery owner and landlord Scott Wayland, said the eight foot-square room was initially set up as a tasting room. Room for one: Pub landlord and brewery owner Scott Wayland behind the bar with space for just  one tender . 'After the brewery was set up in 2009 we converted a tiny eight-foot square corner of the old milking parlour into a little room for sampling our beers but it quickly became popular with locals and visitors further afield,' Patrick said. 'People started coming to the tasting room to enjoy a few pints and within just a few months it had transformed into a micropub in its own right. 'Like all great pubs it has a friendly, welcoming atmosphere and sublime beers on tap but we just can't fit any more than 17 people inside. 'The pub is only 68 square feet which makes us one of the smallest pubs in the world and probably the smallest in Britain.' Spilling over: When the inside of the pub is jammed, or if it's a nice day, up to 80 people fit into the outside area . A number of establishments would dispute that claim. The Guinness Book of World Records says the smallest pub in Britain is The Nutshell in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, which is in fact bigger at 105 square feet but can barely fit 10 people inside at any one time. The Signal Box Inn in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, is 64 square feet and lays claim to being the 'smallest pub on the planet'. But it is merely a seasonal bar attached to a heritage steam railway rather than a 12 months-a-year operation with regular opening hours like the tap. Farm watering hole: The pub, opened in 2009 along with the Sixpenny Brewery, is on a former dairy farm . There's no inferiority complex for the Tap when it comes to size though. Patrick adds: 'Being so small works in our favour because it creates an electric atmosphere. 'We have just been listed by CAMRA's Good Beer Guide which is testament to the quality of the beer and the popularity of the pub. 'We have the sort of atmosphere and clientele that many a local pub would die for.'","The Sixpenny Tap can fit just 17 people inside and has one bar tender .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have started legal action against a photographer amid reports that he tried to take a picture of Prince George in a London park, it was revealed today. A spokesman for the couple said: ‘The Duke and Duchess have taken legal steps to ask that an individual ceases harassing and following both Prince George and his nanny as they go about their ordinary daily lives. ‘An incident last week has prompted their royal highnesses to seek reasonable assurances from the individual about his behaviour. Scroll down for video . Proud parents: Prince William and Kate with their son Prince George at the Natural History Museum in April . ‘The individual was spotted at a central London park in the vicinity of Prince George, who was removed from the park immediately. ‘There is reason to suspect that the individual may have been placing Prince George under surveillance and monitoring his daily routines for a period of time. ‘The Duke and Duchess understand the particular public role that Prince George will one day inherit, but, while he is young, he must be permitted to lead as ordinary a life as possible. ‘No parent would tolerate the suspicion of someone pursuing and harassing their child and carer whilst their child is playing in a public park or going about their daily activities.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave hospital in London with George shortly after his birth in July 2013 . The statement came in response to newspaper reports that a photographer had apparently tried to take pictures of the prince in Battersea Park. The London Evening Standard reported that there had also been an episode when a photographer was told to move on by police when he was seen waiting outside Buckingham Palace, where Prince George is sometimes taken to swim in the palace pool. It is understood that William and Kate want Prince George to have the freedom to experience normal childhood activities, like going to the park and playing with other children, without the threat of harassment or being placed under surveillance. It is also understood that the individual has already been spoken to by protection officers about his behaviour towards members of the Royal Family on previous occasions over a number of years. It is not the first time the couple, who are expecting their second child, have had concerns about their privacy. Location: A royal spokesman made a statement in response to newspaper reports that a photographer had apparently tried to take pictures of the prince at Battersea Park (file picture) in south-west London . Earlier this year, a German newspaper published a photograph showing Kate's bottom. The Duchess is pictured walking with William during their tour of Australia when a gust of wind blows up her dress at the back. German tabloid Bild caused controversy by running the image, with one commentator describing the move as ‘utterly tasteless’. And French magazine Closer sparked anger by printing topless images of Kate, 32, while she was sunbathing on a private holiday with William, 31, in September 2012.","Photographer 'tried to take pictures' of George in Battersea Park, London .

"The first 100 days of a Ukip government are to be imagined in a spoof documentary to be aired by Channel 4 before the election. Producers claim they want to explore the effects of the Eurosceptic party's policies on Britain ahead of polling day, when Ukip is planning to target 100 seats across the country. The programme will follow a new Ukip MP as she arrives in Westminster with the aim of taking the UK out of the European Union but one question is as yet unanswered: Who will play Nigel Farage? Scroll down for video . The spoof documentary will examine the impact of Nigel Farage taking the keys of Number 10 as Prime Minister in a Ukip government after May's general election . The decision to commission the programme is further recognition of the extraordinary rise in support for Ukip. One poll this week put Mr Farage's party on 19 per cent, a record high and well above the 3 per cent secured at the 2010 election. The party gained its first MP - Douglas Carswell - in a by-election this month, and is expected to be joined by Mark Reckless, another Tory defector, on November 20. Mr Farage has upped his ambitions, and Ukip's biggest donor has promised to target 100 seats at the next election. Such a move could secure several more Ukip MPs, and deprive Tory MPs of a majority. Even Mr Farage admits the prospect of him becoming Prime Minister is a distant one. But it will be the central premise of the Channel 4 programme, 100 Days of Ukip. The one-off 'What-If' drama will examine the impact of Ukip actually winning the general election in May 2015. 100 Days of Ukip will be broadcast in the spring, ahead of polling day. But there are as yet no details of the cast, and no hint about who will play Mr Farage. Today Mr Farage said he had been told about the programme, but asked by MailOnline who he would like to play him in the drama, replied: 'No comment.' A surge in support for Ukip has put Mr Farage at the centre of the media spotlight, and under more intense scrutiny . Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June . Raw TV, which is producing the show, said it will be 'set in a possible future where Nigel Farage's party has continued its exponential rise to power, the film projects what could actually happen if UKIP were to gain power in next year's election'. The programme will use both members of the public and actors to film scripted scenes  which will be woven together with real-life archive from news programmes. Channel 4 Head of Documentaries Nick Mirsky said: 'This is a very exciting commission from a team known for brave and thought-provoking television.' In recent days Ukip has been bolstered by the huge row over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion to the EU by December 1, rising to 19 per cent in a ComRes survey for The Independent. Executive producer Richard Bond said: 'With support for Ukip growing in the polls, this is timely exploration of the effect their policies might have on Britain.' Twitter spoof account @GeneralBoles was quick to mock up Ray Winston in a pinstripe suit with a purple rosette . With Channel 4 yet to cast its Ukip spoof documentary, speculation has mounted about who will play Nigel Farage. The Ukip insists he has not given it any thought. But Twitter spoof account @GeneralBoles was quick to mock up Ray Winston in a pinstripe suit with a purple rosette. Bookies, meanwhile, have installed Michael Sheen as 3/1 favourite, after successfully playing Tony Blair three times, including in the 2006 film The Queen. By contrast Brad Pitt is on 500,/1, Russell Brand 100/1 and Eddie Izzard 100/1. Matthew Shaddick of Ladbrokes said: 'Sheen fits the bill perfectly but if they want a hapless Prime Ministerial performance, Hugh Grant has some form at 33/1. 'We suspect Brad Pitt might have more suitable projects lined up, so needless to say he's the rank outsider.' Michael Sheen has played Tony Blair three times .

"Heroin has been uncovered in the hotel room where an American TV producer was found next to his unconscious assistant. The lifeless body of 'Amazing Race' producer Jeff Rice was found on the balcony of the Serena hotel in Uganda, blood pouring from his nose and mouth. Next to him lay his unconscious assistant, Katheryne Fuller, who is recovering in hospital but is being held in Uganda until police determine if she has committed drugs offences. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Katheryne Fuller, who was found unconscious in a Ugandan hotel next to the lifeless body of 'Amazing Race' producer Jeff Rice, is recovering in hospital . An autopsy revealed that Rice died of a . cocaine overdose and had large quantities of the drug in his stomach, . according to Ugandan police. South African Fuller also tested positive for cocaine, police told ABC News. The presence of the drug in large quantities has fuelled speculation that the two were involved in a smuggling operation. Forensics have now determined that other drugs were also present at the scene. Dr Stephen Cina, a forensic pathology consultant, said. 'The bag of white powder that was found on scene is a mixture of a component of heroin and some Tylenol and some caffeine. 'So that certainly suggests that at least in that bag there's a mixture of several substances present.' The pair who were in Kampala, Uganda, to . film a documentary, were originally thought to have been poisoned. But . police have now ruled out this theory. Uganda Police Force spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told ABC News. 'This is a very wrong account,' However friends believe they were forced to ingest it after a failed shakedown. Others fear they were targeted because they were working on an investigative documentary, ABC News reported. But police insist the pair willingly ingested the substance. 'There was no struggle. These were two people in their room and there was not a single sign of a struggle. Not even a single bruise on Rice's body,' Mugenyi said. Poisoned or Overdose? Jeff Rice was found dead on his hotel balcony in Kampala, Uganda . Mystery: An autopsy revealed that Jeff Rice died of a cocaine overdose and had large quantities of the drug in his stomach . Fuller's father is in Kampala and wants to take her home to South Africa for medical treatment, but Mugenyi indicated this may not happen for some time.

She needs medical attention that they can't do here,' he said. To complicate her return home Fuller's wallet and passport are missing from the hotel room, a family friend told ABC News. Creative: His company website describes Rice as 'the ideas man' Rice's wife Sally Blackman told English language online Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor she would not speculate about her husband's death. She said: 'I would not like to speculate or even attempt to give my views on this as this may jeopardise the investigation going forward.' Dr. Nicholas Kardaras, an addiction specialist at Stony Brook University, told Fox News that the most likely reason for cocaine in the stomach would be from a bungled smuggling operation or forced ingestion. He said: 'If someone were to snort very large amounts of cocaine, there could have been some trace amounts from nasal drip into the stomach. But if the concentration was found in the stomach, that’s likely a result of smuggling or ingestion.' 'A typical overdose from the traditional methods of using cocaine is not going to be in the stomach. If it was found in his stomach, it could absolutely have been the result of poisoning if he was forced to ingest it.'

"Adam Tajul was jailed for three years and nine months for his role in the drugs ring . Charlotte Church's former lover has been jailed for dealing drugs, making him the second in the singer's repertoire of ex-boyfriends to be put behind bars. Adam Tajul, who taught Ms Church 'how to kiss' when she was just 15, was jailed for three years and nine months for his role in a drug smuggling operation. The 29-year-old from Cardiff previously revealed how he dated the Crazy Chick singer and claims to have taught her how to kiss after the pair met in a sandwich shop. He is the second of Ms Church's lovers to be put behind bars. Kyle Johnson was jailed for 12 years after police discovered a £10million heroin haul in his home in 2009. Tajul was at the 'heart of a conspiracy' to transport 12kg of cannabis from Bristol to the Welsh capital, Cardiff Crown Court heard. Officers investigating the operation for more than two years seized £43,000 in cash after raiding his home. He was sentenced alongside six gang members on September 12. Tajul previously told how he met Ms Church in their native Cardiff in 2001 at which point her classical singing had become known as 'the voice of an angel'. 'Charlotte was a nice girl when she met me. She was well spoken and posh but she wanted to make things happen,' he said. 'At first she couldn't kiss at all. But once I taught her how to French kiss she soon caught on.

'She loved me hard. It was like I was God - she gave it everything.' After breaking up with the criminal around her 16th birthday, Ms Church moved in with Kyle Johnson. In 2009 and following their acrimonious split four years earlier, Johnson was jailed after going on the run from police after £10million worth of heroin was found at his home. Ms Church has two children with rugby player Gavin Henson, from whom she separated in 2010.

"Joan Rivers had said some harsh words about the president and the first lady in the past, but that did not discourage Barack Obama from mourning her passing. Melissa Rivers appeared Thursday night on a special episode of E!'s Fashion Police to talk about her late mother for the first time since the legendary comedienne passed away at age 81 on September 4. Ms Rivers, dressed in black, sat down for an interview with her mother's grieving co-hosts, Kelly Osbourne, Giuliana Rancic and George Kotsiopoulos and spoke about the many people her mother touched. Scroll down for videos . First appearance: Melissa Rivers (second right) came on Fashion Police to talk about all the peoplpe her late mother had touched . Touched: Melissa Rivers received a handwritten note from Barack Obama that read in part: 'not only did she make us laugh, she made us think' Among the dignitaries and celebrities who have reached out to the comic’s family since her passing was President Obama, who sent Melissa Rivers a handwritten note that read in part: 'not only did she make us laugh, she made us think.' The tart-tongued comedienne, notorious for her take-no-prisoners attitude, often made fun of America’s first couple. In July, Joan Rivers sparked a controversy after calling President Obama gay and his wife, Michelle, transgender, CNN reported. At the time, the Fashion Police host was asked by a photographer outside her Manhattan apartment building if she believed a gay or female president would ever occupy the White House. The quick-witted Ms Rivers responded by saying: ' we already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down. She then added: 'you know Michelle is trans.' Big shoes to fill: Rivers paid tribute to her famous mother by appearing on a special episode of the Fashion Police Thursday night . The Sidney Morning Herald reported that just weeks before her passing, Ms Rivers told the Sunday Times Magazine in an interview that Mrs Obama was not allowed to attend her funeral because she was a 'tranny.' The list of celebrities banned by Rivers from her memorial service also included late-night host Chelsea handler, whom she branded a 'w****,' and singer Adele, whom Rivers called 'fat.' Today E! is celebrating 'Joan Rivers day' - with back-to-back episodes of Fashion Police and a 90-minute special of the show featuring Melissa Rivers and co-hosts Guiliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne and George Kotsiopoulos. The marathon viewing includes Joan's birthday episode and also the last show she filmed. Ms Rivers passed away on September 4 at the age of 81 after slipping into a coma a week earlier following a throat procedure at a Manhattan clinic. Melissa Rivers pictured with her beloved mother Joan Rivers on May 15. Melissa thanked fans for the 'depth of love' expressed following the comedienne's death on Thursday . The special tribute will also include outtakes and never-before-seen footage, according to CBS. The E! Fashion Police episodes are airing from 7am until 7pm before the 'Celebrating Joan' special at 8pm. On Wednesday evening, Melissa Rivers posted this message to her social media accounts: 'As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media. 'My mother would have been overwhelmed by the scope and depth of the love that people have expressed for her. It is certainly helping to lift our spirits during this time. 'We are forever grateful for your kindness and support in continuing to honor my mother’s legacy, and for remembering the joy and laughter that she brought to so many.' Alongside her mother, Melissa Rivers hosted red-carpet fashion for the E! cable network. Last year, she co-created her mother's web show In Bed With Joan, a series of short interviews which starred Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman, Kelly Osbourne and Carmen Electra among many others. Melissa Rivers' emotional words came as new details emerged on Wednesday about the throat procedure which led the comedienne to slip into a coma last month. Dr Gwen Korovin, 56, is known as a 'throat specialist to the stars', and was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death, MailOnline has learned. The doctor, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. Joan Rivers, pictured with her Fashion Police co-hosts on E! - from left, Kelly Osbourne, guest Jessie J, George Kotsiopoulos and Guiliana Rancic . It is believed that Dr Korovin was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 as Joan’s personal doctor when the legendary comedienne stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords. Staff at Dr Korovin's offices on the Upper East Side of Manhattan refused to comment. CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said the star suffered a cardiac arrest as her personal doctor performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. A staff member at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor even took a 'selfie' photo in the procedure room while Joan was under anesthesia, the source said. Joan Rivers, 81, arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. Dr Gwen Korovin (pictured left) and Dr Lawrence Cohen (right) were both present when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest during a throat procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on August 28. Neither has been accused of wrongdoing . An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist. CNN said that investigators believe that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4 after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects. On Friday, Dr Cohen stepped down from his position at the medical center. A Yorkville spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.’ Sources told ABC news that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Joan. Neither Dr Cohen nor the specialist have been accused of wrongdoing. Today, the New York State Department of Health, in a statement to People, said: 'The State Department of Health's investigation is ongoing. As this is an open investigation, DOH cannot comment on any specifics regarding the investigation.'","Friday on E! is 'Joan Rivers day' - with back-to-back episodes of Fashion Police and 90-minute special of the show .

"A young woman who was stabbed more than 30 times by by her ex-boyfriend had to undergo several emergency surgeries and flat lined four times while receiving more than 12 pints of blood. Melissa Dohme, who is only 5ft tall, was allegedly stabbed by 6ft4in Robert Burton as they walked outside a park hear Ms Dohme’s home in Clearwater, Florida this January. Burton had been calling and texting her requesting a hug - however, when she met him to talk, she said she heard a click, and then sharp pain in her neck, where he allegedly embedded his knife. He is facing charges of attempted first-degree murder and assault from a previous altercation. Survivor: Melissa Dohme was stabbed in the face and neck more than 32 times, but her scars are quickly fading; the picture on the right shows how her scars have healed in a two-month span . Support: Melissa pictured with her mother Joann at church in Clearwater . Robert Burton is charged with attempted first-degree murder after he allegedly stabbed Ms Dohme . However, the 20-year-old remains optimistic, and recently left for a backpacking trip through Europe, which she planned before the January 24 attack. Ms Dohme met Burton at Clearwater High School, and the couple dated for nearly two years. However, things took a violent turn when Burton allegedly attacked her outside Ms Dohme’s house last October. Court documents allege that he pulled her hair and punched her repeatedly. The couple broke up soon after. But Burton called and texted the petit blonde over and over January 24, saying he needed to see her, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Ms Dohme told the Times that she initially ignored him and told Burton that she had class early the next day – it was, after all, around 2:30am. She agreed to see him when he said he was near her house, around 3am. He said he only needed a hug. Even so, Ms Dohme took pepper spray with her. According to court documents, Burton asked for a hug, and then began stabbing her in the face and neck. During the attack, she was screaming as loud as she could, hoping someone would hear. A young couple who did not want to be publically identified happened to be in Crest Lake Park. Roving: Ms Dohme, pictured before the attack, still has a long road ahead of her . Law and order: Ms Dohme wrote: 'Ran into these two great men tonight, detectives Ruhlin and Sena! These are the ones working on my case and were able to get the jerk (putting it nicely) to confess his guilt' According to a police report, the couple – who are both in their late teens – yelled at Burton to stop and said he was going to kill her. The man attempted to push the 245-pound Burton off of Ms Dohme, but was unable to. Meanwhile, the young woman tried to help Ms Dohme escape to safety and called 911. Ms Dohme told the Tampa Bay Times that the couple’s intervention likely saved her live. ‘(Burton) would have stabbed me ‘til I was dead,’ she told the Times. 'I know it's a miracle that I am still here. Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.' The couple left, and Burton had allegedly gone back to his truck to retrieve a bigger knife. Ms Dohme had lost pints of blood already, and was fading. Burton was later found after he crashed his car some distance away. He was believed to have overdosed on sleeping pills. Doctors rushed her to Bayfront, where she underwent several surgeries, and was given 12 units of blood. She suffered a slash to the right side of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out. Ms Dohme later counted 32 stab wounds, 18 of which were deep. ‘I know it’s a miracle that I am still here,’ she told Bay News 9 in an interview earlier this month. ‘Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.’ But her fighting spirit, as well as her faith helped her persevere. ‘He didn’t win and I won,’ she told the Times. Within days of the near-lethal attack, Ms Dohme was able to breathe on her own, could grasp a pencil, and could walk down the hallways of the ICU. Achievements: She was named 2012 Student of the Year Award at St Petersburg College and managed to finish her courses, receiving A's . She had to regularly attend speech therapy and get check-ups with other specialists. Remarkably, she went home three weeks later, and finished out her classes at St Petersburg College, earning A’s in her Humanities and Sociology classes. Burton faces assault charges in addition to first-degree attempted murder charges. Ms Dohme hasn’t let the injury slow her down. Though she completes seven hours of rehab weekly, she continues to be the bright, smiling young woman she was before the attack. She is currently backpacking through Europe with a few girlfriends, and has received an outpouring of support from friends and family. Her brush with death hasn’t stopped her from pursuing her dream – becoming a neo-natal nurse. And more than anything, nearly losing everything has shown her a new appreciation for the small tings. ‘I’ve never loved life so much, I’ve never been so appreciative, I really appreciate every day,’ she told Bay News 9. High-octane: She went skydiving for her 20th birthday, weeks before she was stabbed . However, there are some more battles to be won. Her medical bills alone total more than half a million dollars, and she faces more surgeries in the future – especially cosmetic procedures that will help lessen the appearance of scars on her face and neck. The aspiring nurse is currently petitioning Governor Rick Scott and Senator Mark Rubio (R-Florida), as well as President Obama, for Melissa’s Law. The law states that those with restraining orders against them should pay for monitoring. In addition, victims should receive texts, emails, and phone calls to be alerted when their attackers and stalkers are near. It also calls for the names of judges, and defence attorneys who allow perpetrators to be released to be published.","Melissa Dohme was allegedly stabbed more than 30 times in her face and neck in January by her ex-boyfriend .

"The dazzling tiara worn by the Duchess of Cambridge on her wedding day to Prince William is to go on display in Paris for the next two months. The halo tiara, which was designed by Cartier, will take pride of place at an exhibition celebrating the style and history of the iconic jewellers. The head piece, composed of stylised petals and paved with 739 brilliant-cut diamonds and 149 baguette-cut diamonds, takes its name from its halo shape and was made in 1936. Regal: The Duchess of Cambridge wore the halo tiara when she married Prince William. It will be on display in Paris for the next two months . Something borrowed: The Queen lent the tiara - that her father commissioned Cartier to make in 1936 - to Kate to wear on the big day . The future King George VI had commissioned Cartier to create it for his wife, Elizabeth, the Queen's mother, shortly before he succeeded his brother to take the throne. The Queen Mother then gave the tiara to Queen Elizabeth on the occasion of her 18th birthday. Over the decades, it has been worn by the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne, before she lent it to Kate to wear when she became a member of the royal family in 2011 as a decadent 'something borrowed'. Priceless: The tiara takes its name from its halo shape and is composed of stylised petals and paved with 739 brilliant-cut diamonds and 149 baguette-cut diamonds . Passed down the royal generations: The tiara was made as a gift by the Queen's father for her mother, the then Princess Elizabeth, left. It was then given to the Queen on her 18th birthday and she has lent it to her sister Princess Margaret, centre, and daughter, Princess Anne, right, over the years . The tiara can be seen at the Cartier display at the Grand Palais, Paris, until 16 February. As previously reported in MailOnline, a number of other jewels worn by royalty and Hollywood legends will also be part of Cartier's biggest ever exhibition. Grace Kelly's engagement ring and pieces commissioned and worn by the Duchess of Windsor will be among the exhibits. A display of diamonds wouldn't be complete with those worn by the late Elizabeth Taylor, and some of her stunning gems will be shown. Dazzling: Grace Kelly's emerald-cut 10.47 carat engagement ring, left, given to her by Prince Rainier of Monaco. She can be seen wearing the ring in the film High Society . Bird of beauty: The Duchess of Windsor's flamingo brooch, designed by Jeanne Toussaint, left, was made using platinum gold, brilliant-cut diamonds, calibré-cut emeralds, sapphires, rubies and one citrine. The Duchess can be seen wearing it, right, in 1940 . Design process: Toussaint's original drawing for the flamingo brooch will be part of the exhibition . Part of the display pays tribute to Jeanne Toussaint who became director of Cartier's luxury jewellery department in 1933. In a career spanning the decades, she designed and created some of the world's most exquisite pieces of jewellery. Her designs included a flamingo brooch created in 1940 that was commissioned by the Duchess of Windsor, Wallis Simpson, who was devoted to the Cartier's creations. The 9.65 x 9.59 cm brooch was made with stones belonging to the Duchess herself with the flamingo's body set with calibrated diamonds, sapphire feathers, rubies and emeralds. Her husband, Edward, the abdicated King, bought it for her shortly before the couple fled their home in France as the Nazis advanced. The item will be on show as well as Toussaint's original design sketches. Toussaint was famed for being fearless and politically engaged, creating brooches depicting caged birds when France was occupied by the Nazis during World War Two. They were displayed in the windows of rue de la Paix, symbolising the plight of occupied France. One of the brooches created in 1944, after the Liberation of Paris, will be in the exhibition showing a freed bird made from gems in France's tricolour. Historic: Elizabeth Taylor's 'La Peregrina', left, was a gift from Richard Burton that Cartier turned into a necklace. The actress can be seen wearing it, centre. It features a pearl that dates back to the 16th century once belonging to Queen Mary Tudor, right . On the silver screen: Actress Gloria Swanson commissioned Cartier to create her diamond, platinum and rock crystal bracelet in 1930 to celebrate her marriage to Frenchman Michael Farmer. She can be seen wearing them in the films Perfect Understanding and Sunset Boulevard . Still in fashion: This diamond hair ornament was created by Louis Cartier in 1902 and is 7cm in height at its centre. It was worn by designer Stella McCartney to the Met Ball last year, right . Extravagant taste: Barbara Hutton was one of Cartier's best clients when she was one of the world's wealthiest women as  heiress to the Woolworth stores. She was fond of tigers and asked Toussaint to create her a brooch and earrings, left, in the shape of the animal made from diamonds, emeralds and onyx. She can be seen wearing the brooch, right, in 1960, at her son's wedding . Decadent: Mexican actress Maria Felix asked Cartier to create necklaces and bracelets for her in the shape of crocodiles and snakes. The crocodile necklace, left, made in 1975, weighs more than 126 carats and she can be seen wearing it, right . The exhibition is curated by Laurent Salomé, scientific director to the Réunion des Musées Nationaux Grand Palais, and will feature 600 pieces of jewellery. Of those, 550 from the historic Cartier Collection while 50 are on loan from museums and private collectors around the world. One of the highlights is actress Grace Kelly's emerald-cut  10.47 carat engagement ring, given to her by Prince Rainier of Monaco. She can be seen wearing the gem in the film High Society, her final film before she retired from acting to focus on her royal duties and motherhood. Actress Gloria Swanson also worn Cartier jewellery on the silver screen, wearing diamond, platinum and rock crystal bracelets created by Cartier in 1930 in Perfect Understanding and Sunset Boulevard. She commissioned the jewellers to create the bangles at the height of here fame the year after the Wall Street crash to celebrate her marriage to Frenchman Michael Farmer. Elizabeth Taylor's jewels on show in the exhibition include her famous necklace made by Cartier featuring the La Peregrina pearl. The stone dates back to the 16th century when it was worn by Queen Mary Tudor. Centuries later, Richard Burton bought it at auction and gave it to Taylor as a Valentine's Day gift. More gems on display: A platinum tiara made by Cartier in 1914 with a tree made from black onyx set against a diamond background, left, and a Tutti Frutti strap bracelet, right, featuring diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds was made by Cartier in 1925 inspired by Indian jewellery.  This and other Tutti Frutti pieces enchanted women of distinct tastes, such as Lady Mountbatten, Mrs. Cole Porter and Daisy Fellowes . Symbolic: One of the brooches created by Toussaint in 1944 after the Liberation of Paris showing a freed bird made from gems in France's tricolour, left, meanwhile, this bold brooch was inspired by the Ballets Russes and illustrates Cartier's pre-Art Deco design. Made in 1913 using platinum, round old-cut diamonds, a 11.90 carat emerald, emerald cabochons and drop-shaped emeralds, natural pearls and onyx . She then had it set into a ruby and diamond necklace, which sold for a then record price of £7.1m which it was auctioned in 2011. Gems worn by another of the world's wealthiest women - Barbara Hutton, heiress to the Woolworth stores - will also be in the exhibition. Ever loyal to Cartier, she was known for her extravagant taste and frequently commissioned them to create jewellery for her. She was particularly fond of tigers and asked Toussaint to design a clip brooch and a pair of three-dimensional ear clips featuring the animal. Another of the jewellers biggest fans was Mexican actress María Félix’s. She once visited them at rue de la Paix in 1975 accompanied by a baby crocodile in an aquarium and requested that they reproduce the animal in the form of a necklace. The piece was completed a few months later and was two entwined reptiles made from gold inset with diamonds and emeralds and weighing more than 126 carats. She also commissioned Cartier to make numerous diamond inset snake necklaces and bracelets for her that she was often seen wearing wrapped around her neck and wrists. The exhibition charts Cartier's place in history to the present day with examples of jewellery worn by recent stars on the red carpet including a diamond hair piece wore by Stella McCartney to the Met Ball in 2012. It was designed more than a century earlier by Louis Cartier in 1902 and the jewellers said it is now owned by an anonymous American client. Cartier Style and History will be at the Grand Palais from 4 December 2013 - 16 February 2014.

"Breakfast cereals sold in Britain contain as much as 30 per cent more sugar than the same products in the United States. Kellogg’s Special K is sold as a healthy option for women trying to lose weight but contains 17g of sugar per 100g. That is equivalent to more than four teaspoons of white sugar and is 30 per cent more than the 13g of sugar per 100g in Special K sold  in America. Manufacturers claim that the level of sugar consumed in breakfast cereals is still low compared to what most people eat throughout the day . The British version of Cheerios, made by . Nestlé, has 21.5g of sugar per 100g, more than five times the amount of . sugar as the American version (4g per 100g). Nestlé said the British version of Cheerios more closely resembled Multi Grain Cheerios, a cereal with a similar amount of sugar which is not sold in the UK. Weetabix flagship health brand Alpen muesli was found to have 15% more sugar than the version sold in the US. The manufacturer claimed that the difference in levels of sugar was not a result of extra additives in the UK product. Weetabix said that the difference was because of 'locally sourced ingredients'. Calorie content was also found be divergent between UK and US cereals. Of the 16 brands of Kellog's cereals sold in both countries, 11 had had a higher number of calories per 100g. For example Krave, a chocolate cereal, contains 15% more calories than the same brand sold in the US. The findings come on the back of Government moves to regulate sugar content in products available to children. A recent report by the Organisation for the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that English children were the third fattest in Europe, after Italy and Greece – but almost twice as obese as the French. Almost 27% of girls in England were overweight and 23% of boys.The OECD estimated that a comprehensive anti-obesity strategy in England would cost less than £12 per person and save 70,000 lives per year. The Government has responded to the obesity problem by drafting a public health responsibility deal that will require manufacturers to meet a series of commitments. Nestle has already signed up to all commitments, including reducing calories. However, Kellog's have only committed to a reduction in salt content. All manufacturers are expect to report on their progress by next month. Chairwoman of the food network, Dr Susan Jebb, which is involved in the public health deal, said: 'I really would like the rest [of the cereal manufacturers] to be as good as the best and that is the refrain i am constantly writing to the food companies - if one company can do it then why can't you? 'This is an even better example - if your company can do it in the States why can't you do it here? It;s not that difficult.' Andy Burham the shadow health secretary, who has been calling for a sugar content cap on cereals at 30%, said: These finding will shock quite a few people. 'It seems to be that UK consumers are getting a pretty poor deal.' Kellog's claimed that despite differences in sugar levels, content was pretty low in products in both the US and the UK. A spokesperson added the manufacturer creates its products to suit different tastes and palates. 'When you look at the amounts you are talking about it's still low when you consider what people eat across the day.'","Kellogg’s Special K has 17g per 100g compared to 13g in US .

"Fantasy author George R.R. Martin, whose 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series has been turned into the hit HBO program 'Game of Thrones,' has a new book being released this week, which includes what he says are faithful renderings of the landmarks and castles fans know and love. Martin's book is 'The World of Ice & Fire: The Untold History of Westeros and the Game of Thrones,' and offers 300 pages of back story and original artwork by the some of the world's top fantasy illustrators. He agreed to the companion volume in 2006 and expected it would take just a couple of years. Naturally, it took longer. He intended to write some brief text to accompany the drawings, but ended up setting down some 300,000 words, more than enough to make his editor's 'head explode.' 'It was bigger than I anticipated,' he said during a recent telephone interview, acknowledging that 'The World of Ice & Fire' might have delayed still further the next 'Ice and Fire' novel. 'I start these things that I think won't take much time and they grow and grow.' Scroll down for video . Seat of power: George R.R. Martin recently said at a panel the Iron Throne 'towers over the room like a great beast' Scaled down: The Iron Throne used in the HBO series is not nearly as large as what Martin has imagined . Fantasy lands: Martin has said this illustration correctly shows Dragonstone, where the Targaryens once lived . Rocky: Dragonstone is noticeably less elaborate in 'Game of Thrones' Martin said 'The World of Ice & Fire' offers material already in the 'Ice and Fire' series, material he has long worked out in his mind and on paper, but had never released, and material he invented entirely for the book, such as the section dedicated to lands on the other side of the Narrow Sea. (Fans of Tyrion Lannister, be advised: Martin includes little about the character he has called his favorite. He's saving that for future books). Time spent working on 'The World of Ice & Fire' also means time spent on publicity, and on Sunday the resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico came to New York and appeared before hundreds of fans at Manhattan's 92nd Street Y. Dressed all in black - black corduroys, black shirt, and black vest set off by his white hair and beard - he was interviewed on stage by Salon.com critic Laura Miller and responded to written questions from the audience. A video of the interview was posted online. Martin was filmed saying at the panel that he had been inspired by Hadrian's Wall when imagining Castle Black at the Wall, where members of the Night's Watch defend Westeros from what lies beyond - including the White Walkers. At the edge of the world: Martin has said he was inspired by Hadrian's Wall when imagining Castle Black at the Wall, where the Night's Watch guard the edge of Westeros . As seen on TV: Kit Harington plays Jon Snow, one of the members of the Night's Watch on the HBO series . Dramatic: The Red Keep at King's Landing is seen perched on the edge of steep cliffs . Adapted: The Red Keep's design appears much taller and narrower on TV . Not yet! 'A Song of Ice and Fire' author George R.R. Martin, seen in July 2014, has not yet released the next book, 'The Winds of Winter' Speaking about the Iron Throne, Martin also said at the panel 'Nobody ever got it right. There were comic book versions, and there were versions in the card game and the board game, and there were versions on the cover [of books], and there were versions that were done for conventions. The very first.. there was a wooden one that I sat on in 1996.. but none of them were ever really right.' 'I said repeatedly the Iron Throne is huge,' he also said. 'It towers over the room like a great beast. And it's ugly; it's asymmetric. It's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacture. And you have to walk the iron steps, and when a king sits on it he's like 10 feet above everybody else in the hall so he's in this raised position looking down on everyone.' Martin was also filmed saying the Dragonstone, the former fortress of the Targaryens, 'has been a b**** because it's really a unique castle. You know some of this is very easy for me as a writer to describe, but it's not necessarily easy for the artist to draw.' Winter is coming: Large towers are seen on the top of the Stark stronghold Winterfell . The North remembers: Winterfell is a much lower structure on the hit HBO fantasy program . Martin, 66, has completed five of seven planned novels: The most recent, 'A Dance With Dragons,' came out in 2011, the same year the Emmy-winning HBO adaptation 'Game of Thrones' first aired. Martin said Sunday that one challenge is keeping track of so many characters and events spread out over thousands of pages. Like a filmmaker hiring a continuity director, he works with longtime 'Ice and Fire' experts Elio M. Garcia, Jr. and Linda Antonsson, who run the fan site http://www.westeros.org and are credited as co-authors of the new book. 'They displayed, right away, an almost obsessive knowledge of my world. In fact, I had to alter my world because of that obsessive knowledge,' Martin said in his phone interview, noting that they had caught errors in his work. A native of Bayonne, New Jersey, Martin loved comic books and writing as a kid and by high school had won an award for a superhero story. He has been publishing books since the 1970s and began his 'Ice and Fire' series in the 1990s, intending to write a trilogy. During his telephone interview with The Associated Press, Martin said some of his fondest early memories were of reading illustrated versions of 'Treasure Island' and other classics and that he wanted 'The World of Ice & Fire' to have a similar appeal. He admires the Kindle, but prefers reading on paper and thinks the new book is especially suited for its hardcover edition. 'My feeling was ""Let's make it a coffee table book and let's fill it with some great fantasy art by some of the top illustrators in the fantasy world,""' he said. 'We're at a time in publishing history where you can have you stories in many different ways. But I'm still an old fart. I love a physical book.'","Fantasy author George R.R.

The average phone user unlocks their device 63 times a day, for 2 hours 49 minutes each time - a minimum of three hours a day. And in a move that might seem counter-intuitive, a Berlin-based psychologist has developed an app to help wean us off our gadgets. Called Offtime, it limits which apps can be used to avoid distractions, or prevents people from contacting you unless in an emergency. It doesn’t limit connectivity permanently, instead, users can enable Offtime mode for any time when they need to focus, or at set times during the day. And there are various levels of customisation. For example, all calls, texts and notifications can be blocked during Offtime. Alternatively, users can pre-select so-called VIP contacts that are never blocked, and can get hold of the phone owner even when Offtime is enabled. The app can be setup to send custom replies to anyone who tries to contact them during Offtime, and will record all messages and notifications until connectivity is restored – meaning users don’t miss anything, they just delay it. By registering calls and texts, the app can also determine that if someone is trying to call repeatedly, it may be an emergency. In this case, it will let the call through even if the number isn't listed as a VIP. Elsewhere, the app either limits access to apps entirely, allows access to pre-selected apps, or just limits internet access on apps. Plus, users can track their smartphone usage, including which apps they use the most, using Offtime's built-in analytics tool. Offtime was developed by Berlin-based psychologist Alexander Steinhart, who recently commissioned the Institute of Psychology at Humboldt University to conduct a study into smartphone usage. Over two weeks, the study analysed the patterns of 49 participants with an average age of 34 years. Scroll down for video . All calls, texts and notifications can be blocked during Offtime.

This reveals daily and weekly habits (right) Offtime was developed by Berlin-based psychologist Alexander Steinhart, who recently commissioned the Institute of Psychology at Humboldt University to conduct a study into smartphone usage. Over two weeks, the study analysed the patterns of 49 participants with an average age of 34 years. During the first week of the study, ‘normal’ smartphone usage was tracked. In the second, so-called 'intervention' week, participants used Offtime for at least two hours a day. The use of Offtime boosted mental detachment from work after a week, by 8 per cent. It also led to higher work motivation; in comparison to the first week, this increased by 5 per cent among participants. During the first week of the study, ‘normal’ smartphone usage was tracked. It was found that on average, each phone was unlocked 63 times a day, typically for approximately 2 hours 49 minutes each time. Over this period, functions such as calls, SMS, messenger apps and social networks were the used the most. And, in the case of one participant, use of Whatsapp totalled 35 hours over one week, an average of 7 hours per day. In the second, so-called 'intervention' week, participants used Offtime for at least two hours a day. The use of Offtime boosted mental detachment from work after one week, on average by 8 per cent, explained the researchers. This meant they were able to shut off and not worry about work-related problems more effectively. It also led to higher work motivation. In comparison to the first week, this increased by 5 per cent among participants. ‘In addition, it appears that conscious “offtime” positively affects work, since motivation rises. Consequently, this usually leads to higher productivity,’ explained study Professor Dr. Annekatrin Hoppe. Offtime was developed by Berlin-based psychologist Alexander Steinhart, who recently commissioned the Institute of Psychology at Humboldt University to conduct a study into smartphone usage. The use of Offtime boosted mental detachment from work after a week by 8%. It also increased work motivation by 5% . ‘The app is designed to let you unplug without missing urgent matters,’ explained Mr Steinberg. ‘It lets you whitelist contacts who able to pierce through your downtime, like your spouse or children, but otherwise shuts down apps, calls, texts, and emails. ‘It can also auto-respond to incoming messages on your behalf, while maintaining a careful activity log of everything you missed while away so you can quickly catch up.’ The free app is available for Android. The developers said they are working on an iOS version.","Offtime was developed by Berlin-based psychologist Alexander Steinhart .

"A 15-year-old boy could smell his own burning flesh after he blew off his fingertips with an illegal firework which he had lit to show his girlfriend. Dylan Cosgrove panicked and put the explosive in his mouth in a desperate bid to put it out - before running to the corner of his bedroom and covering it with his hand. The blast broke his right hand in seven places and snapped two tendons, with Dylan suffering permanent damage despite four and a half hours of surgery. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Burning flesh: Dylan Cosgrove, 15, blew off his fingertips after lighting an illegal firework in his bedroom . Injuries: The blast broke his right hand in seven places and snapped two tendons, with permanent damage despite four and a half hours of surgery. Dylan said he thought he would be able to extinguish the fuse . Dylan, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, had bought the firework as one of a set of ten from a friend for just £1. He was planning to use them on Bonfire Night and decided to light one 'for a laugh' to show his girlfriend Erin Easton on October 8 - but to his horror, he was unable to extinguish the fuse. 'I quickly realised the fuse wouldn't go out and went into a blind panic and didn't know what to do,' he said. 'I even put it to my mouth to try to put it out. 'That was crazy when I think about what could have happened if it had exploded in my face, but I was desperate to stop it going off. 'I tried to put it out by blowing on it like a candle and even tried licking it to extinguish the fuse but it wouldn’t work. Foolish mistake: The schoolboy is warning other teenagers a Bonfire Night mistake could be deadly . 'I was frightened for my girlfriend and I didn't want to start a fire in my bedroom so I ran to the other side of the room to protect her from the explosion. 'I thought the only thing left to do was to put my two fingers on it to soften the blow, but the next thing I heard was a huge bang. 'I couldn’t feel anything, I think my body was running on adrenaline. I knew I had been badly hurt. 'My ears were ringing and I could smell my burning flesh.' Dylan's father Michael Stephenson, 41, heard an 'almighty bang' and screaming before his son came running down the stairs 'white as a sheet'. 'There wasn't any blood at first but it began to seep out over the floor when he sat down on the sofa,' he added. An ambulance took the schoolboy to Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where an X-ray revealed his right hand had been broken in seven places. He went through four and a half hours of surgery at the nearby Royal Victoria Infirmary and now has metal pins in several of his fingers. The tip of Dylan’s index finger had been completely blown off, leaving the bone sticking out which had to be cut away. Two of his tendons  snapped and retracted  into his arm, reducing flexibility and causing damage from which he will never fully recover. Fortunately, the schoolboy said, he is left-handed. The pupil at St Robert of Newminster Catholic school in Washington, Tyne and Wear, said he bought ten of the fireworks for £1 from a classmate. Although the packaging said they were UK approved, firefighters later told them the fireworks were illegal. Dylan's mother, 39-year-old B&Q project co-ordinator Samantha Cosgrove, said she was 'in shock' when she heard the news. 'I just stood up in the restaurant and shouted, ""my son's blown the ends of his fingers off""', she said. 'Goodness knows what people were thinking. 'He was in total shock and kept asking if he would be sent to prison. 'We would never let fireworks in the house and we know now how dangerous they can be. We destroyed the remaining ones.' Small but dangerous: Bandaged Dylan (left) and another of the ten fireworks he bought from a classmate for £1 . Dylan's mother Samantha (right) said: 'We would never let fireworks in the house and we know now how dangerous they can be'. She added: 'We never thought that he would do something like this in the house' She added: 'We trusted Dylan and we never thought that he would do something like this in the house. 'Unfortunately he has had to learn the hard way. There should definitely be tougher restrictions on how people can purchase fireworks.' The teenager agreed to make his case public to raise awareness. Area Manager Kevin Gardner, of the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'I would like to thank Dylan and his family for telling their story, to try to prevent this from happening to anyone else. 'I would urge anyone to report the sale of illegal fireworks to the police and not to buy them. 'Licensed fireworks are explosives but buying fireworks from non-reputable or licensed retailers is asking for trouble - you simply do not know what is in them or how they will react.' Dylan added: 'Everyday life is so much harder now. I'll have to get the pins removed from my fingers in a few weeks and I'll need to continue to have physiotherapy for some time. 'I wish I could turn the clock back. This moment of madness could have cost me my life and I put my girlfriend in danger too. I've been extremely lucky'.","Dylan Cosgrove panicked and put firework in his mouth to put it out .

"When a fresh-faced dancer from Sydney's Northern Beaches met a Colombian photographer in Paris, little did she know she was about to be thrown into the world of a European cocaine ring. Robyn Windshuttle was 21 years old when she travelled to the French capital to dance with world-famous cabaret troupe The Bluebell Girls and later on the Moulin Rouge. It was her first day in Paris in 1976 when she first caught a glimpse of a Colombian man - only known as Daniel - and the attraction was immediate. Ms Windshuttle has now penned a book about her 10-year relationship with Daniel, who turned out to be a drug dealer, called 'Dancing with a Cocaine Cowboy'. Robyn Windshuttle (left) was a dance for famous cabaret The Bluebell Girls when she met Daniel (right) When they first met, Daniel told Ms Windshuttle he was a photographer and because he was carrying a Nikon camera at the time, she had no reason to doubt his story otherwise. But soon the 21-year-old realised her 'glamorous life' of 'flashy cars, fur coats, diamonds and gold' was funded by profits of a Colombian drug syndicate operating in Paris with the help of her new lover. During her long-term relationship with Daniel, Ms Windshuttle said she had witnessed a number of drug raids. It was Daniel who introduced her to cocaine - but Ms Windshuttle said she was never an addict. Two years after meeting Daniel, she gave birth to Danielito (pictured with Ms Windshuttle and her former Colombian lover) The 59-year-old now lives in Forster on the coast of New South Wales . 'It's a bit like having a glass of wine at night. You'd do a bit of cocaine at night,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Despite popular opinion, Ms Windshuttle said the cocaine scene was never a 'sleazy' one. 'I don't actually know the full details [of the operation] and he never told me what was going on,' she said. 'Colombia's gross domestic product was cocaine...and cocaine was a drug for the elite and there was money to be made. 'It's a party drug and people who were high-profile lawyers were the kind of people who did cocaine.' Most of the expat dancers rented accommodation close to Le Moulin in impossibly tiny studios . that cost the earth. There were a couple of sisters from New Zealand, some Australians and lots . of British girls and boys. We’d catch up and chat about our lives and swap the latest gossip in . between costume changes or waiting in the wings: who was sleeping with whom; who was going . to be axed; what work was in the wind. But I rarely socialised with my dance friends outside of . work because Daniel was the focus of my life. Of an evening he’d zoom me to work in his flashy . BMW then usually meet me after the show for a late supper before we headed off into the night. There was always a party somewhere and new friends, a trendier club, a fancier restaurant. Wherever there was cocaine there were the wealthy, the chic, the artistic, the models, and Daniel . was at the centre, vibrant, charming, engaging. Usually it would be close to dawn before we finally . slid into bed, aroused by the charge of cocaine. Our desire for each other was insatiable, our . erotic play steamy, lascivious and sensual. Lustful pleasure and intimacy consumed us. I savoured the subdued times too; usually when we had outdone ourselves in the night scene . we’d restore our souls with a quiet stroll along the Seine, a movie or a wander up narrow . laneways into obscure book stores, galleries and gardens. The Bee Gees’ new album Saturday . Night Fever was playing in all the nightclubs and we couldn’t get enough of it. ‘How Deep is Your . Love?’ still resonates with me 30-odd years later, as does the Bellamy Brothers’ ‘Let Your Love . Flow’. Occasionally I’ll hear them play and am immediately transported back to the time . when Daniel and I were immersed in a blazing romance. Ms Windshuttle said she adapted well to her new lifestyle because she was 'really in love' with Daniel and - growing up on Sydney's Northern Beaches - she was accustomed to the drug scene. 'You would see people smoke drugs and they still do,' she said. 'People were growing pot at the back of high school and growing bushy weeds in greenhouses in Warriewood. 'So I wasn't frightened of being surrounding people doing drugs. We were hippies smoking dope. 'I was optimistic and I didn't think anything bad was ever going to happen.' Ms Windshuttle said she still keeps in contact with Daniel despite their relationship ending 30 years ago . Two years after she met Daniel, Ms Windshuttle gave birth to her first child, Danielito, who she says is evidence of the love she shared with the Colombian drug dealer. But soon the bliss of a child soured as Daniel's infidelity started eating away at their relationship. 'Daniel was a bit of a Lothario. I had doubts about his fidelity,' Ms Windshuttle said. 'His dalliances became unbridled infidelity, and I tried to ignore it for a long time.' Ms Windshuttle's only other solace - apart from her son - was dancing. During her decade-long relationship with Daniel, her career as a dancer also took off and took her to Hong Kong, the UK, Amsterdam, Milan, Ibiza and Monte Carlo. The tall and blonde stunner also did a stint at the world-famous cabaret house, Moulin Rouge, in Paris. 'It was fabulous. There were full houses every night,' Ms Windshuttle said. 'There were feathers and diamantes. It was a very glamorous show and it was one of the most prestigious shows. 'It wasn't until later when I grew up, I realised that I had accomplished a lot and had such success. I was very proud.' Ms Windshuttle had been a dancer since she was six years old and danced for the Moulin Rouge . Finally the instability of her lifestyle and Daniel's indiscretions led Ms Windshuttle to take back control of her life. At 28, she and her son moved back to Australia and settled in Mosman, but Daniel soon followed. 'For the next three years, I would visit him in Europe and he continued to provide for us,' she said. 'Then when he was deported from Australia [for drug-related offences] that was the end of the relationship.' Ms Windshuttle, who is now 59 and lives in Forster on coastal New South Wales, said she still kept in touch with Daniel - in his 70s - who lives in Colombia. 'It's hard not to stay connected. We remain connected in a bizarre way,' she said. 'The ties have never really been cut even though we've lived separate lives for 30 years.' Dancing with a Cocaine Cowboy is published by Allen & Unwin and is now available online.","Robyn Windshuttle was a dancer from Sydney's Northern Beaches .

Hernandez, 24, is seen lounging on a couch in his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, home, and playing with his baby daughter, as multiple authorities search his property back in June of 2013. The search was to recover evidence as it pertained to the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée at the time of his death. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Aaron Hernandez (above) seemed in good spirits while in court today, smiling and laughing during his murder trial . Relaxed: Hernandez (above in white) is seen laying on the couch and relaxing as he is surrounded by authorities . Hernandez has been accused of his murder, for which he has entered a plea of not guilty. Now, Hernandez's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court. A cell phone turned over by Hernandez that shows he had been in contact with Lloyd, and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died, was obtained by the prosecution under a 'false claim of legal authority' the defense is arguing. Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleboro and killing him. According to CBS Boston, the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone. Judge Susan Garsh said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence.

"Award winner: Chef Gary Usher roasted a 'nasty' Trip Advisor reviewer who called a visit to his Hoole restaurant 'the worst day of my life' An award-winning chef has barred a diner who left a review on TripAdvisor claiming he had tried to ‘give her cancer’ with a chargrilled dish. Gary Usher trained at Michelin-starred Chez Bruce and has just won the AA restaurant of the year for England for his bistro Sticky Walnut in Hoole, Chester. So when he got a bad review from a mother and daughter on Trip Advisor, branding the evening the ‘worst day of her life’, his first reaction was to bite back. Not only did he respond on Trip Advisor, but he posted the review on Twitter, where there was a backlash against the couple - mocking their complaint littered with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. ‘A nasty lady came for dinner at sticky,’ Mr Usher wrote. ‘When the nasty lady got home, she was really mad. So she wrote us a love note.’ His former boss, Bruce Poole immediately backed him: ‘Sounds like she ain’t ever coming back,’ he tweeted. ‘What you call a win-win situation!’ Other diners weighed in: ‘Worst day of her life?’ one wrote. ‘Has she never had a loved one or pet die? A tad over-dramatic I think!’ ‘This is just brilliant. I really want to come down and sample such an appalling place,’ magician John Holt added. The row began when daughter calling herself Elana took her mother, who goes by the Trip Advisor screenname Annushkachi, to the restaurant, in Hoole, Chester, which opened three years ago, for a celebration. ‘Worst day of my life!,’ Annushkachi wrote on Monday on Trip Advisor, criticizing the ‘very bad design’ ‘horrible attitude’ and ‘cheap furniture’. ‘The manager, middle-aged woman was very rude to us,’ she added. ‘I had an half an hour argument with the waitress and then the manage (sic). Just awful, very disappointed with cheap rubbish food. ‘Any cheap caffe is much better than this restaurant. I DON’T recommend and will NOT in a million years come there again.’ The following day her daughter Elena, added her own review on the website. ‘My mother is a lover and conosur (sic) of fine dining,’ she wrote, ‘having dined for many years in some of the worlds finest restaurants all over the world. ‘My mum was not happy with the meal that arrived as the sauce was not to her taste and the lamb did not appear to be grilled as it says in the menu. ‘One would assume that like in any other restaurant and even in the simplest of Whitcheaf pubs, you would be offered an exchange. However instead she had received a whole load of abuse from the waiting staff especially the female manager. ‘I can honestly say that I have never felt so uncomfortable in my whole life and the way that my mother was being rediculed (sic) is simply disgusting. ‘To top off the reuined (sic) evening and minus the hard earned cash, instead of an apology to my mum, I receive a voicemail from Emma the manager who wasn’t there on the evening, arrogantly telling ME not to ever come back again! ‘Because my mother have left a bad review on a trip advisor and ‘apparently’ this means that therefore I’m now also banned. ‘Avoid this place like the plague guys. So many other wonderful, funkier, excellent hidden gems in Chester that are a lot more value for money and where you will be valued and treated with love and respect.’ Unassuming: Yet the Sticky Walnut has just won the AA restaurant of the year award for England . However the award-winning chef was not contrite. ‘Your behavior on the night is just so very rude that it does not warrant a response,’ he wrote to Annushkachi. ‘As much as we all enjoyed your racial and verbal abuse on the night we would like to see your million and raise you a cool billion.’ He was even more vocal in his reply to Elena. ‘Your mother, being a “conosur”, ordered the chargrilled lamb rump on your recommendation, he said, mocking her for her spelling mistake, ‘although she had said at the table that she wanted a well-done steak. ‘You told her that the lamb would taste like steak (of course it would - don’t all “conosurs” know that?). Your mother didn’t like the chargrilled aspect of the chargrilled lamb and proceeded (this is a first for us by the way) to accuse Nat of trying to give her cancer. ‘When your mother started to raise her voice and rudely interrupt other lamb eating guests, Nat simply went to get the manager for help. Jess then tried to calm the situation. However, your mother had a different agenda. ‘Your mother poked at a “cancer causing” carrot and launched it in Jess’s direction. This was after Jess had offered a different meal. Jess had tried to talk to your mother to resolve the “problem” but your mother refused to make eye contact and then started to mention cultural differences saying that the two English girls needed to read more. ‘Jess politely asked your mother to stop speaking in that way. “The customer is always right” you say and yes, in most cases this is a fantastic attitude for the service industry to practice but when we receive verbal or physical abuse the customer is most certainly not right.’","Angry chef Gary Usher blasts reviewers on Trip Advisor and Twitter .

"A man who was recorded confessing to the killings of two Chinese graduate students near the University of Southern California was convicted Monday of first-degree murder. Javier Bolden, 22, was found guilty of shooting Ming Qu and Ying Wu as they sat in a double-parked car about a mile from campus on April 11, 2012. The killings drew international interest and fueled concerns in China about the safety of students abroad. The crime spurred USC to provide more protection around campus. Guilty: Javier Bolden, 22, was found guilty Monday in the April 11, 2012 murders of University of Southern California international students Ming Qu and Ying Wu. Bolden pictured in court on Monday, reacting to the decision . Victims: Ming Qu, left, and Ying Wu, right, were a couple and planned to get married, her father said in court on Monday . Parents of the students have filed a lawsuit accusing USC of misrepresenting security at the campus, where nearly one-fifth of the 38,000 students are from overseas, including 2,500 from China. USC says it has more international students than any other U.S. university. Concerns surfaced again this summer when another Chinese student was killed. The murder charges against Bolden carry special circumstances but prosecutors didn't seek the death penalty, so he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole when he is sentenced on Nov. 17. Bolden, who was in a white shirt, vest and glasses, showed no emotion. His mother, seated in a front row of the courtroom, doubled over in her seat and sobbed. He also was convicted of attempted murder and assault with a firearm in separate shootings that occurred months earlier that wounded two men and a woman. Authorities said Bolden told a cellmate that he shot the 23-year-old engineering students. The cellmate was a police informant and secretly recorded Bolden discussing how he and a friend had planned to steal the couple's BMW. Defense attorney Andrew Goldman said his client lied to the informant to appear tough. In February, Bolden's friend, Bryan Barnes, who also shot into the locked car, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. Smirk: Bolden was pegged with the murder after his cell mate recorded a jail confession. Bolden allegedly told his cell mate that he killed the couple in an attempt to steal their car. Bolden pictured above in court on Monday . Relaxed: USC's campus is located about a mile away from gang-plagued neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Bolden pictured above in court on Monday . Fathers of the two victims came from China to speak at the Barnes sentencing, saying their son and daughter were in love and had planned to be married. XiYong, father of Ying Wu, said her killing 'shattered the dream and hope of our entire family into pieces and pushed us into the abyss of endless pain.' Concerns about the safety of Chinese students at USC surfaced again this summer when four teens were charged with murder in the beating death of a University of Southern California graduate student with a baseball bat and wrench as he walked to his off-campus apartment after meeting with a study group. Two of the suspects were juveniles charged as adults in the slaying of Xinran Ji, 24, an engineering student from China. He was able to make his way to his apartment despite being hit in the head with the bat. A roommate discovered him dead hours later. USC's urban campus is within a mile of gang-plagued neighborhoods with historically high crime rates. Since the 2012 killings of Qu and Wu, USC has added 60 security cameras, including some license plate readers, for a total of 178 cameras in a 1.8 square mile area that includes blocks off campus, according to USC Department of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle. The university also deploys private security officers in the adjacent neighborhoods. In addition, the Los Angeles Police Department has assigned about 30 more officers to the university community since 2012. Changes: The school has since installed more security cameras, including some license plate readers. Above USC prsident C.L.

"Last month scientists spotted mysterious jets of water vapour spurting from the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. And now Rosetta has again spotted jets in new images - but their origin and formation still isn’t entirely obvious. It’s known that as the comet approaches the sun its surface will met, expelling vapour into space, but why the vapour is appearing as jets from only certain points on the surface is unclear. This amazing new image reveals more jets of water vapour on Comet 67P (shown). The latest mosaic of the jets was created by stitching together images from Rosetta. Emily Lakdawalla of The Planetary Society first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery . In a blog post Esa Space Science Editor Dr Emily Baldwin explains that the four images are a montage taken on 26 September from a distance of 16.3 miles (26.3km) from the comet’s centre. 'What we’re seeing is the product of ices sublimating and gases escaping from inside the comet, carrying streams of dust out into space,’ she writes. ‘Zooming in close to the surface and to the source of this activity and it is apparent that it is originating from several discrete locations.’ In the image the jets can be seen travelling into space from the comet. The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 12 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae . will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws . and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once . the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the . landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has . landed. The . initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing . the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface . temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. They are centered on one location, the middle of the comet, with no other part of the comet seeming to have such jets. This may suggest that, as the comet has orbited the sun many times before, much of its ice may have already melted. This would mean that only small pockets of ice melt and produce vapour in this way as it approaches - which could explain the formation of specific jets. As the comet approaches the sun it will become more active, and scientists will be hoping for more opportunities to view features like these. Dr Baldwin explains: ‘As the comet gets progressively closer to the sun along its orbit, the surface will become warmer, and the level of activity will increase, producing a vast coma around the nucleus, along with a tail. ‘It’s perhaps hard to believe looking at images like this at less than 30km [18.6 miles] distance from the surface, but recent gound-based images have revealed that 67P/C-G’s coma already extends at least 19,000km [11,800 miles] from the nucleus!’ In other Rosetta news digital imaging professor Mattias Malmer created a 3D model of the comet’s surface, reports Dr Emily Lakdawalla from The Planetary Society. His montage, using data from Rosetta’s Navcam, shows the comet as seen on 24 September 2014. He explains that the views were made by projecting images of the comet over a digital model. This 3D model of the comet's surface was created by digital imaging professor Mattias Malmer. Using data from Rosetta's Navcam, it shows the comet as seen on 24 September . As soon as Rosetta entered orbit around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August, engineers rushed to find a landing site for its Philae lander - which they have now done. This is because as the comet nears the sun it will become more active, with more potentially hazardous vapour and debris released. And that activity was first revealed in images last month showing how the comet is indeed giving off water vapour as jets. Drag the slider in the image below to reveal the plume . Jets of water vapour have been spotted in images of Rosetta's comet target. The material is being shot into space, but it's unclear why it appears as 'jets'. Emily Lakdawalla of The Planetary Society spotted the jets by brighting photos from Rosetta (move the slider above to see the 'before' and 'after' effect) The jets of water vapour were initially spotted by Dr Lakdwalla last month. By increasing the contrast on available shots of the comet, she revealed previously hidden jets of water vapour spewing outwards. And scientists will be hoping to study these jets in more detail as the comet approaches the sun, and possibly work out exactly how they form and what they’re made of. ‘The challenge with Rosetta's images of the comet is that until quite recently, most of them were taken with the sun nearly behind the spacecraft,’ Dr Lakdawalla told MailOnline. ‘That lights up the comet's surface very brightly compared to the much fainter comet jets. ‘But the jets are there; all you have to do is brighten the image to reveal them, an operation anyone can do with the most basic photo editing software. ‘The work I did was to combine a brightened image of the jets with an unbrightened image of the comet, so it's an artistic enhancement of the original image. ‘It's much like a film photographer would dodge a photo to brighten some areas compared to others. ‘I also cleaned up some distracting specks and cosmic ray hits, which make white marks on the original photos.’ As Rosetta spends more time on the night side of the comet Dr Lakdawalla says it will be easier to spot jets coming off the comet as the surface will not be so bright. She continues: 'Every day brings the comet closer to the sun and makes it more active. 'That will be exciting to watch, but it presents a challenge for Rosetta. 'The jets and the gas around the comet will influence Rosetta's path in unpredictable ways, making it hard for them to steer precisely, which will make it hard for them to place Philae where they want to put it on the surface. 'That is one reason they're in such a hurry to select a landing site and land Philae - it will get harder to achieve as the comet gets more active.' As the comet (seen in this 'selfie' with Rosetta) approaches the sun it will become more active. Ice remaining on the surface will melt, surrounding the comet in gas. For this reason engineers want to perform the planned landing of the Philae lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present . In November the Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to 67P. If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace. The lander will drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to an onboard laboratory for analysis . Earlier this week scientists picked landing site 'J', shown, as the location where the Philae lander will touch down. ite J offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites, and is also scientifically interesting, with signs of activity nearby . In addition, while the jets are mostly made of water vapour, Rosetta’s Miro (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) instrument has also spotted expected signs of ammonia and methanol in the jets - although a lack of carbon monoxide has been a surprise. They are also thought to carry ice crystals and dust specks with them from the surface. One thing that is not known however is why the jets are actually appearing as ‘jets’. As a comet nears the sun its surface sublimates, which means the solid ice turns to gas, creating a ‘coma’ of material around the comet. Why Rosetta’s comet is only spewing material at specific points in jets, rather than across the whole surface, remains a mystery. 'That is one of the as yet unanswered questions about comets that Rosetta's scientific data will hopefully address,' added Dr Lakdawalla. ‘One thing to remember is that short-period comets like 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have been baked by the sun for a long time so their surfaces are not covered with ice but rather with very dark dust. ‘It looks bright in Rosetta pictures only because we're looking at a dark object against even darker space, and the camera's exposure settings have been adjusted accordingly - try taking a digital photo of a charcoal briquet against an asphalt-covered street and see how bright the auto-exposure on your camera makes the charcoal appear! ‘The ice we see coming out of it is being released from the interior, through fissures or craters. But how this process works isn't understood, yet. ‘By orbiting a comet for many months and watching it become more active, Rosetta is the first mission that has a chance of answering these questions.’ Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment .","New images have revealed more jets of water vapour on Comet 67P .
They were revealed in a blog post for Esa, headquartered in Paris .
The latest mosaic of the jets was created using images from Rosetta .
Dr Emily Lakdawalla of The Planetary Society first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery .
It's known that as the comet approaches the sun the ice on its surface will melt - but why this creates jets is unknown .
As the comet approaches the sun it will become more active .
Ice remaining on the surface will melt, surrounding the comet in gas .
For this reason engineers want to perform the landing of the Philae lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present .
This could be hazardous to any landing attempt - although the vapour will be of key scientific interest to Rosetta throughout its mission .

"There has been a security scare at an AFL training ground in Melbourne after three razor blades were found on the field ahead of Hawthorn's final session before the  grand final. The open razor blades were located by security staff as they combed the field at Waverly Park in Melbourne's south east before the Hawks players kicked off their training session on Thursday. Forty staff members were forced to sweep the grounds for more blades just minutes before training was scheduled to start. Scroll down for video . Hawthorn Hawks player Grant Birchall runs out during a training session at Waverley Park in Melbourne's south east on Thursday after security found razor blades on the ground . The Hawks believe the blades were deliberately planted and could have caused serious damage to a player or fans if they came in contact with the blade . The Hawks believe the blades were deliberately planted and could have caused serious damage to a player if he came in contact with the blade, Nine News reports. Thousands of fans, many of which were children,  took to the field following the open session and potentially could have been injured by the razors too. Hawthorn chief executive, Stuart Fox, told the Herald Sun  he was deeply concerned but had ensured no players were in danger when training resumed. 'We can confirm there were some razor blades found and we took immediate action and scoured the ground before the players went out,' he told the newspaper. 'We are fortunate that no one was hurt and disappointed that someone would go to that extreme and put our players in jeopardy.' Hawks player Cyril Rioli, who may be recalled from injury to play in Saturday's grand final, was a crowd favourite . A stream of yellow and brown filled the Hawks' training ground as eager fans turned up to support their team . A Hawthorn star in the making? A mini fan ran around as the Hawks trained on Thursday . Hawthorn player Matthew Spangher was kicking goals at training ahead of Saturday's grand final . The club said they decided not to involve police. The training ground at Waverley Park  is open to the public so Hawthorn cannot prohibit fans and spectators from entering. The thousands of fans who turned up to watch the Hawks run through some light match practice were reportedly not aware of security scouring the grounds. Thursday's training was the final session ahead of the AFL grand final on Saturday against inter-city rivals, the Sydney Swans, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The Swans kept it low-key on Thursday, running through a closed session at their home ground the Sydney Cricket Ground before flying south. Swans fans thronged to an open training session on Tuesday. Sydney Swans opted for a closed session for their final traning run at their home ground before flying to Melbourne . Hawks midfielder Jordan Lewis said that if fans were planning to boo former player Lance  Franklin, they should think again, according to the ABC. Franklin, a dual premiership star at Hawthorn, quit the club last year to join the Sydney Swans and will now face off against his former team mates on Saturday. 'I'm against that side of the game,' Lewis said at Hawthorn's training session. 'Everyone who comes to the game has their own intentions. We can't stop it. We're not in a position to stop it. 'But you would think a guy who has given us nine years of good service, you'd think there'd be some sort of respect there and not boo him the way we've heard they're going to boo him. 'But I think that spurs him on, he loves the big occasion. He loves proving people wrong and if we go along that path, we might poke the bear.'

"Sarah Palin is trading in the personal drama for political drama today as she was pictured with her makeup and wedding ring back on while stumping for U.S. Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas. In her first public appearance since she was spotted running errands bare-faced with nothing on her ring finger, the former Republican Vice Presidential candidate was all smiles with perfectly applied makeup. Her return to the campaign trail - a mainstay of Palin's career since losing the 2008 presidential election and stepping down as Governor of Alaska in 2009 - comes at a turbulent time in her public life. Back on the campaign trail: Sarah Palin was wearing her wedding ring again today as she stumped for Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas . Palin's wedding ring was clearly visible in picture taken from the event . She and her family have been forced to deny reports that she and husband Todd are divorcing after 26 years. Palin and her family were also involved in a drunken brawl at a party in Anchorage, Alaska, two weeks ago with started over her daughter Willow's ex-boyfriend. Her son Track was left with four broken ribs, Todd had a bloody nose and the police showed up - though no charges were filed. In Kansas on Thursday, Palin alleged that Roberts' independent opponent is trying to 'snooker' voters in what has become a surprisingly close race. She donned an apron and flipped pancakes alongside the GOP incumbent, once considered a near lock for re-election but now facing a tough battle from independent businessman Greg Orman after the Democratic candidate withdrew. 'Kansas, we are counting on you to get it together,' Palin told the crowd of about 250 people attending the pancake breakfast at the Independence Historical Museum and Art Center in the southeastern part of the state. Earlier this week Palin came out in defense of her daughter Bristol who allegedly punched a man in the face during a family brawl. The former Vice President candidate hailed her child as a 'straight shooter' in a Facebook which appears to be her first veiled reference to the fight two weekends ago. The 23-year-old is said to have repeatedly hit the owner of a home in Anchorage, Alaska, during an outburst in which her brother Track broke four ribs and her father Todd was left with a bloody nose. No make-up Monday: Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was pictured running errands in Anchorage, Alaska last week with no makeup and no wedding ring . First response: This Facebook post appears to be Sarah Palin's first veiled reaction to the family brawl . Straight shooter: Palin shared pictures of her daughter firing a shotgun and linked to an article by Bristol . 'I have to say this as a proud mama: right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate, my kids' defense of family makes my heart soar! 'As you can imagine, they and my extended family have experienced so many things (liberal media-driven) that may have crushed others without a strong foundation of faith, and I'm thankful for our friends' prayer shield that surrounds them, allowing faith to remain their anchor. 'Thank you, prayer warriors! I love you!' The post was accompanied by pictures of Bristol firing a shotgun, other family photos. She also linked to an article by Bristol condemning reports that suggest Todd and Sarah Palin are getting divorced. Bristol's post, topped with a picture of her father kissing her mother, blasted the reports as 'garbage'. The comments are the first from the family following widespread media attention to the fight on September 6. On Monday, Sarah Palin emerged for the first time following the melee as she was photographed sweaty and make-up free running errands around Anchorage, Alaska. Bristol Palin (pictured right) and little sister Piper (left) hit Costco in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday to stock up on groceries including bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, yogurt, whipped cream and apple sauce. The Palin family were recently caught up in a reported disturbance at a house party in Anchorage . The fight which allegedly broke out at a house party most of the Palin family was attending came as daughter Willow's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in some unspecified 'questionable behavior'. RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him'. That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th birthday that night, although it was not his party- became involved. Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America: 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, 'You know who we are, don't you?'' But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!' Her son Track served with the U.S. Army in the Iraq War. According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose. The former vice presidential candidate has yet to publicly comment on the brawl. On Monday, she left a shopping mall dressed casually, and without wearing her wedding ring. Exes: The fight allegedly broke out when Willow Palin's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary (pictured) tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in 'questionable behavior' Her daughters Bristol, 23, and 13-year-old Piper were also spotted out and about on Monday in Anchorage, stocking up on food supplies at a CostCo. The two sisters looked serious as they pushed a cart into the parking lot, filled to the brim with bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, apple sauce, yogurt and whipped cream. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.' But the source said that Bristol is left-handed. One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend. The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. 'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence. 'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. 'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.' Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office. It had been reported that the drunken brawl started when the Palin pack allegedly had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20 (pictured to the left of her mother, in a blue dress). The Palins are pictured in 2007 . Sarah Palin has claimed that she owes the United States a 'global apology' for the 2008 Republican presidential ticket's loss to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Mrs Palin, who ran for vice-president on John McCain's ticket, spoke about Obama's long-term strategy for defeating ISIS, which he laid out in a speech on Wednesday night. 'As I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is, I owe America a global apology,' she said. 'Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.' She added: 'It's not just a vision that's so obvious. It's an articulated mission that they're on, and that is the caliphate. That is a takeover of the region. And guess what? We're next on the hit list.' The former Alaskan governor compared ISIS to Hitler and questioned how seriously Obama is taking the threat. She said: 'So when Barack Obama, like the rest of us, hear these bad guys, these terrorists, promising that they will raise the flag of Allah over our White House, for the life of me I don't know why he does not take this serious, the threat. Because yes, it's more than a vision. 'They're telling - just like Hitler did all those years ago, when a war could've been avoided, because Hitler, too, did not hide his intentions. Well, ISIS, these guys aren't hiding their intentions either.'","The former VP candidate has spoken for first time since family fight .

"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has told how he is determined to fight for his life after being hospitalised with a 'deteriorating' condition. The 83-year-old statesman did not disclose the exact details of his illness but is known to suffer from an acute form of diabetes, for which he has previously sought treatment in Germany. However, Gorbachev, who is credited with bringing openness and reform to the Soviet Union - leading ultimately to its downfall - did not say where he is currently hospitalised. Illness: Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev said he is 'fighting for his life' as he battles a 'deteriorating' condition in hospital . He said: 'In the last seven days my condition was more or less well, but today I am in hospital. 'There has been a deterioration. I am lying under monitors, wires all over me.' He stressed: 'You know my character. It's focused on fighting, on life.' Gorbachev was president of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991 and is widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War. During his years in the Kremlin, he forged closer ties with the West, building relationships with both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The Nobel Peace laureate expressed annoyance that he could not follow this week's Nobel awards properly due to his illness. Last month he warned Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama not to let their mutual animosity deepen the current crisis over Ukraine. Breakthrough: Gorbachev pictured with then US President Ronald Reagan in 1987. He served as President of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991 and is widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War . Mikhail Gorbachev with Baroness Margaret Thatcher. She famously said of him: 'I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together' 'It is spoken that the current radicalisation is mainly a result of the personal relations between presidents Putin and Obama which are 'not shaping well',' said Gorbachev at the time. 'To me such a way of thinking is a huge mistake. 'We do not choose our partners and if our relations do not 'shape', we have a duty as leaders, a responsibility for our citizens and the whole world, and we should step over personal matters and stand for the interests of our nations.' He warned that 'for the sake of peace in Ukraine, in Europe and in the whole world, it is essential to resume the dialogue between Russia and the USA.' This was 'their role and responsibility' and they must set aside differences and start talking. 'It is inevitable if we do not want to kill the world where all of us now live. ' Mr Gorvachev's wife Raisa, who he married in 1953, died in 1999 from leukaemia. Loggerheads: Mr Gorbachev has been openly critical of current Russian leader Vladimir Putin . Mikhail Gorbachev took over the Kremlin in 1985 and began the process of economic and political reforms which ingrained the terms perestroika and glasnost on the western consciousness. In 1984 the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said of him: 'I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together'. He stepped down on Christmas Day 1991 handing over control to Boris Yeltsin and declaring the office of President of the Soviet Union dead. The Soviet Union was formally dissolved the following day. Popular in the West for the role he played in ending the Cold War, Gorbachev is disliked by many at home for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the years of turmoil that followed it. Gorbachev was intially supportive of current Russian leader Vladmir Putin praising him for bringing stability and economic reform to the country. But in recent years he has become openly critical of Putin's policies, warning that the lack of political competition, flawed elections and rampant corruption have stymied Russia's development. Earlier this year a group of Russian MPs made an extraordinary bid to have Gorbachev prosecuted for the 'illegal' collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. One MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party even branded 83-year-old Gorbachev a 'US spy' for the break-up of the Communist state 23 years ago. Gorbachev called the MPs' move 'sheer stupidity', adding: 'These people just do not have shame.'","Former Soviet leader, 83, did not give exact details of his condition .

"Trendsetter: The Queen carries her Launer bag as she opens the Royal London Hospital building this year . Move over, Kate. There’s a new fashion queen in the Windsor family. Her identity? Well … the clue is in the title. Sales of Launer handbags, the Queen’s favourite brand, have risen by 52 per cent in the last year. The . firm says the increase is down to her recent willingness to experiment . with different styles and colours of her trademark boxy bag. The . sales boom echoes the so-called ‘Kate effect’ – anything the Duchess of . Cambridge is seen wearing usually flies off the shelves in minutes. Launer’s . owner Gerald Bodmer said: ‘What is lovely is that people are thinking . of her as a fashion icon rather than an elderly person. The fact is that . she does carry stuff that other people want.’ Although the Queen usually opts for a simple black patent model, in the last year she has chosen a variety of different colours. It is these colourful designs which have proved hugely popular with customers. Mr . Bodmer told The Sunday Times: ‘We are very lucky. She is really loyal . to us and loyal to British merchandise. 'I get a colossal buzz every time . we see a picture of the Queen with one of our handbags. We couldn’t . have a better advert. It’s wonderful. ‘She is partly the reason we’re still here. Having a Royal Warrant makes a big difference to a firm like us.’ The Queen owns around 40 Launer bags, which she has used since the 1960s. Fit for a Queen: Launer, the company behind the monarch's bags, recorded a 52 per cent rise in sales last year . Favourite: The Queen during an engagement in Lewes and leaving the National Theatre with her Launer bag . Her bespoke bags always come with a mirror, a matching purse and a glasses case. Her handbags have a slightly longer handle so they don’t get caught up in her clothes when she is greeting people. She is also said to dislike shoulder straps, zips and partitions. A Launer handbag costs between £435 and £6,000. In June, Launer revealed that the Queen uses her handbag to signal to her ladies-in-waiting when she wants to leave a function. Mr Bodmer said she placed the bag on the table to provide them with a five-minute warning. The Queen’s bespoke bags always come with a mirror, a matching purse and a glasses case, he said.

"For hotel cities looking to expand, space is always a problem. However, one resort in Austria got around that issue but lifting its new penthouse onto its roof with a crane. The LoftCube room, which weighs 12 tonnes, sits 65ft in the air on top of Hotel Daniel, in the southern city of Graz. Up and away! The 12-tonne all-glass cube suite was lifted onto the roof of the hotel with a crane . High life: At the Hotel Daniel in Graz, Austria, the top floor has been given a radical makeover in the form of a new suite . Boasting glass walls on every side, the 44-square metre room - which costs £300 a night - has also been placed on stilts to add a feeling of 'floating in air' to those renting it. And it affords guests stunning 360-degree views across Arnold Schwarzenegger's hometown in Styria, a province in the south of the country - including of the city's Unesco heritage sites Schlossberg and Schloss Eggenberg. The cube accommodation was winched into place using a massive crane capable of lifting it more than 65ft to get it onto the roof. The 44-square metre room has also been put on stilts to give the illusion of 'floating in air' To reach the roof, the cube suite had to be lifted over 20 metres into the air by a crane . The luxurious suite also boasts a specially-made bed, designer furniture, and a home cinema . It meant that, during construction, the hotel operators did not need to close for disruptions. Conceputalised by Berlin-based architect and designer Werner Aisslinger, the room also features a specially made extra-large double bed, designer furniture, a rainfall shower fitted with plants to simulate a jungle, a home cinema, and, of course, blinds for extra privacy.

"An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' above the British Isles. The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before an amateur astronomer in East Yorkshire managed to take the photographic first. Richard Kacerek, 33, spotted the . sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull - and has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image. An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' (pictured) above the British Isles. The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before . Sprites are shards of light caused by large-scale electrical discharges that take place high above thunderstorm clouds. They cause a varied range of visual shapes in the night sky but have never been recorded before in the UK. Mr Kacerek spotted the sprite on Tuesday night from a camera set up in Hull. He said: 'Astronomy is my hobby, I am not a scientist so I am delighted to have captured the sprite, it was such an interesting event. 'They are a fascinating phenomena as they happen in the atmosphere above the storm clouds. 'They are relatively unknown and it looked a little special so I sent it to Dr Martin Fullekrug at Bath University and he said it was the first spotted over the UK. 'I think luck had a lot to do with it.' Mr Kacerek spotted . the sprite on a camera that is part of the UK Meteor Observing Network, . which amateur stargazers can use to observe space. Richard Kacerek spotted the sprite, caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull. His photograph has sparked excitement in the scientific community . Dr Fullekrug, an expert in the electrodynamic properties of the atmosphere at the University of Bath, has carried out a number of studies on sprites. He said: 'This particular sprite is a rare example of sprites that can occur over the North Sea. 'The lightning flash inside the thunderstorm, which caused the sprite above the cloud was also unique.' The UK Met Office recorded the thunderstorm using the ATDnet lightning detection network, which is ordinarily used for real-time forecasts of flash floods, hail, and wind gusts often associated with thunderstorms. Graeme Anderson, foundation scientist for the UK Met Office, said: 'The ATDnet lightning location system operated by the Met Office picked up widespread and particularly intense storms across the UK during Tuesday 23 July. 'The storms detected in the region near Hull developed around the wash before moving northwards, but were of only moderate intensity and were small compared with some other storms that occurred on that day in other areas.' The first colour image of a sprite was captured as part of  a 1994 NASA/University of Alaska aircraft campaign to study the rare lightning strikes. The red color was found to be from nitrogen fluorescent emissions excited by a lightning stroke in the underlying thunderstorm . Alec Bennett, who develops lightning detectors for BIRAL, a Bristol-based company, predicted sprites would occur during thunderstorms approaching the UK from the Atlantic with his electrical sensors. He said Mr Kacerek was very fortunate to catch this extremely rare phenomenon on camera. Dr Fullekrug said: 'Citizen scientists can play a major role in unravelling the mysteries of lightning into space. 'It is well known that upward lightning is a necessary condition to initiate lightning into space, but upward lightning alone is not sufficient. 'There are yet unknown factors which will be investigated in more detail during two upcoming space missions due to be carried out by the French and European Space Agency in 2015. 'Citizen scientists can make a major contribution by reporting sprite occurrence times.' Sprites are shards of light are caused by large-scale electrical discharges which take place high above thunderstorm clouds (pictured). They cause a varied range of visual shapes in the night sky but had never been recorded before in the UK .","Sprites - shards of light caused by large electrical discharges high above thunderstorm clouds - have never before been recorded in the UK .

"A blanket of early-morning fog and mist cleared to make way for beautiful scenes across the UK today, as a giant weather front which is stretching across the entire Atlantic was poised to bring more heavy showers and gusty winds over the weekend. The effects of the low pressure system, which is currently sitting to the west of Britain in the middle of the Atlantic, will load the UK with unsettled weather for the next five days, including thundery showers, strong winds - and unseasonably warm temperatures. Forecasters have also warned that Hurricane Gonzalo - the strongest Atlantic storm in three years which is due to hit Bermuda on Friday - could potentially pummel across to the UK on Monday night, bringing 50mph gales and heavy downpours. Tranquil: Swans posed beside a calm-looking lake as the sun set at the Oake Manor Golf Club in Somerset last night, amid warnings that two weather fronts from the Atlantic are due to bring unsettled weather to the UK . Wispy strands of pink and purple cloud braided together across the sky in stunning autumnal scenes. The lake is nestled between the Quantock, Brendon and Blackdown hills . The stirring picture of the lavender and fuchsia-coloured clouds was reflected onto the perfectly still lake, as the two birds watched on . Birds were seen moving across the sky as the sun set down for the day on a calm and beautiful evening . Despite calm scenes at sunset, forecasters warn the effects of a low pressure system, currently sitting to the west of Britain in the middle of the Atlantic, will load the UK with thundery showers and strong winds . But there will be unseasonably warm temperatures, some six degrees above average for this time of year. This morning, these dog walkers made the most of the balmy weather as they strolled through Greenwich Park, London . A blanket of early-morning fog and mist cleared in Ditcheat, Somerset, this morning to make way for sunshine across the UK . The beautiful scenes were a far cry from some of the most severe weather which has been battering Britain over the past few days . These horse riders in Somerset made the most of the calm weather, before Hurricane Gonzalo - the strongest Atlantic storm in three years which is due to hit Bermuda on Friday - could potentially move across to the UK . A bird perched itself on ruins in Somerset, as it watched over the low mist clouds moving across the countryside . But temperatures will still continue to soar, with the mercury expected to reach 21C in parts of the UK on Saturday and Sunday  - some six degrees above average for this time of year. Gonzalo has already battered islands across the West Indies, with images revealing destroyed boats, down trees and debris strewn across beaches in Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy and Saint-Martin on Tuesday. The storm, which was yesterday upgraded to a category four hurricane as its winds reached 125mph, is poised to hit Bermuda on Friday and then move onto Canada on Sunday. A spokesman for the Met Office said Gonzalo could hit the UK by early next week, bringing 50mph winds and heavy rain - but she said Britain should be braced for those conditions anyway, regardless of Gonzalo's movement. She said: 'Gonzalo could hit us by Monday - but it could not. It could swoop northwards and miss us completely - the path is still largely unknown. If it does hit us, it won't be a hurricane by the time it does and the effects of it will be no different to the usual autumnal weather we have seen lately. 'But, if it does arrive, there could be winds of 50mph and heavy rain.' Until then, the existing low pressure system sweeping across the Atlantic - separate to Gonzalo - will leave Britain at its mercy. Despite stunning scenes showing mist and cloud calmly clearing at sunrise this morning, a band of rain caused by the system will move across  the UK this afternoon, bringing thundery showers to Wales, the south west and north west England. The early-morning mist was also seen gliding over London this morning, making way for a day of sunshine and warm temperatures . Recent wet and warm conditions have allowed areas such as Greenwich Park, pictured, to shine in its autumnal glory . Keswick, in the Lake District, looked stunning in the early-morning sunshine today. But an existing low pressure system sweeping across the Atlantic - separate to Gonzalo - is expected to leave Britain at its mercy . Two paddleboarders made their way across Derwent Water near Keswick, Cumbria, as they made the most of the dry weather . A canoe was also spotted out on the water this morning, as fog and mist cleared to make way for beautiful sunshine . But that stormy weather should fade by this evening, making way for calmer scenes tomorrow, as sunshine spreads across many parts of the country. By Saturday, temperatures could reach 21C in parts of the south east, while central and eastern parts will also bask in glorious sunshine. But this will be interrupted with periods of heavy rain  in western areas, Wales, the north west and Scotland. A band of rain will also linger over parts of Kent and the far south east coast. Forecasters say the warm weather will continue through Sunday, although the blustery and breezy winds caused by the Atlantic front means it will not feel particularly warm. Bouts of rain will also continue to hang around the south east, while showers will be seen across western parts and the Midlands. But storm clouds were also seen gathering across the City of London later on, as Britain prepares itself for days of unsettled weather . Ferocious waves crashed into the Torry Battery lighthouse in Aberdeen this morning, as wintry, wet conditions hit Scotland . Fierce gusts whipped up the water up into a frenzy. Parts of Scotland will be drenched in heavy showers over the weekend . Grey clouds moved overhead as the lighthouse took a battering - a sign of the unpredictable weather to come over the next few days . Commuters heading into Leeds battled through the fog and mist on the M621 this morning . A Meteogroup spokesman said: 'Tomorrow, a band of cloud and increasingly light and patchy rain in northern Scotland will become confined to the Northern Isles. 'Many other parts of the UK will have a dry morning with sunny spells, although isolated showers may affect southern and western areas. Through the afternoon, winds will freshen as an area of rain edges in from the south-west, reaching all areas during the evening. 'On Saturday, rain may persist for a time across some southern counties of England while the rest of the UK will have variable cloud and blustery showers, these potentially heavy and thundery. 'On Sunday, it looks set to remain fairly windy and unsettled with sunny spells and heavy showers, these most frequent in the north and west.' The huge pressure system is just one of three huge depressions filing the Atlantic Ocean at the moment, with Hurricane Fay also barrelling towards Bermuda, along with Hurricane Gonzalo. This graphic shows the predicted path of Hurricane Gonzalo, which forecasters say could hit Britian on Monday . This satellite image of the latest hurricanes shows Gonzalo - the strongest Atlantic storm in three years - headed towards Bermuda . This image, from the Met Office, show the movement of weather fronts caused by the low pressure system, which is affecting the UK . The three-day forecast shows unsettled weather across most of the British isles over the weekend, with sunshine and heavy rain . They are the latest weather systems to move in from the US and play havoc with Britain's climate. In August this year, five flood warnings and 33 flood alerts were brought in when the remnants of Hurricane Bertha moved up from the Caribbean and swept across Britain. That hurricane formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean first lashed the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds of up to 90mph. Bertha then travelled north, veering away from the US and Canadian coast before heading across the Atlantic and being downgraded to an 'Atlantic storm', which dropped 20mm of rain an hour on some parts of the UK. But hurricanes emanating from the region are not always bad news for Britain. Hurricane Cristobal, which ravaged parts of the Caribbean, brought warm weather to the UK later in August this year by dragging an area of high pressure up from Europe.","A blanket of early-morning fog and mist cleared to make way for sunshine across most parts of the UK today .

"Dengue fever hits around 390 million each year causing extreme joint pain and headaches, and until now, scientists have been unable to find a drug that can cure it. Earlier this year, researchers began testing genetically-modified mosquitoes that could eradicate entire populations of the bloodsucking bugs - and now a team of experts has found another way to stop the spread. They discovered that by infecting the insects with a specific bacteria, it acted in a similar way to a vaccine against the disease, which would stop it being spread to humans. Researchers in Brazil have freed thousands of mosquitoes infected with a dengue-blocking bacteria in the hope of combating the disease naturally . Scientists in Janeiro infected the mosquitoes with a bacteria called Wolbachia. The idea is that Wolbachia will act as a vaccine for the mosquito which carries dengue, Aedes aegypti, preventing it from spreading through its body. When a male mosquito carrying Wolbachia fertilises the eggs of a female without the bacteria, these eggs do not turn into larvae. If both male and female mosquitoes reproducing are contaminated, their offspring will also carry Wolbachia. Researchers hope this means Aedes mosquitoes with Wolbachia will spread without them having to contaminate more insects. Brazil currently has the world's highest the number of dengue cases, with 3.2 million cases and 800 deaths reported in the last five years alone. Pictured is artwork of the Dengue virus . The initiative, by the Rio de Janeiro-based Fiocruz research institute, is part of a programme also taking place in Australia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Starting with Tubiacanga, in the north of Rio, ten thousand mosquitoes will be released each month for four months throughout Brazil. Brazil currently has the world’s highest the number of dengue cases, with 3.2 million cases and 800 deaths reported in the last five years alone. The plans follow a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever. The mosquitoes were engineered in such a way so that their offspring died before reaching maturity. Dengue is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, with Brazil having the highest number of cases. Symptoms include: . Dengue . is spread by infected mosquitoes. An infected human is bitten by the . mosquito, the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle . continues. The condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations. Dengue usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks. There are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol. A number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness, known as 'severe dengue'.It is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock, bleeding and organ damage. The latest initiative follows a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever . The GM mosquito was created by Oxford-based firm Oxitec. The Oxitec insect can be used to control the dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti and is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes. The Oxitec males, which cannot bite, are released to seek out and mate with the wild females. Their offspring inherit the additional genes and die before becoming functional adults. They also inherit a marker that is visible under a special light, making monitoring in the field simple and helping ensure that dengue mosquito control programmes succeed. In several trials, successive releases of the Oxitec males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area. This meant male insects were on a suicide mission which involved mating with wild . females before they, and their offspring, die. This, . in theory, could reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and . spread dengue fever. Elsewhere, Panama announced plans to release the GM insects into its jungles to similarly help tackle the spread. The bugs were engineered by Oxford-based firm Oxitec. Oxitec has developed the technology to create the genetically modified insects which, it claims, can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests. The Oxitec insect is used to . control the dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti, because it is a strain of the wild . species that contains two additional genes.

"Created: . 05:03 EST, 22 October 2014 . A teaching assistant was sent away from her first day of her new job at a Catholic school because her arms and neck are covered in tattoos. Mother-of-two Charlotte Tumilty had been  offered the role at St John Vianney's Primary School in Hartlepool as part of her teacher training course. But within an hour of turning up for her first day, she claims she was sent home because of her body art - and she insists she cannot cover up the tattoos in order to return to the school. Charlotte Tumilty, left, who claims she was sent away from her first day working in a Catholic school because of her tattoos. Right is the eye emblem she has inked on her neck . The 26-year-old says that she was told the tattoos on her feet, hands and neck were unacceptable because the school is 'strict Catholic' and that they were 'inappropriate'. However, the school insists that Miss Tumilty, from Hartlepool, was only told to consider 'covering' up her tattoos so she could return to her placement later. But she says she is unable to cover them all up and there are no other placements available at other schools. She said: 'It ticks me off. They said I could maybe start later but I don't think it's going to get anywhere because you can still see bits of my tattoos. 'They prejudiced me because they could see a few tattoos.' The mother of two has a full sleeve of tattoos on both of her arms and claims the school knew about her body art before she began the job . Miss Tumilty is currently on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education and was due to work at the school twice a week for a year. She has a 'full sleeve' of tattoos on her arms and legs, smaller inkings on her fingers, hands, back and chest and an eye emblem on her neck. She said that when she went for an interview at the school to secure her placement, staff were able to see her tattoos, but she did promise to take out her piercings. Miss Tumilty, who is mother to four-year-old RayGan and Willow, one, said: 'They said that would be perfect.' She claims it then took a while for the school to confirm her placement and other students on her course had already started theirs when she rang to inquire about starting training . She went to the school on Monday, and spent around £25 on a new outfit, ensuring her arms were covered. She explained: 'They showed me to the class I was working in. 'But a woman asked to speak to me in the office and said, ""What we need to discuss is you can still see a bit of your neck tattoo peaking out of your top."" Miss Tumilty was told by the school to cover up her tattoos if she wanted to return to work there, but she says it would make her look 'ridiculous' The deputy headteacher at St John Vianney's Primary insists Miss Tumilty was just politely asked to cover her tattoos . 'I suggested wearing a higher-necked top. The woman said, ""That's not the point, it's a strictly Catholic school and tattoos are forbidden"". 'She said they do have teachers with tattoos, but they cover them up. I said ""Yes, I have covered mine up"", but the woman said, ""To be honest, I don't think it's appropriate."" 'She then suggested I might be able to uses plasters and bandages to cover them up. I'd look ridiculous.' However, deputy headteacher Martin Boagey insists that Miss Tumilty was just 'politely asked' to cover up her tattoos. He said: 'The school expects all members of staff to project a professional image and we have a code of conduct, part of which requires members of staff with tattoos to cover them up. 'We do have members of staff with tattoos, and they are happy to abide by the code of conduct. Miss Tumilty has tattoos down her arms and legs as well as on her fingers, hands, back, chest and neck. She is pictured, right, in the outfit she wore on her first day at the school . 'On her arrival at school to take up her placement, Charlotte Tumilty was informed of the school's code of conduct. 'She was politely asked to consider how best to cover up her tattoos and it was suggested that she should. 'At no point was she ever told that she could not work In the school. 'The school regularly offers placements to students to help them develop their careers, and to date dozens have been welcomed and supported.' The further education college said it was down to individuals to arrange their placements and that school guidelines should be followed. They added that they give advice to students on what is appropriate dress and appearance but say it is up to the individuals to take the advice on board. The school is under the control of Hartlepool Borough Council but the local authority say that schools in their area are free to decide their own policy on tattoos . Many employers have strict policies on tattoos from complete bans on inkings to having them covered while in the workplace. Under current legislation people with tattoos are not covered by the Equality Act 2010. Earlier this year a business executive was sacked from her job after having an inking of a butterfly design on her foot. Jo Perkins, 38, had the design on the side of her left foot when she started working for multi-million pound firm Salisbury FM. But after she started work, bosses brought in a ‘no tattoos on show’ rule – and terminated Miss Perkins’s contract when she could not cover up her inking. Similarly, Larissa Westcott says she was having a job interview with British Airways when she was told her application wouldn't be taken any further because of a tattoo on her foot. However, earlier this month, the army announced that it was lifting its ban on hand and neck tattoos in a bid to draw in more recruits. Previous strict rules restricting art on visible parts of the body meant a number of potential soldiers had to be turned away. But a change to the regulations means that designs are allowed providing they are not visible in a passport-style photo when the soldier’s top button is undone on an open-necked shirt. Union officials have now called for a 'balance' between the right of the individuals and the needs of organisations when it comes to tattoos. Mike Hill of Unison, which supports teaching assistants, said: 'The unions recognise that most workplaces have dress codes, and that includes such dress codes which would accommodate the covering up of tattoos. 'Unions will stand by anybody who is subject to disciplinary action or discrimination as a consequence of them having tattoos. 'But we will also encourage a strike of balance between the needs of the organisation and the individual's choice."" A spokesman for the Tattooing and Piercing Industry Union said: 'Members of the public should think carefully about tattoo placement because it can impact on your employment prospects.'","Charlotte Tumilty turned up for  placement at a school in Hartlepool .

"It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding extravaganza, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons. The Lebanese-born lawyer's Oscar de la Renta wedding dress quickly became one of the most coveted bridal looks - and now you can steal her style. Esteemed designer Oscar de la Renta has created an Amal-inspired wedding gown, which forms part of his bridal fall 2015 collection. Get the look: Oscar de la Renta, who designed a bespoke wedding gown for Amal Alamuddin's wedding to George Clooney has created a dress inspired by the lawyers as part of his bridal fall 2015 collection . Almost identical: It isn't exactly the same but the only obvious difference between this gown and the 36-year-old's is the length of the train. Here Amal can be seen having a dress fitting with Oscar de la Renta in U.S. Vogue . It isn't the exact copy - Amal had a bespoke design made in his studio - but the gown has the same features, such as the same off-the-shoulder design and a similar lace overlay. The only obvious difference between this gown and the 36-year-old's is the length of the train, which may be a blessing. Indeed, according to Vogue, Amal's train consisted of so much fabric that it was too heavy for her 12-year-old flower girl Mia, her sister's daughter, to carry. Plus, the price, which is yet to be revealed, will no doubt be lower than the original. George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin sold their wedding photos exclusively to HELLO! and People for charity. Style icon: Amal, who has been advising the Greek government lately, said that meeting Oscar made the design process all the more magical  'as he is so warm and such a gentleman' Fashion's darling: From her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit to the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress, pictured, Amal has positioned herself as a global style icon . And a picture of Amal's dress fitting with Oscar de la Renta was also taken by famed photographer Annie Leibowitz for U.S. Vogue. The acclaimed barrister told the fashion bible: 'George and I wanted a wedding that was romantic and elegant, and I can’t imagine anyone more able than Oscar to capture this mood in a dress. 'Meeting him made the design process all the more magical, as he is so warm and such a gentleman.' Back on home soil: The 36-year-old barrister - who changed her name last week after marrying the American actor - touched down at Heathrow Airport on Thursday afternoon following a four-day work trip in Athens . Amal was pictured being attended to by de la Renta and head tailor Raffaele Ilardo, who helped her into the gown made of ivory tulle and appliquéd with fourteen yards of Chantilly lace, its bodice hand embroidered with beading and crystals. As her mother Baria and sister Tala watched on, it was decided the dress was so heavy that Tala's 12-year-old daughter Mia - who was Amal's only flower girl - would have to be helped in her train-carrying duties by Tala. The dress was so gorgeous that both Baria and Tamal broke down in tears as Amal tried on the gown, Vogue reports, as de la Renta told the magazine: 'It’s the most important dress in the life of a woman. 'Any girl from any walk of life dreams of that special dress, and I try to make that dream a reality for her. Amal and I looked at a lot of evening dresses and wedding dresses together, and we discussed what she liked. That gave me the idea of what she wanted.' The pair had a quick chat about veils - Amal debated whether she needs a shorter veil for the reception - and de la Renta told her: 'No, I think after the wedding you take off the veil altogether; you don’t need it anymore. Once you are married, you are married.' Speaking about Amal's wedding wardrobe and her ascent to global style icon, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe. 'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored classic dressing. 'Not to mention the most exquisite bespoke Oscar de la Renta wedding gown, equipped with diamantes and pearls. This is the kind of dress women dream about. It was truly a masterpiece. 'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try and emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence. 'What a women! What a clever woman!'

"Darwin the baby koala is looking for a friend after being brought into a wildlife shelter at Rawson, 20 km east of Melbourne. The joey was orphaned when timber workers failed to see him and his mother in a tree they were felling in the area.They rushed the 250 gram joey to koala expert Colleen Wood who has nursed the little boy around the clock for the past two months. 'Koalas are actually incredibly maternal and the mothers will often manage to fall in a way that protects their babies over themselves,' says Wood from the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter. 'This is how we think little Darwin survived.' Darwin is now five months old and after a special 'every four hour' feeding routine, has almost doubled in weight. Wood says he is inseparable from his friend George the teddy bear, but she needs to find a real life companion to help the joey learn how to survive on his own. 'It's very funny, people will see me feeding and they look at this teddy bear and they look at me really strangely until I tell them: ""No, there's a real Koala under there, behind George!.""' she says. Scroll down for video . Darwin the baby Koala and his best friend George the teddy bear . A 2-month old Darwin when he was first bought to the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter in rural Victoria . Darwin will remain under watchful eyes at the wildlife shelter for about another 10 months before he is released back into the wild to fend for himself. Collen Wood and volunteers at the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter will tag him and other koalas to track how they're doing in their natural habitat. 'We monitor them over the years and there's just nothing more rewarding than to see a female you've nursed since it was a joey having young of its own in the bush.' According to Wood, about 78 per cent of injured or orphaned koalas that are released will survive. 'We always try to release them close to the areas they come from because they'll seek those places out - but sometimes this is problematic,' she says. 'We've had some koalas return to bushfire damaged areas and some have died after falling from weak branches that just snap. We have problems with cows; cows hate koalas and will call the rest of the herd to stomp on them - and we have the chlamydia disease which they pick up from other animals like cattle and which is just horrific.' Wood, who began caring for injured wildlife 19 years ago, says the biggest threats to koala populations in Australia are increased habitat destruction, fires and the drying out of the landscape because of climate change. 'We really don't know enough about koalas in Victoria and this is a big concern, we need more research,' she says. Darwin required special feeds every four hours when he came to the shelter because his stomach had not yet developed the enzymes to breakdown eucalyptus leaves . Wildlife carer Colleen Wood said Darwin was 'borderline' when he came to the shelter; 'We usually wouldn't accept joey koalas under 250 grams because they will rarely make it' she says, but Darwin  has almost doubled in weight since he first came to the shelter three months ago . With joey season starting early this year, Wood says she will soon see a lot of babies coming in because of road hits, dog attacks, tree-felling accidents and bushfires. She says more than 200 baby koalas came in to the centre last year, and the numbers are growing. But for now, Darwin will continue to enjoy his padded tree fork stand, heated to the temperature of his mother's pouch. And he will most likely be paired up with another adult female to help him socialise. 'He's a very lucky boy,' says Woods. 'He'll do fine.' Darwin and his 'inseparable' companion George .

"It was just too good to last. The driest start to autumn in 50 years was sure to have a downside – and yesterday it arrived in the form of smog across the South. As the pollution hit danger levels, the elderly and those with lung and heart problems were warned not to exert themselves outside due to the poor air quality. The heavy pollution was caused by fumes from diesel cars on our roads as well as emissions from factories on the continent. Sunbathers enjoyed the warm weather in Lyme Regis, Dorset today but the driest start to autumn in 50 years will not last . The Environment Department issued the health warning as smog reached the second highest level of between seven and nine on its scale which goes up to ten. But our changeable weather means that thankfully, the smog isn’t here to stay as thunderstorms are likely to blow it away today. Forecasters have warned that our Indian summer will come to a dramatic end as an inch of rain is expected to fall in just two hours. Yesterday, temperatures hit a sweltering 26C (79F) in Sussex, which is 10 degrees above the average September daytime temperature. Last night the Met Office issued weather warnings for the South, the Midlands and most of Wales. The Met Office three day forecast that shows the warm weather making way for cooler spells . Paul Gundersen, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘A warm and humid airmass covers southern Britain at present. ‘This is already becoming increasingly unstable and producing a few thunderstorms through Thursday, but these are expected to become more widespread overnight into Friday and extend further north into the Midlands and Wales. ‘Many places will miss the worst of these – some may stay dry – but where they do occur, one inch of rain may fall in a short time, leading to some surface water flooding, while lightning and hail may be additional hazards.’ The torrential rain will fade away on Saturday and Sunday will be dry for most. However, the time has come to pack away your T-shirts and take out the scarves as temperatures are set to plummet to 5C (41F) in the North and 6C (43F) in the South on Sunday night.","The driest start to autumn in 50 years has led to dangerous levels of pollution .

"The Chicago air traffic control center that was disabled by a former employee setting fire to it reopened early Monday morning after weeks of disrupted air travel nationwide. A full team of air traffic controllers returned to work around 1 a.m. at the En Route Center in Aurora, bringing back control capacity from nearby air traffic centers. Around 200 employees from Aurora had been working at other FAA control centers to monitor flights since September 26, FAA officials said in a statement. Up: FAA controllers returned to En Route Center in Aurora, taking control of Chicago airports from nearby centers who had been lending control capacity . In earlier statements, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta had stated it would take at least until October 13 to get the center running normally again. Chicago's two main airports, O'Hare and Midway, struggled in the weeks since the fire to return flight capacity to normal. On October 1, O'Hare was still struggling to reach 85 percent capacity for scheduled flights while Midway was up just over 80 percent. Brian Howard, 36, was charged with felony destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities after he cut cables and set a fire in the basement of the air traffic control center before trying to take his life. The paramedics and firefighters who responded to smoke coming from the fire discovered blood pooled on the floor of the basement, according to the complaint filed in federal court. Canceled: Passengers became stranded at O'Hare and Midway after flights were canceled due to the fire set in the Aurora control center . Delayed: Passengers waited for any available flights out of Chicago as other air traffic control centers took over for Aurora, though airports were only running at 85 percent  their normal capacity as of October 1 . Following the trail of blood, emergency responders discovered wires had been sabotaged and, a little farther on, found Howard shirtless under a table with knife wounds on his arms. Accused: Paramedics found Brian Howard, 36, under a table in the basement of the En Route Center in Aurora moments as he tried to kill himself . Paramedics said that when they discovered him, Howard was in the process of trying to slit his throat and told emergency officials: 'leave me alone.' Ron Safer, Howard's lawyer, has said that Howard made a 'tragic mistake.' A FAA technical team will remain in Aurora until Tuesday to supervise the transition . The agency drew fire from officials, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, for its handling of the incident. Emmanuel held a press conference sharply criticizing the agency for not being able to restore service to O'Hare, a central hub for air traffic, and the FAA is conducting a 30-day review of their contingency and security plans at major facilities. The fire also brought to light how antiquated air traffic infrastructure in the U.S. had become. Huerta has said that with the $37billion overhaul of the nation's air traffic control systems now being implemented, the FAA 'will have the ability to configure any single facility to view any part of our nation’s airspace.' As of Monday morning, flights were moving much smoother than travelers had become used to in Chicago. Charged: Howard's lawyer, Ron Safer, said his client had made a 'tragic mistake' during his suicide attempt, adding that his client regrets having 'inconvenienced many many people' Only two flights at O'Hare had been canceled as of 9 a.m., putting the Chicago airport ahead of Boston and Newark's international airports.","FAA flight controllers returned to work at En Route Center in Aurora at 1 a.m. Monday, taking over control from nearby centers .
The air traffic control center had been out of service since September 26, when it was evacuated following a fire set by a disgruntled employee .
In the weeks following the fire, technicians worked around the clock while other air traffic control centers monitored Chicago-area flights .
O'Hare and Midway airports were operating at 85 percent capacity as late as October 1 .

"A new graphic video recording has emerged showing a mentally ill Michigan man being shot at 46 times by eight police officers for refusing to drop a penknife during a standoff in 2012. The killing of Milton Hall, 49, sparked a nationwide outcry and a federal investigation into allegations of police brutality, but the officers in question have been cleared of any wrongdoing. At the time, Milton's mother, Jewel Hall, described the officers who shot dead her disturbed son as ‘a firing squad dressed in police uniforms.' Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Milton Hall, 49, pictured left and right, was shot and killed by police officers during a confrontation in a Saginaw, Michigan, parking lot in July 2012 . New evidence: The ACLU has obtained this video recording showing eight police officers converging on the mentally distraught man armed with a penknife . In their cross-hairs:  Hall, pictured pacing in front of the officers with their weapons drawn, was the one who called them after having a confrontation with a store clerk . On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union released a police dashcam video obtained from the victim’s family showing police officers converging on Milton Hall in a Saginaw parking lot and unleashing a volley of bullets at him. The non-profit civil rights organization also published excerpts from an interview with Jewel Hall about her son's violent end. Police in Saginaw said that on July 1, 2012, Milton Hall, a homeless man suffering from mental illness, called 911 after getting into a confrontation with a convenience store clerk. The disturbing video obtained by ACLU shows the distraught man standing in a parking lot outside the store with a penknife in his hand, surrounded by eight uniformed police officers with their guns drawn. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT The eight officers who responded the the scene unleashed a volley of bullets at the Milton Hall in broad daylight . Man down: Hall crumpled to the ground after being struck by 14 bullets, but the officers continued firing . Arrest: The officers flipped over Hall's lifeless body and placed him in handcuffs . Adding insult to injury: One of the cops appeared to have placed his foot on Hall's bullet-ridden back . A K-9 officer is holding a German shepherd on a leash whose incessant barking provides a chilling soundtrack to the standoff. A couple of minutes into the recording, the cops open fire on Hall. The 49-year-old man goes down in a hail of bullets and rolls over a couple of times as the officers continue firing on him. After the gunfire stops, the cops converge on his lifeless, bullet-ridden body, flip him over and put him in handcuffs; a hulking Saginaw officer appears to place his foot on Hall's back. 'For him to be shot at 46 times and hit 14 times by all white policemen, it really raised questions in my mind,' Jewel Hall says in the ACLU interview. ‘How they circled him and assassinated him… his blood running down the street like water. ‘And he wasn't a threat, I mean, he had a little penknife. He had no idea that those policemen would do that to him.’ Mrs Hall said the 2012 shooting has been devastating to their family and the community at large. Mother's grief: Jewel Hall told ACLU in an interview that her son was 'assassinated' by police . Her pride and joy: Mrs Hall said before he was diagnosed with mental illness, Milton was a community organizer who fought for equal rights for people of color and the poor . Happier times: Milton Hall pictured as a happy teenager and a high school football player . Jewel Hall has expressed dismay over the fact that after a months-long investigation, the US Department of Justice concluded that the police shooting was not intentional. The ACLU presented the new dashboard footage to the Organization of American States Monday in a bid to pressure the federal government to reopen Hall's case. The victim's mother said that before he was diagnosed with mental illness in his 20s, Milton Hall was a community organizer working to expose civil rights violations and promote equal rights for people of color and the poor. ‘He was always addressing institutional racism,’ she said. ‘I admired him for that.’ Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael Thomas told CNN in 2012 that the squad of police opened fire 'because apparently, at this point in time, he was threatening to assault police.' According to Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff, Hall was 'known to be an assaultive person' with 'a long history' of involvement with authorities, 'not only with police from our department but with the county.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A man has given more than $21,000 to charity after collecting all the loose change he found lying around for 10 years. Rick Snyder, from Bradenton, Florida, says he found the bulk of the coins - and the odd note - during his daily four-hour walks. The cash, which weighed more than 2,500lbs, was donated to the Gulf Shore Animal League, a charity which cares for feral cats. Rick Snyder's $21,495 haul of loose change weighed more than 2,500lbs and filled more than 100 jars . Mr Snyder said that he found most of the money left in vending machines and car washes, collecting around $5.60 a day. 'It astounds me how wasteful people are,' Snyder, who also collects thrown away towels so he can wash them and give them to shelters, told the Bradenton Herald. He said: 'I've been taking care of feral cats for years and I started noticing a lot of change laying around. So I started picking it up and keeping track of it. '$10,000 was my first goal and then I hit that and I wasn’t satisfied. 'I said I’d keep going so I got to 100 jars and thought ""well I’ll keep going"". $20,000 was my next goal and I exceeded that.' He eventually reached $21,495, which he donated in its entirety to the charity for feral cats. Mr Snyder owns a 48-unit condominium complex, and has found families for about 100 cats by homing them with his tenants. 'People do avoid me now if they see me coming,' he joked. Mr Snyder decided to donate the money to Gulf Shore Animal League, which cares for feral cats (file picture) Asked why he did not keep the cash for himself, Mr Snyder said: 'I have enough money.' He added that he would continue to pick up and more cash he finds and give it to charity again. The donation is the largest the rescue group has ever received from one person. Cheryl Wade, president of the Gulf Shore Animal league, said: 'This is just so over the top. It will help so many animals in our community.' She added that the money would be used to help care for kittens which are too young to be adopted.","Rick Snyder picked up all the coins he found lying around for 10 years .

"From the shedding of skin to smelling with their tongues, snakes fascinate humans for many reasons. But one reticulated python has given us a new reason to be amazed, because she has produced six babies - without mating. Thelma the snake's virgin birth, through a process known as parthenogenesis, is the first to be documented in the world’s longest snake species. A reticulated python called Thelma has produced six offspring, without the help of a male. The virgin birth, or parthenogenesis, is the first to be documented in the world's longest snake . Parthenogenesis is fatherless reproduction in animals that usually requires two parents to produce offspring. The 11-year-old reticulated python produced her young in June 2012 at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky and new research has revealed how the feat was achieved. Thelma lives with another female python called Louise and has not had any male company for years. The 20ft, (six metre) snake, which weighs 200lbs (91kg) laid a clutch of 61 eggs in the summer of 2012. The 11-year-old reticulated python produced her young in June 2012 at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky. Her offspring are half clones. Three of them have retained her exact colouring, while the others (one of which is pictured) have bright yellow and black patternation known as 'super tiger' markings . A virgin birth is also called parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis is fatherless reproduction in animals that usually require two parents to produce offspring. This is the first time that it's been been documented in the world’s largest snake, although it's been observed in other snake species and birds and sharks. It’s caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal’s egg and usually die, behave like sperm and fuse with the egg, triggering cell division. This process is known as terminal fusion automixis. The eggs were covered and brooded by the coiled female for two weeks before being removed by zookeepers for examination. ‘It is not uncommon for a snake to lay infertile eggs, so the staff was surprised when the eggs appeared to be full and healthy instead of shrunken and discolored shells - typical of infertile reptile eggs,’ said Bill McMahan, Curator of Ectotherms at the zoo. A decision was made to artificially incubate some of the eggs to ascertain whether they were fertile. On September 12, 2012, the first of six healthy reticulate pythons hatched with an average individual weight of 5.23 ounces (148.3 grams). Dr McMahan said: It is a very exciting thing to be able to witness something like that first hand, especially something that has never been documented before in this species.’ To confirm whether Thelma's offspring were born via parthenogenesis, shed skins from her and her offspring were sent to the University of Tulsa’s molecular ecology laboratory in Oklahoma. Genetic testing revealed that the snakelets were produced by the mother (pictured) alone, without sperm from a male snake. Parthenogenesis is caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal’s egg and usually die, behave like sperm and fuse with the egg, triggering cell division . Python retiulatus is the world's longest snake and can measure up to 22.8ft (6.95metres) long. They live in South East Asia and like all pythons, are nonvenenmous constrictors and good swimmers. The snakes eat mammals (from rats to pigs) and birds and can swallow prey up to a quarter of their own length and as heavy as themselves. They are ambush hunters and wait until prey wanders within strike range, before seizing it in their coils and squeexing it to death. While they are strong enough to kill a grown man, this is very rare. Females usually lay between 15 and 80 eggs per clutch, which take an avearge of 88 days to hatch. Hatchlings are typically at least two feet (61cm) long when they are born. ‘We didn't know what we were seeing. We had attributed it to stored sperm. I guess sometimes truth is stranger than fiction,’ he told National Geographic. Genetic testing revealed that the offspring were produced by the mother alone, without sperm from a male snake. It’s caused when cells known as polar bodies – which are produced with an animal’s egg and usually die, behave like sperm and fuse with the egg, triggering cell division. This process is known as terminal fusion automixis, according to the study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. Interestingly, despite not having a father, the snakelets are half clones of the mother, with three retaining her pattern, with the others displaying striped of brighter yellow. Virgin births have been seen in other reptiles before, including other snake species, according to James Hanken, a professor of herpetology at Harvard University in Massachusetts. It is being documented in more and more species, including birds and sharks, mainly due to research by Warren Booth at the University of Tulsa. He thinks that the discovery in pythons will help scientists learn more about snakes’ evolutionary family tree and thinks that while no-one knows what causes parthenogenesis, it may have something to do with females being kept in captivity far away from males.","The 11-year old reticulated python lives at Louisville Zoo in Kentucky .

"A New Jersey man who heads a group the represents the non-religious was floored when his application for a personalized license plate reading ‘ATHE1ST’ was rejected for being ‘offensive. David Silverman is president of American Atheists and wanted a plate that would reflect his beliefs but was told on Monday his request was ‘Objectionable or Need Clarification.’ The state’s Motor Vehicle Commission didn’t realize who they were rejecting, though. Silverman immediately responded with an appeal and in just a couple of days New Jersey reversed their decision and he’s now set to receive the plate. Denied: David Silverman, president of American Atheists, saw his vanity plate application rejected, but the state of New Jersey didn't know who they were dealing with. The request has since been approved . Silverman was livid and called the MVC, where he was told his request was ‘objectionable.’ ‘There was absolutely no reason that this plate should be denied; this is outrageously discriminatory,’ said Silverman. ‘There is nothing offensive about atheism or atheists. The state of New Jersey had no right to deem this ‘offensive’ as though it was their place to do so.’ New Jersey has rejected many license plate requests before and as of 2012, their list of objectionable plates had 1,085 words. The New Jersey Star-Ledger published the list and reached out to the MVP for comment. ‘The language is ever evolving,’ spokesman Mike Horan said. ‘Slang terms and things that might have been . pretty innocuous years ago, now might actually have a meaning at this . point in time.’ However, the word atheist was not on the list of banned words, nor is it slang of any kind. Error? Silverman applied knowing similar requests have been approved before. Here he is holding a vintage atheist plate. New Jersey officials said his denial was a 'clerical error' In fact, the state has approved a plate reading ‘ATHEIST’ before. That’s what led Silverman to request the ‘1’ instead of an ‘I.’ He posed with a picture of the vintage plate in a picture that accompanied a press release sent out by American Atheists in response to the matter. Once he receives the plates, Silverman plans to bring one with him to American Atheists’ 2014 National Convention in Salt Lake City, where American Atheists members will be able to take pictures with it. The group has been around since 1963 and touts itself as the 'premier organization fighting for the civil liberties of atheists and the total, absolute separation of government and religion.' Silverman is not the first person to have a problem with their New Jersey vanity plates. Kim Romano of Manville saw a plate that was already on her car revoked in 2010. Though authorities initially approved the plate, which read ‘BIOCH,’ they later received a complaint and forced Romano to get new tags. Her follow up plate read ‘WHAEVER.’","David Silverman also happens to be the president of freedom of no religion group American Atheists .

"Two days after their historic win, the South Sydney Rabbitohs are showing no sign of slowing down their celebrations. There has been non-stop parties at Sam Burgess' house, private parties at a Surry Hills hotel and now a possible forehead tattoo that appears to be making its rounds of the team. A candid photo of player Adam Reynolds has been circulating social media, showing the 24-year-old with what appears to be a tattoo of the team's logo above his left eyebrow. The black and white image, posted by fellow team mate Tom Burgess, offered little explanation other than the caption: 'BUNNY LOVE #pride'. A photo of Rabbitohs player Adam Reynolds with the team's rabbit logo tattooed on his face has been circulating social media . The black and white image was posted on Instagram by fellow team mate Tom Burgess with the caption: 'BUNNY LOVE #pride' As over 7,700 Instagram followers liked the photo and began speculating about the tattoo's authenticity, a second image was posted to Reynold's own account. Captioned simply 'we done it', the image showed the halfback arm in arm with Rabbitohs' captain John Sutton who sported a replica of the apparent tattoo. Fans and critics of the team took to social media to share their opinion on the unconfirmed ink, with one Twitter user writing: 'Adam Reynolds… knows it's an eye 'brow', not eye 'burrow', right?!'. Despite quips that Reynolds will struggle to find another team to sign him on for next year's season if the tattoo proves permanent, the footballer who grew up on Morehead Street near Redfern Oval, revealed just how much the community and his love for the team make him who he is. A second image was later posted on Reynold's own account captioned 'we done it' and showing the halfback arm in arm with Rabbitohs' captain John Sutton who sported a replica of the apparent tattoo . 'I started at Souths and I came back here ... it's where I belong,' Reynolds told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Every kid who grows up in Redfern or Waterloo has a ball in their hand from a young age….Maybe it's just a result of the die-hard love this area has for rugby league – the passion.' While Reynolds is due to come off contract at the end of 2015, his desire is to stay in red and green. 'We have put it off to concentrate on football, but I would like to get it sorted,' he said. 'I will leave that up to my manager. He has done a great job in the past and I'm sure he will again. Fans and critics of the team took to social media to share their opinion on the unconfirmed ink . 'It is a great club ... I would love to stay. You only have to see how the fans have reacted to what we have done. 'It has touched so many lives. The fans are great here. To give back to them means a lot.' With Souths' victory celebrations in full swing, Reynolds' manager Steve Gillis said he would sit down with Rabbitohs' management over the next few weeks to nut out his client's future. 'There is no timeframe on it at the moment,' Gillis told AAP. While Reynolds is due to come off contract at the end of 2015, his desire is to stay in red and green . 'We want to let the boys enjoy the celebration. They have their (end of season) ball coming up. We will let it runs its course. 'Then we will sit down with them in the next two to three weeks. The preference is to stay at the club, that is the plan, we will see how it goes.' Reynolds said he still found it hard to believe he had won a premiership with Souths. 'It was on the bucket list. It is going to be a great week, I just want to enjoy it,' he said.","A photo of the halfback with the team's rabbit logo  on his face has been circulating social media .

"Elon Musk has teased a potential new car or technology from Tesla that will be revealed next week. On Twitter he revealed that ‘the D’ would be unveiled on 9 October - and what exactly that might be has internet commenters abuzz. Some have suggested it may be a new type of driver-assisted electric car while others have noted similarities in the teased vehicle's appearance to the previous Model S. California-based Tesla will reveal a new car or technology next week. The development was teased by CEO Elon Musk on Twitter, with an official announcement planned for 9 October. 'About time to unveil the D and something else,' he wrote with an image (shown) Features speculated on include speed assist, a lane warning system and automatic braking. In a post on Twitter Musk said: ‘About time to unveil the D and something else.’ But when internet commenters revealed that ‘the D’ had some rather rude connotations, Musk let slip some more information. ‘I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No, it wasn’t intentional. Glad I didn’t mention the other letter!’ Exactly what sort of car or technology 'the D’ might be is so far a mystery. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year. Some have suggested the other letter might be a ‘P’, although what either could stand for is unknown. On the Tesla Motors forum on Reddit one commenter speculates that Musk may announce driver assist technology for existing Tesla cars. ‘Teaser image shows the model S and the front which carries all the sensors and hardware for Driver Assist,’ said user skiesforme. And the ‘something else’ alluded to by Musk may be other types of driver assist technology: speed assist, lane departure warning and so on. On the Tesla forums meanwhile, others speculated that it might be a car with four-wheel drive. Based on Musk's next tweet (shown) some have suggested the announcement may be a driver-assisted version of one of Tesla's previous cars such as the Model S. In the image the teased car looks to be similar to the Model S. Earlier this year Tesla revealed the 'Model 3' mainstream electric car . The Tesla Model S, shown, is a five-door luxury electric car that was first introduced in June 2012. It has a range of 265 miles (426km) on one charge and, as of last December, more than 25,000 had been sold world wide. Some have suggested the front of 'the D' looks similar to the Model S . Earlier this year in July Tesla unveiled the Model 3, a more mainstream version of their other electric vehicles priced around £30,000 in the UK and $35,000 in the US. At the time Musk unveiled his displeasure at being unable to call it the ‘Model E’ due to legal action from Ford. The previous two Tesla cars are called the Model S and the model X, and Musk apparently wanted to spell out the word ‘sex’ with all three. 'We were going to call it model E for a while and then Ford sued us saying it wanted to use the Model E,’ Musk told Auto Express at the time. ‘I thought this is crazy, Ford’s trying to kill sex! So we’ll have to think of another name.’ Exactly what the letter 'D' for the new announcement is trying to spell if anything, though, remains to be seen.","California-based Tesla will reveal a new car or technology next week .

"Michelle Obama put her foot in her mouth again on the campaign trail yesterday, mixing up the personal story of the Democratic senator she was campaigning for, Colorado's Mark Udall, with his Republican opponent in the race, Rep. Cory Gardner. 'As a fifth generation Coloradan, Mark understands what makes this state special,' Obama told attendees of a Denver rally for Udall. Gardner's family, not Udall's, has lived in Colorado for five generations. Udall did not move to the Rocky Mountain state until after college. The Democratic lawmaker was born in Arizona. His father Morris represented the state in Congress. Scroll down for video . Not again, Michelle! The first lady flubbed the personal story of ANOTHER Democrat on the campaign trail yesterday. Obama claimed at a rally in Denver that Colorado Sen. Mark Udall if a 'fifth generation Coloradoan.' He's not. That's his opponent's tag line . Sorry about that: Obama gives an awkward smile to Udall, left, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, during a reelection rally for the two incumbent candidates, on the campus of Colorado State University, in Fort Collins. Earlier the day FLOTUS went off script and messed up Udall's bio. She didn't make the same mistake again at her second rally with the two men . Seeking the backing of the White House without having to be seen as an accomplice to the president, Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates have latched onto the first lady this election cycle as a top surrogate. But Mrs. Obama may be doing just as much damage to candidates' campaigns as they fear appearances with her husband would bring about. At an event for the Democratic nominee to the Senate in Iowa, Bruce Braley, earlier this month FLOTUS claimed the lawmaker was a Marine Corps veteran. He's not. It's his father, Byard Braley, who is the Marine vet. Obama also called the sitting congressman the wrong name, repeatedly, until an audience member corrected her. 'Braley, what did I say?' she asked. 'Bailey,' the crowd shouted back at her. 'I'm losin' it. I'm getting old,' she said, laughing the mistake off. 'I've been traveling too much.' Indeed, the first lady has been on the road frequently in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections. Today she is in Florida campaigning for Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor who now wants to lead the state on behalf of Democrats. Yesterday she appeared at not one but two rallies for Udall and and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is also up for reelection on Nov. 4. On Tuesday she traveled back to Iowa to campaign for Braley a second time. And while the increasingly forgetful first lady did not get his name wrong, the White House mistakenly referred to him as governor of the state in its official transcript of the event. Hours later the White House acknowledged the blunder and sent out a corrected transcription of the first lady's remarks, but it was too late. Reporters nationwide had already posted stories detailing the Obama administration's latest goof. President Barack Obama has made his fair share of eyebrow-raising remarks throughout the last month, too. On two recent occasions Obama has suggested to his supporters that they should judge Democratic candidates claiming to have independent policy agendas on his record instead. It's my 'policies on the ballot,' he said in an Oct. 2 speech in Illinois at Northwestern University. During a radio interview with Al Sharpton on Monday Obama said incumbent Democrats who are up for reelection 'are all folks who vote with me.' 'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he asserted. The White House's sloppy politicking has begun to ruffle feathers among the party's political class. They worry the string of mistakes has taken the focus off of Democratic candidates' accomplishments at a critical point in the election cycle. 'It doesn’t open up a new line of attack, but it freshens one right as voters are tuning in,' a Democratic strategist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Another operative, Steve McMahon, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of high-profile Democrats like deceased Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, said the verbal missteps of White House and the first couple, while embarrassing, are not Democrats' most significant problem right now. 'It is [the president's] approval rating that is actually the real problem here,' McMahon told the LA Times. 'That other stuff, that just isn’t helpful,' he noted. The president's favorability rating nationwide hasn't crossed the 50 percent mark in the last year and a half. It's particularly low in a handful of states Democrats need to win in order to keep control of the Senate.","She mixed up the personal story of  Colorado Sen.

"Maurice Asola Fadola, thought to be in his 40s, conned women out of £800,000 to pay for mansion . He claimed to be an American major general, charming lonely British women through online dating sites with stories of his bravery dodging bombs and saving lives. But in reality the dashing war hero they fell in love with was Ghanaian fraudster Maurice Asola Fadola, who conned victims out of £800,000 to pay for his lavish mansion in his homeland. Yesterday Fadola was unmasked as one of the world’s most prolific online dating fraudsters as he was jailed for five years in Ghana for a series of international romance scams. He targeted women across Britain, France, Sweden, Italy and the US. The conman, thought to be in his 40s, preyed on at least 19 British victims by peddling an elaborate web of lies. He said he needed cash to pay for a legal dispute to get his war medals, emergency medical treatment, customs charges or even to buy his way out of the army. Using pictures of US servicemen sourced from the web, he duped other women into bogus investment schemes and lured them to Ghana where he posed as an official overseeing the money transaction, impressing his victims with his towering gold-plated and marble-clad villa in Accra. Some of his victims were left penniless and homeless. Dena White, of Market Weighton, East Yorkshire, lost her home after using £50,000 of her savings and re-mortgaging her property in 2009 to help the man she knew as Steve Moon in a legal dispute over the impounding of his war medals. Fadola convinced the 57-year-old widow, who had just lost her husband of 26 years to cancer, that he could not get access to his cash because he was serving in Iraq. The pair chatted through a dating website for hours each day. She said: ‘Of course I was wary but everything he told me seemed to check out. 'He’d send me poetry. It sounds silly now but we were in love.’ A 52-year-old victim, a married mother of two, lost £271,000 after paying to release a suitcase supposedly containing £5.2million which her online US soldier boyfriend said he had smuggled out of Iraq. He had been using the money to pay for his lavish marbled mansion in Ghana. Yesterday he was ordered to pay back his victims after being found guilty for over 20 offences . It was Fadola’s attempts to seek a British visa which was to be his undoing. It disclosed his true identity to the National Crime Agency which was working with the Ghanaian police in connection with the case of a disabled woman who was persuaded to sell her house and send funds to Ghana. Fadola was arrested by Ghana’s Serious Fraud Office in April 2010. The NCA flew five victims to give evidence against him in 2012 during his lengthy trial in Ghana. Yesterday he was ordered to pay his victims back after being found guilty of over 20 offences, including deception.","Maurice Asola Fadola was unmasked as a prolific online dating frauster .

"Luke Tobin, 23, of Cardiff, denied wounding Matthew James with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court . An Afghanistan veteran has been jailed for a jealous attack on his ex-partner's new boyfriend after finding him hiding in a wardrobe at her home. Luke Tobin, 23, of Cardiff, denied wounding Matthew James with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, but was found guilty by a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court after a jury heard he had taken pictures of the attack on his mobile phone. Mr James suffered a fractured nose and eye socket in the attack by Tobin, after he had forced his way into his ex-girlfriend Coral Samuel's house, and discovered him in the cupboard. He has been jailed for eight years for the brutal attack. The jury heard that Tobin, a soldier of five years' standing who had completed tours of Afghanistan, had been the boyfriend of Ms Samuel, the mother of a young child. Despite that relationship breaking down in August 2013, Tobin and she continued to see each other and he had stayed over. But after telling him that she had started to see someone else, Tobin went around to her house in Treharris, Merthyr Tydfil, in September last year and forced his way in. When he got inside, he went upstairs and found Mr James hiding. Tobin called him a 'pussy' before laying into him in a relentless attack, kicking and punching him repeatedly while his partner's young child slept in the next room. During the sustained assault, Tobin told him he was going to 'finish him' and before Tobin left, he took photographs of the damage he had caused, telling Ms Samuel 'I've done a good job'. Byron Broadstock, defending Tobin, who had no previous convictions, said he had harboured hopes of rekindling his relationship and had been confused at its status because he had continued to see her. He had also run a trial, said Mr Broadstock, because he wanted to rejoin the army and the consequence of a conviction would have made that impossible. Matthew James (right) suffered a fractured nose and eye socket in the attack by Tobin, after he had forced his way into his ex-girlfriend Coral Samuel's (left) house, and discovered him in the cupboard . Mr Broadstock said Tobin had displayed remorse but he was told by Judge Richard Twomlow: 'Real remorse would have been shown by a guilty plea at an early stage. 'You lost your temper when you saw Mr James in the house. 'He was so frightened he hid in a wardrobe. The attack was sustained and violent. The jury heard that Tobin, a soldier of five years' standing who had completed tours of Afghanistan, had been the boyfriend of Ms Samuel, the mother of a young child . 'You have been affected by your experiences in Afghanistan but this attack was the direct result of jealousy and losing your temper on finding Mr James in the house.' Tobin will serve half the sentence in jail before being released and will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge. He was jailed for eight years at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. Tobin will serve half the sentence in jail before being released and will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge.","Luke Tobin, 23, of Cardiff, attacked Matthew James and took pictures after .

"Facebook has introduced new filters so that users can cut annoying posts from their News Feeds - offering much-needed relief from baby pictures and selfies. On Friday the company said updated Settings controls will show the people, pages and groups you follow that posted the most in the past week, along with a summary. Facebook users will then be offered the option of seeing fewer posts from particular people - without having to conspicuously 'unfollow' or 'unfriend' them. Scroll down for video . New measures: Facebook has announced it is to introduce new filters so that users can cut annoying posts from their News Feeds . The news will come as relief to many people - sick and tired of the same overzealous posters clogging up their News Feed with drivel. Users will also be able to see a list of others they have 'unfollowed' - meaning you can quickly add persistent posters you have cut from your News Feed in a moment of anger, CNN reports. The company are being commended for giving more power to its users - following past criticisms that it has too much control over what people view. Instead of a straight chronological list of posts from friends and family, the company uses algorithms to show an edited feed - with posts that are deemed more important being bumped to the top of the page. Phenomenon: An average of 864 million people check their Facebook News Feed every day. Above, Mark Zuckerberg, the website's founder, speaks in Indonesia last month . It also looks at your behavior and what posts and pages you follow to decide what content to show you - with day-old stories occasionally being resurfaced.

In 2012, the company was accused of unethically experimenting on almost 690,000 users' News Feeds after it tinkered with the content of feeds, showing some people more positive content and others more negative posts. The study was designed to find out how such posts affected the emotions and Facebook activity of those users. In the past, users have been frustrated by the company's controlling approach to the News Feed and the difficulty in customizing what you see.T . here are options for muting individuals or blocking posts from certain sites, but with hundreds of friends, managing what pops up can be a full-time job.

"George Osborne warned that Ed Miliband had returned British politics to a Berlin Wall-era battle between the statist left and the free market right. The Chancellor said that the argument that the right thought it had won in 1989 – that free markets were the best way to promote prosperity – had re-emerged. While Labour figures like Tony Blair understood that the world had moved on since the Cold War, Mr Miliband was stuck in the past – putting businesses in danger. George Osborne - speaking at the Institute of Directors annual conference at the Royal Albert Hall today - said Ed Miliband had returned British politics to a battle between left and right for the first time since the 1980s . Speaking at the Institute of Directors, Mr Osborne said: 'There is a big argument in our country about our future, about whether we are a country that is for business, for enterprise, for the free market. 'For the first time since my adult life, that is up for grabs,' he said. 'That issue felt it had been resolved when the Berlin Wall fell.' Mr Osborne added: 'Politicians like Tony Blair form the left felt like they had understood that free markets create the taxes to fund public services and the like. 'That argument has gone and you saw it with the very stark contrast between the two political conferences in the last two weeks. The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, marking the end of the Cold War . 'I would urge the business community not to sit on the side-lines of the political debate that is going to happen over the next seven months. 'It doesn't mean you have to endorse a party, a party like the conservatives, but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument. 'That is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise, business low-tax economy which deliver prosperity for generations to come.' Mr Osborne's remarks came after he lambasted Mr Miliband at the Tory Party conference in Birmingham earlier this week. The Chancellor said the next election would be hard for the Tories to win but said Labour would struggle because of its leader. He claimed David Cameron 'knocks the socks off Ed Miliband'. Mr Osborne said: 'By a massive margin he is seen as the person to lead our country, the person who looks the part, who has got what it takes to be our Prime Minister and to continue being our Prime Minister. 'Of course there is a lamentable Labour leader who fails in every regard to fill those shoes that you need to fill if people see you as someone who could occupy 10 Downing Street.' Mr Cameron and Tony Blair had looked like prime ministers-in-waiting, before entering No 10 but 'that is not what the country sees today with Ed Miliband and that is a massive advantage for us at this election'. While the Tories had ideas for the future, Labour was 'a backward-looking party that is still settling scores from the past'.","Chancellor said  politics was back to Cold War battle between left and right .

"It was smiles all round at the family barbecue as Lewis Walker hugged his fiancee Emma Schofield and grinned at his father Darren. But Lewis was unaware that Emma was hiding a terrible secret – for the past few weeks she had been sleeping with his dad. Adding insult to injury, father and son had only recently reconciled after spending nearly eight years apart - and it was Emma who had engineered their meeting. But just six months after meeting Darren, Emma found herself falling for the 43-year-old builder and into his bed. Family affair: Lewis Walker and his fiancee Emma Schofield celebrate their engagement party in June last year. Unbeknown to Lewis, Emma was having an affair with his father Darren (left) The 27-year-old from Blackburn, Lancashire, struggled with choosing between her fiancé and her future father-in-law. She said: 'Standing beside Lewis at that barbeque in June 2011 was torture. ''I felt such a fraud knowing that while I was on the arm of my fiance, it was his old man who I had fallen for. 'Sometimes I lie in bed and cry because it’s horrible what I did to him, but on the other hand I found it impossible to control the feelings I had towards his dad.' It was in December 2009 that Emma first fell for labourer Lewis, 21. Emma, who works in sales, said: 'When I met Lewis at a Christmas party he seemed lovely. 'He put his hand on my knee and said: ""I think you’re the most beautiful girl in the world and I really, really mean that."" Moments later our lips had locked and we were kissing. 'After a few dates I realised he was special. He treated me with respect, was always the perfect gentleman and our sex life was fantastic. 'After two months of dating he’d all but moved in and four months later he proposed with the words: ""I want you to say yes because I’ve never loved a girl as much as I love you, and I want to make you happy for the rest of your life."" 'My eyes filled with tears and I said yes.' Ultimate betrayal: Emma and Darren, both from Blackburn, Lancashire, now plan to move in together . But thinking about their upcoming marriage made Emma realise she was yet to meet his whole family. She said: 'The one person I hadn’t met was Lewis’s dad - they hadn’t been close since his parents split eight years earlier. 'I saw our engagement as a way of bridging the gap and bringing them together. I was determined our wedding would bring them closer. 'When we knocked on his door Darren answered and I was confronted by a man who looked ten years younger than his 43 years and was very handsome. Ashamed with herself: Emma describes her split from Lewis as 'heartbreaking' 'He invited us in and was charming and confident. I was instantly attracted to him, not in a sexual way, but I fell in love with his personality. 'We all became very close after that meeting and went out for drinks and to clubs together. 'A year ago Lewis and I were at Darren’s house after a Saturday night out. Darren and I were drunk but Lewis was sober as he was on call for work, in case the alarm went off. 'We’d only been in five minutes when Lewis got a call out. He phoned from work ten minutes later to say there’d been a break in and he wouldn’t be home for a few hours. 'I told him I would sleep in the spare room at his dad's, as I didn’t fancy going home on my own. iI sat with Darren on the sofa with a glass of wine, and suddenly he turned to me and said: ""I don’t think I’ve ever seen you looking this attractive."" 'I was shocked, told him to stop it and pulled my short skirt down as it had accidentally ridden up. But he put his hand on my thigh. 'I turned to him and suddenly we kissed, but then I thought about Lewis and stopped him, saying: ""This isn’t right, it isn’t fair on Lewis."" His face dropped and he said: ""You’re right."" 'I decided the best thing to do was go to the spare room, get undressed and into bed. As I lay under the covers the initial adrenalin rush had been replaced by fear. 'What was I playing at? I loved Lewis, he was the perfect man for me. 'But underneath I knew I was attracted to Darren. I wanted him and not Lewis, and the thought made my blood run cold. 'How could I ever admit that to Lewis? What sort of person would that make me? I was scared, terrified of what the future held. That kiss had made me realise I was with the wrong person. 'Darren appeared at my bedroom door and sat on the bed: ""I’m really sorry for what happened just now. Please don’t tell Lewis, he must never find out."" 'My emotions were all over the place, I pulled him towards me and we started kissing and minutes later we were having sex. 'When it had finished Darren went back to his room and I lay on the bed in a complete state of shock. 'There was no going back now. But I felt so guilty and ashamed, ashamed that I’d betrayed Lewis who was such a genuine person. 'I’d been cheated on in the past so I knew what it felt like, and now I was no better than them. 'But I couldn’t stop thinking about Darren, I couldn’t see a way of having him without causing massive heartbreak. 'I started to cry, I couldn’t see what I was going to do. As they were: Lewis claims he will never speak to his father again while he is in a relationship with Emma . 'An hour later Lewis came home, but I couldn’t look him in the eye. I’d betrayed the man I thought I loved. 'For the next three months I saw Darren when Lewis wasn’t around, and tried to carry on as though nothing had happened. 'I was an emotional wreck. I’d gone from wanting to spend the rest of my life with Lewis to being unable to be intimate with him because I didn’t love him. 'It was heart-breaking. I wanted to reset the clock and go back to how things were before all this happened, but I couldn’t. 'Telling Lewis the truth would mean he lost his dad again, and he’d be unable to forgive me. If Lewis and I ate tea together I’d suddenly well up and have to rush out of the kitchen so Lewis didn’t see me in tears.' During all of this turmoil, Lewis was planning the couple’s wedding. Emma said: 'He’d taken over planning the wedding because I was showing little interest. 'But I still couldn’t choose between . them. I loved Darren and could see a future with him but Lewis deserved . better than that, so I stuck it out. 'After three months of this charade I became so exhausted I told Darren we had to come clean. Darren panicked and said: ""You can’t, he’ll never speak to me again."" 'But I knew this was the right thing to do, I could never end things with Darren now. 'Darren and I met at his house and Lewis joined us. He knew something was wrong and asked: ""Is everything OK?"" 'I took Lewis’s hand and said: ""I’m really sorry, but for the past few months I’ve been seeing your dad. I really like you but I don’t love you. I love Darren."" 'Lewis laughed, thinking I was joking. But when I walked up to Darren, took his hand and started to cry, Lewis’ face dropped. 'He threw himself at Darren and they started fighting. Eventually Lewis marched to the front door and screamed: ""I hope you two will be happy together, in hell!"" 'The guilt and betrayal I felt towards him made me feel sick. I lost lots of weight, couldn’t eat, didn’t want to go out and sank into depression. 'But I think I have made the right decision by choosing Darren, my future is with him now. 'To drag things on with Lewis would’ve been crueller than doing what I did and I’ve come to terms with that now. 'Darren and I have been together, properly, for five months now and are hoping to move in together this year. 'Darren’s hoping to patch things up with Lewis but I’m not holding my breath. We haven’t spoken since the fight, but I hope one day we can all be friends again.' Darren claimed the couple are 'really happy' together. He said: 'It’s a shame what’s happened and I didn’t want to hurt Lewis, but at the end of the day I’ve found Emma and that’s what counts. 'Lewis will find someone else, he’s a good-looking lad and I hope one day we can be friends again.' Lewis said: 'I’m getting over it. But I still think it’s a nasty thing to do. 'I feel quite embarrassed about it. I don’t know if I’ll ever be friends with my dad again, well definitely not while he’s with her. 'I’ve just got to get over it and I am.'",Emma Schofield confesses how she broke her fiance Lewis Walker's heart when she revealed her love for his estranged father Darren .

"Many single women might at some point have thought that losing an extra ten pounds or having a slightly larger chest and blonde curly hair would be the answer to all of their dating problems. But imagine if the shoe was on the other foot - if your petite figure, pretty face and long golden locks made it hard to find a man because you are TOO pretty. Paula Jayne Allen, 33, from Chelmsford, Essex, says this is what happened to her when she joined an online dating site five years ago. She said: 'I am a size six, with long blonde hair and blue eyes and have done a bit of modelling in the past. 'When it came to trying to find a man who would see me as more than just 'piece of meat,'  it was so hard. I just felt like eye candy.' Scroll down for video .

Fed up with shallow men approaching her in nightclubs just looking for a one-night stand, Paula tried online dating as a way of finding a man based on a personality match. But after reading MailOnline's interview with size 24 Verity Brown, who has struggled to find a man on dating websites because she is overweight, Paula maintains that it was even harder for her to find a partner on the same sites because men simply saw her as a trophy. She said: 'Verity is thinking that once she has lost this weight, everything will change and all of these men will come out of the woodwork. 'But it doesn't change, in fact it only gets worse. 'You get all of these men wanting one night stands or who want you to sit there, be quiet and just be arm candy. 'I went on two dating websites - Match.com and eHarmony - about five years ago, just before I met my now-husband and it was awful. Paula Jayne's looks have always attracted plenty of attention on nights out . 'I decided to try it because all of the sites guarantee to match you up with someone who shares your interests, so it's more about personality, and I was fed up with all of the men in the bars looking for skirt. 'But it made no difference. 'You'd regularly get people getting in contact just saying, ""Fancy meeting up for a f**k?"" 'You'd get married men just wanting fun and you'd get people saying, ""I just need someone for  one night, can you do me a favour?"" 'It really was truly awful.' Often, Paula also found that men were just interested in using her so that they could impress their friends with a good looking girl on their arm. She said: 'If you did meet people online and then go out for a drink with them away from the websites, they'd take you out to where their mates were and they'd just want you to stand there. Paula Jayne struggled to find a decent man in nightclubs, because they were always 'chasing skirt.' The mother-of-two thought dating sites would be the answer to her problems but found they attracted similar kinds of men. 'If you tried to talk to them and they realised that you have a brain and you actually quite enjoy intelligent conversation, then they wouldn't want to see you again. 'It was really frustrating and very boring. 'Some of them I'd talk to a couple of times online and then they'd take me out in front of their friends  and their male friends would look me up and down and give me the approving look. 'Then their female friends would grab hold of their men and give you the female equivalent of the snarl and you'd think to yourself, 'I'm really not after your man!' 'It got frustrating, it got disheartening and I gave up. 'I must have been on there for a good six months before I just lost faith and gave up. 'I couldn't get anywhere on those sites, it was always sleazebags and people who just wanted to use me and didn't care if I had any opinions on anything or care at all what I thought really.' Paula also used to get a constant stream of requests from married men, who would ask her to be their mistress. Despite her looks hindering her search for a partner, Paula Jayne refused to change her appearance . She said: 'I had married men approach me all of the time saying, 'My marriage is on the rocks, my wife doesn't understand me, I'm hoping you will.' It's like, do you really think I will fall for that? 'You get the sob stories, they would constantly email you expecting a reply. 'I replied saying, ""Do you think I was born yesterday?"" 'They have no shame.' But far from sharing her story in order to brag about her good looks, Paula is actually hoping to inspire women like Verity, who are happy about their larger figures, not to change for a man. She said: 'I was reading the article and I thought that she shouldn't lose weight - it's not the answer to anything. 'Mr Right will be there whether or not she loses the weight - she shouldn't have to change that, she should be happy as she is. Paula Jayne gave up on dating websites and six months later bumped into her now-husband Mark at a friend's party. They are now husband and wife . 'I didn't change a thing about me, even though when I was joining these agencies, all of these men were only interested in one thing. 'But I didn't change anything, I didn't change my hair colour, my size or anything. 'And I still found my husband at the end of it all. 'Just be yourself, no one should have to change. If you're truly happy in who you are you shouldn't have to change a single thing about you, because someone else will love that happiness - it will shine through in everything that you do.' Just a few months after giving up on dating sites, Paula met her now-husband Mark and they have been together for four years. The couple also share two children Molli-Jayne, who is three next month and William, who turned two years old last week. She said: 'I met my husband about 14 years ago in a nightclub, we dated for about three or four months and eventually broke up because he was quite quiet and I was too outgoing. Paula Jayne and her husband Mark with their children William (left) and Molli-Jayne (right) 'But by chance, we happened to bump into each other again ten years down the line. 'I looked him up on Facebook, got in contact, and asked him for a drink and we pretty much haven't been apart since. 'We fell in love straight away again.' Paula is hoping her story will help women who are also struggling to find love to understand that it often has very little to do with something like being overweight. She said 'I know there will be some backlash but I don't mean any of this in that way. 'I've never won awards or used my beauty to get anywhere. 'My best friend is a size 20, but she doesn't care in the slightest - we're like little and large - and but she gets more attention than I do because she has so much confidence. 'It doesn't matter about the size, just whether you are happy in yourself.' Do YOU have any dating horror stories? Or MEN - would you like to defend yourselves?

"The sad absence of Prince Philip from the final glorious tableaux marking the Diamond Jubilee meant the Queen had the opportunity to decide with whom to share the affection of the public on that last open carriage ride through the streets of London to Buckingham Palace. She chose the former Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall. The two women sat side by side, their comfortable level of intimacy plain to see. Prince Charles sat on the seat facing them. How true the old axiom that time changes everything. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Close: Ecstatic crowds cheered the Queen's . carriage procession through the streets of London today as Camilla was . given pride of place next to Her Majesty . The Queen set off with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall instead of Prince Philip, who is in hospital, in an open-topped 1902 State Landau . Friends:  The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall travel together to Buckingham Palace. This year it was . announced that Camilla is to become a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal . Victorian Order to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince . Charles . Some 14 years ago, just 12 months after that crash in Paris in which Princess Diana was killed, Charles went to see his mother. He was looking for approval and . support for his relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles. Since Diana’s . death, his relationship with her had continued to be conducted in the . shadows. He wanted to be able to go out openly . with Camilla, to be seen with her, to take her to the theatre and out to . dinner with friends. The Prince knew the Queen’s approval . would help, and that the first step was to get her to soften her . attitude towards his long-time mistress. It was not a happy meeting. As a . highly placed royal confidante told us then: ‘The Queen told her son she . never wanted to talk about that wicked woman, and wanted nothing to do . with her.’ Her Majesty the Queen arrives at the Grand Entrance to Buckingham Palace. Her husband, Prince Philip, has been watching the events unfold on the television . Birds eye view: Camilla, once derided by Princess Diana as 'that other woman', has been slowly winning the hearts of the public after years on the sidelines . The Queens carriage procession passes through as thousands of excited fans wait to greet her - and Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall . Patriotic: The Queen's carriage procession passes through the capital in front of adoring crowds . Charles was devastated. He couldn’t . understand why his mother had taken so bitterly against the woman he . loved. Nor could he see that his request to the Queen so soon after . Diana’s death was premature. These were the days, of course, when . memories of Princess Diana, accompanied by considerable public anger at . the way she was treated, were still fresh in the nation’s mind. Today, the only mention of the tragic . Princess came four days before the Jubilee weekend from Prince William, . in a touching TV interview recorded not here but in the U.S., where . affection for — and understanding of — Diana remains high. Here, the woman Diana described as the . ‘third person’ in her marriage has not merely been accepted into the . Royal Family. She has clearly turned into its most central figure after . the Queen herself, a vital and trusted lynchpin between the young and . the old. During the four-day Jubilee weekend, . Camilla has never been without a word: here, to the Duchess of . Cambridge; there, to the Queen; an amusing aside with Prince Philip; a . giggle with the young Princes. Throughout the spectacle, she has been . the most animated and relaxed figure in the Royal Family, plugged in to . them all. The truth is that she has become — as we first saw as the . Royals grouped with the Queen on board the Spirit of Chartwell on the . Thames on Sunday — an integral element of the so-called ‘Magnificent . Seven’. Camilla pictured in the distance during the Golden Jubilee pop party at Buckingham Palace in 2002 . All change: Camilla took her place on the front row of the Royal Box as she watched the Diamond Jubilee concert last night showing just how far she's come in 10 years . Time heels: The Queen shares a word and a smile with her daughter-in-law at the Jubilee concert on Monday night. The Duchess of Cornwall was a notable fixture over the Jubilee weekend . These core VIP family figures, in addition to the Queen and Prince Philip, are Charles, Camilla, William, Kate and Harry. So there was Camilla in the spotlight . while Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne — who has always . been frosty towards her elder brother’s wife — were consigned to the . margins on other boats. The reason? A new palace policy of a ‘slimmer’ family focusing on the monarchs and her direct heirs. Harry, too, will probably disappear . from this core group the moment William and Kate have a baby and the . child is old enough to take his or her place in public. Yesterday, not one of these . ‘relegated’ royals was even allowed on the Buckingham Palace balcony . with the Queen when she excitedly took in the RAF Battle of Britain . fly-past salute followed by the Red Arrows. No Anne. No Andrew. No . Edward. Yet a smiling Camilla was there with the other principal royals. How very different from the Queen’s . Golden Jubilee a decade ago, when Diana had been dead a mere five years . and Camilla was a peripheral presence, shepherded carefully out of the . spotlight. Prince Charles on his wedding day to Diana, Princess of Wales, and right, in 2005, after he married the Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall at Windsor . Part of the clan: Camilla stands close to her husband Prince Charles as the senior royals admire the cheering crowd . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wave as they travel along Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and along The Mall was lined by more than 1,000 servicemen . On that occasion, when there was a . concert in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, and Charles went on stage . to give his thanks and pay tribute to his mother, William and Harry were . with him, but there was no sign of Camilla. This time, on Monday night after the . concert watched by tens of thousands round the Victoria Memorial and . down the Mall, when the Prince again paid a warm tribute to ‘Mummy’, the . Duchess of Cornwall was not only on stage with him, but standing . alongside the Queen. For Diana’s friends and millions of supporters, Camilla’s comfortable prominence is bound still to be painful. What has to be said about the Duchess . of Cornwall, however, is that since marrying the Prince of Wales in a . civil ceremony at Windsor in April 2005, she has made a spirited effort . to win over her detractors and has worked hard embedding herself as the . wife of the heir to the throne. Charles’s relaxed and jolly manner . during the past few days can also be ascribed to Camilla’s influence. The raw humour and blue jokes that first attracted him to her at the . start of their epic love affair 40 years ago still make him ‘giggle’. Home and dry: The carriage, built in 1902, was made by Hoopers for Edward VII's coronation. It is pictured here arriving at Buckingham Palace . Home sweet home: The Queen's carriage pulls up outside the palace - luckily the rain that had been threatening held off . Following the carriage procession through Whitehall, the Queen and senior royals will gather on Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch a flypast of Second World War aircraft and the Red Arrows . His confidence and widely praised . speech after Monday night’s concert is not unconnected to her perceived . growing popularity with the people, even though many will never forgive . her for her role in Diana’s tragedy. ‘No one should underestimate how proud . the Prince is of her,’ says a friend. ‘He sees Camilla as a . misunderstood woman who has stuck to her guns. This weekend he has . derived great comfort and pleasure from the fact people have been . applauding Camilla. It’s what he’s always wanted.’ The intervening years, however, have . been difficult for the Queen, who has had to tread a delicate path . between public animosity towards the woman Diana described as the . ‘rottweiler’ and her son’s refusal to give up the woman he loved. Under . the circumstances, the Queen really didn’t have much choice, because the . heir to the throne could hardly go on living indefinitely with a woman . who was not his wife. When they married seven years ago, the . Queen clearly made up her mind to give them her support, hence her . amusing speech at that Windsor Castle wedding breakfast in which the . horse-racing enthusiast Queen welcomed the newlyweds ‘into the winners’ enclosure’. Brolly good fun! The crowd comes down The Mall to see the Queen appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace . A people on the move: Thousands of members of the public are let in to watch the balcony appearance of the Royal family . A huge wave of Diamond Jubilee fans make their way up The Mall to catch a glimpse of the Queen as she makes her way to the balcony of Buckingham Palace . Even the Queen could not have recognised the prescience of her words. Since then, having earlier lost the . wise and close counsel of the Queen Mother and her sister Princess . Margaret, it is no surprise to long-serving courtiers that the mature . and shrewd Camilla has turned herself into someone to whom the Queen . feels she can talk. Indeed, this has made Camilla the ultimate bridge — between Charles and his mother. Whichever way you look at it, hers has certainly been a remarkable transformation from scarlet woman to royal Duchess. And ultimately — who would seriously question it? — to be Queen one day.","After Diana's death in 1997, Queen referred to Camilla as 'that wicked woman' and 'wanted nothing to do with her'

"London Zoo's animals have embraced the Halloween spirit, enjoying a few pumpkin-shaped treats of their own this October 31. Cheeky squirrel monkeys, penguins, a tortoise and a tiger were just some of the animals who were involved in fun and games to celebrate the spooky day. The squirrel monkeys were treated to snacks such as sunflower seeds, monkey nuts and their favourite treat, wax worms, all served in carved pumpkins. Gore-toise! A Galapagos tortoise chows down on a carved pumpkin as a treat for Halloween at London Zoo . A London Zoo keeper said the squirrel monkeys have thoroughly enjoyed the unusual meal time arrangements and the monkey are especially curious. 'The monkeys are so inquisitive, they're going to absolutely adore these pumpkins and they'll be head first in looking for what they can get,' she said. 'Our monkeys are very much like us, so they're like children, extremely inquisitive. They want to explore everything. They love insects and things like that so they'll be foraging around under leaves. So anything new that we put in is really exciting for them.' A London Zoo employee said the squirrel monkeys are very inquisitive and love the filled pumpkins . A squirrel monkey likes what he see as he makes his way down to the carved pumpkins . The staff member said it encourages the whole group to come down and it also encourages all of the natural behaviour that is seen in the wild. 'The more brave ones will be the first down and then some of the younger ones will be holding back so it's fun to watch them all interact.' The penguins, who are located in a walk-through enclosure, also enjoy their own range of Halloween inspired treats with fish attracting their interest in the pumpkins. The pumpkin treats elicit natural behaviours of the monkeys as they explore anything new . It's mine! A tiger also plays with one of the pumpkins during the short video . Speaking to a little boy who asks the keeper if the penguins ever get scared  the keeper says that they are entirely comfortable in their surroundings.' 'No, they're not scared,' she says. 'They've been brought up in this enclosure where it's a walk through. They're used to lots of people coming through. This is their territory if you like so this is their home and they're happy here.'","Monkeys, penguins, a tortoise and a tiger all enjoy Halloween treats .

"It is the end product of the most expensive weapons programme in U.S. history, set back by glitches and overspending, but today marked the first time an F-35C fighter landed on a carrier ship. This video shows the F-35C Lightning II stealth fighter, which has cost the government nearly $400billion so far, touching down on the deck of the USS Nimitz off the coast of San Diego. The operation is being hailed by the Pentagon as a major step forward in the race to get the aircraft operational, after the entire American fleet was grounded earlier this year following an engine fire. Scroll down for video . This is the moment the F-35C fighter landed on the deck of the USS Nimitz for the first time, hailed by the pentagon as a 'landmark moment' in developing the aircraft . The fighter has cost $400billion to develop - the largest weapons programme in U.S. military history - and has been hampered by engine problems and overspending . The plane landed using the tailhook system - a large metal hook which grapples on to a cable laid across the carrier's deck - which has had to be redesigned several times due to problems in development . The F-35 will form the backbone of the US airforce once it is operational, and will also be bought by NATO allies including the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and Turkey. There are three variants - the standard F-35A, designed for conventional takeoff, the F-35B for short take off and vertical landing, and the F-35C which is designed for use on carriers. Aircrew: One . Max speed: 1.6Mach (1,217.3mph) Length: 51ft . Wingspan: 35ft . Max. altitude: 50,000ft . Today marks the first time an F-35C has been landed on a carrier using the tail-hook system, where a large metal hook hanging from the back of the aircraft snags on a cable laid across the deck of the carrier, slowing it down very quickly. Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 joint program office, said the landing was part of a two-week sea-based test that runs until November 17. The sea testing of the plane will give officials key data about the ship's performance on a carrier, and allow any adjustments needed to keep the program on track for initial use by the fleet in 2018. The latest exercises are part of an extensive array of sea tests as the aircraft enters the final phase of its development ahead of an expected 2018 deployment . In video footage the plane can be seen using a tail-hook to land - grappling on to a wire laid across the deck . The F-35 has three variants - the F-35A, designed for conventional runway takeoff, the F-35B, designed for short landing and vertical takeoff, and the F-35C, designed for use on aircraft carriers . Navy test pilot Commander Tony Wilson, who landed the CF-03 aircraft on the Nimitz flight deck just after noon, called it a 'landmark event.' Vice Admiral David Buss, commander of Naval Air Forces, said the landing was 'historic,' noting that it begins 'the integration of the next generation of warfighting capability into our carrier-based wings.' The jet, and a second due to arrive later Monday or Tuesday, will carry out two weeks of testing at sea, the first of three testing phases planned for the carrier variant of the F-35. The jets will perform operational manoeuvres, including various catapult takeoffs and arrested landings using a tailhook that had be redesigned after early test problems on land. The F-35 and its two variants will form the backbone of the U.S. airforce, while NATO partners such as the UK, Canada, Turkey and Italy also expected to buy the aircraft . The fighter is designed to be invisible to radar and can travel at up to 1.6Mach, more than one and a half times the speed of sound . The entire fleet of American planes had to be grounded earlier this year following the discovery of a cracked rotor blade in one of the engines, and an engine fire . Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the program for the Pentagon, said the Navy, Pentagon and contractors had been preparing for the testing for months. The high-tech fighter allows the pilot to fly at up to 1.6 times the speed of sound while being completely invisible to radar. The fighter's helmet contains a display which maps the battlefield below and will even map underneath the plane - allowing the pilot to effectively see through the floor. Graphics projected directly onto the visor inside the helmet give a 360-degree view, with icons representing threats and friendly forces for miles around the aircraft. Two touchscreens display all of the pilot's information, and allow him to immediately share data with commanders at sea, in the air or on the ground. The jet, and a second due to arrive later Monday or Tuesday, will carry out two weeks of testing at sea, the first of three testing phases .","F-35 Lightning II fighter cost $400billion to develop and was hit by delays .

"A self-proclaimed member of 'Hitler's Order' from New Jersey lost custody of his son after he argued the state made no effort to find a psychologist to interview him who was not Jewish. An appeals court labeled the man's arguments 'unpersuasive.' The Hunterdon County man is identified in court papers by a fictitious name Ian and the initials I.H.C. to protect the identity of the 3-year-old boy, known by the factious name Henry. Hateful: A self-proclaimed member of 'Hitler's Order' from New Jersey (not pictured) has lost custody of his 3-year-old son after he argued the state made no effort to find a psychologist to interview him who was not Jewish . The child was removed from his parents shortly after he was born in November 2011. The boy's mother, named in court filings as Daisy, surrendered her parental rights last year. The state had terminated the father's parental rights of three older children in 2012. The Courier News of Bridgewater reported the man argued the state made 'no effort to find an alternative psychologist' who was not Jewish. According to court papers, the state said it attempted to provide the man with anger management, domestic violence and marital counseling. But the state said he refused to comply. The court said the man failed to respond to notices and didn't attend a court hearing because he said he was fearful for his life. Ian said he did not trust law enforcement to protect him because 'law enforcement doesn't care about someone with Swastikas and tattoos.' The father (not pictured), identified by the fictitious name 'Ian,' said he didn't trust law enforcement to protect him because 'law enforcement doesn't care about someone with Swastikas and tattoos' One of his tattoos reads, 'I hate DYFS,' which stands for 'Division of Youth and Family Services' - the former name of Division of Child Protection and Permanency. In his appeal of the state's decision to terminate his custody, Ian argued that the state failed to convey to him that his participation in counseling programs was necessary for him to keep his son. Ian reportedly told a caseworker that he wanted to go to 'federal buildings,' where he believed he had a better shot at winning his case. Court filings from 2010 described Ian as an abused child whose medical and psychological disabilities resulted in his being illiterate and unemployed his entire life.","The 3-year-old child was removed from his parents' New Jersey home shortly after he was born in November 2011 .

"A shocked animal lover who found the partially-eaten carcass of a deer nicknamed 'Bambi' on his lawn is convinced it was attacked by a panther. John Griffin, who found the deer's body in his country garden, was shocked when he found the small deer's body lying on the grass in Billingshurst, West Sussex. The small deer was given free reign to eat windfall apples under his trees and became such a regular that neighbours nicknamed it Bambi. This small deer, known as Bambi, often visited John Griffin's garden in Billingshurst, West Sussex where it had free reign of the windfall apples . But he found the carcass of the small animal on his lawn - and is convinced it was attacked by a panther . Now Mr Griffin is convinced the animal was attacked by some sort of giant cat - because he says no other native predator could do such a 'thorough job' of pulling the carcass apart. Mr Griffin said: 'The remains had been stripped of all flesh, and I don't know of any native predator that could do such a thorough job. 'The carcass was completely bare. I don't know what could've stripped it so quickly.' Neighbours in the rural village say there have been several big cat sightings in recent weeks, which Mr Griffin thinks could be behind the incident. He said: 'My son's friend said he'd seen two animals run across the road in front of him that looked like wild cats, almost panther size.' Mr Griffin said he did not know of any native predator that 'could do such a thorough job' of stripping the carcass . Neighbours in the rural village say there have been several big cat sightings in recent weeks, which Mr Griffin thinks could be behind the shocking incident . Huge cat sightings have become common throughout Sussex over the last 20 years, according to one of Britain's big cat experts. Derek Bilston, of Sussex Big Cat Watch, said: 'We know from countless sightings over the years that the most likely candidates are puma, mountain lions, leopards or a black panther. 'These are the two most seen or described animals. 'That is not to say that the animals are puma or leopard only that these are the descriptions that best fit the picture that witnesses are trying to describe.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Young cancer doctors are struggling to cope with the high demands of their job, a major study has found. Across Europe, more than 70 per cent of oncologists under the age of 40 are showing symptoms of burnout that may affect their ability to care for patients, it is claimed. The findings, from a survey of 595 doctors in 41 European countries, were presented at the annual congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology in Spain. Young doctors are struggling to cope with the high demands of their job, a major study has found . Lead author Dr Susana Banerjee, a . consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Trust in London, . said: 'Oncology is an exceptionally rewarding career but it can be . demanding and stressful at times. 'Oncologists make complex decisions about cancer management, supervise the use of toxic therapies, work long hours and continually face patients suffering and dying. 'Furthermore, young oncologists are now facing increased administration, complaints/medico-legal issues, increasing expectations and workload with reduced resources. 'Taken together, these factors make oncologists at risk of developing burnout, a syndrome characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation (treating people as if they are objects) and loss of meaning or purpose in work.' Burnout can lead to serious consequences including anxiety, depression, alcohol or substance abuse, and suicide, she said. Burned-out doctors may also find it challenging to deliver compassionate, high-quality care to their patients. The study showed that rates of burnout varied significantly across Europe. They were highest in central Europe, where 84 per cent of participants met the symptom criteria. Lowest rates were found in the northern European countries, including the UK, where just over half (52 per cent) of young oncologists were affected. Burnout can lead to serious consequences including anxiety, depression, alcohol or substance abuse, and suicide, the study found . Men and women were not significantly more likely to suffer burnout, but men showed higher levels of depersonalisation. Factors linked to a higher risk of developing burnout were a poor work/life balance, lack of holiday time, not being in a relationship, living alone and not having children. Burnout was also more likely in hospitals with small workforces, higher numbers of patients and no access to support services. Dr Banerjee added: 'I believe, as a profession, doctors have a duty to try and address this growing issue at all levels - from universities, individual hospitals and professional societies such as Esmo. 'Burnout should not be stigmatised as a weakness. We need to support colleagues by focusing on recovery and prevention.' Achieving a good work/life balance was vital and could involve interests outside daily clinical practice such as research, teaching and mentoring, as well as hobbies, exercise and spending time with family and friends, she said. Dr Raffaele Califano, chair of Esmo's Young Oncologists' Committee, urged young doctors not to be put off becoming oncologists. He said: 'This specialty remains one of the most fascinating and rewarding where physicians can make a huge difference in patient outcomes and quality of life.'","More than 70% of oncologists under 40 are showing signs of burnout .

"Israeli drink maker SodaStream International Ltd. will relocate a factory next year that activists criticized for being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a representative said Wednesday. Nirit Hurwitz said that the decision to move the facility to Lehavim in Israel's southern Negev region is for 'purely commercial' reasons and is not connected to pressure from Palestinian activists who had boycotted the company because of its location. Activists launched a campaign boycotting the company because of the factory being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a territory captured by Israel in 1967 that's claimed by the Palestinians. Scroll down for videos . Shutting down: The controversial West Bank SodaStream factory (pictured) will close its doors in 2015, comapny officials announced this week . Hurwitz said the new location received a $20 million grant from the Israeli government. The new location 'will become our flagship manufacturing site and is expected to deliver operational excellence and result in savings of 2 percent across our entire cost base.' she said. The Palestinian boycott campaign welcomed the announced move, saying its boycott caused retailers to drop SodaStream. The Israeli company, which signed on Scarlett Johansson as their first Global Brand Ambassador, runs three factories in the occupied West Bank and many say the company is taking advantage of the Palestinian residents who have few other employment options. Johansson ended an eight-year role as an Oxfam goodwill ambassador early this year after causing an uproar by appearing in ads for the company. SodaStream says it employs hundreds of Palestinians and gives them equal benefits as Israeli workers. Most of them are from nearby West Bank towns. Controvery: Johansson ended an eight-year role as an Oxfam goodwill ambassador early this year after causing an uproar by appearing in ads for the company . Scarlett Johansson controversially appeared in an advertisement for SodaStream at Super Bowl XLVIII . The company's chief executive Daniel Birnbaum told the Independent in February: . 'We purchase special health insurance for our 500 Palestinian employees so that we can be sure they have coverage for things like emergency surgery and organ transplants,' Officials say there were no financial incentives to base the company on the controversial Mishor Adumim and insisted Sodastream has no political agenda. For Palestinian workers from Ramallah, the new facility will be 107 kilometers (66 miles) away. For those from Hebron, it will be 48 kilometers (29 miles) away. 'We are offering all employees the opportunity to join us in Lehavim, and specifically, we are working with the Israeli government to secure work permits for our Palestinian employees,' Birnbaum said. Boycott or no, sales of SodaStream's soda machines have been weak in the United States as consumers in the company's biggest market opt for healthier drinks such as juices and teas over sodas. 'Our third quarter performance was pressured by challenging selling conditions for soda makers and flavors primarily in the U.S.,'  Birnbaum said, adding that performance outside the United States was mixed. Defending their methods: 'We purchase special health insurance for our 500 Palestinian employees so that we can be sure they have coverage for things like emergency surgery and organ transplants,' said the company's chief executive Daniel Birnbaum in February while giving a tour of the facility . Good for all? An Israeli-Arab factory worker gives the thumbs-up to the camera as SodaStream officials gave a tour of their facility in the West Bank early this year . Birnbaum announced a 'comprehensive growth plan' meant to return SodaStream to profitable growth. As part of that plan, the company said it would be shutting down and relocating operations from two facilities into a new plant. It would also discontinue certain beverage makers and flavors at a cost of about $20 million to the company. The financial impact of those two moves will be spread out from the fourth quarter into 2015. 'We are fully committed to getting the company back on track,' Birnbaum said. It was reported in July that SodaStream was in talks with an investment firm to be taken private in a deal valuing the company at $828 million. SodaStream's shares received a boost last week when it said it would sell some PepsiCo Incbrands such as Pepsi Homemade, that are not sold in stores in a limited test. SodaStream said third-quarter revenue was $125.9 million, down from $144.6 million a year earlier. net profit was $9.5 million versus $16.4 million a year earlier. The company lowered its forecast for all of 2014, saying revenue was expected to decrease about 9 percent from $562.7 million in 2013, and profit was expected to drop about 42 percent from $42.0 million in 2013. Previously the company had forecast a 5 percent drop in both revenue and profit from 2013.

"A woman was sexually assaulted by a group of teenagers wearing Scream-type masks (pictured) on Friday night in Denton, Greater Manchester . A woman has been sexually assaulted by a group of teenagers, who were  wearing Scream masks, on the evening of Halloween. The 22-year-old victim was approached by four youths, who were all wearing the mask, before she was dragged to the ground and sexually assaulted  in Denton, Greater Manchester on Friday night. The woman managed to fight them off and raised the alarm. One of the teenagers was described as 'chubby' and in his early teens while another was tall and wearing white trainers. The attackers were all wearing dark clothing. The 'Ghostface' type masks were made famous by cult horror film Scream. Greater Manchester Police said the woman was walking along Sunningdale Road in the Haughton Green area of Denton when she was attacked. Superintendent Neil Evans said: 'This young woman has suffered a traumatic ordeal at the hands of four individuals who were dressed in Halloween-type masks. 'She was pushed to the floor and sexually assaulted, leaving her in a state of total shock, and clearly she is extremely distressed. 'Anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault will know just how frightening it must have been for this victim, and given the offenders were wearing masks designed to be scary means it must have been a truly harrowing and scary few minutes for this woman.' He added: 'The purpose of this appeal is not to unduly alarm the community but it is important we let people know what has happened so they can both be vigilant and help us track down these cowardly offenders. 'If you know of anyone who might be involved, then please call us. 'If you are a parent and you know your child went out with friends dressed in these type of masks and you have suspicions then, please, do the right thing and call us. 'This woman has suffered a terrible ordeal and we need, for her sake and the wider community, to catch the culprits. 'We are conducting a number of inquiries in the local community and I want to assure people we will do everything we can to find those responsible.' Greater Manchester Police (headquarters pictured) are investigating following the sexual assault on Friday . A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said no arrests have been made and there have been no significant updates so far. Police are appealing for anyone who has information about the assault to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. A few hours later, one man was injured and his wife and child left in shock after they were attacked by a man wearing a Scream-mask and two accomplices on Halloween night. The young family was walking home from a party in Abingdon, Oxon, at 1am on Saturday morning when the trio struck. The masked man and his accomplices all punched the 30-year-old repeatedly after barging his shoulder as he walked behind his wife and child. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'Three men approached the victim, one of them pushed him to the shoulder and punched him to the side of the head. 'The other two offenders also punched the victim before running away towards the town centre. 'The victim sustained bruising and swelling to his right eye and his face but did not require hospital treatment,' said the spokesman. 'The first offender was white and under 6ft tall. He was wearing a Scream mask, a black top and blue jeans and a grey hooded top with the hood up. 'The second man was white, aged in his early 20s, under 6ft tall and was wearing a black cap, a dark top and dark hair. He had fake blood on his face. 'The third offender was white, under 6ft tall and was wearing dark clothing,' added the spokesman. Police have not named the victim but appealed for help from the public to catch the trio as quickly as possible.","Victim was sexually assaulted by four youths wearing the masks in Denton .

"An 18-year-old mother has been arrested after a sickening photo of her crying 14-month-old son hanging from a hook by his shirt was posted on Facebook. Alexis Breeden from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, took the disturbing image of the youngster suspended from a door frame with what appears to be a top pulled around his neck. The picture was believed to have been put on Facebook by the boy's father in retaliation after he had an argument with Breeden. Sickening: Alexis Breeden from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, took the image of her 14-month-old son suspended from a door frame with what appears to be a top pulled around his neck . It was then shared by a number of other people before users began to send it to the sheriff's office Facebook page. The mother then turned herself in after a felony warrant was issued for her arrest last week. After police visited the child at home, she reportedly wrote on Facebook: 'They think this was immature and dumb of me but saw I was playing and no one needs to know everything going on because some of you aren't parents and no one knows the full story.' Sgt. James Konicki with the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office told CBS 6: 'We had it assigned to a criminal investigation detective through the child victim unit. 'When she responded, she did an investigation and found that it wasn't a nail, it was actually a planter hook that the child was hanging from. But the child was absolutely fine.' Arrested: The 18-year-old mother is now facing child abuse charges after being released on bond . 'The baby's father and mother had an argument and in retaliation the father posted this on Facebook to get the mother in trouble.' Konicki added that the father of the child was not involved in the alleged abuse. Breeden was released on a $2500 and is now facing child abuse charges. A press release from the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office read: 'On October 29, 2014, the Spotslyvania Sheriff's Office was made aware of an image that was circulating on Facebook. 'The imafe was of a child that appeared to be suspended from a door frame and in distress. 'The photograph was immediately forwarded to the Sheriff's office Facebook page at which point the case was opened and an arrest made shortly after.

At the culmination, he plans to choose a spouse. Scroll down for video . The page has already garnered 500 likes and a torrent of media coverage . Luke D’Astoli, 34, created a Facebook page called Get Lucky With Luke, which he plans to use to find a spouse . The page, which was created last Sunday, has already garnered 500 likes and a torrent of media coverage. Mr D’Astoli was fed up meeting women in the usual places and wanted to try something new. ‘I knew I needed to meet some people. Most of the time I was meeting partners through work which is obviously not ideal, and I don’t really do the whole nightlife thing anymore.' ‘I also get a bad impression from dating sites and Tinder. It’s so time consuming, and I don’t think rejecting people to that degree is really very healthy.' When asked if his page was not going to involve a likewise process of rejection, he replied ‘not at all. This is going to have some proper interaction, rather than just mindlessly swiping away.’ ‘Plus, this way I get to be the centre of the operation, rather than just being one in the thousands online.’ Mr D’Astoli runs his own personal training business in Melbourne. He says that finding romance through work is 'not ideal' Mr D’Astoli says he has already found some possible romantic matches, and he plans to set some dates in the next week . Mr D’Astoli says his friends have been very supportive, with scores of them sharing the page and tagging potential partners. And he’s already found prospective matches. ‘I've already had some promising contacts who I plan to meet with. I'll be setting a time and seeing who is available on the day, then using the advice of some close friends to narrow down the process after the date.’ When asked if he was concerned the criticism Blake from the Bachelor received for embarking on a comparable venture, he said ‘there are parallels, but ultimately I think those bachelor guys act pretty ingenuine. If you’re straightforward and act with authenticity, I think you can’t go wrong.’ Mr D’Astoli plans to start posting a date schedule in the next week.","Luke D’Astoli has created a Facebook page called Get Lucky With Luke .

"When it comes to opening himself to ridicule, Nick Clegg appears to need no help. But yesterday it was his wife’s words that caused titters at the Deputy Prime Minister’s expense. Miriam Gonzalez Durantez told an interviewer: ‘Women have been faking lots of things during history’. In a light-hearted response to a question about how schoolgirls could be more confident, the 46-year-old Spaniard said with a laugh: ‘My answer to them is always, “Look, if you don’t have it, you fake it”.' In a light-hearted response to a question about how schoolgirls could be more confident, the 46-year-old Spaniard said with a laugh: ‘My answer to them is always, “Look, if you don’t have it, you fake it”.' Non-traditional: Clegg walked down into the audience to hug his wife at the Lib Dem Conference . She added: ‘Women have been faking lots of things during history. So if you are going to fake something, fake self-confidence.’ Miss Gonzalez Durantez – a highly successful corporate lawyer – was speaking on the first anniversary of the launch of her Inspiring the Future: Inspiring Women campaign. She told the London Evening Standard that although her husband went to exclusive Westminster School, she wants her children – Miguel, 12, Antonio, seven, and Alberto, five – to go through the state school system. She added: ‘Everyone picks on Eton, but it is a serious point. If you dress in tailcoats it doesn’t make you any cleverer, but it makes you feel part of an elite. ‘This is the 21st Century. You cannot buy your place into the elite. You have to earn it. There is not a shortcut. Whether you are at Eton, or [a state school in] Islington, you have to work – you cannot bluff forever.’ She said she ‘cannot understand’ why a state-educated girl should ‘feel that she is any less than a boy who dresses up in tailcoats to learn maths’. High powered: Despite playing second fiddle at political events, Miriam is hugely successful in  her own right . Inspiring: Mrs Clegg speaks to schoolgirls during an event at Basildon Upper School in Essex last January . Backing the campaign: Easyjet CEO Carolyn McCall and the BBC's Fiona Bruce are also backing the campaign . Miss Gonzalez Durantez – who is reported to earn far more than Mr Clegg’s £134,565 salary – wants to see women make the best careers they can and is campaigning to introduce girls to a broad range of female role models. She also said last night she feared women would be turned away from certain school subjects due to preconceived ideas, adding: ‘Lots give up maths and science – what they call “hard subjects” – because they think that they will look like geeks, or that they are not going to be attractive to boys’. She said she wanted to make these subjects ‘cool’ through her campaign, which aims to sign up 15,000 volunteers to talk to 250,000 girls about their careers. Miss Gonzalez Durantez has long refused to play the role of typical politician’s wife. Earlier this month, she shunned party conference tradition by not kissing her husband on stage after his keynote speech.","The Deputy Prime Minister's wife was speaking at the launch of a campaign .

"A group of masked clowns attacked a young man's face with cavity filler during a terrifying Halloween prank. Michael Day feared he would lose his sight after the reckless pranksters sprayed the quick-drying filler over his face as he was walking home from a party in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, on Saturday. The 21-year-old initially thought he had been struck was shaving foam but began to panic when it began to solidify around his face, fusing his eyes together. Michael Day was sprayed with cavity filler by a group of masked clowns during a terrifying Halloween attack in Southend-on-Sea, Essex . The 21-year-old initially thought he had been struck was shaving foam but began to panic when it began to solidify around his face, fusing his eyes together . He said: 'They came at me from behind and even though they had masks I get the feeling they were younger than me. 'I think it was meant to be a prank and they did not realise that cavity filler solidifies. It was a stupid thing to do. I could have lost my sight.' After the attack, Mr Day had to shave off all his hair because hospital staff said there was no other way of removing the hardened foam. He added: 'At first I just thought they had sprayed shaving foam on me. 'It was when I got back to my mum's house and it would not come off that I realised what had happened. 'My clothes are ruined and I have had to shave all my hair off. On Sunday I went to the hospital to see if they could help get it off my skin, but they said there was nothing they could give me.' The young man, who feared he would lose his sight as it began to solidify around his eyes, had to shave off his hair because the filler could not be removed . His mother Lyn Day is urging witnesses to come forward so she can track down her son's attackers. She said: 'When he arrived he was covered in the cavity filler. It was all over his clothes and hair. 'As we tried to get the foam off it was taking parts of his skin with it and it looked as though the chemicals were burning his skin. 'I just want to warn people that this has been going on.'

"Cockroaches are known to be able to survive a nuclear explosion – and once day they could be saving trapped victims in a variety of disasters. Researchers have fitted the hardy creatures with electrical backpacks complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds. The idea is that cyborg cockroaches, or ‘biobots’, could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes, for example, and help emergency workers find survivors. Scroll down for video . Rise of the robo-roach: Scientists have developed technology that allows cyborg cockroaches, or biobots (pictured) to pick up sounds with small microphones and seek out the source of the sound. They could one day be used in emergency situations to detect survivors . ‘In a collapsed building, sound is the best way to find survivors,’ said Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at North Carolina State University. ‘The goal is to use the biobots with high-resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that don't matter - like a leaking pipe. ‘Once we've identified sounds that matter, we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero-in on where those sounds are coming from.’ Cockroaches to the rescue? Cyborg cockroaches, or ‘biobots’ could one day enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes and help emergency works find survivors. A rescue worker searching for victims is pictured . Professor Bozkurt's team has recently demonstrated technology that creates an invisible fence for keeping biobots in a defined area. This is significant because it could be used to keep them at a disaster site and to keep the biobots within range of each other so that they can be used as a reliable mobile wireless network. The technology could also be used to steer biobots to light sources, so that tiny solar panels on biobot backpacks can be recharged. The ‘backpacks’ control the robo-roach's movements because they are wired to the insect’s cerci - sensory organs that cockroaches usually use to feel if their abdomens brush against something. By electrically stimulating the cerci, cockroaches can be prompted to move in a certain direction. In fact, they have been programmed to seek out sound. One type of 'backpack' is equipped with an array of three directional microphones to detect the direction of the sound and steer the biobot in the right direction towards it. Another type is fitted with a single microphone to capture sound from any direction, which can be wirelessly transmitted - perhaps in the future to emergency workers. They ‘worked well’ in lab tests and the experts have developed technology that can be used as an ‘invisible fence’ to keep the biobots in a certain area such as a disaster area, the researchers announced at the IEEE Sensors 2014 conference in Valencia, Spain. A previous study led by Dr Edgar Lobaton, who is also at the university, showed that biobots can be used to map a disaster area. Dr Lobaton and Professor Bozkurt plan on merging their research to both map disaster areas and pinpoint survivors. The idea of turning cockroaches into cyborg slaves is not new, Gizmodo reported. Kits are available for under $100 (£63) that enable people to control their own insect by stimulating its antennae with electrical signals. This lets people 'drive' an insect for a few minutes. While the creators of the 'Roboroach kit' claim the cockroach forgets the experience after 20 minutes, some people think it is cruel.","Researchers at North Carolina State University have fitted cockroaches with electrical 'backpacks' to control their movement .

"Demonstrators blocked streets around Oakland police headquarters and chained shut four of the building's doors Monday to protest recent grand jury decisions not to indict white officers who killed unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. Police made 25 arrests as the protesters also chained themselves to the doors and prevented people from getting inside.

Both demonstrations were peaceful, Oakland police said. Oakland and neighboring Berkeley have seen numerous protests - some violent - since grand juries recently declined to indict white officers in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City. Both men were black and unarmed. An Oakland police officer uses bolt cutters to free protestors who chained themselves to the front door of police headquarters .

Monday's protest in Oakland came a night after Brown's father visited a San Francisco church to thank those who supported his family, and after artists claimed responsibility for hanging three cardboard images of black lynching victims at a Northern California university. A note posted at the University of California, Berkeley, said the effigies were meant to provoke thought about a systemic history of violence against blacks. Campus authorities said Monday they no longer view the life-size effigies as a hate crime.","Police made 25 arrests as the protesters also chained themselves to the doors and prevented people from getting inside .

"The cruise ship entertainer who sent a young Gold Coast woman 1439 text messages in the weeks before she plummeted to her death allegedly emailed a former girlfriend a 34-point memo where he outlined the reasons 'why she is not worthy'. Last month, Dan Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail for using a carriage service to menace and harass his cheerleader girlfriend Breeana Robinson, 21, before she plunged to her death in January 2013. Former partner Kate Ostrowska, 35, has since revealed she allegedly received a lengthy email message from an account in Shearin’s name in 2010. It was just one of the 'nasty' alleged incidents that occurred during and after their tumultuous relationship. ‘He sent me and my friend (an) email with a 34 point list,’ Ms Ostrowska told Daily Mail Australia.

Tragedy: Breeana Robinson, 21, pictured with boyfriend and cruise ship entertainer Dan Shearin . Breeana Robinson, pictured left in both images, was bombarded with 1439 text messages by ex-boyfriend Dan Shearin in the month before she took her own life . Horror scene: Ms Robinson fell from their luxury H20 Broadwater complex in Southport, on the Gold Coast . The email featured the subject line 'Things for Kate to see a councilor (sic)' and branded Ms Ostrowska 'selfish, stubborn, nasty, psychotic'. It criticised her sexual performance and physical appearance and complained that she 'won't clean or cook'. The note described her as 'jealous, two-faced, hates men', saying she 'always thinks she is the victim' and 'has no heart', among multiple other insults. Ms Ostrowska first met Shearin while working on a cruise ship in 2005. The pair struck up a relationship over Facebook in 2010 and she soon came to Australia to meet with him. 'He was the perfect man for me,' she told Daily Mail Australia, saying the two talked together about love and their future life. But when she came to Australia, Ms Ostrowska, from Poland, said their relationship quickly took a turn for the worst, with Shearin becoming ‘very controlling’ towards her. Shearin has written a book, Confessions of a Cruise Ship Singer . Mr Shearin poses with two waitresses . ‘I ALWAYS had to say sorry, and it was always my fault,’ Ms Ostrowska said. After their relationship ended, Ms Ostrowska said was receiving threatening Facebook messages from unknown people, who she believed was Shearin, until May 2014. 'You look disgusting,' said one message, seen by Daily Mail Australia as being sent from a woman's Facebook account. On January 29, 2013, Shearin's girlfriend Breeana Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport, at 10.35pm. She had just returned from cheerleading practice. The athletic but slight young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. 'I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection': Excerpts from Dan Shearin's Facebook page. Breanna Robinson was bombarded with 1439 text messages in the month before she took her own life . A court heard that in one text sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin wrote: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'. In another text, Shearin wrote to Breanna: 'You're a complete f---ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c---'. Shearin pleaded guilty to harassing Ms Robinson with his phone. According to reports, he is planning to appeal his six month sentence. A former star of So You Think You Can Dance told Daily Mail Australia in October that Ms Robinson was a 'beautiful soul'. Anthony Ikin, who runs a Gold Coast dance studio and has performed in Paris at the Moulin Rouge, said Ms Robinson - herself a talented dancer who was legally blind - was an inspiration to him. He called her his 'beautiful Bree'. 'I was just as big of a fan of hers as she was with me,' Mr Ikin told Daily Mail Australia from Los Angeles, where he is on tour. 'Her courage, strength and never-give-up attitude inspired me throughout my career. That time she came and watched me in Paris at the Moulin Rouge was magical.'","Cruise entertainer Dan Shearin was sentenced to six months imprisonment over bombarding Breanna Robinson with text messages .

"Google will be forced to reveal who leaked the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer after Marvel was granted a court order to compel the information. A federal judge approved the Disney-owned company's request for a far-reaching subpoena against the tech giant two weeks after the video was made public before it's scheduled release date. Marvel said in court documents that someone using the name 'John Gazelle' posted a file of the film, which stars Robert Downey Jr and Chris Hemsworth, on a Google Drive account. Scroll down for video . Google will be forced to reveal who leaked the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer after Marvel was granted a court order to compel the information . A federal judge approved the Disney-owned company's request for a far-reaching subpoena. Pictured is Ultron, the titular villain in the new movie . A Disney lawyer sent Google a takedown notice requesting the tech company to remove the file due to breach of copyright. The subpoena, issued two days ago, said Google has to bring 'all identifying information for the user 'John Gazelle' to court on November 18 in San Francisco. But Judge Richard Wieking did not grant Marvel's request to 'permit entry onto the designated premises, land, or other property possessed or controlled by you at the time, date, and location set forth.' Google was told: 'You are commanded to produce at the time, date, and place set forth below the following documents, electronically stored information, or objects, and to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the material.' Ironic: The clip begins with Ultron stating, 'I'm gonna show you something beautiful' A subpoena is a writ issued by a government agency, most often a court, which has the authority to compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure. It is possible that the company is looking for an infringer either inside Marvel or Disney or a production house handling the prized trailer. After the leak, Marvel released the official version of the trailer the same day - days ahead of its schedule debut. The leaked video paints a bleak and eerie picture for the sequel to the hit 2012 Marvel film. The band of superheroes can be seen looking defeated and on the verge of giving up hope as the world around them goes to chaos.

'It is up to The Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.' And this is no easy task, as Ultron, voiced by James Spader, certainly seems to have the upper hand for much of the film. He narrates the video in an ominous and gravelly voice, relishing the destruction he has caused.","Google will be forced to reveal who leaked the Avengers trailer last month .

"A mother has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after her 16-year-old daughter died two years ago weighing just 43 pounds. Ebony Berry, 37, from Smyrna, Georgia, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and child cruelty charges in Cobb County on Tuesday for the death of her daughter, Markea. Prosecutors had agreed to drop murder charges against Berry, who they said did not withhold food but failed to seek proper medical care for the teen, who had eating disorders including anorexia and bulimia. 'But just because the victim had an eating disorder does not absolve this defendant from responsibility in this death,' Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Lindsay Gardner said. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Ebony Berry, pictured in Cobb County court on Tuesday, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for failing to get her teenage daughter help as she slowly starved to death in 2012 . 'Had she gotten the victim the help she needed, there’s a chance Markea would be here today.' As Markea's weight plummeted, her mother did not take her to a doctor; the girl did not receive medical care at all in the three years before her death. Ebony Berry also waited more than an hour to call for help after finding her daughter unresponsive on a mattress in the family home in June 2012, prosecutors said. Instead, during that time, she called her parents and tended to her three other children, authorities said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Loss: Markea Berry, left, suffered from multiple eating disorders, prosecutors said, and died weighing just 43 pounds. Her mother, right, only called 911 after finding her unresponsive in her bedroom in June 2012 . Scene: Before dying at her family's home in Smyrna, pictured, Markea had not been to the doctors in 3 years . The defense team argued that Berry, who had a newborn at the time, was overwhelmed with raising her four children and could not give the teenager the care she needed, WXIA reported. Earlier reports revealed that one night in 2010, Markea had run away to a Walmart and told cops she had not wanted to be a 'burden' on her mother. After the incident, both a caseworker and supervisor with the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services noted that girl was undernourished, but the case was closed and Berry failed to get her daughter any medical care. On Tuesday, she was sentenced to 30 years behind bars and 10 on probation. She is not allowed to have any contact with children and must undergo mental evaluations while on probation. Imprisoned: Berry's defense team said she was overwhelmed with caring for her four children at the time . 'I just want to apologize for everybody having to come out today for my situation and my circumstances involving my daughter,' Berry told the court, WTSB reported. Berry, who has been in jail since her June 2012 arrest, will get credit for time served. Her three other children are now being cared for by her aunt in Michigan.

"A lot of women bemoan the constant presence of sexual images in advertising, particularly the over sexualisation of women to sell products to both sexes. However, new research shows that while women do exhibit negative reactions to sexual imagery, this diminishes for high value products that are viewed as exclusive or designed for the elite. It seems women don’t mind sex being used to products we deem as high-end, rare and glamorous, and psychologists suggest that this is because it mirrors their view of sex in general. Research has shown that women instinctively have a negative reaction to overtly sexualised advertising . Evolutionary psychology suggest that women dislike sexual imagery as it diminishes the value of sex, making it more likely their partner will cheat . The study, conducted by the University of Minnesota and published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, suggests that evolutionarily women have a vested interest in sex being portrayed to men and other women as something special and rare, something to be highly valued. Perpetuating this view makes it less likely that another woman will attempt to hoodwink your partner into bed, or that your man will stray, leaving him attached to and providing for you and your children. ‘Women generally show spontaneous negative attitudes toward sexual images,’ says psychological scientist Kathleen Vohs, a researcher at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. ‘Sexual economics theory offers a reason why: The use of sexual imagery is inimical to women’s vested interest in sex being portrayed as infrequent, special, and rare.’ Pamela Anderson in an old Pizza Hut TV advert in which she gets the brush off by a group of men, who favour a pizza instead of her . Women don't seem to mind sexual imagery if it is associated with a high value product . Vohs and colleagues predicted that . women’s negative attitudes toward sexual imagery might soften if sex is . depicted in a way that is consistent with the values of sex being seen . as highly valued and of great worth. This Gucci swimwear may not offend women, despite being very sexual as it is for a brand seen as high-end and exclusive . Sexual imagery may be less . off-putting to women, for example, if it is paired with high-priced . consumer goods, which can convey exclusivity and high value. To test this prediction, Vohs and colleagues Jaideep Sengupta and Darren Dahl had male and female participants come to the lab and view advertisements for women’s watches. In some of the advertisements, the watch was presented with a sexually explicit image, whereas in others the watch was pictured with a majestic mountain range. Importantly, some of the ads priced the watch at $10 and others at $1,250. To measure the participants’ gut reactions toward the ads, the researchers had them memorize a 10-digit code before viewing the ads, a cognitive distraction designed to prevent them from thinking too deeply about the ads. Then, after reciting the code, participants were asked about their attitudes and emotional reactions toward the ads. Overall, women who saw the sexual imagery with the cheap watch rated the ad more negatively in comparison to women who saw the sexual imagery with the pricey watch. These negative ratings seem to be driven by women’s negative emotions — feeling upset, disgusted, unpleasantly surprised, or angry — in response to the ad that paired sexual imagery with the cheap watch. Men, on the other hand, reported similar reactions to the sex-based ads, regardless of the advertised price of the watch.","Research by University of Minnesota, published in Psychological Science .

"Most of us are all too familiar with the rage that ensues when fiddly plastic tags defy all attempts to remove them. But Marks and Spencer has come up with a solution in the shape of a new set of easy-open ties - that will be launched just in time for Christmas. The brainchild of the team at Design Futures, which is based at Sheffield Hallam University, PaperTies are made from recyclable paper and lock the product in place. Impossible: Many of us will be all too familiar with the challenges involved in prising toys from their boxes . Like the traditional plastic variety, they keep toys secured in their box but can be torn away with ease - finally eliminating packaging rage. The new design is part of the British high street brand's bid to boost its eco credentials, with the company hoping to become the world's most sustainable major retailer by 2020. As a result of innovations already in place, the company has already reduced by two billion the number of plastic bags it uses and sends zero waste to landfill. M&S has also become the first retailer to receive the triple award of certification for achievements in carbon, water and waste reduction from the Carbon Trust. But while the company's green plans are good news for the environment, for customers, getting rid of irritating plastic ties is set to prove the icing on the cake. The ties, which use a stronger, more flexible version of regular paper, have already been rolled out in the toy department, and will later be used across several product ranges. New and improved: M&S toys such as this Butterfly Rattle are now held in place with easy-open paper ties . Ever hopeful: With Christmas on the way, M&S hope the new packaging will come in handy for parents . Speaking about the new look packaging, Alex Hill, Senior Packaging Technologist, General Merchandise, at M&S said: 'Getting toys out of their packaging can be a big frustration for consumers and we have been working really hard over the last 18 months to find a solution. 'The PaperTies are designed to be as effective as plastic or metal ties, but can be torn easily - no more accidents trying to cut plastic and wire ties on Christmas Day, and no more frustrated children waiting to play with their new toy.' 'Our design team devised the initial concept for the ties as a direct response to the frustration caused by hard to open toy packaging,' added John Kirkby, creative director at Design Futures. 'We identified a new paper material that is very strong and used it to create a user focused way of holding products in packs. 'Not only is the product much easier to open but the material is better for the environment. It is very exciting to see the team at M&S develop our initial idea and take it to market.'","M&S has rolled out PaperTies across its toy department ahead of Christmas .

Taking into account every second of every English player's performances in the Premier League this season, EA have provided a balanced squad of the 23 most in-form players, and from that a best XI.

Berahino - the highest-rated player in the squad - is one of three West Brom players picked, making them the joint-most represented club along with Southampton and West Ham. City and United, meanwhile, have the same number of representatives in the squad (1) as Crystal Palace, Hull, QPR and Stoke. Just nine of England's World Cup squad make the 23, but the centre back pairing from Brazil of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka are retained in the XI. Of Hodgson's last starting XI, who played Estonia last month, only four make the EA XI. Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench in that match, is one star name who does make the cut, as does his Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson. There is no place in the squad for Jack Wilshere, with West Ham's Mark Noble starting in midfield alongside Henderson.

"James Bond may have liked his shaken, not stirred, but now there’s a machine that makes cocktails that float in mid-air. British scientists have created what they claim is the world’s first levitating cocktail machine, which uses sound waves to suspend tiny droplets of alcohol that drinkers can lick out of the air. So far  inventor Charlie Harry Francis has served Gin and Tonic and Bloody Mary cocktails using the quirky machine. Bottoms up! British scientists have created what they claim is the world’s first levitating cocktail machine, which uses sound waves to suspend tiny droplets of alcohol that drinkers can lick out of the air (pictured) He came up with the idea for the Levitron along with Professor Bruce Drinkwater of Bristol University. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to generate a levitating field capable of trapping tiny alcohol droplets and floating them in mid-air. ‘It's a pretty powerful machine. So far we've made a levitating Gin and Tonic at 70 per cent proof and a levitating Bloody Mary cocktail using Vodka at 160 per cent proof which will blow your socks off,' Mr Francis said. Professor Drinkwater explained: ‘Sound waves, even in the form of your voice have an inherent amount of power. Work in progress: So far inventor Charlie Harry Francis (pictured right, alongside Professor Bruce Drinkwater) has served Gin and Tonic and Bloody Mary cocktails using the bizarre machine (also shown) A device called Le Whaf, which looks like a goldfish ball containing smoke, lets people inhale cocktails and food such as lemon tart. It was invented by a Harvard University professor and aerosol scientist. Liquid such as whisky is poured into the base of the machine, which when switched on, creates a cloud of tiny droplets suspended in a glass dome. Like the levitating cocktail maker, it uses ultrasonic sound waves, which are generated by vibrating piezoelectric crystals. The waves alternate low and high pressures through the liquid, which make it bubble and form tiny droplets that behave like a cloud. The device can be bought for around $167 (£104). ‘The Levitron uses very powerful sound waves in the ultrasonic spectrum which crucially are beyond the range of human hearing, otherwise it would seriously damage your ears when the machine was switched on.’ The machine is the first step in a wider project to create contactless cutlery and levitating popcorn. The team plan on eventually being able to float an entire roast meal into hungry diner’s mouths. Currently, the Levitron costs around £30,000 but they are working on cutting the cost. Mr Francis has previously invented edible mist machines, an ice cream pottery gramophone wheel and glow in the dark ice cream, at events company Lick Me I’m Delicious, which he founded. The company is now working on developing a jellybean waterfall, whirlwind popcorn storm and an edible aftershave range.

'We already have the foundation of a strong partnership,' said Modi, seated beside Obama. 'We now have to revive the momentum and ensure that we get the best out of it for our people and for the world.'

Modi, who took office in May, received a warm welcome in the United States, even though he was denied a visa in 2005 over rioting in his home state three years earlier that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. Modi was exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court investigation. Foreign ministry official Vikram Doraiswami told a news briefing that the two leaders agreed to negotiate a 10-year extension of a military cooperation framework due to expire at the year-end, and will stress counter-terrorism cooperation and joint efforts against militant networks. The two sides also agreed to set up a contact group with the aim of resolving a liability issue that is discouraging U.S. investment in the Indian civil nuclear sector, and to work towards resolving a dispute over India's blocking of a landmark World Trade Organization agreement reached last year, the official said.

"Tory minister Matt Hancock was forced to apologise after retweeting a poem online which said the Labour party is ‘full of queers’. The Business Minister insisted it was a ‘total accident’ and did not agree with the offensive comment. Labour MPs called for him to be sacked, but fellow Tory minister Nick Boles, who is gay, leapt to his defence as ‘a bit of a queer myself’ to insist there was no harm done. Business minister Matt Hancock was forced to apologise for causing offence after retweeting a homophobic poem . After writing his own limerick online about the Labour party, Mr Hancock was sent this one which he retweeted . He later deleted the offensive message and posted this apology on Twitter . The problems began for Mr Hancock when he wrote a limerick about Labour leader Ed Miliband, who last week forgot to mention the deficit in his conference speech. Mr Hancock wrote: . 'There was a young man called Red Ed . 'Whose deficit ne'er entered his head . 'He simply forgot . 'He's losing the plot . 'So I'm voting Cameron instead. However, it attracted a response from an account called @InAFlap, which read: . 'The party run by young Ed . 'Is quietly going quite dead . 'Bereft of ideas . 'Quite full of queers . '‘No wonder the faithful have fled.' Mr Hancock retweeted the poem to his 17,300 followers. It attracted an angry response from Labour, with frontbencher Chris Bryant said he was ‘amazed’ that Mr Hancock ‘sends vile tweet about ""queers""’. He said Prime Minister David Cameron should ‘sack him now’. Labour MP Steve Reed added: ‘Is this how Tories really think.’ Skills minister Nick Boles came to the defence of his colleague, insisting there was 'no harm done' Mr Hancock later deleted the message, insisting the retweet was a ‘total accident’.

"An American veterinarian is trapped in East Timor after she was accused of drug trafficking, a crime she says she didn't commit. UC Berkeley grad Dr. Stacey Addison, was traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor on September 5 when she was arrested. The vet spent five terrifying days in jail and was forced to surrender her passport. Now she's been freed but can't leave the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. In flux: 40-year-old Portland, Oregon veterinarian Dr. Stacey Addison was detained in East Timor and set free, but authorities took her passport and expect her to stay in the country during an investigation that could take a year . Drug charge: Addison says a man she shared a taxi with on September 5 was caught with a package of methamphetamine and she was arrested along with him . The 40-year-old from Portland, Oregon has now been trying to get home for weeks. She's been in contact with American news outlets via Skype despite her shaky internet connection. 'I'm a suspect in a crime I didn't commit,' she told KGO. 'I don't know what's going to happen with the case, so it just makes everything really scary.' Authorities in East Timor strip-searched Addison and took a urine sample upon her arrest. She says she knew she had no drugs and that her drug test would be negative, so at first she wasn't too worried. 'I thought, OK, I haven’t done anything. It should be OK. But it’s not,' she told KOIN. After days of sleeping on a floor with 13 other women in jail and her subsequent release without a passport, the worry set in. Initial pleas to the U.S. Embassy were fruitless because diplomats aren't allowed to interfere with a foreign crime investigation. Holding out hope: Addison, who's often traveled abroad to do volunteer work as a vet, has been in touch with American media via a shaky internet connection. She says she's been in contact with her U.S. Senator and some diplomatic officials . 'I haven't committed a crime, I've done nothing wrong and the facts will prove that,' she said, but, 'their system is different here in that they have a long period to investigate and I'm sort of stuck in this.' While things appeared hopeless, by Tuesday leaders from both the state of Oregon and from East Timor had become 'aware of the situation' according to what Addison told KOIN. In addition to the foreign minister and prime minister, Addison said she's in touch with the office of U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley’s office via email and hopes the case will be resolved sooner rather than later. She said she's been told such investigations are known to take up to a year. 'I’m not asking that they have special treatment,' she said. 'I’m just asking that they look at the evidence. There isn’t any evidence.'","UC Berkeley grad Dr. Stacey Addison was traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor when she was arrested .

"Craig Warren was speared in the head with a wooden 1960’s-style Malibu surfboard when a ‘hipster’ refused to wear a leg rope while he was surfing. The 40-year-old was swimming with his children and some friends at Snappers Rocks on the Gold Coast about two weeks ago when he noticed a long board flying at him ‘like a missile’. The Currumbin resident told Daily Mail Australia that it was only a matter of time before being cool meant killing someone. Craig Warren was speared in the head with a wooden 1960’s-style Malibu board . The Gold Coast father warns the 'hipsters' are putting everyone's lives at risk . ‘I noticed the board coming at me like a missile when the guy fell off with no leg rope,' he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I tried to dodge it and I could have potentially got out of the way if I dived down but the water was too shallow. ‘Those old school boards are very heavy and big and they could seriously cause death. ‘I’m not being a grumpy old man but a classic example is – if my head was one of my kids or someone else’s son or daughter, the outcome would be a lot different. 'The one that hit me had a reasonable size fin on it and it took a chunk out of my head.' The father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine-year-old son Taj and was bandaged on the spot by his friend, who was an off-duty paramedic at the time and a lifesaver. ‘I was rushed to hospital after and had 23 stitches all up,’ he said. Mr Warren, who works in sales for surf brand Globe Industries, said even the most experienced surfers wear leg ropes. ‘I have been surfing for many years and I couldn’t go without a leg rope,’ he said. 'But these hipsters think they're too cool for leg ropes and want to live the lifestyle.' Mr Warren works in sales for a surf brand Global Industries and one of the sponsored stores made a sign after the incident . The 40-year-old Gold Coast man was rushed to hospital where he got 23 stitches on his head . Mr Warren said their actions are putting lives at risk and similar incidents like this could be avoided if the surfers wear a leg rope. ‘If you get up on a wave and fall off – you fall two to three metres but your board will travel 200 to 300 metres like a missile. ‘It doesn’t need to be a law but these guys need to be more responsible and take it into consideration when they’re surfing. ‘Throw a leg rope on – it gets really crowded at Snappers Rocks, Byron Bay and Noosa and you can avoid causing danger or putting someone’s life at risk. A Gold Coast City Council spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the City could not comment on the matter. But Snapper Rocks Surfriders Club president Jay Philips told Daily Mail Australia that the 'hipsters'  have become a problem  at Snappers Rocks. 'There are 200 to 300 people surfing at the same time and they're gonna have a board coming at them without doubt and endangering people's lives. 'Their boards go flying when they fall off and when it's coming at you, there's no way getting out of it. The father of two was swimming with his children two weeks ago when he was hit in the head by a board . The father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine-year-old son Taj (pictured) when he was bleeding . 'On Tuesday, we had 30-40 kids swimming in our program and around 10 guys were surfing with no leg ropes and one of our locals pointed it out and said ""where's your leg rope?"" and they just turned around and said ""we don't need it"".' 'If that board hits one of my kids - they're gonna hear about it.' When asked how the label 'hipsters' had come about, Mr Philips said the 'hipsters' have been a 'craze' in the area for a while. 'Just an image they have with their long hair and beards - It's an era that a lot of them like to live still and they're trying to live like the 60s. 'But as I'd like to say is - the 60s are done so just wear a leg rope.'","Craig Warren was hit in the head with a wooden surfboard two weeks ago .

"As Sherlock Holmes, his intelligence is the only weapon he needs. But for his latest role, Benedict Cumberbatch has found himself armed with something a little more unwieldy. These shots show the 38-year-old as an armour-clad Richard III, brandishing a sword and charging on horseback into the Battle of Bosworth of 1485. Leading man: Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard III, filming for BBC2 series The Hollow Crown . Horseback: The dramatic scenes involving the 38-year-old actor were filmed in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire . Filming: The actor, known for his role as Sherlock Holmes, is seen brandishing a sword and charging into battle . More often seen in a deerstalker hat when he plays Holmes, he seems keen to embrace a more active role. Richard III is traditionally depicted with a hunchback. But Cumberbatch’s portrayal suggests producers have taken note of recent scans of his newly-discovered remains, which found his spine only had a slight deformity that would not have affected his prowess in battle. The dramatic scenes were filmed in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, for BBC2 series The Hollow Crown, which is based on William Shakespeare’s history plays. Experience: Cumberbatch learned to ride a horse for the 2011 Hollywood version of War Horse . Two years away: The Hollow Crown - which will consist of four separate films - is not expected to air until 2016 . New show: Cumberbatch will star in The Hollow Crown, which is based on William Shakespeare’s history plays . He will be reunited with Sherlock actor Andrew Scott, the detective’s nemesis Moriarty, who plays the role of King Louis XI of France.

He thought I meant for him to stand up and the next thing I know he started going. ‘I made the classic mistake of pulling on the reins to keep my seat and he started to go backwards, which is really dangerous.’ The Hollow Crown - which will consist of four separate films - is not expected to air until 2016.

"A leading Tory MP has voiced his anger as a crushed commuter on Britain’s ‘Sardine Express.’ He said rail company South West Trains was treating its customers like ‘a cash cow’ while forcing them to endure misery in overcrowded conditions that would provoke prosecutions if livestock were treated so badly. Rising star Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab said that like many of his constituents, he had the misfortune to be crammed into the most overcrowded commuter train in Britain – the 7.32am South West trains service from Woking to Waterloo. Tory MP Dominic Raab spoke out about the overcrowded commuting conditions on South West Trains . During the debate in Westminster Hall, Raab pointed out that conditions were 'one grade below cattle class' He told Transport Minister Claire Perry: ‘It’s little wonder the Daily Mail dubbed the service the Sardine Express.’ Speaking during a debate which he instigated in the Commons’ Westminster Hall he noted: ‘EU rules stipulate that calves, adult goats and unshorn sheep must be transported by train in an area of space of at least 0.3 metres squared per unit of livestock. ‘Yet, the new government standard for commissioning commuter services for humans is now 0.25 metres squared, significantly less. ‘I understand that the only train company currently operating to that standard is - you guessed it - South West Trains’. He said he and his overcrowded constituents were paying soaring fares and massive subsidies to improve other rail services across the UK ‘for the privilege of travelling at one grade below cattle class on South West Trains’. South West Trains customers ‘feel quite literally as if they are treated like a cash cow, despite travelling in sub-cattle class conditions,’ he said. But while his words of woe will resonate with millions of commuters the length and breadth of Britain, they are likely to be met with dismay by Transport ministers. Waterloo Station is the final stop for Britain's most overcrowded commuter train: the Woking to Waterloo route . Mr Raab, a judo black belt who boards at Esher station in Surrey said: ‘I know first-hand how packed the carriages are. Occasionally, it’s impossible even to get on the train.’ He said the service had become even worse since last year: ‘I say this not just from the clear data available, but also as a commuting MP.' He said: ‘I stand on the platform with my constituent paying an ever-increasing fare both for the train service and the parking at the station. ‘And together we have experienced the steadily increasing overcrowding of a prime commuter route.’ Mr Raab said he was ‘not surprised’ to learn that 2013 data from the Department for Transport had pinpointed his regular service – the 7.32am train from Woking to Waterloo train – as having ‘the largest number of passengers in excess of capacity’, rail industry jargon for ‘most overcrowded.’ He said: ‘By the time it arrives at Esher at 7.52am, it’s packed to the gunnels.’ Official data showed it has 540 passengers over its specified maximum capacity limit – or 73 per cent over its official capacity ceiling. Raab opened up discussion about the high fares and poor service that his constituents must endure . He noted: ‘The 7.32 has consistently appeared in the top 10 overcrowded peak services in recent years. Nor is it a freak time … for example, the 7.02am service is almost as packed.‘ . He said Surrey commuters were particularly hard-hit with high fares and poor service. In his own Elmbridge borough alone - dubbed the ‘Beverley Hills of Britain for the high concentation of celebrities and premiership football players - nearly 12 million people using the stations. Recorded journeys have almost doubled between 2002 and 2010. A season ticket for the 25 minute journey from Esher to Waterloo currently costs just under £2,000, he said, noting: ‘Fares will rise by 3% again in the New Year.’ Surreys ‘sardine’ commuters are also subsiding services elsewhere, contributing £6billion to the Treasury but getting back less than £1billion in services. In 2013/14, South West Trains passengers paid Department of Transport the highest premium for their rail service - 5.2 pence per passenger per kilometre. By contrast some 13.1 pence subsidy ‘doled out’ by the government to Arriva Trains Wales, while London Midland received 2.8p and South Eastern 2.2p. In the four years to 2013/14, South West Trains passengers had ‘coughed up the largest subsidy to government coffers of any train company’ totalling just over £1 billion. Although this was ‘a truly staggering amount’ it appeared ‘quite arbitrary no-one could explain to him how it was calculated.' South West Trains passengers recently ranked their service 3rd worst in the country in terms of value for money. Only 37 per cent thought they were getting value for money compared to 78 per cent of Grand Central passengers and 61% of Virgin Trains passengers, he said. Excuses from South West trains might be ‘easier to swallow’ if director remuneration at parent company Stagecoach Group ‘doubled between 2010 and 2014,’ he said. Nicknamed the 'Sardine Express,' Raab urged Transport Minister Claire Perry to acknowledge the  line's falws . He told ministers that during the pressing financial crisis his constituents have ‘rather stoically endured’ the immediate frustration of high fares and acute overcrowding: ‘But, when I stand on that platform, with my fellow constituents taking the Sardine Express up to Waterloo, I need to be able to explain how we are going to address the conditions of travel, which are often cramped and uncomfortable, over the long term. ‘I need to explain how we are going to deliver better value for money and to give them some light at the end of the tunnel.’ Transport Minister Mrs Perry said she had first-hand experience of the crush ‘Sardine Express’ having travelled on it during a ‘mystery shopping exercise’ on a day when four carriages had been removed. She said overcrowding was ‘perversely a measure of success’ because more people were using the railways. But she acknowledged the South West franchise, drawn up under labour, was flawed.","Tory MP Dominic Raab spoke out about conditions on South West Trains .

"The son-in-law of a Monaco heiress shot dead as she left a hospital had run up debts of €9 million in advance of her murder. Wojciech Janowski has been accused of paying two hitmen to murder his mother-in-law Helene Pastor as she left a hospital in Nice in May. Mrs Pastor's chauffeur Mohamed Darwich was also killed in the attack. Wojciech Janowski, 64, (left) had debts of €9 million including an overdraft of €1 million according to investigators probing his mother-in-law Helen Pastor's death. The billionaire, right, was murdered in May . Mr Janowski initially admitted his role in the killing, although he later retracted the confession, claiming that he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language. French newspaper Le Parisien said investigators had discovered Mr Janowski owed €9 million including an overdraft of €1 million. The newspaper also claimed that Mr Janowski faced the prospect of handing over a further €30 million after an oil deal. Mr Janowski has lived with Mrs Pastor's daughter Sylvia for the past 28 years. At an earlier court hearing, Erick Campana said that he had 'retracted his statements made while in custody' and 'denies having ordered' the killing. Mr Campana said Mr Janowski, whohas served as Poland's honorary consul in Monaco, had 'misunderstood the meanings of the terms used by police and was speaking in French while he does not understand all the nuances of our language'. Janowski and Sylvia Pastor (right) have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter . Mr Campana said he would demand that an appeal court nullify Mr Janowski's detention - and the statements made while in custody - because he did not have access to a lawyer or interpreter during his 96 hours in custody. However, the judge ruled that Cambridge graduate Mr Janowski must remain in custody pending trial. Mr Janowski was arrested early last week by police on suspicion of 'masterminding' the killing of Mrs Pastor, who was shot multiple times with a sawn-off shotgun as she was leaving a hospital in the French Riviera city of Nice. Her driver, Mohammed Darwich, 64, also died from injuries sustained in attack on May 6. A police officer investigates a car at the site where Helene Pastor and her driver were shot dead . Wojciech Janowski, hides his face as he leaves a police station in Nice, France, after questioning . Mr Janowski was charged after prosecutors said he confessed to the contract killing, for which he allegedly spent some 250,000 euros (£198,000) to hire two alleged contract killers. The two men - a 31-year-old and a 24-year-old originally from the Comoros islands and living in Marseille's rough northern districts - were also apprehended last week and charged. Mr Janowski's personal trainer was also charged with allegedly organising the murder and acting as a go-between with the killers. Prosecutors had alleged Mr Janowski ordered the killing 'to lay his hands on the inheritance' due to Sylvia, Pastor's eldest daughter on her death. Sylvia was initially detained in the case but later released without charge. The two have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter. Helene Pastor had inherited a huge real estate and construction business set up by her Italian grandfather Jean-Baptiste Pastor, a stone mason who moved to Monaco in 1880. As the sleepy principality on the French Riviera slowly grew into a playground for the world's rich and famous, the family's fortune skyrocketed. The real jackpot came in 1966 when Prince Rainier, whose fairytale wedding to Hollywood actress Grace Kelly helped catapult Monaco to international fame, gave permission to Helene Pastor's father Gildo to build high-rise buildings along the seafront. Mr Janowski heads a Monaco nanotechnology firm and an oil business, and is involved in numerous charities in the principality. After he was charged, Poland announced it was stripping Mr Janowski of his title of honorary consul 'because of the loss of the irreproachable reputation that is essential for this role'. It also noted that as an honorary official Mr Janowski did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution.","Helene Pastor was shot multiple times as she left a hospital in May .

"President Barack Obama should send at least 10,000 American ground troops to Iraq to turn the tide of the war on the ISIS terror army, a former NATO commander said Thursday. Retired Admiral James Stavridis insisted that the reality on the ground 'is not good news, but we're going to need to put U.S. boots on the ground there.' 'Not 150,000 like at peak in Iraq, but probably 10,000,' he explained, 'to do the advising, the training, the mentoring. That’s how you make Iraqi security forces effective. That’s how you get the (Kurdish) Peshmerga in the game.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Retired Admiral James Stavridis said the U.S. will ultimately have to commit between 10,000 and 15,000 ground troops in order to stabilize Iraq . Hands full: Obama is juggling the ISIS war with an Ebola crisis back home, all while fretting that his Democratic Party will take a beating in the Nov. 4 midterm elections . US airstrikes continued Wednesday on positions held by the ISIS terror army in Kobane, Syria, but some military commanders worry that attacking from above won't get the job done by itself . Stavridis said Obama's goal should be to 'get ISIS in a three-front war,' pinning them between 'the Pehmerga in the north, Iraqi security in the south, (and) the bombing in the west.' In that scenario, he said, 'we can still turn this thing.' The admiral, who is hawking his biography 'The Accidental Admiral,' told an MSNBC audience that he's 'not surprised' Obama entered the Iraq crisis with a promise to keep U.S. ground troops out of harm's way. 'Let's face it: There's enormous Middle East fatigue in the country,' he said. 'The last thing in the world people want is troops back (in Iraq). I believe we have to confront this.' An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released in late September showed that 72 per cent of Americans think Obama will have to change his mind. A smaller number, 45 per cent, said they would agree with that decision if Obama's top generals said it was necessary. It's likely the top Pentagon brass has already presented him with that sobering reality. Obama has pledged to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Syria and al-Sham, which has plowed through countless square miles of Syria and Iraq in a murderous quest to establish a country based on Islamic Sharia law. 'Our military are giving the president a wide range of options,' Stavridis said. 'And within that range they will say to him, ""This is very high risk if we don’t put U.S. boots on the ground. If we want to turn this thing, Mr. President, we need to be putting 10,000, maybe 15,000 troops on the ground"".’ 'I would guess those conversations are underway. I certainly hope so,' he said. ISIS is inching closer to a direct attack on Baghdad, taking a strategic military base this week in Anbar Province and threatening Fallujah – a large city where hundreds of American servicemen and women died during the decade when U.S. troops had a presence there. Meet the Peshmerga: Iraqi Kurds who want their own state in Iraq's northern region are fighting off ISIS near Turkey, but the Turks have their own beef with Kurdish separatists so they aren't helping . Stavridis, a former NATO commander, is hawking a book and weighing in on the ground conditions that will dictate America's next move . Stavridis said that overall, the Obama administration's effort to bring ISIS to heel through an international coalition effort isn't going well. 'I would say it's not, at this point,' he said. 'We have got to get Turkey into the game.' The Turks share massive borders with both Iraq and Syria, but their government has largely ignored ISIS – instead focusing on ancient enmity with Kurdish separatists who are holding ISIS back from crossing into Turkey. The weeks-long battle for Kobane, a Syrian city whose northern wall abuts Turkey's southernmost province, has attracted scant attention from Ankara. 'Turkey has a 500,000-man army, the second biggest in NATO,' Stavridis said Thursday. 'They've got to get into the game.'","Retired Admiral James Stavridis made the claim on MSNBC .

"After buying a cheap Dodge Ram van off the internet, three friends spent four months travelling around North America on a quest to see the true beauty of their homeland. And they came up with one very unique way of documenting their trip: by taking 'selfies' on a couch that they brought along with them at each stop. The brain child of university pals, Becca D'Agostine, 25, Andy Fuhrmann, 25, and Dave Fine, 24, the trip was first planned so that they could celebrate Andy's recovery from a serious spinal injury. Three friends road tripped across the US and documented their trip with 'couch selfies' at each stop. Pictured: Seward Highway, Alaska . The university pals initially embarked on this trek to celebrate Andy Fuhrmann's spinal surgery recovery . The group bought a used Dodge Ram van to transport the futon during their four-month adventure . After setting out from Burlington, Vermont the group visited everywhere from the snowy mountain tops of Alaska to breathtaking sunsets of California before ending in finally ending Massachusetts. By turning the couch into a mattress, the students managed to save on space and so were able to bring their dogs, Arthur and Corinna, along for the 18,000 mile ride. Since posting the images online, they have had an overwhelming response from other would be travellers who are keen to make the same journey. The trio snapped this photo on the train tracks in Parks Highway, Alaska . In Big Sur, California, the friends dragged the couch to the beach for this sunset photo op . The couch also doubled as a mattress when they opted to sleep in the back of their car. Pictured: Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument, Utah . Because they saved so much space with the convertible futon, they were also able to bring along their dogs. Pictured: Humboldt Redwood National Park in California . Sea views: In Hueneme Bay, California, the group enjoyed the ocean-front view . 'The water looks like the Caribbean,' one of the friends, Becca D'Agostine said of their favourite stop: Kenai Lake, Alaska . Becca said: 'We bought a 1996 Dodge Ram Van on craigslist for $2000 (about £1,260), it had 186,000 miles on it when we bought and now it has over 205,000 miles but it's still doing great! 'Our favourite place was probably Kenai Lake on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, the colour of the water looks like the Caribbean and there's also giant, snow covered mountains popping out in every direction. 'We stored the couch in our van, on nights that we slept in the car, we folded it out into a bed. 'We wanted to figure out a way to show how varied the American landscape is, and we thought we'd do that using us and the couch. The group admits they've had an overwhelmingly positive response since posting the photos online. Pictured, Homer, Alaska . Sitting under a gigantic tree in Mt Baker, Washington, the dogs seem to enjoy the photo project just as much .

Rest: Stella stops unusually by collapsing on the grass with the ball in her mouth . Stella barks at her owner in excitement and then launches herself into the leaves - like a child jumping into a swimming pool - as the ball disappears. Moments later she somehow emerges with the ball in her mouth and is ready for another round. Even though it's like finding a needle in a haystack, the determined and dedicated dog manages to retrieve the ball on every occasion. The cute canine always emerges from the leaves happily wagging her tail and revelling in her accomplishment.

"The owner of a hotel in Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains that had the dubious honor of topping TripAdvisor's 2011 list of America's dirtiest hotels cannot sue the travel website operator for defamation, a federal appeals court has ruled. Owner Kenneth Seaton complained in a $10 million lawsuit that the ranking for his Grand Resort Hotel and Convention Center in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee was the product of a flawed rating system dependent on ‘unsubstantiated rumors,’ and intended to irreparably damage his business and reputation. TripAdvisor, a travel website, said the ranking was based on traveler ratings for cleanliness. Owner Kenneth Seaton complained in a $10 million lawsuit that the ranking for his Grand Resort Hotel and Convention Center in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee was the product of a flawed rating system dependent on 'unsubstantiated rumors' But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati on Wednesday said travelers could not reasonably interpret the ranking as a statement that Grand Resort was in fact ‘America's dirtiest hotel,’ and that website operators deserve broad protection from lawsuits over reader-generated reviews. While the hotel's entry had a photo of a ripped bedspread and a complaint from a TripAdvisor user about ‘dirt at least (1/2-inch) thick in the bathtub which was filled with lots of dark hair,’ Circuit Judge Karen Nelson Moore said no one would view this to conclusively mean the hotel deserved its ranking. She also said ‘dirtiest’ amounted to ‘rhetorical hyperbole,’ and that the general tenor of the list - including reader comments about other hotels such as ‘probably more sanitary to sleep in the bathroom’ and ‘camp out on the beach instead’ - showed that the list also served to entertain. Grand Resort's ranking ‘is not capable of being understood as defamatory,’ Moore wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. Of the 321 reviews on TripAdvisor, 265 rated the hotel as 'poor' or 'terrible' and posted unflattering photos including this one of a ripped bedsheet . A judge has ruled that the dubious Grand Resort's ranking on TripAdvisor 'is not capable of being understood as defamatory' ‘Even the most careless reader must have perceived that “dirtiest” is simply an exaggeration and that Grand Resort is not, literally, the dirtiest hotel in the United States.’ Moore also said the prevalence of lists on the web - such as 'Top Ten Dumb Asses,' and a Reader's Digest poll calling actor Tom Hanks the most trusted person in America and 'Judge Judy' Sheindlin more trusted than any of the nine Supreme Court justices - reasonably suggests that such lists are opinion, not fact. Wednesday's decision upheld an August 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas Phillips in Knoxville, Tennessee. The 6th Circuit also upheld Phillips' refusal to let Seaton add claims of trade libel and interference with prospective business. 'It is a victory for online review sites by letting them not only publish user comments but also draw conclusions,' said Jeffrey Hermes, director of the Digital Media Law Project at Harvard University, which filed a legal brief supporting TripAdvisor. A judge ruled that 'dirtiest' was simply an exaggeration and the hotel cannot be interpreted as literally 'the dirtiest hotel in the U.S.' Following a host of negative reviews on TripAdvisor, the Grand Resort Hotel and Convention Center closed late last year . 'This helps journalists and researchers who work with user-submitted data to inform the public.' Todd Shelton, a lawyer for Seaton, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Seaton could not immediately be reached for comment. TripAdvisor spokeswoman Alison Croyle welcomed the decision, saying it serves 'to protect the opinions of consumers online.' The Grand Resort closed in November and was sold, according to published reports, but remains on TripAdvisor's website. Of the 321 reviews, 265 rated the hotel 'poor' or 'terrible.' As well as unflattering photos, users have left a litany of negatives reviews about staying at the hotel .","The owner of the Grand Resort Hotel and Convention Center in Tennessee claimed the ranking was based on 'unsubstantiated rumors'

"Gem stone fraudster John Bishop, 32, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was jailed today for four years . A gem dealer who conned pensioners into parting with their life savings to buy coloured diamonds as an 'investment' at hugely inflated prices was jailed for four years today. John Bishop, 32, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was part of a team of five fraudsters who cold called thousands of elderly people to persuade them to buy brightly coloured stones as via their company No1 Gems. The victims, mostly retirees registered with investment companies, were sent glossy brochures and promised massive returns on gems which, they were told, HSBC bank had agreed to buy the entire stock of for £15million. In fact, the stones had been bought in bulk from a diamond catalogue and given a huge mark up in the No1 Gems brochure. The year-long scheme was masterminded by Bishop's friend Adam Simmons, 28, who set up an office in Hove, East Sussex. Bishop was put in charge of the office in Marbella, Spain, and tasked with pulling in Brits who had retired to the Costa del Sol. The Old Bailey heard how No1 Gems was set up in late 2011 and conned a total of £1million from investors until it was raided by police in September the following year. Bishop, who was arrested in October 2012 after returning to Britain from Spain, had denied all knowledge of the scam, but was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and transferring criminal property after a trial at the Old Bailey. Prosecutor David Durose said during the trial: 'Basically No1 Gems were engaged in what is known as a boiler room fraud. 'It is a specific type of fraud in which individuals are targeted with cold calling and pressured into making purchase of items such as shares, equities or financial instruments - or in this case, diamonds. 'They marked up the price by eight, ten or even up to nearly 30 times'. One victim, William Doorbar, a retiree from Stoke, Staffordshire, agreed to buy a 0.26 carat green diamond, worth just ££50, for £5,598 after being told he could make annual returns of more than 20per cent. Mr Durose said it was not clear if Bishop had known from the outset that the company was a con, as he had sent Simmons an email in April 2012 saying ""These prices are getting a bit ridiculous"". But he said that by June he definitely did know, and may have known before then. Richard Furlong, defending Bishop, said: 'He was drawn in by Mr Simmons. 'He was in a position where he was living in Spain, he needed a job, the economic circumstances in that part of Spain were not very good. Adam Simmons, left, was the gang mastermind while his father Michael Simmons, 54, also played a part . He claimed Bishop was only responsible for a total loss of £70,000 to investors because he was less closely involved than the others and for a shorter period, but the prosecution claimed the figure was £600,000. Sentencing him to four years in prison, Judge Andrew Lees said: 'You claimed you did not know of the dishonesty of Adam Simmons and that's the position that you maintain today. 'Having heard the evidence and having heard your evidence I have no hesitation in rejecting this assertion by the defence. 'I am sure your knew of this fraudulent activity... 'You concealed your identity from the customers, you gave a false name throughout and you concealed the fact that you were working from an office outside the UK.' Judge Lees said he accepted that Bishop was responsible for a total loss of around £600,000. Adam Simmons, right, and his brother-in-law Adam Leach, left,  have already been jailed for the fraud . Bishop operated out of Marbella, on Spain's Costa del Sol, targeting retired Brits with phony gem deals . Bishop, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between 31 October 2011 and 10 September 2012 and transferring criminal property. He was cleared of fraudulent trading at the direction of the judge. The rest of his gang were jailed last September having been found guilty of fraud charges. Adam Simmons, of Liverpool,  was sentenced to six years for conspiracy to defraud, money laundering, and fraudulent trading, while his father, Michael Simmons, 54, of Stone Cross, Pevensey, East Sussex, got two and a half years and Adam Leach, 30, of Eastbourne, four years for the same charges. Their accomplice Lee Miller, 33, of Bexhill on Sea, was jailed for three years, four months after he admitted a single count of fraudulent trading. A proceeds of crime act hearing has been scheduled for 19 December to determine how much the fraudsters will pay back.","John Bishop, 32, was one of a team of five fraudsters selling gemstones .

"The National Football League has enacted stiffer punishments for any personnel who commit domestic violence. In a letter to team owners, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said players, coaches and owners now face a six-game suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban for a second. Goodell said second-time offenders may petition for reinstatement after a year, but with no guarantees. Harsher penalties could also be levied for offenders with incidents before joining the NFL or 'violence involving a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child,' the letter states. 'I didn't get it right:' Commissioner  Roger Goodell said the NFL will enact stiffer penalties for domestic violence, starting with a six-game suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban for a second .

Three members of Congress wrote . Goodell asking him to reconsider Rice's . suspension, the governor of Maine says he'll boycott the league, and . numerous groups that advocate for women and families condemned the . penalty as too lenient. In his letter, the commissioner admitted that he 'didn't get it right.' 'We allowed our standards to fall below where they should be and lost an important opportunity to emphasize our strong stance on a critical issue and the effective programs we have in place,' Goodell wrote. 'My disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families. I take responsibility both for the decision and for ensuring that our actions in the future properly reflect our values.' The NFL Players Association said the union was informed of the new policies but didn't have to approve it, as it's a change in personal conduct policy, a source told USA Today Sports. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon (12) was banned from the league for a year for testing positive for marijuana.

"This is the shocking moment a pair of violent thugs raided two off-licences after battering shop workers over the head - with bottles of alcohol. CCTV taken from separate raids in Walsall, West Midlands, show the men first walking into the store before picking up wine and vodka. They then approach the counter appearing to be about to pay before launching their brutal attack by smashing the shopkeeper over the head with the glass bottles. Scroll down for video . Two thugs were captured on camera using bottles of alcohol to batter shop workers over the head during two terrifying robberies . One of the robbers can be seen raising up his arm and brandishing a bottle of alcohol (circled in red) during one of the violent raids on two off-licences in Walsall, West Midlands . On both occasions one of the men raids the till while the other continues to rain down powerful blows leaving terrified staff cowering in fear. West Midlands Police released footage of the vicious attacks which took place on May 26 and June 2 and left one cashier with head injuries. Officers are appealing for any witnesses to get in touch after the CCTV was also aired on BBC's Crimewatch. Detective Constable Gerry Maley, from Bloxwich police station, said: 'Despite numerous inquiries in the area and appeals to the public, we are yet to identify the pair in the images. On both occasions, the men can be seen approaching the counter appearing to be about to pay (pictured) Violent: After pretending they wanted to purchase alcohol, they are seen using the glass bottles to attack the till attendants .

The first attack happened at the Convenience Store off licence, on Glyn Avenue in Moxely, Walsall at about 10.40am on May 26. The one minute 46 second clip first shows a stocky bald black man in a grey hoodie walking up to the counter with a bottle of red wine .

The second robber is described as an Asian or light-skinned black man, and is around six feet tall with a slim build. The pair then fumble with the lock to the till before opening it and escaping with hundreds of pounds in cash. But before they flee, the man in the black hoodie picks up two more bottles of vodka, and launches one at the store worker. The second robbery took place at a News & Booze, on Wednesbury Road in Darlaston, Walsall, at 10.10am on June 2. Two men can be seen entering the store, and the shorter of the two, wearing a dark hoodie and sunglasses, picks up a bottle of white wine and approaches the counter. Police have released CCTV footage of the two men (pictured left and right) in the hope witnesses will come forward . The bottle is again  thrown at the shop assistant, as the second raider wearing a blue cap, leaps onto the desk. This time the till attendant tries to fight back after grabbing a wooden pole - but after making a run for the shop door, he is overpowered by the two thugs. The man in the cap then goes behind the counter, rips out the till drawer, and the pair flee the scene.

"Consumers around the nation can't be sure what kind of shrimp they're buying if they simply look at the label or menu at supermarkets, grocers and restaurants, an advocacy group says. Oceana did a DNA-based survey of shrimp sold at outlets in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and various spots around the Gulf of Mexico. The group said it found about 30per cent of 143 shrimp products bought from 111 vendors were not what the label said. Cheap imported farm-raised shrimp is being sold as prized wild-caught Gulf shrimp, common shrimp sold as premium shrimp and shrimp of all kinds sold with no indication whatsoever about where they came from, the group said. Misleading: Results from a DNA-based survey show consumers cannot be sure what kind of shrimp they are buying simply by looking at the grocery store label or restaurant menu . Oceana is urging Congress and regulators to enforce proper labeling. The group acknowledged that the survey was but a small sample, but said the survey using DNA techniques is the first of its kind. The group did a similar survey last year for fish and made similar findings. A laboratory tested each sample to identify what kind of shrimp each was by species. 'It was a first good look at shrimp,' said Kimberly Warner, a marine scientist with Oceana. She went out and obtained many of the samples. Misleading and illegal labeling of food is considered a major problem among food purists because it cheats consumers and puts them at risk of tainted foods, hurts honest vendors and tarnishes an industry's product. The report said that because of mislabeling, consumers are not guaranteed they are eating shrimp that meets high, chemical-free standards. Oceana said it found bad labeling on shrimp sold at national and regional supermarkets and smaller grocery stores alike. It also said restaurants of all kinds, from national chains to high-dollar eateries, were selling shrimp with poor labeling. Oceana declined to provide the names of the vendors it obtained the samples from. Dustin Cranor, an Oceana spokesman, said the company did not want to identify individual vendors because 'fraud can happen at any point in the supply chain.' The group's report came as no surprise to fishermen and others involved in the shrimp industry. 'I've been shouting this for ages from the rooftop,' said Kimberly Chauvin, who runs a family shrimp business with fishing boats and docks in Chauvin, Louisiana. She said shrimp mislabeling has gotten worse in recent decades, and coincided with a growing appetite for shrimp among Americans. For more than a decade, shrimp has become the nation's most popular seafood, according to federal data. The craving for shrimp has been accompanied by a major uptick in imported farm-raised shrimp, which are considered inferior to shrimp caught in the open ocean. Chauvin said mislabeling will get worse unless regulators 'start handing out big fines' to companies that break the Food and Drug Administration's labeling laws. The Oceana survey found the worst labeling of shrimp taking place in New York City. The group found few problems in Portland but more widespread misrepresentation in Washington and the Gulf. Jerald Horst, a Louisiana seafood writer and former state fisheries specialist, said mislabeling runs rampant in the seafood industry. He said many of the big vendors want to keep the status quo — in other words, lackluster enforcement of labeling. 'There's a lot of pressure from the major institutions for them not to do it,' Horst said. 'They want the freedom to do 'creative marketing.'' Lauren Sucher, an FDA spokeswoman, said mislabeling is illegal and pointed out that the agency inspects and enforces labeling laws.","Advocacy group Oceana did a DNA-based survey of shrimp sold at outlets in New York City, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon and various spots around the Gulf of Mexico .

"The owner of a used car showroom in Devon has been ordered to remove decorative bunting from his premesis - because it could be too much of a distraction for passing motorists. Reg Payne, who owns West Country Car Sales, was asked to take down his decorative flags which hang outside his business near Cullompton following a council planning meeting on Wednesday. The bunting was one of the concerns raised when Mr Payne presented an application to expand his car dealership. Reg Payne, pictured, has been ordered to take the bunting away from his used car lot by council officials . Health and Safety gurus fear the bunting, circled, may distract motorists driving along outside his showroom . The council raised the bunting issue as a matter of concern when he applied to expand the size of his business . Councillors were divided in opinion over the plan, with those opposing the expansion citing the appearance of the site as one of their biggest concerns. Councillor Barry Warren, planning chairman of Willand Parish Council said there was a 'kaleidoscope' of colours of cars on the site and said there were worries of the visual impact the business had on its surroundings. Mr Payne said: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm doing nothing other than trying to make a living here.' This follows an earlier decision by Nottingham City Council workers who erected a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath. The sign in Dulwich Road was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards, which enclose a pedestrian-only zone in the residential area.

Dorothy Francis, 89, who has lived in the area all her life, said: ‘It’s bizarre, you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car. ‘The sign is actually on the pavement, it’s not like it’s a few yards before, there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards. ‘I know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far.’ In Yorkshire, Craven District Council has ordered its refuse collectors not to drag bins along residential driveways. Councillor Paul English branded the move 'crazy' saying it was 'health and safety gone mad'. He said: 'When you apply to be a refuse collector it is pretty obvious you will be expected to collect refuse. It is kind of part of the job description. 'Wheelie bins have wheels and are easy to move around and refuse collectors are trained to do it. It is like telling a footballer not to play football in case he breaks his leg. 'If [health and safety bosses] says it is dangerous for all these big strapping lads to move the bins, what about all the little old ladies who are going to have to do it instead?'","Reg Payne wanted to increase the size of his Devon used car show room .

"An elderly disabled woman has told how her loyal dogs kept her alive when she was badly injured by a fall in her kitchen. Judy Muhe, a 76-year-old with Parkinson's disease, couldn't move and was left drifting in and out of consciousness when she fell over at home in Palmdale, California. Muhe, who lives alone, had only her two golden retrievers - Higgins and Dodger - to come to her aid after the accident. Savior: Judy Muhe, 76, told how her golden retreivers, Higgins (pictured) and Dodger, helped her when she had a dangerous fall in her kitchen . Loyal: The two pets stayed by her side for two days - forgoing food and water - in an attempt to keep her save while help arrived . Second savior: Muhe told how Dodger (pictured) nuzzled her and reminded her she was not alone through the ordeal . The two animals stayed with her through the agonizing two-day wait until somebody realized she was hurt, remaining at her side even without food or water. Muhe described how the animals kept her spirits up - and the cold at bay - by nuzzling up against her propping her up, away from the tiled floor, ABC news reported. Due to her Parkinson's disease - a degenerative disease of the nervous system that hampers movement - she is especially susceptible to cold. Concerned neighbors eventually found Muhe on the floor after checking in on her using a key she'd given them. They were able to get her medical help. Muhe, tearful at the thought of her dogs' unwavering loyalty, said: 'They went two days without food and water and stayed with me. Demonstration: Higgins lay at Muhe's feet - staving off the cold, which is particularly dangerous to Parkinson's sufferers . Scene: Muhe had fallen onto her kitchen floor, injuring her head and shoulders. She later needed surgery . 'By keeping me warm, keeping me comfortable as they could, they let me know that I was not alone. 'Dodger kept nuzzling me with his nose. He was laying beside me... My guardians - I have no doubt they would do it again. Kathy Jacobs, the neighbor who found Muhe on the floor, told the station: 'The dogs were right here with her - they ran to the door then ran back to where she was - showing us she was there'. Muhe bruised her head and hurt her shoulders in the fall - and needed two operations to fix the damage. But she has now recovered, and lives at home with her two saviors once again. Rescuer: Kathy Jacobs, a neighbor, was concerned after not hearing from Muhe, and found her semi-conscious on the floor when she went to check on her .","Judy Muhe, 76, fell, injured herself and was left semi-conscious .

"A judge in Maryland has refused to allowed the mother of two missing toddlers out of a state mental institution so that she can lead police to her children. The family of Jacob and Sarah Hoggle, 2 and 3, are furious with the decision by Montgomery County District Court Judge Eugene Wolfe. They believe the toddlers, who were reported missing on September 8, could still be alive and in grave danger. Judge Wolfe said Catherine Hoggle, 27, has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and has been ruled not competent to stand trial on charges of abduction, neglect and hindering an investigation. Her lawyer argued that it is wrong for authorities to ask Hoggle to take them to her children because she would be incriminating herself, the Washington Post reports. Scroll down for video . Where are the children? Catherine Hoggle is pictured here with her children Jacob, 2, and Sarah, 3. The toddler have been missing since September 9 and Hoggle won't say where they are . Catherine Hoggle claims the children are still alive and had said she wanted to lead police to them. However, a judge prevented her from being let out to help authorities . Hoggle has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She is charged with abduction, child endangerment and hindering an investigation . Jacob and Sarah's relatives, including her father - Catherine Hoggle's longtime boyfriend - say she is the only one who knows where the children are. 'It’s infuriating,' Troy Turner told the Post. The judge ordered police and prosecutors not to speak to her until she is deemed mentally fit to stand trial - meaning that they can't press her on where Jacob and Sarah are. Prosecutors say that Hoggle claimed in phone calls from her mental ward at the state psychiatric hospital that she wanted to lead authorities to her children and that they are still alive. Authorities aren't sure whether Hoggle is telling the truth - or even if she is mentally fit to know what she is saying - but they argued that even the smallest chance that she could aid in the rescue of Jacob and Seth makes it worth the effort. However, when prosecutors filed a motion asking that Hoggle be allowed out of the hospital to lead police to her children, her defense lawyer stepped in and said that she no longer wants to help police. Troy Turner, Hoggle's longtime partner and the father of the two children, says it's 'infuriating' that the judge won't let police have Catherine Hoggle lead them to his toddlers . 'What the state is asking the court to order is that she incriminate herself,' attorney David Felsen told the judge, according to the Post. Her disappearance with her children from her home in Germantown, Maryland, in September sparked a massive police manhunt. She was found days later, but she was not with her children. During a 16-hour interview, she changed her story multiple times but maintained that they were safe. Two months later, Sarah and Jacob are still missing and authorities have run out of leads.","Jacob and Sarah Hoggle, age 2 and 3, have been missing from their home in Germantown, Maryland, since September 8 .

"Malaysia Airlines is to sack a third of the workforce -  as it struggles to overcome the twin disasters that have hit it this year. Around 6,000 members of staff will lose their jobs following the disappearance of flight MH370 over the southern Indian Ocean in March and the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine last month. The announcement comes just days after the airline admitted almost 200 cabin crew had quit in recent weeks, with many citing family pressures and some claiming they were too scared to fly. Scroll down for video . Up to 6,000 workers will be sacked as the Malaysian government tries to rebuild the airline . Flowers outside the Dutch Embassy in London to remember the passengers who were killed on Malaysian Flight MH17 . The MH370 incident, on March 8, involved a Boeing 777 plane en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. Despite intensive searches, no trace of the aeroplane has been found and a fresh hunt has now been instigated. The Ukraine incident on July 17 again involved a  Boeing 777. The flight, with 298 people on board including 10 Britons, was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It is believed the aircraft was brought down by a missile fired by pro-Russian separatists. Black box flight recorders have been recovered from the scene and an interim report on the crash is expected soon from the Dutch Safety Board which is in overall charge of the investigation. A Malaysia Airline spokesman talked of 'rebuilding' the carrier following the two tragedies this year . The job losses, announced in Kuala Lumpur, are part of a major restructuring of the airline which will see a new chief executive in place next year, as well as the carrier being completely taken over by the Malaysian government. There will also be a restructuring of routes flown, although the twice-daily service between Heathrow airport in west London and Kuala Lumpur, on which the world's largest passenger plane the Airbus A380 superjumbo operates, is set to continue. A London-based Malaysia Airlines spokesman said: 'The London-Kuala Lumpur route is highly successful and will carry on. Passengers have been reporting that the beleaguered airline is flying near-empty planes . 'Today's announcement is all about rebuilding the airline after these two awful incidents. The airline is being reshaped and the aim is to return it to profitability.' Malaysia Airlines has also slashed its prices for long-haul routes and is giving away flights as it struggles to hold onto customers. The beleaguered airline is offering a sale from Heathrow Airport to Kuala Lumpur and nine other destinations in Malaysia, with return economy class flights selling for as little as £570 on select dates. It is also offering cut-price deals to customers in Australia and New Zealand, and is reportedly giving away 12 return flights to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, as part of a competition called ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’.","Employees will go after disappearance of MH370 and MH17 shooting down .

"You know the look, don't you. Their eyes glaze over, they look over your shoulder for a distraction and before long you're in a one-way conversation to nowhere. What is it about reliving holiday experiences which makes even best friends and family fail to take an interest - and us feel all the poorer for it? A new paper by Harvard University called The Unforeseen Costs Of Extraordinary Experience claims to have worked it out. Psychologists have proved once and for all that having superior experiences will make people dislike you . Psychologists Gus Cooney, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson found that we seek out extraordinary experiences; from yachting with celebrities off the coast of St Tropez, to climbing mountains, detoxing in exotic spas and sampling rare wines. More importantly, though, while we thoroughly enjoy having these superior experiences to our peers,  the feeling is spoiled by subsequent conversations with them which ultimately leave us feeling worse than if we had a more ordinary, relate-able trip. The reason? Uncommon experiences make us at once 'alien and enviable' and leave you feeling left out. The Harvard scientists proved the theory with tests on lots of small groups of people. Harvard: Paper was published by the University and called The Unforeseen Costs of Extraordinary Experience . In each case one person was given an amusing video clip of a talented street magician to watch while others a low budget animation. Researchers told everyone whether they were getting the average or better footage then asked them to rate how happy they felt directly after watching it. The group reassembled and and chatted for some time about whatever they wanted. After that, they were asked to rate their happiness again. The results were, in a nutshell, those who'd watched the premium video felt immediately happier but after speaking to their peers felt excluded and a lot worse than those who had seen the cartoon. How to lose friends and alienate people? Tell them how brilliant your yachting holiday to St Tropez  was . Those who had the mundane experience were united by it and enjoyed sharing common ground making them happier overall. 'At worst, people may be envious and resentful of those who have had an extraordinary experience, and at best, they may find themselves with little to talk about,' wrote the paper's authors. As leading psychologist Cooney paraphrases: 'If an experience turns you into someone who has nothing in common with others, then no matter how good it was, it won't make you happy in the long run.' Helicopter skiing might make an incredible trip but talking about it will alienate people and make them envious . An abstract from the paper reads: 'People seek extraordinary experiences - from drinking rare wines and taking exotic vacations to jumping from airplanes and shaking hands with celebrities. 'But are such experiences worth having? 'We found that participants thoroughly enjoyed having experiences that were superior to those had by their peers, but that having had such experiences spoiled their subsequent social interactions and ultimately left them feeling worse than they would have felt if they had had an ordinary experience instead. 'Participants were able to predict the benefits of having an extraordinary experience but were unable to predict the costs. 'These studies suggest that people may pay a surprising price for the experiences they covet most.'","Uncommon experiences make us 'alien and enviable' according to paper .

"David Cameron’s pledge to force GP surgeries to stay open seven days a week will be impossible to deliver without hiring thousands of new doctors, health experts said today. The Prime Minister said everyone would have access to a GP every day of the week by 2020, with surgeries opening from 8am to 8pm. But doctors' leaders warned that GPs were already stretched to breaking point because of staff shortages and NHS cuts. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister will unveil a revolution in the family doctor service, so that busy patients will no longer struggle to fit in visits to their GP with childcare and work commitments . Mr Cameron insisted significant additional funds and staffing would be introduced to meet the pledge. He said 12 hour surgery opening hours and weekend appointments were already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries. The PM annuonced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million people are covered in 2015, and a further £400million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election. But Dr Richard Vautry, a GP and spokesman for the British Medical Association, said: ‘GPs are under huge pressure at the moment and we can't sustain the current service, let alone stretch it to a seven-day service, without significant extra funding and more importantly significant extra staff.’ Under the Government's plan doctors will be required to band together so that they can take it in turns to open at weekends – giving all patients access to a GP on Saturdays and Sundays. Mr Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed the proposal – which will cost £400million over the next five years – at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today. The reforms are a response to growing concern over the quality of out-of-hours care. Labour’s 2004 contract allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends. But while the plans will be welcomed by patients, doctors themselves are likely to warn that there simply are not enough staff to open at weekends and keep the level of service the same during the week. David Cameron (left) and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) will reveal the plans - which will cost £400million over the next five years - at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham . There will also be concerns that practices will simply employ expensive locum GPs to cover the extra opening hours. As well as seven-day-a-week access and evening opening hours, Mr Cameron said family doctors will also be encouraged to try out services to suit modern lifestyles, such as greater use of Skype, email and phone consultations. They will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments and registration. And every patient will be given a named GP responsible for their care outside hospital. The Prime Minister said: ‘People need to be able to see their GP at a time that suits them and their family. That’s why we will make sure everyone can see a GP seven days a week by 2020. ‘We will also support thousands more GP practices to stay open longer – giving millions of patients better access to their doctor.’ Mr Cameron first signalled the reforms last year, when he unveiled a £50million fund for 20 groups of GPs to develop ways to improve access for 7.5million patients. While the plans will be welcomed by patients, doctors themselves are likely to warn that there simply are not enough staff to open at weekends . Today he will say that, from April 2015, the Government will invest a further £100million into the fund. This will allow a second wave of pilot schemes. Not all surgeries will open at weekends. Instead, practices will band together and agree to take turns to open at weekends – seeing all patients from all their lists. A source said: ‘We are not being prescriptive about this. We want to see practices joining together in hubs, to ensure all the patients on their lists have access to a GP surgery at the weekend. ‘So it might not be your GP who is open, but there will be one down the road.’ However, when the pilots were launched last year, some doctors warned that the plan would be ‘undeliverable’. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘It’s not realistic to talk about GP services opening from 8 until 8, seven days a week – that’s the bottom line.’ Later today NHS England will publish the revised GP contract, which will include the return of a ‘named GP’. It means every person in the country will have a named family doctor who is responsible for their care outside hospital.","Money pumped into NHS so surgeries can open from 8am until 8pm .

"The matchball from one of the most iconic and infamous matches in World Cup history will be auctioned next week, with an estimated value of £15,000. England – on their way to victory on home soil in 1966 – beat Argentina 1-0 at Wembley in a quarter-final best remembered for the sending-off of opposition captain Antonio Rattin. The family of German referee Rudolf Kreitlein inherited the ball – which had been in his living-room since 1966 – following his death in 2012 and now it - along with other pieces of his memorabilia from the tournament in England – will go under the hammer in the German town of Kassel. The items, belonging to Rudolf, Rreitlein are being sold in Germany at auction by Agon . The items include the match whistle, match card and fan mail from all over the world .

The match was described by Argentines as the 'Robbery of the Century', while England boss Alf Ramsey refused to allow the players to swap shirts and would later describe the visitors as 'animals'. Kreitlein dismissed Rattin for dissent before half-time having earlier cautioned him for a foul on Bobby Charlton, but the skipper refused to leave the field and the Spanish-speaking player insisted that a translator be called amid a 10-minute hold-up. He did eventually depart escorted by police before scrunching the corner-flag – carrying a Union Jack – in his hand. The Argentinians later claimed there was a conspiracy between the English and the Germans to have them eliminated from the competition. Geoff Hurst scored the winning goal 12 minutes from time as England made it through to the last four – where they beat Portugal – before defeating West Germany in the final. Alf Ramsey steps in to stop the England's George Cohen swapping his shirt with the Argentines .

Rudolf Kreitlein is escorted off the pitch after a difficult match in which he sent off the Argentinian captain . Kreitlein, along with Ken Aston, the English supervisor of referees during the game, are credited with the introduction of yellow and red cards as a means of communicating better with players in light of the Rattin incident.

"The woman whose death went unnoticed for six years somehow voted in Michigan's 2010 gubernatorial election. Mummified remains were discovered in the Pontiac home belonging to 49-year-old Pia Farrenkopf last week, when a contractor was dispatched to the property when it went into foreclosure. The remains found in the backseat of a jeep parked in the home's garage have not been positively identified yet, but authorities believe the body belongs to Farrenkopf. Adding more mystery to the gruesome discovery is the fact that Farrenkopf registered to vote in 2006 and even cast a vote in the 2010 elections, though authorities believe she died at some point in 2008. Scroll down for video . Sign of life: Records show that Pia Farrenkopf (pictured above in her high school yearbook) voted in the 2010 Michigan elections, though police estimate she died around 2008 . The . city clerk told the Detroit Free-Press that Farrenkopf's vote in the governor's race may have been . an 'administrative error' since infrequent voters tend to participate in . presidential races (like the one in 2008), as opposed to local ones. 'Everything . to date points toward late 2008,' Oakland County Sheriff Michael . Bouchard said. 'This information, obviously, has to be run to its . logical conclusion.' Farrenkopf's sister believes that foul play was involved in her death. Paula Logan told wxyz.com: 'I think there was foul play. I think someone might have been in that garage.' Logan insisted that her sister was not the type of person to commit suicide. Waiting: Police tape surrounds the house on Savanna Drive where a woman was found dead in the back seat of an SUV in the garage on March 6 . Decay: Police had to done HAZMAT suits to enter the home, the interior of which was covered in a toxic black mold . The remains were discovered only last . Wednesday when a bank contractor was sent to the home to investigate a . hole in the roof after it went into foreclosure in March 2013. Farrenkopf's payments for her . mortgage, utilities and other bills, were automatically deducted from . her bank account which at one time contained $54,000. The . money finally ran out, leading to the grim discovery of the woman's . mummified body lying on the back seat of a Jeep Liberty registered to . Farrenkopf inside the garage. Undersheriff . Mike McCabe told Detroit Free Press that investigators believe the . woman has been dead since at least 2008. That’s the year the license . plate on Farrenkopf's Jeep expired. The . body was clothed in a heavy jacket and jeans, leading investigators to . believe that it was winter when she died. The key was in the ignition, . but it was switched to the off position. Investigators . are treating the death as a homicide at this time and say suicide by . carbon monoxide seems unlikely. The body shows no signs of trauma, . McCabe says. Crime scene? A woman was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep inside the garage of her Detroit home and she may have been there for upwards of three years . Dr Bernadino Pacris, the Oakland . County deputy medical examiner, said the skin was intact on the corpse, . but the internal organs had decomposed. Climate, weather and humidity play a role in preserving a body in such a way, he said. The . medical examiner's office is awaiting toxicology results and hopes to . find dental records to identify whether the corpse is Farrenkopf. Neighbors of Farrenkopf's on Savanna St said they never noticed anything amiss. The woman lived alone and kept to herself, often disappearing for days or weeks on business. According . to the Detroit News, Farrenkopf was a contractor with Chrysler's . financing division before her employment was terminated in September . 2008. Investigation: The body was found when a contractor went into the home because it is going into foreclosure . Unpaid bills: Mail for Pia Farrenkopf on the snowy driveway to the home she once owned . Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said that detectives had spoken to a sister of Farrenkopf in Boston, who told them that the two were estranged and had not spoken in years. Ms Logan said that the Chrysler job had been the reason for her sister's move from Massachusetts to Detroit. Neighbor Darryl Tillery, 49, said the woman’s mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat. Neighbor Darryl Tillery talks about Pia Farrenkopf, and says there were no outward signs that she had died more than five years ago and was lying in her garage . 'It was pretty manicured,' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'There was no indication there was a body in there, at all.' Some believed they no longer saw Farrenkopf because she had moved to Germany, something she had indicated that she intended to do. Many left the area after the economy crashed in 2009 wand they could no longer afford their mortgage payments. The outside of the home was fairly well maintained, but inside a black mold had taken over, McCabe said. WXYZ reports that Farrenkopf's stepfather Edward Caroll, said she was estranged from her family. Caroll married Farrenkopf’s mother three years ago. He said Pia Farrenkopf never answered the wedding invitation. 'I tried to find her through the Internet and everything and I never could find her.  And I wrote a letter a couple times and I think some of them came back. Her mother hadn’t heard from her for years and years.' Farrenkopf's mother died a year and a half ago.","Public records show Pia Farrenkopf voted in Michigan's 2010 elections .

"A pensioner who shouted 'die you b******' after slitting the throat of his son-in-law with a steak knife has been jailed for six years. Rodney Cohen, 68, had flown over from New Zealand after learning his daughter Jane's marriage to her husband 'was on the rocks'. Victim Declan Campbell thought Cohen was 'joking' when he first approached him with the knife and it was only when blood poured out did he realise what had happened. Mr Campbell said the amount of blood 'was like something out of a Halloween horror film' and had to hold his jugular together with his fingers to stay alive. Rodney Cohen (pictured), 68, crept up behind Declan Campbell and pulled his head back before cutting his neck . Cohen's daughter Jane, 43, sent her husband Declan Campbell (pictured left) an email ending their marriage . Mr Campbell was rushed to Luton and Dunstable hospital with two slashed veins and a gaping neck wound . The 41-year-old ran from the house to a nearby pub as a laughing Cohen shouted 'die you b******' from a balcony. He was rushed to hospital with two slashed veins and a gaping neck wound and was unconscious for 24 hours. St Albans Crown Court heard the attack happened on July 26 after Cohen flew over from New Zealand when his daughter Jane, 43, sent an email to her husband saying she wanted to end their marriage. The two men had been to Sainsbury's in the town to buy beer and were drinking on the balcony in Harpenden, St Albans, when Cohen suddenly crept up behind his son-in-law, pulled his head back and cut his neck with the knife. He narrowly missed his jugular vein and left blood pouring from a 10cm wound. When Cohen was arrested he told the police: 'I am sorry. I saw the knife and picked it up and sliced it across his throat.' He told the police the pair had been arguing and accused Mr Campbell of making derogatory comments about his daughter, who was away at the time. Cohen, who has lived in New Zealand since he was 18, and pictured here with daugther Jane, admitted wounding with intent at St Albans Crown Court in September and was sentenced to six years in prison . The court heard the couple had only got married in July 2013 after meeting four months earlier . Prosecutor David Stanton said: 'The first thing Mr. Campbell knew about it was when the defendant pulled him by the neck. 'He pulled the skin so it was stretched and he was cutting Mr Campbell with a kitchen knife. 'At first he thought he was joking. It wasn't until blood started pouring from the wound that Mr Campbell realised what had happened and he was scared he was going to die. 'Mr Campbell ran from his house and heard Mr Cohen laughing as he left. He heard him shouting ""die you b******""'. When Cohen was arrested he told the police: 'I am sorry. I saw the knife and picked it up and sliced it across his throat' Cohen, who has lived in New Zealand since he was 18, admitted wounding with intent at St Albans Crown Court in September and was sentenced to six years in prison. Judge Stephen Gullick told him: 'You came over to this country because your daughter's marriage was on the rocks. You came here with the intention to go and assist this couple. 'You and your son-in-law had been and bought some alcohol. You then got a hold of him by the head and effectively you slit his throat. 'You cut the skin of his throat but you did not cause any injury to the internal organs which is fortunate but a matter of luck rather than judgement.' The court heard the couple had only got married in July 2013 after meeting four months earlier. Mr Campbell was devastated in August this year when his wife sent him an email saying she wanted to end their relationship. He desperately tried to change her mind but eventually gave up when she told him the marriage was beyond saving. Speaking outside court Mr Campbell said he has not seen his wife since the attack because she chose to stand by her father. The engineer said he had the 'perfect life' with IT specialist Jane, 43, and rejected claims that her father had travelled to the country to help save their marriage. He added that three days before the attack he and his wife had celebrated their first anniversary in a plush hotel. Mr Campbell, who still lives in the house where the attack happened, said: 'Jane and I had resolved all our issues back in February. We were just a young married couple very much in love. 'He came in and poisoned our marriage. He has destroyed the whole lot and I think it is because he was jealous of us. 'Jane was the love of my life. She gave me butterflies and he took that away from me. 'We had some arguments but they were about hanging the towel up or about ordering her the wrong meal. There were never any big bust ups.' He added that he felt the sentence handed down by Judge Gullick was an 'injustice' and said six years was not enough. The father-of-one said: 'The sentence was not my decision to make, but it is not enough and doesn't reflect how this has affected me. 'It is a total injustice as far as I am concerned. I was expecting him to get a lot more. He was trying to kill me, he wanted to murder me. 'I have had nightmares and the attack will always be in the back of my mind. It has shattered my confidence and I will live with this for the rest of my life. 'The amount of blood was like something out of a Halloween horror film. I had to hold my jugular together with my fingers to keep me alive. 'After the attack I secluded myself, I was ashamed and I didn't want to talk to anybody. I have gone from sky high to rock bottom just like that.'","Rodney Cohen, 68, slit the throat of his son-in-law Declan Campbell .

"A shocked couple watched on as a coastguard team dramatically rescued their pet dog trapped down a 200ft cliff. John Griffiths, 47, and his wife Michelle, 36, looked on as their German shepherd Chloe was hauled back up to safety. The complex operation took more than an hour to carry out on the seafront at Cromer, north Norfolk, yesterday morning. John Griffiths, 47, and his wife, Michelle, 36, were relieved to be reunited with their pet dog, Chloe (pictured left) Jerry Woodley, from the HM Coastguard rescue team, rescued the dog which slipped down a cliff in Cromer . The difficult operation took more than an hour to carry out on the seafront at Cromer, in north Norfolk . And the crowd of holidaymakers and locals who gathered to see the drama unfold cheered as Chloe was rescued. Mrs Griffiths wept with relief when she was reunited with her pet dog. She said: 'I am just so relieved that she is not hurt - the Coastguard did a brilliant job.' The couple were walking along the cliff top  with six-year-old Chloe and 14-month-old Tilly, a German Shepherd crossed with a Siberian Husky, when the older dog slipped and tumbled. Mr Griffiths said: 'We didn't see Chloe go off the cliff but we knew something had happened when she disappeared. You read about dogs going off cliffs and you think, how can that happen, but it can. 'I could not believe that she had got that close to the cliff.' Mr Griffiths bravely slid down part of the way through thick bushes and undergrowth in a desperate bid to get to Chloe. But he quickly realised it was far too dangerous and rang 999 to raise the alarm. Mr Griffiths waited nervously as the rescue team worked to retrieve his German Shepherd dog, Chloe . The rescue team set up special ropes and a tugger machine to lower Mr Woodley down the steep cliff . The dog's owners pose with the rescue team when they had been successfully reunited with their pet . Ten members of the Mundesley, Sheringham and Cromer Coastguard units arrived about 10 minutes later, along with Cromer fire crew members and a police. They set up special ropes and a tugger machine to lower Sheringham Coastguard's Jerry Woodley down the cliff. Mr Woodley, said he found Chloe barking with terror and trapped about 60ft down the steep 200ft cliff. He said it was a tough rescue as dense brambles totally covered the dog. 'It was hard trying to get the dog in the rescue bag. Once we achieved that, it was fairly straightforward', he said. Mr Griffiths, who made a generous donation to the Coastguard as a token of his appreciation for saving Chloe's life, said: 'They were fantastic - especially when you think they are all volunteers. 'We just cannot thank them enough.'","German shepherd Chloe slipped off the cliff top at Cromer, north Norfolk .

"The bereaved mother of Utah teen is convinced her otherwise healthy son's death was caused by a flu-shot he was given the day before he fell ill - in a case which baffled doctors. In the obituary for her son, Chandler, 19, Lori Webb said that her son was given his first ever shot on October 15th after agreeing to travel on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, the day after receiving the flu and tuberculosis shots, the Brighton High School graduate began suffering sever vomiting and was admitted to hospital in Salt Lake City wehere he fell into a coma 24-hours later. Tragic: Lori Webb with her son Chandler who died on November 19th after spending a month in a coma - which his mother believes was triggered by a flu-shot . 'Sicker than he has ever been in his life. He says he's never shook so hard his whole life. He had the worst headache, throw up, and he slept for about two and a half days and didn't eat anything during that time,' said Webb to the Salt Lake Tribune. Chandler was ultimately taken off life support after a month in a coma and he died on Tuesday after 28 days in the hospital. Chandler Webb’s direct cause of death was swelling of the brain, his mother said. But Lori claims that it has to be the flu shot because her had never been ill before. 'We're angry because we believe it's the flu shot that caused it,' said Lori to the Salt Lake Tribune. However, Chandler's doctors have not discussed his case and public health officials repeated that the vaccine is safe and rarely has serious side effects. Fit and Healthy: Chandler Webb was described by his mother as the picture of health and would visit the gym five-days a week in an effort to stay fit . Lori has decided not to have an autopsy, deciding that the results of a brain biopsy will be sufficient to determine the cause of death. Chandler's medical team, which included six neurologists at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, tested him for every conceivable illness - including Lyme disease and sexually transmitted ones. 'They checked every virus, every fungus, ever tick, west nile they even checked for rabies,' said Webb.  'And they can't find anything...it was the most senseless, senseless, death.' 'This was his first flu shot,' Webb said. 'He’d never had one before.' 'I hate this. 'I hate that I have to bury my son.' Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said the state is aware of the case but can’t verify the cause of death or whether it is investigating. The health department also has no record of anyone from Utah dying from a reaction to the vaccine, he said. Hundreds of millions: A man is given a flu shot by at the medical offices of Yaffe Ruden & Associates in New York on January 10, 2013. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises those at risk get the shot . 'Like with other medical procedures, there can be side effects and adverse reactions,' he said. 'In the vast majority of those cases the side effects are not very severe — soreness at the injection site, low fever, achiness. Occasionally, yes, there are more severe side effects from receiving the vaccine.' 130 million people nationwide, nearly half of Americans, get the flu vaccine every year and side effects are extremely rare. Out of those 130 million people, about 140 people report serious side-effects. Chandler Webb was described as a healthy teen, who visited the gym five days a week before he fell ill. Lori Webb described how as her son was taken off life-support she cut his hair for the last time and told him the story of 'The Three Billy Goats Gruff', just as she did when he was a child. 'I can’t describe how hard it is to lose a child,' she said.","Chandler Webb, 19, fell ill one day after being given a flu-shot before a Mormon mission .

"Amanda Knox's former lover Raffaele Sollecito has reportedly asked her to marry him in a blatant attempt to flee to the United States. Sollecito made the desperate plea in March, six years after they were both tried in Italian court for the 2007 murder of Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher to avoid serving more jail time, his ex-girlfriend, Kelsey Kay, claimed this week. The couple, who split years ago, are awaiting potential new convictions in a retrial of their case in Italy, after their previous murder convictions were overturned in 2011. While Knox said she plans to be a 'fugitive' and remain in the U.S. if re-convicted, Sollecito could face a lengthy prison sentence because he's an Italian citizen. Scroll down for video . Desperate bid: Raffaele Sollecito, pictured outside Florence court, Italy, reportedly tried to marry Amanda Knox to flee possible jail time . But Kay, told RadarOnline that he propositioned Knox and her lawyers in an attempt to become a U.S. citizen and dodge potential jail time. 'Raffaele told me that when he had been in Seattle in March, his lawyers and Amanda's lawyers had a meeting where he had proposed the idea of the two of them marrying,' Kay said. 'It would've been natural to the public that the two of them got married.' But she insisted it would have been purely a marriage of convenience. 'Raffaele proposed the idea to Amanda and her lawyers so that he could obtain citizenship in the United States and stay,' Kay claimed in the RadarOnline interview. She added that it was important for her that the public know the truth about what happened between Sollecito and Knox, who is in another committed relationship with classical guitarist James Terrano, . 'And what had happened — according to him — is in the meeting, he had proposed marriage and that she had told him that she was seeing someone for the past few years and that (it) wasn't an option,' Kay said. Ex: His ex, Kelsey Kay, pictured, told RadarOnline that he propositioned Knox and her lawyers in an attempt to become a U.S. citizen and dodge potential jail time . The news comes as an Italian court was urged to ensure Knox and Sollecito serve their sentences, if they are found guilty of the murder Kercher. Knox has stayed in Seattle while there is an Italian retrial for the murder of the Leeds University student, while Sollecito has been present in Italy. She and her ex-boyfriend are accused of stabbing Kercher, 21, to death and sexually assaulting her while the young women were studying abroad in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini has requested guilty verdicts and jail . sentences of 26 years for both defendants. Crini also urged that the court increase Knox's three-year sentence for a slander conviction . to four years. Knox and her one-time lover served four years in jail for the murder of Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox. Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy's highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial. The Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca told the court after the concluding arguments in the trial, . that the family trusts the court to reach a fair decision. Miss Kercher's half-naked body was found  beneath a blanket in her locked bedroom on November 2, 2007. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed multiple times . A lawyer speaking for Meredith Kercher's family, mother Arline, sister Stephanie and brother Lyle, said they trust the court to reach a fair decision . Maresco said: 'I am sure whatever the decision of the . court, there will be justice because all of the elements have been . profoundly evaluated. 'It will be a decision that we . will accept with absolute serenity.' The defence and prosecution are both making their summing up arguments before the court begins deliberations on January 30, when a verdict is expected. During a break, Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said that any request . for extradition could be made only after a possible guilty verdict is . confirmed by Italy's highest court, a process that can take more than a year. She is currently being tried in absentia and would become a 'fugitive' if she fails to return to serve her sentence should she be found guilty. Sollecito's father, Francesco Sollecito, said his son has no intention of escaping justice and that was evident in the fact that he had been present throughout the trial. Precautionary measures could include immediate arrest, house arrest or the confiscation of his passport. He added that his son has been looking for jobs abroad because he 'hoped the story' would soon end. Kercher's half-naked body was found beneath a blanket in her locked bedroom on November 2, 2007.

"Former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger was sentenced Thursday to life in prison for his murderous reign of terror in the 1970s and '80s, bringing to a close a case that exposed FBI corruption so deep that many people across the city thought he would never be brought to justice. Bulger, 84, was defiant to the end, calling his trial on racketeering charges a sham and refusing to testify or provide information to probation officials preparing a sentencing report for the judge. A jury convicted Bulger in August in a broad racketeering indictment that included murder, extortion, money-laundering and weapons charges. The jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with participating in but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a conclusion on an eighth. Scroll down for video .

Bulger, the inspiration for Jack Nicholson's sinister character in the 2006 movie 'The Departed', was seen for years as a Robin Hood figure who bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class South Boston residents and kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood.

Sean McGonagle was 11 when his father, Paul, disappeared. He said Bulger called his family's house the following year and said, 'Your father won't be coming home for Christmas'. When he asked, 'Who's this?' Bulger responded, 'Santa Claus,' McGonagle said. 'You're a domestic terrorist fueled by greed and sickening evil,' McGonagle said. Tommy Donahue, the son of murder victim Michael Donahue, told reporters he had waited 31 years for someone to pay for his father's death.

"Two decades after her mother kidnapped her as a baby and made them fugitives across five continents, Savanna Todd faces separation from the woman she desperately loves and forgives. As Dorothy Lee Barnett is held among thieves and drug dealers at Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre in Queensland, Australia, her 20-year-old  daughter Savanna says she supports her mother’s actions. In an exclusive interview with Today Tonight, which screens tonight at 6.30pm on Channel 7, Savanna – now a university student who goes by the name of Samantha Geldenhuys – says her mother should be given a chance to explain what she did. Scroll down for video . Grown-up: Savanna Todd only discovered her past when the police knocked on the door to arrest her mother Dorothy Lee Barnett . Secret past: Savanna knew nothing about her wealthy father or that the FBI had an international warrant out on her mother . Dorothy Barnett, 53, faces up to more than a decade in a U.S. prison if convicted of alleged U.S. federal crimes. But as the story of their life on the run using a string of aliases and staying ahead of an international manhunt makes global headlines, the young woman at the centre of the storm has pleaded her mother’s  case. 'I backed my Mum on the first day because I knew who she was and I knew what she did would be for a valid reason,' she said. ‘I was brought up not to judge until I see fit. 'I’ve always had a mother. I’ve always been loved. I’ve always been protected. I’ve read her side. I’ve read all the docs and I feel that she needs to be heard.’ In 1994, then an 11-month-old baby, Savanna Todd was living with her parents in Charleston, South Carolina. Fugitive: Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured in the US before she kidnapped her daughter and began her life on the run . Dorothy Barnett, a flight attendant, had married Benjamin Harris Todd in December 1991, but the relationship foundered amid accusations of violence and her desire to have a child. Barnett filed for divorce in February 1993, alleging in court documents that Todd had left her because he was angry about her being pregnant, reports The Post and Courier . Todd accused Barnett of physically and emotionally abusing him, winning temporary custody of their then unborn daughter after psychiatric tests showed Barnett to be bi-polar . In a little-seen interview with Columbia Journalism School from 2009, Todd – now a successful investment banker who lives in the exclusive ocean-side S.C. suburb of Isle of Palms - said he cited 'physical cruelty' by Barnett in his divorce papers. He said their marriage was impromptu, with a planned vacation to the Bahamas quickly refashioned as a honeymoon, and that soon after his wife his wife turned violent. Todd alleged Barnett would attack him while driving in their car . 'I've never hit a woman in my life,' Todd said. 'I can't explain why I let myself be hit.' He said she wouldn't sleep for 'seven or eight days at a stretch' and she would 'beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours’. One night, he awoke to find her lying in a fetal position on the floor, staring at nothing, rocking back and forth. He went into hiding and would sometimes sleep in his car. ‘I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses,’ Todd said. ‘She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself.’ Barnett was diagnosed with manic depression - now largely classified as bi-polar disorder - but refused to get treatment. Barnett's lawyer, Mendell Rivers, said Barnett's 'tragic lack of self-control' in the court room lead the judge to believe the accusations were true. In court she claimed Todd was evil and she suspected he was homosexual. But the stress of the trial and the stress of being a mother was 'too much for her to handle', Rivers said. Mother and daughter on the run map . In prison: Ms Barnett is currently in the Brisbane Womens' Correctional Centre awaiting a hearing next week (file picture) Savanna Todd was born on May 6, 1993. Her father was granted sole custody, with Barnett allowed two supervised weekend visits a month. But during a court-supervised visit in April 1994, mother and daughter left for a birthday party without an escort. According to a police report, they never returned. The same month they disappeared, the FBI obtained a warrant for Barrett’s arrest. Artists created images depicting what Savanna and Barnett would look like as the years went on. Barnett had left behind a map of South America, however according to Queensland news reports, she initially fled to South Africa, where she married a man, Juan Geldenhuys, in 1995. She gave birth to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen. Five years ago, she settled in Australia after splitting with Mr Geldenhuys, who recently died of bone cancer. During her alleged time on the run, Barnett used aliases such as Alexandria Maria Canton, federal authorities said, to evade detection. Once in March 2003 and again in March 2004, Barnett used her new name, Alexandria Maria Geldenhuys, to attempt to get a U.S. passport, according to the indictment against her. TodayTonight Original Story . YouTube - TodayTonight - Savanna Todd . Then and now: Savanna Harris Todd has remained a missing person for 19 years after being kidnapped by her mother in April 1994. Pictures of her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might look like today (right) Court papers say Savanna's father was the one who led authorities to his ex-wife. An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her. He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship. A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact Benjamin Harris Todd. Life on the run came to an end on November 4 last year when, at the behest of the FBI, the Australian Federal Police arrested her on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, where she and Savanna had been living under several aliases. Most astonished of all was Savanna herself. On the day police knocked on her mother’s door she woke up to a different name, identity and past. The vivacious nursing student and skilled lifesaver knew herself as Samantha Geldenhuys, and knew nothing of the fact she had a wealthy and successful father who lived in America. But Savanna-Samantha did not harbour any resentment towards her mother, and to this day believes she has done nothing wrong. ‘A name does not change who you are,’ Samantha tells Today Tonight. ‘I’ve always had a mother. I’ve always been loved. I’ve always been protected. I don't feel I have an identity crisis, when I was told I was Savanna Todd or Savannah Barnett, or whatever alias.' ‘Savanna can be a remembrance of what happened 20 years ago but Samantha is who I am and who I will be.’ Barnett was charged with international parental kidnapping and two counts of false statement in a passport application and taken immediately into custody where she has remained since. Savanna was by her mother’s side at Barnett’s first court appearance, where she held up a sign saying ‘We love you Mom’. According to The Australian, Barnett, who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by more than two dozen people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good character. Barnett's barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, unsuccessfully applied for bail, saying  his client was not a flight risk and had a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community. She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home. According to Today Tonight, Savanna is a ‘courageous , intelligent young woman with an extraordinary resolve to see justice done’. ‘This story is a riveting rollercoaster of emotions and intrigue,’ said Today Tonight executive producer Max Uechtritz. ‘It's got it all: the FBI, an international manhunt, fugitives on the run across four countries and two decades, an ultimate betrayal and now the highly-charged consequences. ‘It's a compelling tale of a mother's fierce, protective love, now reciprocated by her little girl.  Samantha is determined that the truth gets out about why her mother was forced to do what did. ‘We've  forensically examined hundreds  of pages of evidence from the original custodial court case and spoken to multiple key witnesses who still say their testimony was ignored or dismissed.’ Barnett will next appear at an extradition hearing in a Queensland court. It is expected she will be extradited back to the United States to face her charges. If convicted, Barnett could spend three years in prison on the kidnapping charge and 10 years on each of the two passport counts.","Australian woman, 20, discovers mother kidnapped her as a baby from US .

Forecasters are predicting one of the coldest Super Bowls in recent memory this year as a second block of arctic air hovers over New York and New Jersey. Temperatures are expected to hover around 30F all week and there is now a 30 per cent chance of snow on Super Bowl Sunday. The venue, Met Life stadium in New Jersey is also open to the elements meaning a potentially uncomfortable experience for the majority of fans who will not be in heated suites. There is even speculation that the game could be postponed if faced with heavy snow - an outcome that would surely bring questions about the decision to hold the game in an uncovered stadium in the North East. Superstars: Peyton Manning and Richard Sherman are among the draws at the Super Bowl as the cheapest ticket nears $1,000 . The last two Super Bowls have been held in temperature-controlled domes in Indianapolis and New Orleans. However experts say that other factors are also conspiring to drive the cost of tickets down. Both the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks are based on the others side of the country, making an impulsive decision to attend the game harder to make. Prices were also talked up in the months before the game, with many predicting that the combination of the wealth of the New York area and two exciting finals teams would push the minimun ticket price to $3,000. Analyst Ram Silverman, of Golden Tickets in Plano Texas told ESPN: 'The price has to get down to that point where people will say, 'I'm going even if my team isn't in it. There are millions of people in the tri-state area who have the money to do it, and some of them are going to say, 'I just don't care about the weather for that price.''","Cheapest ticket is on the stadium's upper level for $1,277.50, down significantly on the past two years .
Temperatures are forecast to be in the 20s on Super Bowl Sunday ."
"Pictured in his white cowboy hat rushing horrifically injured Boston bombing survivor Jeff Bauman away from the finishing line, Carlos Arredondo is one half of possibly the most iconic image from that fateful day in April. The Costa Rican native became the face of 'Boston Strong', as the proud city battled to recover from the scars left by the two Tsarnaev brothers. But behind the bravado, Arredondo was and still is fighting his own demons, the hero of Boston tortured by the anguish caused by the deaths of his two young sons and how that pain propelled him to help Bauman as he lay bleeding on the floor. Iconic life changing image: Carlos Arredondo, center, push Jeff Bauman in a wheel chair after he was injured in an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Monday, April 15, 2013 in Boston . 'I told him to hold on,' Carlos said of the moment he ran to help the injured and saw Bauman lying on the floor with only protruding bones where his legs once were. 'He looked very pale. I thought he was going to die.' Carlos didn't know his name was Jeff at that moment - he only knew that he looked young enough to be Alex, the son he lost in Iraq, or Brian, his boy who tragically killed himself in the years after that. The selfless bravery the 52-year-old showed that day on Boylston Street was captured forever by Associated Press photographer Charles Krupa - his image of Jeff Bauman's ashen face and Carlos in his white cowboy hat splashed across the front pages of the world's papers. Within that one flash of a picture, photogenic Carlos was instantly propelled to fame and hungry reporters began to delve into the hero's life - discovering his dark struggle. They discovered that Carlos has endured two divorces, suffers severe depression and is bi-polar and of course lost his two sons. Carlos Arredondo was in his front yard putting up a new white pickett fence when a marine van pulled up to his home to inform him that his 20 year old son Alexander Scott Arredondo was killed in Iraq in 2004 . Carlos Arredondo of Florida is carried by stretcher to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish, where funeral services were held for his son, USMC Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo, who was killed in action in Iraq at the end of August . Driven by guilt over his two boys, Carlos feels he is a different man when he goes home and takes the hat off. He told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that he feels that God is punishing him for his mistakes. But, since April, Carlos has become the public face of the rehabilitation of Boston, he eats out for free and appeared alongside James Taylor as he sang 'American the Beautiful' at the World Series. 'I don't know how long this is going to last,' Carlos said in October to the Sun Sentinel. 'I didn't ask for any of this.' At home when he isn't appearing at a charity function or a commemorative event, Carlos's thoughts delve into the dark. Thoughts of his two boys keep him awake at night, 'There have been times when I just cry and cry for days,' Carlos said. 'I never stop thinking about them.' His second ex-wife, Mélida, who still lives with him in Boston, worries when there is no answer if she calls during the day. She fears he may have killed himself. Hero: Carlos Arredondo (L), who rushed to the aid of a man injured in the Boston Marathon bombings, removes his hat during the singing of the national anthem before the start of Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference semifinal . Indeed, the pain for Carlos began in August 2004 when his son Alex was killed by a sniper's bullet to the head. Alex enlisted in the army in August 2001 and because he was 17 need his mother, Victoria Foley. to sign papers to allow him to join. The events of September 11 only strengthened his resolve and his first deployment was to Iraq in 2003. In one poignant letter he wrote to his father, Alex said, 'I'm not afraid of dying. I am more afraid of what will happen to all the ones that I love if something happens to me.' But on August 25th, 2004 everything changed when a van arrived outside his then home in South Florida. Boston marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman (L), responder Carlos Arredondo (C), and Taylor Morris (R) of the U.S. Navy are honored in a ceremony before the New York Jets face the New England Patriots in their NFL AFC East football game . Three Marines in full dress blue uniforms got out and asked if he was Mr. Carlos Arredondo. 'Are you the father of Marine Lance Cpl. Alexander Scott Arredondo?' 'Yes.' 'The commandant of the Marine Corps has entrusted me to express his deep regret that your son, Alexander, was killed in action today in Najaf, Iraq...' What followed became a blur to Carlos, but he does know that he became enraged after he asked the Marines to leave and they said no - because he needed to sign legal documents. He grabbed a hammer, a container, a propane torch and set fire to the Marine's van and himself. Carlos was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, then transferred to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Hospital in Miami. He had burns on 26 percent of his body. Carlos Arredondo, who was at the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon when two explosives detonated, leaves the scene on April 15, 2013 in Boston . His actions that day proved polarizing to the nation - was he broken by the news his son died in a controversial war, or was Carlos selfishly stealing the limelight from his hero son? 'I lost my mind,' he said recently of the incident, which led him to be know as the Burning Dad. In the months after the incident, Carlos sought out the three Marines who informed him of his son's death to apologize. Police decided to not press charges and even his hospital bills were waived. Because he was the father of a fallen veteran, Carlos' application for U.S. citizenship was speeded up and he was made on in December 2006. The photographer who was there to capture the event - The Associated Press's Charles Krupa, the same photographer who would later snap the iconic shot of Carlos with Jeff in Boston. However, the stresses and strains of his burns and his continuing grief over his son Alex proved too much. He was admitted to McLean Hospital in Belmont Massachusetts, a psychiatric hospital, having moved away from Florida following his son's death. But for Carlos, there was worse pain to come. Alex's brother Brian, was 17 in 2004 and had been struggling since he had left to joint the army. He was having problems at school and had a brush with the law after stealing jewelry from a girlfriends house. Carlos Arredondo pulls a mock coffin of his son Alexander, who was killed in Iraq, as he joins other protesters marching toward the venue of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota August 31, 2008 . Brian began to fall into problems with drugs, using cocaine and heroin and moved into an apartment in a shed in his mother's backyard in Massachusetts. His first suicide attempt came in 2006 when he tried to strangle himself and it failed. He then tried to commit suicide by cop in 2011 - brandishing a machete at them - only to be subdued and placed in a mental institution. But on December 19, 2011, Brian's mother went  to check on him in the backyard shed and found Brian hanging by an electrical chord wrapped around his neck - he was 24. Victoria called Carlos with the news.'No, God, no!!!!' Carlos screamed. 'Not again!!!!' Carlos drifted after this. He returned to Costa Rica and traveled with a group of bereaved veteran's families to Europe on a fallen military members. The week before this year's marathon, Carlos returned to Boston. There were various groups that sent out runners to memorialize war casualties and a military group called Tough Ruckers that would walk the 26.2-mile course in full gear, carrying 40-pound rucksacks. Carlos was there to cheer them on. Oddly, just before Carlos waded in to help the wounded, he took pictures. This caused the FBI to wonder why, in short, they wondered whether Carlos was involved, so unusual was it to take pictures of blown-off limbs and bleeding injured. However, the suspicions quickly lifted in the days after the attacks and now as the face of 'Boston Strong' - Carlos uses his fame to keep himself busy. 'I'm just hoping for the best and praying,' Carlos said. 'There's no script for this.'","Carlos Arredondo was thrust into the limelight after a picture of him wearing a white cowboy hat rescuing a victim of the Boston bombings became the iconic image of the terror attacks .

"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has defended putting a nurse in quarantine for three days - in what she claims was a violation of her human rights - to protect residents from Ebola. Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo were sharply criticized for ordering mandatory quarantines when Kaci Hickox, 33, complained that she was held against her will after returning to the U.S. from West Africa, even though she did not show any symptoms of the illness. But Christie has maintained he did the right thing. 'My first responsibility is to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey,' Christie said on Today on Tuesday morning. Not backing down: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured on the Today show on Tuesday, has maintained that his strict quarantine rules are to protect the wellbeing of residents . 'I will not submit to any political pressure to do anything I believe is less than necessary.' He said that, despite criticisms, the state would not be changing its protocol. 'We're trying to be careful here,' he said. 'This is common sense... We're not moving an inch... Our policy has not changed. Our policy will not change.' He said that the CDC was now changing its 'incredibly confusing' policies to match with his state's. His comments came as Hickox left the New Jersey hospital and arrived at an undisclosed location in Maine, where her partner is a nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent. She now faces quarantine in Maine. Battle: Nurse Kaci Hickox, 33, said being forced into quarantine in New Jersey was 'inhumane' But one of Hickox's lawyers, Steve Hyman, said he expected her to remain in seclusion for the 'next day or so' while he works with Maine health officials. She was the first person forced into New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for people arriving at Newark Liberty from three West African countries. She threatened to sue the state for placing her in an unheated, 15ft x 20ft isolation tent with no working toilet in the University Hospital parking lot in Newark. He said he believes the state should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that require only monitoring, not quarantine, for health care workers who show no symptoms after treating Ebola patients. 'She's a very good person who did very good work and deserves to be honored, not detained, for it,' he said. Hickox, who was expected home Tuesday morning, volunteered in Africa with Doctors Without Borders. She spent the weekend in a quarantine tent in New Jersey despite having no symptoms other than a slightly elevated temperature she blamed on 'inhumane' treatment at Newark Liberty International Airport. This came although Hickox said she never had symptoms and tested negative for Ebola in a preliminary evaluation. She left New Jersey in a private vehicle on Monday. Locked up: Hickox is pictured inside an isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey on Sunday after she was quarantined following her flight into Newark Liberty International Airport . Fight: She is pictured with  prominent New York civil rights attorney Norman Siegel. She argued that she had shown no symptoms of the illness and was being held against her will in a violation of her human rights . On Monday, CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden announced a voluntary quarantine for health workers returning from West Africa, encouraging them to avoid public transport and undergo daily check-ups at home. In Maine, state officials also announced a quarantine. 'Upon the healthcare workers' return home, we will follow the guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for medical workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients,' Governor Paul LePage said in a statement. 'Additionally, we will work with the healthcare worker to establish an in-home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other Mainers until the period for potential infection has passed.' But state officials said later clarified it was only a voluntary quarantine. 'We fully expect individuals to voluntarily comply with an in-home quarantine,' LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said Monday. 'If an individual is not compliant, the state is prepared to take appropriate action.' Bennett did not immediately say what 'appropriate action' might be. At work: The 33-year-old nurse is pictured left during her recent trip to Sierra Leone, where she provided care for Ebola patients with non-profit organization Doctors Without Borders . Heading to quarantine: The nurse (circled in red above) is seen exiting an ambulance in a Hazmat suit outside University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey on Friday . In Fort Kent, Northern Maine Medical Center is ready to care for an Ebola-infected patient, if necessary, a spokeswoman said. Hickox and her partner, Ted Wilbur, had moved recently to Fort Kent, where Wilbur is a senior nursing student, family members said. WAGM-TV said Wilbur was given the choice of staying on campus in student housing over the next few weeks or temporarily suspending classes to stay with Hickox in his off-campus home during the quarantine period. A University of Maine system spokesman said he couldn't confirm details of discussions with Wilbur. Wilbur's uncle Tom Wilbur said that Hickox should be trusted to make good decisions and that medical decisions should be grounded in science and not 'hysteria.' 'She's very much a professional,' he said. 'And she's very bright. And if she were running a fever, she would be the first to take action.' Nina Pham: The 26-year-old Texas Health nurse, was declared Ebola-free on Friday at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. She will now return to Texas with her family and be reunited with her dog Bentley. She thanked doctors, family and the country for their 'prayers, hope and love' during her recovery. Her dog Bentley was declared Ebola-free earlier this week . Amber Vinson: The 29-year-old colleague of Miss Pham was given the all-clear on Wednesday from the virus. She was being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia . Ashoka Mukpo: The NBC cameraman, 33, was given the all-clear on Tuesday at Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with Ebola last month. He said that his greatest fear about dying from Ebola was leaving behind his beloved fiancee. Unidentified man: An Ebola patient who was being treated at Emory since early September was released earlier this week.  The man was released Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. WHO disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease. Thomas Eric Duncan: The Liberian man, 42, was the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was hospitalized on September 28 after initially being sent home from Texas Presbyterian Hospital. He died on October 8. Dr Rick Sacra: The doctor who has spent a great deal of the last two decades as a missionary in Africa, contracted Ebola while treating Ebola patients. Dr Sacra, from Massachusetts was declared disease-free and released on September 25 after weeks of treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital . Nancy Writebol: The missionary worker contracted Ebola in July and was flown from Liberia to Emory in Atlanta. She recovered several weeks later and was declared disease-free although has said she is still working to rebuild her strength. Dr Kent Brantly: The doctor contracted Ebola around the same time as his colleague, Nancy Writebol. Both he and Mrs Writebol received the experimental serum Z-Mapp. He was also declared Ebola free and has given multiple blood and plasma donations to help subsequent Ebola patients. Dr Craig Spencer: The 33-year-old Doctors Without Borders volunteer was the first person to be diagnosed in New York City. The medic was currently being monitored in Bellevue Hospital after being rushed from his Harlem home on Thursday . His fiancee Morgan Dixon and two friends are being monitored after their contact with him. His treatment to date has been undisclosed and his condition is said to be stable.","Kaci Hickox said that being held in quarantine in New Jersey - even though she showed no signs of the illness - was a violation of her human rights .

Two 12-year-old boys have been arrested for hurling a shopping cart from a fourth floor walkway that hit and critically injured a mother-of-two who was shopping for under-privileged children. Marion Hedges has been left fighting for her life after she was struck by the falling cart when the dangerous prank went wrong on Sunday evening in the East Harlem district of Manhattan, New York. The 47-year-old, who works as a real estate agent, had been walking with her 13-year-old son on the ground floor when she was hit, reported the New York Post. Her son was not injured in the incident. Critical: Marion Hedges, 47, remains in critical condition today after being hit by a shopping cart thrown from a fourth floor walkway . Marion Hedges was devoted to helping under-privileged children like the two who dropped a shopping trolley on her. She helps out at Manhattan's Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center and was out on Sunday buying sweets for trick-or-treaters. ‘She’s a terrific member,’ the centre’s executive director Wanda Wooten told the New York Daily News. ‘You can't believe this happened.’ Mrs Hedges attended the $37,500-a-year private Spence school and then the $40,400-a-year Barnard College in Manhattan. She has a 13-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter.

Mrs Hedges, who also has a daughter, was rushed to Harlem Hospital where she is reported to be in a stable condition but remains unconscious. The two boys have been charged as juveniles with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon. They were arrested after one of their friends reported the prank to the police. 'They deliberately pushed it over the . edge,' a law-enforcement source told the New York Post. 'They're a bunch of . stupid kids, they made a bad decision. She was in the wrong place at the . wrong time.' Her husband Michael Hedges told a New York Post reporter in Central Park while walking his dogs that his family is going through a 'very difficult time' and this is 'really a very tragic situation'. 'Every year on Halloween, 1,000 kids come to our block from less-privileged neighbourhoods and we spend $500 to $600 on candy for them and that's what she was doing,' he told the New York Post.

Heart-stopping: Mrs Hedges had been walking with her 13-year-old son on the ground floor when she was hit by the shopping cart, which flew from the fourth-floor walkway . 'They have her sedated right now, . she's unconscious. It's not quite clear what happened but I hear she has . some broken bones and some cranial injuries - there's some blood up . there,' he added gesturing to his head. 'They're letting us up two at a time and . we can only stay for five minutes. 'You can't really see anything up . there - it's just her lying in a bed unconscious with 50 thousand tubes . in her. She's stable, they're keeping her stable and her respiratory . system is functioning.'

"Meghan Hellrood is organizing a boycott of school lunches at D.C. Everest High School in Wisconsin . A Wisconsin high school student is leading a boycott of school lunches to protest new nutrition rules and calorie limits that she says are leaving her classmates still hungry. Meghan Hellrood of D.C. Everest High School in Weston, Wisconsin, is the latest student to take on the new school lunch regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama. 'We have calorie regulations now on our lunches, so students cannot take as much food as they used to be able to, but the whole Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act put restrictions on calories. The whole point of it was to get healthier foods, but instead of healthier foods, we’re getting smaller portions of more processed foods,' she told WSAU radio. School cafeteria staff are even required to limit access to barbecue sauce and mayonnaise packets, she says. Students are only allowed to take one sauce packet because use more could exceed the 850 calorie lunch limit imposed by the federal law. Miss Hellrood has launched a movement at her school to encourage all students at her school to bring a bag lunch on November 13 and refuse to pay for school lunch. She has also organized an effort to make sandwiches for the students who receive free or reduced lunches. Scroll down for video . According to one classmate at D.C. Everest, this was labeled a 'breadstick' on the school lunch menu . Restricted: A sign in the cafeteria announced that only one packet of mayonnaise and other sauces were allowed per sandwhich . Miss Hellrood hopes that the one day boycott will cost the school $3,000 and send a message about the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act . She estimates that if all 1,500 students at her school participate, it will cost the school district $3,000. 'Help us send a message to Washington. By packing your own lunch, you will help show our school district that we are unhappy with the so called Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act,' she says on a Facebook page she started to spread awareness of the campaign. The social media campaign has 344 likes, as of Monday afternoon. Miss Hellrood is only the latest high schooler to protest the lunch requirements. They've been the subject of parody videos and social media campaigns since the new lunch rules went into effect in 2012. 'I’m 4-foot-11 and weigh 90 pounds and I want more food. I can’t image the senior guys on the football team,' Miss Hellrood told WSAU. Unappetizing: This student from D.C. Everest posted this picture of what appears to be a fish sandwhich . One student resorted to bringing her own ranch dressing to spice up the school-issue pizza slice . First Lady Michelle Obama championed the school lunch requirements that lowered calories to just 850 and put other restrictions in place . Many students, she says, end up bringing food to school to supplement what they're getting in the lunch room. The 2010 Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act was meant to reform school lunches to offer students more variety and healthier meals. The idea was to remove high-fat, high-sugar foods from cafeterias to combat childhood obesity. However, the law also cut calories. Previously, school lunches had to provide a minimum of 825 calories. The new restrictions set calories at 750 minimum to 850 maximum.","Meghan Hellrood, a student at D.C.

"It is the programme that has seen presenters go toe to toe with political heavyweights over the big issues of the day. But a Newsnight interview between Jennifer Saunders, 56, and Lena Dunham, 28, was a touch less intellectual. The pair – a comic giant of the 1980s and 90s, and a current rising star of TV – spent their time discussing drug-taking, acting and the awkwardness of filming sex scenes. Low-brow: Miss Saunders discussed drug-taking on the BBC's current affairs programme . They did touch upon the issue of sexism in the TV industry, but devoted more time to their generations’ differing attitudes to casual sex and drugs. The interview, in which Miss Saunders admitted she had ‘smoked a couple of spliffs’ and taken ‘two or three lines of coke’, was part of a new series for Newsnight called Encounters, which features conversations between cultural figures. But it will lead to further accusations that the BBC’s current affairs programme is dumbing down. It has been dogged by such accusations since being taken over last year by former Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz. Under his regime, the number of celebrity interviews has increased, with the programme receiving criticism for twice giving extended slots to controversial comedian Russell Brand. In the interview on Thursday, Absolutely Fabulous star Miss Saunders also revealed she faced sexual harassment when she started at the BBC. Asked by Miss Dunham, creator of the American TV show Girls, whether she had experienced sexism early in her career, Miss Saunders recounted a story of a meeting at the BBC when she and her comedy partner Dawn French were pitching a show. She said: ‘There is a story that Jimmy Moir, who was the head of light entertainment, which was what it was called then at the BBC, did sit me and Dawn down and say, “Right girls, I’m going to put my d*** on the table, you’ve got a series”. That was what he said, but he was just a big jolly man.’ The interview was part of a new series for Newsnight called Encounters, which features conversations between cultural figures . Miss Dunham simply responded: ‘I don’t even get mad when old guys say that, I think it’s cute. I don’t like insidious sexism but if someone is just right out there with it…’ The conversation also touched on the subject of drug-taking. Miss Saunders admitted: ‘I’ve smoked a couple of spliffs, I’ve probably had two or three lines of coke in my life but I’ve never really [taken a lot of drugs]’. This prompted Miss Dunham to reveal: ‘I have had two lines of cocaine, one of which I sneezed out, like all the comic greats, and then a little bit of marijuana but I can’t drink, I vomit almost immediately.’","Jennifer Saunders, 56, discussed drug taking on a Newsnight interview .

"The BBC was once known across the world for the precise elocution of its presenters. But the corporation is now facing complaints that its staff are making basic errors in the use of English. A number of viewers have pointed out that television personalities are increasingly pronouncing the letter ‘H’ as ‘haitch’ instead of ‘aitch’. Viewers pointed to Sara Cox as one of a number of  BBC presenters who fail to pronounce 'H' in a correct way . Appearing on Points of View, a programme which airs public concerns over BBC content, one branded the falling standards ‘horrible, horrendous and harmful’ while another urged the corporation to ‘educate your presenters’. Points of View highlighted several instances of the BBC broadcasting mispronunciations of ‘H’, including an advert for the Children in Need Great British Sewing Bee, in which guest presenter Sara Cox makes the error, and another television appearance by Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw who makes the same mistake. Speaking yesterday, campaigners said such mistakes marked the beginning of a ‘slippery slope’ and called on the BBC to only hire presenters who use the English language correctly. Points of View presenter Jeremy Vine said the programme had collected a ‘whole folder’ of complaints about the issue and two viewers appeared on the show to express their concerns. June Binyon said: ‘Would the BBC please instruct their presenters and commentators on the correct pronunciation of the letter “H”. For example, when announcing a programme is to be in HD, they will say haitchD. This is not correct. Please BBC, educate your presenters.’ Radio 1 breakfast host Nick Grimshaw has also come under fire by BBC viewers over his English elocution . While Sharon Shepperd added: ‘I just cannot believe my ears that you, the guardian of the Queen’s English, is showing a television trailer where someone mispronounces the letter “H” as haitch. 'Surely, this should never have been allowed to air, it’s horrible, it’s horrendous and it’s harmful to the English language. Is this the thin end of the wedge?’ According to campaigners, such a decline in standards in the BBC’s use of English could have negative impacts across the world. Gareth Hardwick, who recently stepped down as secretary of the Queen’s English Society, said: ‘With the BBC in particular, it is listened to by a worldwide audience and people for whom English is a second language look to the BBC for an example of what is good English. ‘There are a whole number of reasons why the BBC might choose to recruit someone onto its staff as a broadcaster and maybe the use of English should be one and BBC broadcasters should be people to aspire to good, correct English usage’. Dr Bernard Lamb, the group’s president, added: ‘It is a problem because presenters can be quite influential, so a mistake that broadcasters start taking up is easily spread to the rest of the population. ‘I take the view that you have to be very careful about slippery slopes and if you let one or two things through it will encourage people to let even more things through and become slacker and slacker.’ A spokesman for the BBC said: 'The BBC has won awards for its use of language and we are proud of the range of voices heard across our programmes.'","One complains of 'horrible, horrendous and harmful' drop in quality control .

"Based 4,300 miles away in Memphis, Tennessee, the pilgrimage to Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion has previously been confined to only the most devoted fans. But with 300 of The King’s most personal items being shipped to London for a nine-month public exhibition, soon anyone with a love of The King will be able to have the full ‘Graceland experience’. The Elvis at the O2 exhibition will include some of the singer’s trademark pieces, such as the leather outfit from his 1968 television special, the American Eagle jumpsuit Presley wore in the Aloha to Hawaii concert, the Red MG Roadster from his film Blue Hawaii and his custom-made ‘Taking care of business’ ring. Scroll down for video . Fans of Elvis Presley will get the chance to see some of his personal items when an exhibition comes to London next month. He is pictured wearing his Aloha jumpsuit, which is among the 300-piece collection . But it will also give a rare insight into Presley’s personal life, putting on display items such as the first Christmas present he was bought by Priscilla, 69, his wallet containing a picture of his two year old daughter Lisa Marie and a gold phone from his home. Presley was found dead in the bathroom of Graceland on August 16, 1977, aged 42 shortly before he was scheduled to begin another tour. Angie Marchese, Graceland’s Director of Archives, said: ‘Elvis didn’t have anything out in Graceland that didn’t mean something to him because, obviously, he has thousands of pieces and gifts from fans, so everything Elvis chose to put out was special to him. ‘I have close to a million documents, 5,000 pieces of wardrobe in the collection, it’s massive. How I chose the exhibition was I asked myself: “What are the key pieces that tell this story” and I kept in mind that the majority of the people who come and see this exhibition will probably never have a chance to come and visit Graceland. ‘I wanted them to feel like they were part of this magical legacy that Elvis has left behind. So it was really important to have his school report card, or the jump suit his wore for the Aloha Hawaii concert or the little pieces from Graceland.’ The exhibition, which will open next month, will include sections exploring Mr Presley’s childhood, his rise to fame in the 1950s, his time in the army, as a Hollywood star, his return to music with the 1968 television special and his later life in Las Vegas, as well as more personal aspects of his character. Elvis with a 1956 Lincoln car, which is one of the cars which will be on show at the O2 for the next nine-months . Fans will get the chance to see iconic item's like the King's black leather suit from his 1968 TV special (above) While Graceland does not want to put a price on any individual item, describing them all as ‘priceless’, one piece that can have its financial worth estimated is the singer’s ‘Taking Care of Business’ ring. Presley had it custom made in 1974 by Lowell Hays Jewellers in Memphis, for a cost of around $35,000, it is gold and onyx and contains 16 carats of diamonds with a solitaire of 11 and a half carats ion the middle. Miss Marchese said: ‘Elvis came up with the TCB logo in 1969, it stands for taking care of business in a flash. ‘The first thing he had his jeweller make with that motif was necklaces, which he would give to close friends and entourage members. ‘It was his motto, his way of thinking. We’re taking care of business, we’re going to get this done, whether it’s in personal life or professional, it was how he thought about things. Many fans have made the 4,300 mile pilgrimage to his Graceland mansion in Memphis (above is his Aloha cape) Presley was found dead in his bathroom in 1977 at the age of 42. Pictured is his Taking Care of Business ring . ‘He eventually had the ring made in 1974 and he wore it all the way through to 1977 [when he died].’ There will also be a selection of Presley’s cars available for fans to admire at the exhibition. There will be the red 1960 MG Roadster from the film Blue Hawaii, the only car that actually belonged to Presleythat he used in his films. Also included will by the 1956 Lincoln Continental he bought in Miami while on tour to replace the car he had been driving which was covered in messages during the night by fans after they found out where he was staying. One of only 3,000 of the models ever to be made, the Lincoln cost $10,000, more than the price of a Rolls Royce at the time. Another key piece will be the 1955 Pink Fleetwood Cadillac which he used for touring before giving it to his mother, it was originally blue but he had it custom painted pink. Miss Marchese describes the Cadillac as ‘the most important car that we have in our collection’. Elvis and the Red MG from his movie Blue Hawaii which features among the connection being flown to the UK . The King's gold phone is among the enormous collection showing a rare insight into his personal life . She added: ‘Elvis drove around a lot. He was the kind of guy who didn’t like to be chauffeured around, he would rather drive himself or even chauffer his friends around town. But he loved cars, they were really a status symbol for him. When he was able to buy cars it was a sign to him he had made it. They then became a thing that he would give away, if you were part of Elvis’s close group of people it would not be unusual for you to receive a car as a gift to say thank you or show how important you were to him’. And, with Presley being known for his flamboyant clothes on stage, some of his most famous performance outfits are being shipped over for the exhibition. They include the American Eagle outfit and accompanying cape, covered in semi-precious stones and gold-plated studs, he wore for a televised concert knowing he was going to be watched by millions of people aroudn the world. Miss Marchese explains: ‘Because it was going to be seen worldwide, what he really wanted to do was wear something that represented America, so he went with the red, white and blue motif and the American eagle, which is the national bird. It will give a rare insight with items on display such as the first Christmas present he was bought by Priscilla . Over 300 items will include cars, personal items, historical documents, iconic stage costumes, guitars, gold and platinum records, and photography, in addition to audio and video presentations . It will will include sections exploring Mr Presley’s childhood, his rise to fame in the 1950s, his time in the army, as a Hollywood star, his return to music with the 1968 television special and his later life in Las Vegas . ‘He felt it would make a significant statement given the show was being seen in over 40 nations. When it aired in January 1973 it was watched by more people than when man walked on the moon, it was seen by 1.5billion people.’ Also included is Preseley’s black leather outfit from his 1968 television special, marking his return to the stage after years in Hollywood, will also make a limited appearance at the O2. Miss Marchese explained: ‘That show really gave Elvis the confidence to leave his movie career behind and return to his first love which was stage performance. Before that, he had been so involved in Hollywood he hadn’t been in front of a live audience in almost eight years. The suit is iconic, it really represents that turning point in his career.’ Tickets are available from Friday.

"Face, shoulders, hands, anything that might be glimpsed on stage turned a deep shade of green – it looks like a laborious process. But Kerry Ellis, 35, who shot to fame playing the role of Elphaba in Wicked, says the transformation takes as little as 20 minutes to complete. The actress, who recently returned to the show for a limited run, said: 'Everybody's been doing it for so long that it's quite quick now, they're like a machine. Kerry Ellis shot to fame playing Elphaba in Wicked, in each show she is transformed from her blonde ivory-skinned self to the brunette green Wicked Witch of the West . 'It is funny because some days because I'm so busy nowadays that I can be working on my computer when they are doing my make-up, so one minute I'm me and by the time I look up next I'm green, completely different, which is quite funny. I like that it's a complete transformation and completely different. 'We're quite lucky because I go a nice colour green, I'm not like the actual Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz, I haven't go the nose and the ears, it's quite complimentary make-up. Just a little bit different from what I wear on a night out though.' Kerry says it can take as little as 20 minutes to make her transformation . Having been performed more than 3,000 times in the West End alone and grossed £2.1billion internationally, Kerry said Wicked is the only role she would ever have considered returning to . The make up artists use large paint brushes on Kerry in order to cover her completely . Miss Ellis certainly knows how to keep the plates spinning: not only is she a new mum with a new baby, she has been performing in the West End and touring at the same time . Miss Ellis is now busy promoting her self-titled album, Kerry Ellis, released last month, and completing a nationwide tour that wraps up at the Cadogan Hall in London this weekend, the mother-of-one said it has been 'amazing' returning to a show that has been seen by 42 million worldwide. Having been performed more than 3,000 times in the West End alone and grossed £2.1billion internationally, Miss Ellis said Wicked is the only role she would ever have considered returning to. She stepped into the part for a twelve-week run, which also comes to an end this weekend, after the actress playing the role suffered an injury. Kerry is now busy promoting her self-titled album, Kerry Ellis, released last month . Despite having to juggle so much, Miss Ellis, 35, is happy her lifestyle provides her with the flexibility to be a hands-on mother to son Alfie who is yet to turn one. She said: 'Alfie's more travelled and got more stamps in his passport than I did at his age. But, I am so grateful that I work in a business where he can be with me,' Kerry says. 'I get to have the best of both worlds – I get to continue doing my job, which I love, and I get to spend time with my son. 'The only difficult thing is taking him away from my husband, James, who misses him dreadfully. We make up for that when we come home. We find ways to make it work. We're very lucky that we have a great support system thanks to both of our families and that's working fine – touch wood – we just work on a little less sleep.' Much of their lives are pre-planned – Kerry's diary is booked up months in advance, sometimes a year, and husband James Townsend is a football coach for Luton Town and so his life follows the football season. However, there are still times when they have to be places at the last minute. 'I don't know where we would be without both of our parents,' Kerry says. 'We can pick up the phone and say, can you pop over for a couple of hours or can you take Alfie for the weekend? They have been phenomenal because even though I can take Alfie with me and look after him during the day, he can't come with me on stage – not yet at least.'","Kerry Ellis plays Elphaba in the stage show Wicked .

"As head of Strictly Come Dancing’s panel, Len Goodman is a rigorous judge of posture and technique. But the ballroom dancer admitted he has not always been so focused, smoking cannabis as a teenager in the 1960s.

Tommy still likes a spliff but good luck to him.’ The dance expert said he has often never heard of the celebrities who appear on the programmes. ‘It is not a problem as you get to know them as the shows go along,’ he said. ‘You know that I live in England so we don’t get General Hospital or whatever your shows are called. 'It’s the same in Britain … I look at the list and I think, “Who the hell he is he?” But what I love is that they always get an interesting cast.’ Mr Goodman also spoke about his childhood, telling Mr Kimmel: ‘My sayings come from my granddad … The roughest part of London is the East End, Bethnal Green.

"Stephen Fry has claimed he took cocaine at Buckingham Palace. Opening up about a 15-year addiction to the Class A drug, the comedian details dozens of respected institutions where he says he took it. The list includes the House of Lords, the House of Commons and BBC Television Centre – but Fry, 57, fails to elaborate further. At the Palace: Stephen Fry pictured with Her Majesty The Queen at Buckingham Palace earlier this year . Meeting royalty: The comedian met The Queen at a reception for dramatic arts at the palace in February . The claims come in a new autobiograhy, More Fool Me, published yesterday. Fry writes: ‘I take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly, to the owners, managers or representatives of the noble and ignoble premises and to the hundreds of private homes, offices, car dashboards, tables, mantelpieces and available polished surfaces that could so easily have been added to this list of shame. ‘You may wish to have me struck off, banned, black balled or in any other way punished for past crimes; surely now is the time to reach for the phone, the police or the club secretary.’ Following on from 2010’s The Fry Chronicles, which touched on his drug use in its closing pages, his new book sees the presenter speak in detail about the habit that cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds. It also reveals his brushes with the law and how he narrowly escaped drug charges after being stopped by police while in possession of cocaine. This third instalment of his autobiography follows Fry through the 1980s and 90s after he had found fame through shows such as A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster. He recalls the ‘momentous night’ in 1986 when he first took cocaine with an unnamed actor friend and admits that he never saw himself as an addict as his dependency spiralled out of control. Fry doesn’t detail the year he believed he became addicted or when he kicked the habit. On the list: In his autobiography, More Fool Me, the 57-year-old admits he took cocaine at Buckingam Palace . He writes: ‘How can I explain the extraordinary waste of time and money that went into my 15-year habit? 'Tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds, and as many hours, sniffing, snorting and tooting away time that could have been employed writing, performing, thinking, exercising, living.’ The actor, who suffers from bipolar disorder, also explained his simple motivations behind taking cocaine: ‘I didn’t take coke because I was depressed or under pressure. 'I didn’t take it because I was unhappy (at least I don’t think so). I took it because I really, really liked it.’ While he assures readers that he was always too ‘squeamish’ to try harder drugs such as heroin or crystal meth, his cocaine consumption could be insatiable. His need for drugs was so great that he built up a network of dealers to ensure he would always have a steady supply. He explained how he built up this web across London after his first £240 drug buy. He talks about ‘Mitch’ introducing him to ‘Nando’ who passed him on to ‘Midge’ and then ‘Nonny’ – who had ‘A-Charlie’ for actors, comics, musicians and supermodels. Revelations: The comedian apologised for his actions and said his habit was an 'extraordinary waste of time' High profile: The star also said he took the Class A drug at the BBC Television Centre and at The Ritz hotel . Habit: The 57-year-old said his need for drugs was so great that he built up a network of dealers in London . He recalls how he was stopped by police for driving his motorbike while drunk, with three grams of cocaine in his possession. Scared that he would be charged with intent to supply, he tried to surreptitiously leave the cocaine, which was stored in a small holder, in the police van as it drove him to London’s West End Central Station on Savile Row. He was charged with drunk driving but allowed to go until his court date. However, as he was leaving, a police officer came running after him with the unopened holder, unknowingly returning the drugs to Fry which he went on to take that same night. Fry also recounts how he gave Tony Blair advice on how to dress when he was invited to a dinner at Chequers soon after Labour took power in 1997. The dress code was stated as ‘informal’ – but Fry was surprised to find the prime minister in a denim shirt and chinos. He explained to the PM that ‘in the strange British world of etiquette’, informal meant ‘not black tie’ and that many guests would wear dark lounge suits. ‘There was much confabulation before the PM hared upstairs to change,’ Fry writes.","Comedian said he took cocaine at Buckingham Palace and other institutions .

"Radio 1 breached standards by allowing singers Lily Allen and Ed Sheeran to swear during a pre-watershed broadcast, watchdog Ofcom ruled yesterday. The BBC is now set to put up signs in dressing rooms warning stars performing live that they will be pulled off air if they use foul language. The clampdown comes after Miss Allen said ‘f***’ six times in her set at the Big Weekend Festival in May, broadcast on Radio 1 from 5.30pm to 6.15pm. BBC said it had considered cutting away from Allen's set twice during her performance, but a senior producer decided to continue because apologies had been given and it was believed that few children would be listening . It emerged the corporation knew Miss Allen planned to sing songs with explicit lyrics but assumed she would ‘self-edit’ out offensive language. The BBC said it twice considered cutting away from her but that a producer thought few children would be listening and that there had been adequate warnings. Bosses admitted this was a mistake, telling Ofcom it should have stopped broadcasting after Miss Allen’s second song and aired the rest after editing out any swearing. According to BBC figures, 654,000 listeners tuned in for the set – well before the 7pm radio watershed – including around 25,600 aged between 10 and 14. Before Miss Allen took to the stage, presenter Scott Mills warned listeners her songs could contain foul language. He apologised each time she swore and after the performance. Ed Sheeran also said ‘f******’ on stage. Ed Sheeran said 'f*****g' just before 7pm in the Glasgow show but the BBC said swear words were 'relatively rare' and were always followed by an immediate apology, while Ofcom said Allen was known to use strong language and 'it was reasonably predictable that her set could contain the most offensive language', it ruled . The BBC has been deluged with complaints over a ‘hatchet job’ Panorama episode about Ukip. The programme, which was broadcast last week, contained a raft of allegations about the party and its leader Nigel Farage, who was described as ‘back-stabbing’. In the following days, the BBC received some 800 complaints accusing it of bias, according to its programme Points of View. Viewers described the report, entitled The Farage Factor and fronted by Darragh MacIntyre, as ‘mud- slinging’, and ‘a hatchet job’, with one commenting: ‘It’s no surprise Nigel Farage refused to be interviewed. Surely every story has two sides?’ Ukip pointed out that many of the report’s allegations, such as questions over party funds, had first appeared several years ago. In a voice-over, Mr MacIntyre said Ukip ‘preaches accountability so why are they so careful about what questions they answer?’ He added: ‘Nigel Farage says he’s a straight talker so why have so many colleagues quit in disgust?’ Interviewee Dr Richard North, Ukip’s director of research from 1999 to 2003, said: ‘He’s socially very skilled ... but behind your back he’ll be stabbing you. Brutus has got nothing on Farage.’ Panorama editor Ceri Thomas said staff had ‘tried our very best to make this a balanced, fair, impartial programme’ even though Mr Farage refused to participate. The BBC insisted artists were reminded not to swear and that many changed songs accordingly. It claimed it sought to give ‘adequate warnings’ about expletives. But Ofcom said it was ‘concerned [the BBC] did not take more measures … to ensure compliance [with broadcasting guidelines] … when children were particularly likely to be listening’. The BBC Trust said the incident was a ‘serious breach’ of editorial guidelines. It added that Radio 1 will likely add signs to stars’ dressing rooms saying ‘strong language will result in your performance being dropped from Radio 1’s live coverage’.","Singer Lily Allen said 'f**k' six times between 5.30pm and 6pm in show in May .

"During his 25 years on Newsnight, Jeremy Paxman earned acclaim for humiliating politicians with his scathing interview style. But far from hailing the presenter as one of the great TV journalists, the programme’s new boss claims Paxman’s aggressive interrogations ‘didn’t produce any real enlightenment’. Ian Katz, 46, who took over as editor of the current affairs programme last September, also branded him ‘petulant’ and difficult to work with. Scroll down for video . Ian Katz (right) said his show ideas were attacked by the star (left) as being 'infantile' and 'preposterous' And he revealed that Paxman, 64, initially refused to take part in a much-discussed interview with Russell Brand, broadcast on the BBC2 show last October. The segment saw Paxman call the comedian ‘trivial’ and ‘facetious’ for claiming voting was pointless. Mr Katz, former deputy editor of The Guardian, said such scepticism towards his ideas was common from Paxman. ‘I’d love to know if he was less petulant in meetings before I got there,’ he said. ‘I think that’s just his modus operandi. ‘He’s dyspeptic about pretty much everything. Ideas are flattened. 'Almost everything you suggest Jeremy will think is “preposterous” or “infantile” or an otherwise “completely lamentable” idea, and that’s a challenge because you have to sell it to him.’ Fearsome: Jeremy Paxman, above, left producers feeling 'terrified', claims Newsnight boss Ian Katz . As a result, he says, the programme’s producers were ‘pretty terrified’ of Paxman. But Mr Katz, who was speaking to the Evening Standard, admitted he was ‘utterly charming and quite generous to very junior people’, and ‘courtly’ to women. In The Financial Times last week, Mr Katz said the ‘predominance of an aggressive [interview] style’ has made modern political discourse ‘dull’ and predictable. Asked if, by saying this, he was ‘sticking the knife in’ to his former colleague, he told the Standard: ‘I tried hard not to. I said I thought Paxman was one of the few things that made political interviews watchable for a long time because he was so thrilling even if it didn’t produce any real enlightenment.’ Critics have expressed concern over the direction of Newsnight since Mr Katz took over, accusing it of becoming lightweight. Paxman’s representative did not respond to requests for comment.

"When Ellie Goulding posed for a picture in her Halloween costume, she probably expected fans to admire her ‘beautiful’ Native American outfit. What she might not have expected was to find herself at the centre of a race row. But within minutes of sharing the snap on the internet, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding singer had been branded ‘racist’, ‘ignorant’, ‘insensitive’ and ‘deeply offensive’, and was told that wearing a Native American costume was ‘no different than wearing black face’. Ellie Goulding found herself at the centre of a race row minutes after sharing this snap of herself dressed in a Native American outfit . Miss Goulding, 27, was following the example of dozens of stars – including singer Sinitta, Coleen Rooney, Cher, Harry Styles and Pharrell Williams – who have been pictured wearing Native American headdresses in recent months. The British star shared pictures of the skimpy outfit with her 3.6million Instagram followers and a similar number on Twitter. But she was met with hundreds of messages of disgust, with one fan accusing her of ‘promoting racism and cultural appropriation’ and another telling her ‘cultures are not costumes’. One critic wrote: ‘Next time don’t mock a dying race you insensitive and ignorant excuse of a person.’ Another added: ‘Oh Ellie I’m so disappointed. No different than wearing black face.’ Miss Goulding, 27, was following the example of dozens of stars, including singer Sinitta (pictured), who have been pictured wearing Native American headdresses in recent months . However, Conservative MP Philip Davies last night called on the singer to ‘stick to her guns’, saying: ‘As far as I’m concerned, all of these people who are complaining are idiots. 'I never cease to be amazed at how easily people will take offence – and usually this is white, middle-class, Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, politically correct do-gooders who are offended on someone else’s behalf. 'The people concerned are never usually offended themselves.’ Miss Goulding also received support from Crystal Speer, who works for the Native American Heritage Association in the United States. While the organisation does not have an official opinion on the matter, Mrs Speer said in a personal capacity: ‘I do think [the reaction] is a bit much. People these days will jump at anything to get offended at. Ellie Goulding (pictured) shared photos of the skimpy outfit with her 3.6million Instagram followers and a similar number on Twitter . 'I can see both sides but unless you’re Native American yourself I don’t think it’s right for you to say whether it’s offensive or not.’ The row comes just weeks after it was announced that Glastonbury will no longer allow Native American headdresses to be sold at festival outlets, in response to a petition. Miss Goulding declined to comment on the furore yesterday but responded to some of her critics on Twitter, posting: ‘I wore that beautiful unauthentic headpiece for about five minutes.’ She also pledged to donate to the Running Strong campaign, which gives grants to organisations supporting Native American young people.","Ellie Goulding posed for a picture in a Native American outfit for Halloween .

"A clever consumer has turned the tables on one of the supermarket giants with a cheeky post to one of their social media pages. Facebook user Monica Glasgow wrote a tongue-in-cheek message to the Woolworths Australia page claiming she had been misled by one of their products. She purchased a White Toast loaf by Woolworths' homebrand earlier this week, and expressed her dismay after discovering the bread was actually not toasted, according to Buzzfeed. Facebook user Monica Glasgow wrote a hilarious post claiming she had been misled by one of their products . 'Hi Woolies. I picked up loaf of toast this afternoon and was really disappointed to come home and find that it was actually just a loaf of bread which I would have to toast myself,' Ms Glasgow wrote. 'Given the recent lawsuit against Coles regarding the freshness of their bread, I am starting to lose faith in baked goods at our major supermarkets,' she joked. However Woolworths didn't seem to get they were being trolled, posting a rather serious response to a message that was clearly taking the mickey. Woolworths appeared to miss the joke, sending back a reasonable and professional response . Facebook users hijacked the post with one user agreeing the packaging was misleading . 'Hi Monica, We can assure you our toast is made fresh and never frozen,' Woolworths wrote. 'It is true Toast is just the size of the slices of bread. We hope this helps! Thanks'. It is uncertain whether the supermarket giant were simply responding to the inquiry in the most professional way they could, or if they simply missed the humor in the post but other people were quick to pick up on the joke. Others made jokes at the expense of the supermarket giant . One man suggested that there was a need for a new product on supermarket shelves, an untoaster . One user wrote: 'I don't know Woolworths, the bag clearly states 'white toast' not 'white bread cut to toast size'...' 'Brings me back to the classic riddle. What do you put in a toaster?' another quipped. However one particularly funny person seemed to have the solution to end the conversation. 'Just whack it in the untoaster to get bread', he wrote. However it seems Woolworths have since learnt to have a little fun with customers since then, posting a funny response to a customer who just wasn't sure what she wanted to ask. Woolworths mat have learnt their lesson since, having a little more fun with some of their customers on social media .","Monica Glasgow wrote a cheeky message to the supermarket giant .

"Treasurer Joe Hockey has pointed the finger at his Abbott government colleagues over speculation that he's going to be dumped as treasurer in favour of Malcolm Turnbull. Mr Hockey said he faced a tougher job than any other treasurer in the past 15 years and said his ministerial colleagues were also responsible for spruiking the budget to the public. It comes amid reports of growing support within senior ranks for Mr Turnbull to take the treasurer position if government support is the same come next year, according to the Daily Telegraph. Treasurer Joe Hockey said his ministerial colleagues were also responsible for spruiking the budget to the public amid speculation the treasurer position could be handed to Malcolm Turnbull . 'Everyone wants Joe to ­succeed. But to say there is not a problem is barking mad. The backbench wants Malcolm,' a colleague said. Mr Hockey was asked about reports that his colleagues had lost faith in him on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Friday morning. 'Look, this is part and parcel of being treasurer. When you have conversations with your colleagues about asking them to live within their means, in their portfolios, some of them don't like it but we have got to do what is right for the Australian people,' he said. Reports say there's growing support within senior ranks for Mr Turnbull (middle) to take the treasurer position from MR Hockey (left) if government support is the same come next year . Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to Mr Hockey's defence on Thursday, saying he was one of Australia's greatest treasurers . 'I know it's hard for people. I know it's hard for the community. I know it's hard for colleagues but we have to do what is right.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to Mr Hockey's defence on Thursday, saying he was one of Australia's greatest treasurers. 'Joe Hockey has been criticised lately, but I tell you what, I think Joe is going to be one of the great treasurers because he's someone who bounces back and that's what he's doing now,' Mr Abbott told the ABC's 7.30. A ministerial colleague reportedly said the Abbott backbench wanted Mr Turnbull in as treasurer . Sources within the Abbott government told the Telegraph it was likely the idea of a Cabinet reshuffle had been flagged with the prime minister, but said there was 'no push to get rid of Joe'. 'No one is out to get Joe. There is no push. If he has a great summer he will come back a hero,' one source said. 'No one expects Tony will move him. But what we are doing is not working.' Mr Hockey has faced several blunders this year, including when he was filmed smoking cigars on the night before the budget was released and comparing the $7 GP co-payment to the cost of beer and cigarettes.","Joe Hockey said speculation over his colleagues losing faith in him as treasurer was 'part and parcel' of the job .

"For nearly a decade in the 1980s, the nation learned of the day’s events from her clipped tones and clear elocution. But former newsreader Jan Leeming admits the diction of actors and presenters has become so poor, she has to rely on subtitles to understand modern television. And writing in today’s Daily Mail Weekend magazine, she called on broadcasters to enrol their young stars on courses to improve their spoken English. Former BBC newsreader Jan Leeming, pictured, said the quality of diction on TV has declined dramatically . Miss Leeming, 72, who spent seven years as a newsreader for the BBC, writes: ‘There’s been a noticeable rise in poor diction on TV over the last decade and it’s getting worse. It’s particularly evident among younger actors and presenters who, infuriatingly, so often swallow or don’t end their words. ‘The solution, I believe, is for TV networks to enrol today’s young presenters on courses to help them speak with greater clarity. I’m not calling for them to be made to recite phrases like “How now, brown cow”, as in the past – but simply to be taught clear enunciation and voice projection. ‘After all, they’re in the communication business so, to put it bluntly, don’t they have a duty to make themselves understood by viewers?’ Miss Leeming, whose father enrolled her in speech and drama classes as a child to neutralise her south-east London accent, denies her age has anything to do with her difficulty hearing. She said: ‘I can hear the kitchen cat flap go from my sitting room. But all too often I find myself switching on the subtitles in order to understand the English.’ Miss Leeming praised Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, pictured, for his ability to read the news . The former presenter, who has been married five times, refused to name newsreaders she believes fail to speak as clearly as they should – although she did single out Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow for praise – but is concerned there are some who ‘put the emphasis on the wrong words when reading a bulletin.’ This is not the first time the pronunciation of modern television stars has come in for criticism. Earlier this year, actors in BBC dramas Jamaica Inn and Quirke were accused of mumbling their lines and that their thick accents were impenetrable. With the former programme attracting nearly 2,200 complaints from disgruntled viewers. And in an interview last year, BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: ‘I don’t want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I also think muttering is something we could have a look at. ‘Actors muttering can be testing. You find you have missed a line. You have to remember you have an audience.’ Miss Leeming, who presented the 1982 Eurovision Song Contest, also singled out television actors for particular criticism. She recounted how she recently watched a comedy where half the parts were played by theatre actors and the other half by soap stars. She said: ‘We understood the theatre actors perfectly but not the soap actresses, as they neither projected or enunciated.’","Jan Leeming claimed she watches TV with subtitles to see what's being said .

"An aquarium has been urged to stop throwing after-hours parties by an animal welfare group who believe they could cause distress to the marine life with fish even 'attacking each other out of frustration'. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have written to aquarium executives at the SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium in the city's Darling Harbour, claiming that 'aquariums that market themselves as party venues create even more of a nightmare for the animals at these facilities'. However, the aquarium's curator, Gerhard Beukes, insisted that animal welfare was paramount at all exhibitions and the staff prided themselves on providing the highest possible standard of care for the aquatic life. Scroll down for video . An aquarium has been urged to stop throwing after-hours parties by animal welfare group PETA . PETA says the parties could cause distress to the marine life with fish even 'attacking each other out of frustration' 'All functions are developed in coordination with our curatorial staff to ensure they do not exceed the aquarium's normal day-to-day noise levels and are aimed to provide an intimate evening at the aquarium while maintaining an appropriate end time to benefit the animals,' Mr Beukes said. 'Our curatorial staff are onsite to monitor the animals at all times during any function or event; this includes the use of decibel meters to monitor sound as well as restrictions on the use of additional lighting, decorations and equipment.' Sydney Aquarium has thrown a string of limited-edition 18+ events run by non-profit arts company The Festivalists, called Hijinks, in recent months where DJs and artists entertain guests to help raise awareness around crucial marine conservation issues . Pop-up bars are also set up inside the aquarium and the Hijink's website promises party goers can 'grab a drink at the pop up bars serving Little Creatures beers or SKYY Vodka cocktails, take selfies with Grey Nurse sharks, chat with conservationists or simply get a head start on the weekend'. The event also says attendees can 'reclaim the aquarium as their own over the course of a wild and eventful evening'. In the strongly-worded letter to FBi Radio and Sea Life Sydney Aquarium executives, PETA said: 'Events such as this, which take place outside normal opening hours, while animals would normally be resting, are likely to have a detrimental impact on aquarium residents, particularly if the visitors behave in a manner that causes the animals stress.' Aquarium curator, Gerhard Beukes, insisted that animal welfare was paramount at all exhibitions . Mr Beukes said staff prided themselves on providing the highest possible standard of care for the aquatic life . PETA reasoned: 'As you can imagine, loud parties and captive animals are a bad mix. 'Employees at aquariums have themselves said that the animals become extremely agitated during these events, even attacking one another out of frustration. 'Experts have stated that anthropogenic noise at high levels can affect animal behaviour, mask important natural sounds on which they depend, alter their physiological function and physically injure them.' In their plea PETA said marine animals in small tanks already experience 'enough stress'. 'Events with loud sounds held at aquariums are debilitating to these animals, who have no other choice in dealing with their frustration and discomfort but to swim around in endless circles. 'Aquariums should be responsible for the safety of the animals in their care. Allowing these late-night events to continue does not demonstrate adequate consideration for animal welfare,' they added. During the events so far the aquarium's dugongs, which have acute hearing and sensitivity to sound, have not been present as their part of the centre was being renovated. On Hijink's Facebook page this week they announced: 'If you missed Pig & Wuru, as their home was undergoing massive renovations. Good news: the dugongs are back for Hijinks Halloween on October 30th. Lettuce for everyone!'

"Cleveland house of horrors kidnap victim Michelle Knight revealed Sunday that she not only forgives her brutal captor Ariel Castro, but she also doesn't blame him for the perverse horrors he subjected her to for 11 years. 'At first I hated him,' Knight told the group at Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin High School. 'But I went through therapy and realized it hadn't been his fault. He had a disease.' The shocking revelation came as Knight, 33, addressed a live audience for the first time ever in Chardon, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Forgives her captor: Speaking to a live audience for the first time in Chardon, Ohio, Knight, 33 (seen here at the event), described how therapy led finally allowed her to say Ariel Castro's name aloud and how that moment finally let forgive a man so many labeled a monster . 'It wasn't his fault': Knight shocked some when she said that she blames Catro's sexual addiction and not him as a man for the decade of torture she endured . First live public appearance: Cheryl Clark of Middlefield hands a copy of Michelle Knight's book, Finding Me to the author to be signed during her visit to Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin's Education Learning Center . While Knight has changed her own name, preferring to go by Lily now, she's now able to refer to Castro where for so long he was single 'that dude.' 'I was able to say his name, Ariel Castro...I was able to forgive him,' she said, according to Cleveland.com. Knight said that Castro spoke to her of his 'sexual addiction' when he first abducted her. He told her at the time that he only intended to keep her for a little while. 'I knew he was lying, but what could I do,' she said. 'I am a sex addict,' Knight recalled Castro saying. 'I cannot control myself.' She now blames that addiction, and not the man himself, for her decade of disgusting abuse. She even offered the audience of 300 some advice: . Staying strong: Jennifer Ostrander of Euclid has her photo taken with Michelle Knight, who recently changed her name to Lily Rose Lee . Finding her faith: Knight told the crowd of 300 that her faith in God has helped her move on following her 11 years in captivity as well as to forgive Ariel Castro . Knight also discussed her hobbies, which include cooking, drawing, singing and reading. She said she loves to read all of Stephen King's novels . 'If you're getting abused...don't wait, get help.' Knight also discussed her hobbies, which include cooking, drawing, singing and reading. She said she loves to read all of Stephen King's novels. 'That might be a little weird right now,' she said after a moment of reflection. Knight was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002. Amanda Berry was abducted in April 2003 just a day shy of her 17th birthday, and Gina DeJesus was 14 when he kidnapped her a year later. The women escaped from Castro's home on May 6, 2013. Castro took a plea deal to avoid a potential death sentence and received life in prison plus 1,000 years. Knight said he violently aborted five of her pregnancies by kicking, punching and stomping on her abdomen after impregnating her. He ended up hanging himself in his prison cell a month after sentencing.

Berry and DeJesus have kept a lower profile than Knight in the time since their escape. The pair are, like Knight, slated to release a book detailing their saga. However, their public appearances have been far fewer than Knight's. The pair made an appearance in Washington in May, where they were given a special White House reception by President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

"Lynda Bellingham died from colon cancer, which kills nearly 700,000 people worldwide each year . Lynda Bellingham died from colon cancer - the fourth biggest cancer killer worldwide, causing on average 694,000 deaths each year. In countries such as the UK and U.S., more than 80 per cent of cases occur in people aged 60 or over, such as Lynda. The actress and TV presenter had been diagnosed with colon cancer a little over a year ago. The disease later spread to her lungs and liver. Despite knowing she may only have weeks to live, her death was quicker than many had expected. Lynda, 66, was expecting to live until January 2015, and had planned to spend one last Christmas with her family. Writing in The Mail on Sunday last month, she said: ‘I would love to make one more Christmas, if possible, but I want to stop taking chemo around November in order to pass away by the end of January.’ Her death came just days after she made an emotional return to TV show Loose Women  - where she used to be a panellist - for one final appearance. This morning, it was announced the much-loved actress and TV presenter died yesterday. Her husband Michael was by her side in a London hospital. Such a rapid decline is unusual, but not uncommon, oncologist Professor Karol Sikora told MailOnline. He said: 'It's how most cancer patients want to die - where the final episode is very short. 'It's not uncommon for people to be very well one day and die shortly afterwards. Scroll down for video . 'It is quite unusual for it to be as dramatic as just four days later, but it does happen.' He explained there are many reasons why cancer patients die. Ultimately, however, as the cancer grows, the burden becomes too much for the body. 'In the end, multi-system failure occurs - with vital organs such as the liver and kidneys slowing down and then packing up. 'No one knows exactly what causes it.' He added that different patients die at different stages of the disease. This may be the differences in biochemistry, or sometimes, a will to live. 'There are people who realise they aren't going to make it, just curl up and want to die. 'Then there are those who are the opposite - they want to make it to their daughter's wedding, make themselves live and die shortly afterwards.' Lynda's death came just days after the she made an emotional return to the TV show Loose Women for one final appearance, where she appeared lively and in good spirits . The spread of the cancer - known as metastasis - is very often what ends up killing patients. Metastasis is when cells from a tumour separate from it, find their way into the lymph system or the bloodstream, and spread throughout the body. Particular types of tumours often spread to particular organs. In bowel cancer patients, it tends to be the liver. This is because the main vein that drains the bowel goes to the liver, explains Professor Sikora, founder of Cancer Partners UK. This can disrupt the delicate balance of chemicals and salts in the body - with fatal consequences. When cancer spreads to the lungs, there is eventually insufficient healthy tissue to absorb oxygen. Cancer can block off part of the lung. This area may collapse and become infected, which can lead to death. 'However it is possible there was a medical emergency,' he adds. 'The bowel may have become obstructed - there could have been internal bleeding.' Cancer patients are also more likely to suffer from blood clots. If a clot gets into the lung, for example, it can trigger a pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal. Lynda, with sons Michael, Robert, her step-son Bradley and husband Michael, had wanted to spend one last Christmas with her family . Bowel cancer does also not respond as well to chemotherapy as some other cancers, such as breast, explained Professor Sikora. This is because it very quickly becomes resistant to it. Appearing on ITV's This Morning two weeks ago, Lynda discussed how she had planned to stop chemotherapy in November, due to the severe side effects she had suffered. She said: 'There's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon. Colon cancer is also referred to as bowel cancer or rectal cancer. In countries such as the UK and U.S., more than 80 per cent of cases occur in people aged 60 or over, such as Lynda. People who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk. Smoking, alcohol and a family history of the disease also increase the risk. The cancer can present itself in a number of ways, explains Dr Stuart Riley, a consultant gastroenterologist, and clinical director of the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in South Yorkshire. ‘The usual symptoms are rectal bleeding, a change in bowel habits - usually looser stools, though it could also cause constipation or needing to go to the toilet more frequently - abdominal discomfort and anaemia.’ He says if any bleeding is accompanied by a change in bowel habits, or if any other signs persist for several months, then a ‘full clinical assessment’ should be carried out. This includes a colonoscopy - where a tiny camera is inserted into the colon. It’s also important to establish if a patient has a family history of bowel cancer as this can increase the risk. 'When you're in terrible pain, you make decisions.' She told hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'I want my husband and children to see me off happy, contented. 'So I put the chemotherapy in a box. 'In this box, I could stop the chemotherapy after Christmas - I'm determined to hang on until Christmas. 'If my quality of life fades after that, I want to be able to open the box, make a choice and stop the chemotherapy.' She said before this, she'd had no control over the decision - but had struggled with the idea of refusing treatment offered. 'I don't want to look ungrateful,' she explained. 'The box [decision] is there to be used if I need it. 'If my quality of life remains as it is now [after Christmas], then why would I hasten my death? ' Yesterday, appearing on BBC Breakfast, she explained she had the option to resume treatment if her health improves. 'It's there on the table if I want it,' she said. Lynda also admitted today there were times when she lay awake wondering about the future. Speaking about her new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell you, she said: 'The book is for everyone - every single day people are going through this. 'As my oncologist says, the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist.' In the piece she wrote for The Mail on Sunday last month, she described the devastating moment she was diagnosed. 'The pleasant gentleman in front of me visibly crumpled. He stared at his computer then seemed to pull himself up and looked me straight in the eye. ‘""I am so terribly sorry, I thought you had already been informed of your position. You have cancer of the colon, and lesions on your lungs and your liver"".' 'I felt nothing except disbelief.' The actress said she had been ill the Christmas before and ended up in A&E. 'I had been having really bad indigestion and then diarrhoea quite badly, and I was short of breath. 'We finally saw a doctor who said that it was probably nothing and to take Omeprazole for a couple of weeks. I did, and everything seemed to clear up.' Months later, she was told there was a problem with a shadow on her liver - and see a colon specialist urgently. She wrote: 'The day finally came and those unforgettable words resounded round the surgeon’s office – ""Now about your cancer Miss Bellingham"", and, well, you know the rest by now.' The actress said recently: 'As my oncologist says, the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist'","Actress and TV presenter was diagnosed with colon cancer last July .

"She's a globally renowned style icon and recently designed her own footwear collection for Aquazzura so it's hardly surprising that Olivia Palermo is considering her own fashion range. The stylish star, who shot to fame on MTV's The City, has hinted at plans to make a foray into designing. In an interview with The Edit, Net-a-Porter's online magazine, the 28-year-old admitted that she has accounted for a label in her ten year plan. 'I would love to start my own [fashion] house but it’s not the right time. I feel like I can do it in stages and when the timing is right to do it, then I will,' she revealed. It's only a matter of time: Olivia Palermo was recently named one of the ten best-dressed women in the world and has revealed to The Edit that she wants to start a fashion line one day . And she's had plenty of practice; Palermo has already designed a footwear collection, modelled for some of fashion's biggest names and has been managing her own website since 2011. '[The website] came from my travels and my friends constantly asking me, ""Oh, I’m going to Berlin, I’m going to London, I’m going to Madrid... Can you recommend any great spots to visit?"" So [the site] evolved through my experiences of travel, places I like, people I like, and shows,' she said. 'I have three people that work on the editorial side on a daily basis, an entire team who handle the back-end, and myself. I have my hands full at the moment.'

Style advice: The style icon has opened up about how she gets ready in the morning, revealing that she loves to accessorise . The 28-year-old also shared the secrets behind her acclaimed polished style. 'My mother and grandmother are very pulled together,' she said. 'They never leave the house without being completely, 100 per cent presentable and that was instilled in me at a very young age.' Offering her advice on pulling an outfit together seamlessly, the socialite and model said: 'As you get dressed, take a look to see if anything needs to be done. 'I tend to go with the detailing. I have endless skinny belts. There is always a place for a big belt, but sometimes when you’re layering pieces you need to hide the belt and a skinny one does just that. 'Take a razor blade to a sweater if it’s bobbling - it takes the balls off. Double-sided tape is also one of my favorites. Oh, and if you want to roll your sleeves up and they won’t stay, push them up with very thin hair elastics.' Selective: The star recently collaborated with Aquazzura on a shoe collection and says she decided to work with the brand because their shoes are 'aesthetically phenomenal and fit like a glove' Taking notes? The former reality TV star was a fixture at Paris Fashion Week . Rising star: Olivia started out alongside Whitney Port on MTV's The City and is now a globally respected style icon . Olivia  tested the designer waters earlier this year when she was asked to collaborate with footwear brand Aquazzura on a capsule collection. Speaking about the experience, she said: 'I’ve known Edgardo [Osorio, the brand’s designer and founder] since his first collection and he’s become a great friend of mine. I only want to team up and design with people who I have a solid relationship with. 'There is a very small handful of shoe designers of whom you can say [the shoes] are aesthetically phenomenal and fit like a glove; Manolo [Blahnik] is one of them, and Edgardo. With this, we wanted to create the shoes every woman wants in her wardrobe. 'Edgardo and I both like a little toe cleavage, and [the heels] had to be high. The heel is actually the highest he’s ever done, so it was a bit of an experiment, but I think it came out very well, they’re still walkable. You don’t want to waddle in the street.'

"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has warned a New York City clinic of multiple problems uncovered at the facility, it emerged today. Excerpts of the agency's letter to Yorkville Endoscopy - the same clinic Joan Rivers went to for a throat procedure before she had to be hospitalized and died the following week - were published by The New York Post. It says 'Based on the findings of the September 5, 2014 survey, Yorkville Endoscopy LLC no longer meets the requirements for participation as a supplier of services in the Medicare program. 'Accordingly, CMS has determined that the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary [of the Department of Health] will be terminated on January 7, 2015.' Trouble? The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reportedly warned Yorkville Endoscopy of multiple problems uncovered at the facility . The Post reported the inspection letter - stemming from New York State DOH employees' discoveries on September 5 - says the clinic has management, surgical services, staffing, and patient rights problems. The newspaper reported those issues are not linked explicitly to Rivers' death in the letter. According to The Post, the letter informs Yorkville Endoscopy that if the issues at the clinic are corrected, its remunerations for the Medicare program won't be dropped. The newspaper explained that 'CMS by law must make the full inspection report and Yorkville’s response addressing the violations public within 30 days of their being filed. That would make the inspection report public within days.' Patient: Joan Rivers was at Yorkville Endoscopy in August for a throat procedure . Last month, CNN quoted excerpts of a report from the New York medical examiner, which said Rivers suffered 'therapeutic complications' from the surgery. Per the news channel, the report states 'The classification of a death as a therapeutic complication means that the death resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy.' It also reveals that Rivers' brain lacked oxygen and she died due to 'anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest,' CNN reported. The report said it occurred 'during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease,' according to the channel. A Yorkville Endoscopy spokesperson told The Post 'The Center has been working collaboratively with appropriate government regulatory agencies to ensure complete compliance with all regulations. The Center remains open and will continue to collaborate with all accreditation and government regulatory agencies to ensure quality care.' The Post stated that lawyers from Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz for the Rivers family had not immediately answered its request for comment. MailOnline has since reached out to both the law firm and the clinic for comment.","The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reportedly sent a letter to Yorkville Endoscopy .
That is the same clinic Joan Rivers went to for a throat surgery before she had to be hospitalized and died the following week ."
"Senior Lib Dems are plotting to sign up to David Cameron’s pledge for an EU referendum – in exchange for constitutional reforms. At least three ministers have privately called for a dramatic shift to back the Prime Minister’s plan for an in/out vote on Britain’s place in Europe by 2017. But in the event of a second coalition with the Conservatives, they would insist on a system of proportional representation in local government elections – and a fresh attempt to replace the House of Lords with an elected Senate. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has suggested he would like to have an in/out vote on Britain’s place in Europe by 2017 . Despite Nick Clegg refusing to support an EU referndum, at least three of his senior colleagues have called to back the PM's position in exchange for a system of proportional representation in local government elections . So far, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has refused to back Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an in/out referendum, whether or not he succeeds in negotiating changes in the UK’s relationship with Brussels. But several of the Deputy Prime Minister’s senior colleagues believe that embracing a poll will show that the party, which was humiliated in May’s European elections, has listened to voters. Yesterday, as Mr Clegg was raising eyebrows for an inexplicable four changes of outfits during a series of TV and radio interviews, Lib Dem president Tim Farron said it was important the party does not ‘give away a referendum lightly’. A Lib Dem shift would leave Labour as the only major party opposing a poll. One expected price demanded by ministers would be to scrap the first-past-the-post voting system in local government elections. Instead, they want a system of proportional representation called the single transferable vote, under which candidates are ranked. The system favours smaller parties – and would also end the effective ‘one-party rule’ in many parts of the country. The Lib Dems also want to revive reform of the House of Lords, which stalled in Parliament partly thanks to a revolt by Conservative MPs. The Lib Dems have been branded ‘enemies of democracy’ by Tory colleagues after conspiring with Labour to kill off legislation guaranteeing plans to hold a vote on Britain’s membership of the EU. Insisting yesterday that he would ‘relish’ an EU poll only ‘when the rules change’ in Brussels, Mr Clegg said the Conservatives were ‘tearing themselves apart’ and had ‘plucked an arbitrary date’ to hold the referendum. ‘We don’t hold referenda every other Tuesday in this country,’ he said. In a sign of a split among the Lib Dems on how to proceed, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael suggested a referendum would not happen unless the Tories win next year’s election outright. ‘That would of course require the Conservatives to get a majority after the next election,’ he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow. ‘I don’t think that’s going to happen.’","Three of Nick Clegg's senior colleagues want to support PM's EU plan .

"If you have ever travelled to the US and Egypt and forgotten to tip the hotel staff, the chances are you experienced a rather awkward reaction. Similarly, if you slipped table staff a few extra euros following a meal in France or Japan, then you probably received a similar response. Do the same in Argentina and you may even find yourself in trouble with the police – it's illegal. Scroll down for video . Knowing where and who to tip in different countries can be something of a social minefield. But travel search site Wego has now constructed an easy-to-follow infographic revealing where and when to tip when travelling abroad. According to the infographic, no tipping should ever happen in Argentina, Japan, Oman, Yemen and France. In Austria, Brazil, Netherlands, Russia, Chile, South Africa, Ireland and Turkey, tipping is expected after eating in a restaurant, unless service charge is included. Tipping is left up to the customer in countries including the UK, Norway, Spain, Denmark and Germany. But travel search site Wego has now constructed an easy-to-follow infographic which aims to take the confusion out of when and where to tip when travelling abroad . Deciding whether to leave a tip in these countries depends on the quality of service or experience. 'In the US, low wage earners in the service industry are reliant on tipping to balance out their income, yet in Romania, tips are often declined and in Japan, tipping is considered offensive,' explains Joachim Holte, Chief Marketing Officer for Wego. 'It's wise to be aware of the tipping customs in each place you visit to avoid uncomfortable situations, ensure a smooth trip and avoid paying too much which is quite often the result. 'In Argentina for example, tipping is actually illegal, however, waiters often expect to be tipped by foreigners so if you were to tip, discretion is advised. 'Knowing which countries where you should leave a tip is just as important as knowing which countries not to. 'It's amazing how many travellers forget to research this all important component of visiting other countries. 'There are always considerations and dependencies in any country that you should investigate further before travelling,' Holte continued. Knowing where and who to tip in different countries can be something of a social minefield . 'For instance, in the UK, tipping for food in restaurants is OK, although unexpected as service charges are generally included. Yet, tipping for drinks at a bar is just not cricket!' Where restaurants are where you'd most expect to leave a tip as an acknowledgement of good food and service, some countries expect it for other areas of service too. In general, it's not uncommon to give a small tip to your porter as he drops off your luggage in your hotel room in most places. Rounding up your fare for taxi drivers is common in most countries, apart from New Zealand and Chile, where it's not expected at all. 'It seems that tipping traditions are evolving throughout the world as more people travel. 'Australia and New Zealand don't have a history of tipping, yet travellers who are unaware of this fact have heightened some expectations from service staff,' Holte added. 'If you haven't done your homework before you go, remember you can always ask what the custom is from hotel staff. 'Most people will appreciate you taking the time to find out, and it's a good way to avoid some very sticky situations.'

"A boy hailed as China's miracle baby' after he was born when his mother was killed in a road accident has finally been adopted by his uncle and grandmother. Pingan Zhao's mother had been in labour when she and her husband were hit by a truck as they travelled  on a motorbike to a hospital in Xiamen city in south-eastern China's Fujian province. Both Wang Zhao, 40, and her husband Mao, 42, were killed in the accident, but not before Mrs Zhao gave birth at the scene in March this year. Miracle baby: Pingan Zhao lost both his parents when his father's motorbike was hit by a truck as he drove his mother to the hospital to give birth to hi, . Survivor: Pingan was born as his mother died at the scene of the accident, and was found next to her body . After Pingan was born, Chinese media reported that he had been 'catapulted from his mother's womb as the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. This unbelievable, and untrue, story of his birth led to him becoming a local celebrity and hailed as a 'miracle baby'. Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises  when he was found at the scene of the accident, and has since undergone minor brain surgery. Police spokesman Chan Chien said: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. ' Local celebrity: Exaggerated witness accounts which involved Pingan being 'catapulted from his mother's womb' led to him becoming known as 'the miracle baby' when he was just a few hours old . Wang and Mao Zhao both died after being hit by a truck in Xiamen city in south-eastern China's Fujian province . 'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away. 'What we found out from her family is that the woman, a 40-year-old, had gone into labour at 8:30 AM and her husband, a 42-year-old man, decided to take her by motorbike to the hospital rather than waiting for an ambulance. 'The accident happened as they approached the junction of Maqing Lu and Jiaosong Lu.' Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along. Now Pingan Zhao, who has been dubbed miracle baby, has been adopted by his uncle Yanchao Zhao and his grandmother Kaixing Xiao. Family: Pingan Zhao has been adopted by his uncle Yanchao Zhao and his grandmother Kaixing Xiao . Back home: Pingan is pictured in his uncle's arms as the family get ready to leave the hospital . Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan. 'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile. 'I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.' A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident. 'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious. 'He truly is a miracle baby.'","Chinese boy born moments before his mother died in road accident .

"Is this Britain's oldest PCSO? Officer Martindale-Vale turned 70 yesterday but isn't going anywhere . When most people hit 70, they prefer to leave their working days behind and enjoy their golden years. But retirement can wait for one former Navy man who refuses to quit his job as a police community support officer. Ex-boxer Louis Martindale-Vale celebrated the milestone yesterday and could be Britain's oldest frontline officer, but he aims to be catching criminals for many more years to come. Officer Martindale-Vale, who lives in Great Barr, Birmingham, joined West Midlands Police in 2007 after been reassured by his wife that community policing would “suit you down to the ground"". In a career spanning 54 years, the granddad-of-four has proved he can turn his hand to almost anything. He joined the Navy aged 17 where his role with the Fleet Air Arm saw him perform 'shore patrols' to keep hundreds of sailors in check as they roamed ports in South Africa and Hong Kong. He also worked at Land Rover, as a golf course manager and even as a grave digger. But now, his only concession is to cut down to part-time hours due to his age. 'Working part-time was a 70th birthday present to myself,' he said. 'Age is no barrier to a fulfilling career later in life. 'I'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb PCSOs.' Scroll down for video . The 70-year-old joined West Midlands Police seven years ago after an impressive career spanning 50 years . PCSO Louis Martindale-Vale on the beat around Erdington, Birmingham with cobbler Andy Boustead (left) inside Wilton Market . He added that when he finally does retire he will move with his wife Suzie, 59, to the seaside town of Skegness, Lincolnshire. 'We've got our eye on a place by the sea up there but it's a little while off yet.' Suzie, a retired carer, who has been married to Louis for 12 years, said: 'I told him he should get into community policing because I thought it would suit him down to the ground. 'Louis likes that sort of structure and keeping active so I said why don't you give it a go? Age is no barrier: 'I'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb PCSOs' Louis joined the Navy aged 17 but his first application was rejected on height grounds.

Hobbies: Left, the keen mountaineer climbing Snowdonia in 1990 and right, at Newell Birds of Prey Centre . 'And he's not looked back since. 'I think he'll just keep going as long as he can because he really seems to enjoy it. 'He's not told me when he'll stop so might have to put those plans in Skegness on hold for now.' Louis added: 'Erdington High Street has been my office for the last seven years and I love the role. 'It's great being out and about, helping the public and working with retailers to tackle shoplifters. 'There's nothing more satisfying than helping lock up a pick-pocket. 'It may have spared an elderly person the trauma of having their pension snatched or a teenager losing their new phone.' Superintendent Jo Smallwood said: 'Louis is a shining example of how PCSOs can play an important role in our communities, building relationships with organisations and members of the public - people ask to speak to him personally, share their concerns and have confidence he’ll act to address any issues. 'It’s great to hear him speak so passionately about the role and, when the day does come that he decides to hang up his uniform for the last time, he’ll be sorely missed.'","Louis Martindale-Vale joined West Midlands Police in 2007 after working for 50 years .

"At Bloomfield Road last Saturday, Blackpool supporters arrived outside the turnstiles armed with buckets to rally the troops and collect funds for the Gary Parkinson Trust. ‘Parky’, as he is affectionately known, is the former Middlesbrough and Burnley defender who was working as a coach for Blackpool when struck down by locked-in syndrome in the autumn of 2010. The locals are relentless in their support, and they were upset and angered to be told by stewards that they could not fund-raise within the grounds. Protest: Blackpool fans have made their feelings clear about Karl Oyston's running of the club . Chairman: Supporters have staged protests in recent months against Karl Oyston, pictured above . This is just one example of a club who appear to have lost their moral compass. This famous old club — whose most gifted forefathers include Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Armfield and Alan Ball — have plummeted from everyone’s favourite Premier League underdogs to an embarrassing basket case in three years. Sportsmail has spent the week in Blackpool, talking to fans, players and former employees. It does not take long for a picture to emerge of a club bemused and angered in equal measure by the actions of chairman Karl Oyston and his family. Our investigation uncovers the explosive truth behind the bedlam at Blackpool, where organisation, structure and common decency are foreign concepts to the chairman. Many supporters believe his only motivation is avarice. When manager Jose Riga leads out his side at Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon, an illusion of normality will descend over the City Ground. This football club, however, are anything but normal. Tough job: Jose Riga arrived to take over at Blackpool in July to find the club had just six professional players . Riga, a summer appointment, arrived at the dilapidated training ground in July to discover that he had only six professionals. Since then, a bargain-basement approach to the transfer market has seen 12 players arrive in 12 days — midfielder Andrea Orlandi the latest on a one-year deal. They now have 19 but many are strangers to one another. A goalkeeper, Joe Lewis, was signed on a loan deal from Cardiff on Tuesday. Lord only knows how Blackpool intend to defend set-pieces on Saturday. Not that Oyston will be there to witness it — he intends to jet off to Miami for his summer holiday. Blackpool have banked £100million since falling from the Premier League in 2011 in parachute payments and transfer fees. This summer their rotten core has been on public display, but the signs have been there for long enough. The working conditions that former manager Paul Ince was subjected to before he was dismissed in January after less than a year in charge reeked of Sunday League football. On away trips, senior members of staff would be expected to go to local supermarkets and buy ready meals of lasagne and spaghetti bolognese. New signing: Former England U21 goalkeeper Joe Lewis is one of 12 players to arrive in the last two weeks . Addition: Midfielder Andrea Orlandi has also joined Blackpool on a one-year deal for the coming season . At the club’s Squires Gate training ground, players did their morning stretches with rain water splashing into buckets from the gymnasium’s leaky roof. The facilities there — once described by former manager Ian Holloway as a ‘hell hole’ — are among the worst in the English game. ‘Terrible and a turn-off,’ was one scathing verdict this week. Last season, many players refused to shower, dodging the temperatures that veer between freezing and boiling, to head home after training. The club refused to respond to criticism of the facilities, as they did when approached by Sportsmail repeatedly by telephone and email over the past week. No wonder stalwarts have jumped ship. Matt Williams, the long-serving secretary, is understood to have left for a better financial package at League Two Shrewsbury. Disagreements: Paul Ince was dismissed  in January after a tempestuous time in charge of Blackpool . Critical: Former boss Ian Holloway said Blackpool's facilities are 'a hell hole' and the worst in the English game . The last of the players from the Premier League team who were relegated in 2011, Matt Gilks, departed for Burnley after being offered a contract extension — with a 60 per cent wage cut — by text message. The offer to Gilks, a long-standing servant, is symptomatic of the cost-cutting policies Oyston continues to employ. Players are paid £90 a week in the summer as they are not deemed to be ‘working’. ‘Everybody at this club is captive,’ explained one dressing-room source. ‘The players are unwanted trialists in need of a club or young players who need experience. The coaches or managers appointed tend to be out of favour and in need of one more chance. Nobody actually wants to be there, it’s a short-term stepping stone.’ Riga, appointed in June, already faces an uncertain future. The Chinese whispers suggest Noel Blake, the assistant manager, is being lined up as his replacement, while the name Billy Davies continues to crop up in discussions. Loyalty: Club's longest serving player Matt Gilks, pictured right during Blackpool's 2013 game against Bolton, has joined Burnley after being told to take a pay cut. He played against the Seasiders in a friendly last week, left . Valeri Belokon, the Latvian who owns 20% of the club, is disappointed the Oystons have not reinvested in the club... 'In the name of Blackpool Football Club I am very disappointed to hear that Karl Oyston refuses to escrow the last parachute payment to ensure a competitive team for the coming season. As I see it this will lead to a continuation of our current downward spiral - a negative result in a situation where it could be totally opposite.' 'We believe that last year’s result was the outcome of unsound policies pursued since 2011. In order to succeed one must have a clear strategy and an operating plan, which current management doesn’t have. Without a clear plan any venture is deemed to fail.' 'We have a good collaboration with newly formed BST Trust and helped them to arrange Trust launch party where all ticket revenue will go to Gary Parkinson Trust. We believe that football should be about people and local community.' For the Blackpool supporters, the true victims among the wreckage, resentment intensifies over Oyston’s refusal to invest. This distressing script is now mimicking the best funfair rides in town, but the steady climb that captured the hearts of most fans has been followed by a relentless and frightening descent. Supporters we spoke to despise Oyston for his failure to cement a legacy from the year they enjoyed in the Premier League. Since earning promotion to the top flight in 2010, around £100m has entered Blackpool’s accounts. Official figures from the Premier League reveal that Blackpool have received £76.53m, including parachute payments and solidarity fees. They are soon due another injection of just under £10m from the Premier League. The club’s coffers have also been swelled by ticket sales, sponsorship agreements, merchandise and player sales. Charlie Adam and Matty Phillips left for a combined £14m while a tribunal fee is to be agreed for Thomas Ince’s move to Hull. Only £5.5m has reportedly been spent on permanent signings since Blackpool were promoted. Not wanted: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston, left, and his father Owen Oyston, back right . This summer, most of the club’s youth team were released. The finest talent, Harrison McGahey, was offered a derisory contract and will drop down a division to play at Sheffield United. It is estimated that at least £26m has been paid to the Oyston family — principally to father Owen, the convicted rapist — and their numerous businesses since 2011. The club’s former shorts sponsors, Bradley’s Builders, who did many jobs for the club, claim they were left bankrupt by Karl Oyston after a dispute over payments. Owner Mark Bradley, who was an usher at Oyston’s wedding and went on family holidays with Karl, said: ‘We had to be put into receivership after 25-30 years in business. We have emigrated to Spain due to the personal embarrassment.’ Again, the Oyston family declined to comment. The family this summer bought the Quernmore Park Hall estate in Lancashire, valued by one property website at £3.25m. Determined: Mark Cartmell, a lifelong Blackpool fan, holds a poster protesting against the Oystons on August 2 . Karl Oyston’s son, Sam, regularly mocks supporters on social media, posting pictures of his plush cars on Twitter. Sam now has a minder to protect him. Sam runs the Blackpool FC hotel, a separate business on the corner of the stadium, which fans believe is often prioritised before the club. Many of them are refusing to buy season tickets. At the working men’s club over the road, fans are mulling over their next move. Tim Fielding, chairman of the Blackpool Supporters Trust, said: ‘We want Karl to put football first. Look at the hotel compared to the stadium. It is pristine with fancy furnishing. 'In the stadium, you can see panels coming away from the ceiling and rust on the stands. Outside, there are weeds on the statue of the great Jimmy Armfield. ‘The relationship between the Oystons and fans is at its lowest ebb. If he’s not prepared to invest, give someone else a chance.’ Don’t bet on it. As long as there is money to be made, Oyston is likely to remain.","Jose Riga arrived at the club in July to find only six professional players .

'I knew I was gaining a lot of weight but I couldn't stop eating and drinking. Some nights I would go to McDonalds at 2am in the morning for a Big Mac Meal, nuggets and a McFlurry! I was out of control. 'I could barely climb the stairs, I would get so breathless and the sweating was something else. I wouldn't go swimming or ever change in front of anyone. People stare at you when you're bigger.' The moment of realisation came for Graeme when he went shopping for a new pair of jeans. He believed he was a size 36in waist but after trying a few pairs on he noticed that he had fluctuated to a size 40in waist. From that moment on, Graeme cut out all sugar from his diet, stopped drinking and joined his local football team. Graeme's size was taking a toll and he was shocked that he had gone up four sizes before he began his diet (left). Now he eats a strict six meals a day of low fat, high protein foods to achieve his physique (right) As a result he lost 6st in the first 5 months and started regularly going to the gym. It was here that he met some advanced bodybuilders who inspired him to start weight training. Since then he has undergone a complete body transformation and has started competing professionally as a middleweight body builder. Adopting a regimented diet plan of six small meals a day Graeme now starts his day with rolled oats and PhD chocolate protein, followed by five meals of either rice or sweet potatoes with grilled chicken and vegetables. 'The guys at the gym recommended I start taking protein supplements to help me gain muscle mass, so I tried the PhD pharma whey shake and loved it! From being too embarrassed of his body to go swimming, Graeme is now confident posing in front of thousands in just a tiny pair of pants . 'I add it to my porridge first thing in the morning, and use their protein chocolate bars as a treat in between workouts. 'The meal plan is strict but you get used to it. I get up and make all my meals for the day so I'm ready.' Now Graeme, who recently won the title  Scottish middleweight champion in the British National Bodybuilding Federation competition, not only has a new body but a new passion in life which has changed his outlook completely. 'I love everything I'm doing now. 'I can stand on stage in front of thousands of people in a tiny pair of pants and feel confident. It is so different to how I felt before.'","Graeme used to eat up to three take away dinners in one evening .

"An Orthodox Jewish rabbi has managed to lose 100lbs after his shock diagnosis of type 2 diabetes led him to finally take charge of his health. Rabbi Pesach Sommer, a 42-year-old father-of-five based in Passaic, New Jersey, knew when he went for a health check-up in 2007 that he was overweight at 250lbs, but not that he had given himself diabetes as a result of his 'emotional eating.' 'It was my come-to-Jesus moment,' Rabbi Sommer told CNN, adding that his first move was to buy a stationary bike and pedal on it for an hour a day in front of the TV. Radical: Rabbi Pesach Sommer, 42, managed to lose 100lbs in the space of a year, prompted by his diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Pictured, as he used to be before 2007 (left) and this year (right) Rabbi Sommer had recently lost his father - described as being 'a chronically stressed smoker' also with type 2 diabetes - and around the anniversary of his death, the rabbi knew he had to alter his own path of health. Type 2 diabetes is often a direct result of obesity - excess fat making it hard for the body to regulate its sugar levels - and can be reversible if early action is taken. So Rabbi Sommer got hooked on 24, the suspense-ridden TV drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, and watched it while riding his exercise bike. If the cliffhanger was good enough, he kept going. 'Little by little, I started to cut out everything bad for me,' he says of his diet; switching desserts and processed sugar out for fruits and vegetables. Fitness kick: Following his diagnoses, Rabbi Sommer purchased a stationary bike and pedaled on it for an hour a day in front of his favorite TV show, 24. Pictured with his wife Rochie (left) New hobby: He took up running, lost 2.5lbs a week, and completed his first marathon in 2008. The rabbi (pictured) has since run seven more, and says he 'traded an eating addiction for a running addiction' The key to his success, after many previous failures, he says, is that his desire to lose weight finally surpassed his love of food. 'You have to be honest with yourself,' he advises others. 'If you love eating and that's more important than losing weight, then eat.' Type 2 diabetes is a condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 29 million children and adults in the United States have some form of diabetes. That is about nine per cent of the population, and the vast majority of these people have type 2 diabetes. Being overweight and under active dramatically increases the likelihood of developing the condition. Rabbi Sommer claims that one morning in 2007, he told his wife Rochie that he wanted to run a marathon. The next day, be it by chance or divine intervention, someone approached him out of the blue to train for a race – something the rabbi took to be a sign. 'When I started to run, I just had to run for one minute, and I was out of breath,' he admits. 'I wondered, what did I just get myself into?' Still, he pushed on and lost weight at a rate of 2.5lbs a week, and best of all, found that he loved it; remarking that he had 'traded an eating addiction for a running addiction.' Rabbi Sommer ran his first marathon in January 2008, and reached his goal weight of 150lbs the same May. He has completed seven more marathons since then. Aside from the weight he's shed, running has helped him sleep better, given him more energy, and reduced his stress levels. He now runs 20 to 40 miles a week if he's training for a race and less when he's not, and five of Rabbi Sommer's children have taken part in races with him. Family affair: Rabbi Sommer now runs 20 to 40 miles a week if he's training for a race and less when he's not, and five of his children have taken part in races with him (pictured) Rabbi Sommer's waist is now the size it was when he was in seventh grade, and his approach to food is simple these days: he plans ahead. He decides what he's going to eat before he sits down to the table and walks away when he's finished, full or not. Rabbi Sommer, who has kept the 100lbs off since 2007, says there are no secrets when it comes to weight loss. Exercise more and eat better - 'anyone can do it.'","At his heaviest, Rabbi Pesach Sommer tipped the scales at 250lbs .

"Whether you’re waiting in line for the new iPhone or camping in the woods, sometimes you just need a makeshift bed. So to help you get 40 winks without having to make do with the cold hard ground, one company has designed a wearable futon you can carry with you. The coat-like bed is full of padding so you can rest easily on the floor, and it can also be rolled up like a sleeping bag. Tokyo-based office company King Jim has created a wearable futon. The Wearable Futon Air Mat Set can switch between 'coat' and 'bed' (shown) functions. When going to bed the padding provides a 'comfortable' sleeping place. A supplied air mat can also provide additional padding when on the floor . The somewhat bizarre Wearable Futon Air Mat Set was created by Tokyo-based Japanese office supply manufacturer King Jim. It can be fastened at the neck and the bottoms of the legs fold up to adjust for different heights. The 'futon' is one-size fits all as the sleeves can be rolled up to different sizes . This can also change the fit of the ‘coat’ depending on the season. The pack includes an air mat to provide a full blanket and futon set so you don't necessarily have to sleep on the ground with the wearable futon by itself . While the main coat-futon can roll up into a sack like a sleeping bag, the air mat can be folded into a small A4-sized bag. The sleeves and legs can also be folded up so that you don't trip over yourself while you are walking around with it in 'coat mode'. The product itself is made of nylone, polyethylene and polyester. In total the coat weighs about 1.5lbs (700g), which should make it relatively easy for most to wear and carry. In size it measures 5.25ft (1.6 metres) long and two feet (0.6 metres) wide, while the air mat is 9.45ft (2.88 metres) long and 2.3 ft (0.7 metres) wide. That should be comfortable enough for most people, but if someone wants to share your ‘bed’ they’ll probably need a Wearable Futon Air Mat Set of their own. The mat can take a load of up to 440lbs (200kg) without breaking. The product is available now for about £25 ($40) from supplier King Jim, although there's no news of a release in other territories yet.","Tokyo-based office company King Jim has created a wearable futon .

"It was a traditional dialect used for centuries by fisherfolk. But yesterday it emerged that the language of Cromarty had finally died with the passing of its last speaker. Bobby Hogg was the only person still fluent in the age-old tongue of the Black Isle and his death at the age of 92 means it will now exist only in audio recordings. End of an era: Bobby Hogg, the last native speaker of the Cromarty dialect, has died aged 92 . Small talk: Bobby (left) and his brother Gordon Hogg speaking in the old Cromarty dialect at The Marine Nursing Home in Rosemarkie, before Gordon passed away last April . Mr Hogg, a retired engineer, said . recently he could still close his eyes, see the boats heading out to sea . and hear the unique speech pattern – never normally written down – that . set his people apart. His younger brother Gordon had been the other surviving speaker – but he died in April last year, aged 86. Yesterday, . Dr Robert McColl Millar, of Aberdeen University’s linguistic . department, said Mr Hogg’s death was highly significant. He . added: ‘It is the first time that an actual Scots dialect has so . dramatically died with the passing of the last native speaker. ‘This . was always going to be the danger of the Black Isle, as there were so . few speakers even when it was healthy, when the fishing was still good. Language of the sea: The Cromarty dialect was traditionally spoken by fishermen who populated the town on the tip of the Black Isle . ‘So Bobby Hogg’s passing is a very sad day. It was a very interesting dialect and was unlike any of the others. ‘There . are one or two who still have some facility in the Cromarty fisherfolk . dialect but most of the time they speak Highland English. Bobby . was the last fluent native speaker who spoke no other tongue from a . child. He was what we term a “dense” speaker. So all we have now are the . recordings.’ Mr Hogg, who died on Sunday, had worked across Britain, but kept coming back to Cromarty. His wife Helen was a direct descendent of the community’s most celebrated son, 19th century polymath Hugh Miller. But the Hoggs were from the fishing . community. In 2007, the brothers were recorded by Am Baile, the project . that has created a digital archive of the history and culture of the . Highlands and Islands. Mr . Hogg said: ‘Our father was a fisherman and all his folk had been . fishermen stretching way back. It was the same on our mother’s side too. When we were young, we talked differently in the fishertown to the rest . of Cromarty. ‘It wasn’t written down. It was an oral culture. We had this sort of patois, which I think had both Doric and Gaelic in it. 'There . were words, a lot to do with the fishing, which nobody else could . understand. It is dying out. You hear a smattering in some things people . from Cromarty say, but nobody speaks it fluently but for us.’ Dictionary: A few words from the Cromarty dialect . Return: Mr Hogg kept coming back to the Black Isle coast and Cromarty village where a few people still have some proficiency in the extinct language .","Bobby Hogg was the last person still fluent in the fisherfolk dialect .

"A man was sent a five-figure care home bill for his late father just three days after his parent died. Peter Hayden, 53, from Bournemouth, accused of council accountants of insensitivity after he was sent an invoice for £83,680.92 before he had even buried his 89-year-old father, Sidney. The bill was for his father's care at the £700-a-week Highview Residential Home in Southbourne, and payment had been deferred until his father's bungalow had been sold. Mr Hayden said: 'Dad died on the Tuesday, the council sent the letter on the Thursday, and I received in on the Friday. Peter Hayden, 53, left, was sent an invoice for £83,000 two days after his father Sidney, 89, right, died . 'I couldn't believe the timing of it - you would have thought they could let us cremate him first.' The letter began: 'We were sorry to hear of the death of Mr Hayden.  Please accept our sincere condolences.' Immediately below the sympathetic message was a detailed invoice for £83,680 for Mr Hayden's stay at the care home from March 2010 to September this year. The council's letter ended by stating: 'We understand this is a difficult time, however...we look forward to receiving payment.' Bournemouth Borough Council had previously agreed to fund Mr Hayden's care home fees until his home could be sold. His son has accused the local authority for being insensitive about the timing of their demand for payment of the back-dated fees. 'Insensitive': Sidney Hayden's son, Peter, 53, received this bill from the council before his father's cremation . He said: 'They should have let a reasonable time pass before sending us a bill like that, but they either don't think or don't care.' The invoice covered care for Mr Hayden senior from 23 March 2010 until 8 September this year, the day before Mr Hayden died. A spokesman for the council said they were now reviewing their debt recovery policy as a result of Mr Hayden's complaint. Andy Sharp, head of adult social care for the council, said: 'Our sympathy and condolences go to Mr Hayden and his family for the loss they have suffered. 'In the light of Mr Hayden's complaint we are reviewing our policy in relation to debt recovery.' He added: 'We apologise to the Hayden family for any distress the timing of this letter may have caused.'

"Ticket prices for The Open at St Andrews next year will rise by £5 to a minimum of £70 for an adult - or £80 on the day - despite disappointing attendances the last time it was held in Scotland. High prices were blamed for a drop in attendance at Muirfield in 2013 and ticket prices were frozen for this year's Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake. In 2013, the R&A had hoped for 170,000 fans to attend but only 142,036 did - 18,000 fewer than at the same venue in 2002 when tickets cost £35 - which saw a £1.35million shortfall in ticket income. VIDEO Scroll down to watch A history of The Open from McIlroy to Seve Ballesteros . Rory McIlroy will defend his Open title at St Andrews in Scotland next summer after triumphing at Hoylake . The R&A will hope that the draw of watching Rory McIlroy defend his title will bring in the fans for the 144th Open from 12-19 July 2015 over the Old Course. The R&A said in a statement: 'After being frozen for this year's Open, the price of an adult daily ticket will go up by £5 to £70, if purchased before 31 May, and £80 thereafter. The £70 price represents a £10 increase on the 2010 daily ticket price. Grame McDowell plays up the 18th hole during the last time The Open was held at St Andrews in 2010 .

"They seem friendly enough when they’re discussing the creations of the Great British Bake Off contestants. When it comes to Mary Berry’s cooking, however, Paul Hollywood is prepared to ditch the sweet talk. Speaking ahead of the final of the BBC1 show tonight, the master baker declared he would beat his co-judge ‘hands down’ if they were to go head-to-head in a baking competition. Master baker: Paul Hollywood has said he thinks he would beat Mary Berry 'hands down' in a bake off . Earlier this year Miss Berry, 79, was asked who would win in a bake off – but gave a much more diplomatic answer. ‘He’d win the bread, hands down, but I’d win the cakes,’ she told Waitrose Kitchen magazine. But Hollywood, 48, did not admit to any weakness in either specialism. In the magazine’s latest issue, he said: ‘I’d beat Mary hands down. Period.’ Firm friends: The baking experts remain chummy off camera after meeting on the first season of Great British Bake Off in 2010 . If you want to stay trim and healthy look to Mary Berry, according to an obesity expert. The Great British Bake Off judge famously allows herself cake – but only a sliver. And a leading nutrition expert has recommended that this is the best way to stop us craving fatty foods and overindulging later. Miss Berry, 79, has previously revealed how she is very ‘disciplined’ with her portion sizes and has only a small piece of cake when sampling the bakes for the BBC One contest. The best-selling cookery writer also said she used to be ‘large’ but felt obliged to stay in shape in case the public looked at her and thought ‘that’s what happens when you eat a lot of cake’. Professor Tom Sanders, an expert in nutrition at Kings College London, said: ‘I like Mary Berry, she bakes cakes with everything that you think is awful; sugar, fats, cream, but she says, “I only eat a bit of it”. That’s the key to it.’ He also called on shops to ban the ‘walk of shame’ whereby they place chocolate bars next to the till to tempt customers queuing. ‘People are having food pushed on to them,’ he said. ‘We have people who are susceptible and can’t say no. ‘This business of being offered bars of chocolate when you buy a newspaper. I think it is part of the problem.’ Since the TV cooks shot to fame when the show started four years ago, both Hollywood and Miss Berry have developed a firm off-screen friendship. He often stays at her flat in London, and once said she ‘looks after me like I’m one of her family’. For her part, Miss Berry has said she is full of respect for Hollywood’s professional skills, despite the fact she has decades more experience than him. She once said: ‘We respect each other. I would never argue with him over a loaf of something because he knows the science of it – how they’ve achieved it and everything.’ Just who would be victorious in a baking battle is unclear. After joining the family baking business at 18, Hollywood went on to work as head baker for exclusive hotels including Cliveden House and The Dorchester. And he famously created an Almond and Roquefort sourdough bread that was sold for £15 a loaf at Harrods. Meanwhile Miss Berry trained at The Cordon Bleu cookery school in Paris before embarking on a career as a food writer in the 1960s. Today she has more than 70 books to her name, compared to Hollywood’s five, which has helped her make an estimated fortune of £5million.","Hollywood thinks he can beat Berry, he announced ahead of final .

The controversial Blackpool chairman is understood to be heading to the sunshine of Florida as Blackpool kick off their new campaign with just enough players to make a first team squad.

"The new Championship season is upon us with 24 teams looking to emulate Leicester, Burnley and QPR in winning promotion to the Premier League. Coming down from the top flight are Cardiff, Fulham and Norwich while Wolves, Brentford and Rotherham will join them in the second tier after earning promotion form League One. It has been a summer of upheaveal off the pitch for many sides in the Championship, with five new managers being appointed and two takeovers going through - assuming that is that Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov moves in at Sheffield Wednesday in the coming days as expected. Trouble ahead? The inexperienced Dave Hockaday has taken over at Leeds United ahead of the new season . Turbulent: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has already sacked Brian McDermott while in charge . At Leeds there is a new owner already in place in Italian Massimo Cellino and he has in turn appointed a new manager at Elland Road in the previously unknown Dave Hockaday. Charlton and Nottingham Forest - themselves both recently taken over by Belgian and Kuwaiti owners - have brought in new managers in the shape of Bob Peeters and Stuart Pearce respectively. Brighton too have a new man at the helm in the form of ex-Liverpool captain Sami Hyypia while Blackpool, in the headlines all summer for all the wrong reasons, have appointed Peeters’ predecessor at Charlton, Jose Riga. How long Riga lasts at Blackpool in anyone’s guess with the club’s fans in civil war with their owners who have only provided the Belgian with 17 players to work with. With all that out of the way we’re up to the present day and full fixture list this weekend. Here’s a look at the promotion contenders and those who will be fighting the drop... Bounce back? Felix Magath will be hoping for immediate promotion to the Premier League with Fulham . Building from the back: Danny Batth is one of several exciting youngsters at Wolverhampton Wanderers . The favourites . Fulham look in the best shape of the relegated clubs despite a summer of upheaval, while Norwich should also be in the mix for automatic promotion. Felix Magath’s methods have not been popular with all at Craven Cottage but he has managed to assemble a strong, new squad in a short period of time, spearheaded by £11million marquee signing Ross McCormack from Leeds. The Cottagers also have an exciting batch of youngsters who have come through their academy and if Magath gets the blend right then the title is Fulham’s for the taking. Norwich opted to appoint Neil Adams as their full-time manager in May despite him not being able to save them from the drop as caretaker, but they should benefit from the continuity of having a club man in charge. The £3m capture of 22-goal Lewis Grabban from Bournemouth and the addition of ex-Rangers forward Kyle Lafferty look smart pieces of business but a lot depends on who leaves with nearly four weeks of the transfer window still left - and departures are expected. Kenny Jackett’s exciting young Wolves squad make them real contenders for back-to-back promotions. Jackett has real strength in depth to call upon in every position and will still do so even if he manages to move on several players still at Molineux on big contracts from the time of their back-to-back relegations. Derby will be looking to go one better after Wembley heartache in the play-off final in May but have lost George Thorne, Andre Wisdom and Patrick Bamford from their squad last season either to injury - in Thorne’s case after he made his loan move from West Brom permanent - or due to the expiration of loans. Steve McClaren’s squad is a young one too and they can only improve. Wigan and Cardiff’s squads both lack balance but are full of talent nonetheless. If either Uwe Rosler or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can find the right formula then they could both challenge all of the above for the top two places. Up for the fight: Central midfielder Will Hughes will be integral to Derby County's promotion push . Dark horses . Reading have been static in the transfer market as they await investment but still have the benefit of having one of the most prolific academies in the country fuelling their first-team. If they can keep hold of the likes of Alex McCarthy, Jordan Obita and Hal Robson-Kanu then there’s no reason why they can’t finish in the top six, which they so nearly did last season. Bournemouth flirted with the play-offs towards the end of last season after a brilliant run of form in the spring and if Callum Wilson - a big-money arrival from Coventry - can replace the goals of Grabban they could sneak in to the top six. Falling out: Stuart Pearce was unhappy with Nottingham Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi for selling players . Despite his high profile the appointment of Stuart Pearce as manager is a massive gamble by Nottingham Forest given that he has not managed at club level for seven years. He has a very strong squad to work with though, especially after the £5m signing of Britt Assombalonga from Peterborough, and if he can get them performing to their potential there is no reason why they can’t finish in the top six. If. Elsewhere, Ipswich and Blackburn have steadily improved under Mick McCarthy and Gary Bowyer respectively over the last two seasons and will be in the play-off race, while if £2.8m Spanish striker Kike can adapt quickly to Championship football then Middlesbrough too will be in the mix. Relegation battle . As mentioned before, Blackpool are in dire straits and unless there is rapid and significant investment they are doomed. Even if Riga gets up to a full quota of players it will not be easy getting them all pulling in the same direction given the amount of dissent and uncertainty around Bloomfield Road. Promoted duo Brentford and Rotherham look in good shape and will be confident of finishing above the likes of Birmingham, Charlton, Huddersfield and Millwall, who all look set for another relegation scrap. Leeds, meanwhile, for the attention around their new owner, have gone backwards in terms of the quality of their playing squad. It will be fascinating to see how Hockaday - who has only ever managed in non-league - gets on at a club the size of Leeds’ stature. The experiment could go horribly wrong. Tricky business: Jose Riga has had a difficult first couple of months in charge of crisis club Blackpool .","Norwich and Cardiff also looking for swift returns to the top flight .

"Spooked: Was this apparition the Grey Lady of Dudley Castle, or a trick of the light? Whenever I mention to people that I have seen ghosts, I can depend on one of two opposite reactions. Some people will be fascinated and want to know more. Others will vehemently pooh-pooh the possibility of ghosts - either I’m deluded or I’m lying. There can be no such thing as ghosts! The vehemence, even violence, with which sceptics deny their existence makes me suspicious. What are they afraid of? That there are more things in heaven and earth than science can account for? England is a thrilling place for those who do believe in ghosts. It is the most haunted country there is - with 10,000 places which are famed for sightings. One is the West Midlands’s Dudley Castle which appeared in the news pages last week after a tourist took an accidental photograph which appeared to show the castle’s ‘Grey Lady’ in an ancient archway. Only on digital magnification did the image become visible. It looks like the grey ghost of a woman of the Tudor period or earlier. But, of course, ‘ghost’ photographs can always be the result of a trick of the light, not to mention our tendency to make images out of any shapes that we see. It is actually very rare to see ghosts; it’s much more common to hear them. I’ve experienced both and it has made me sure that there is something ‘out there’. Your hair stands on end. Your skin goes cold. Worms crawl up your spine. Your neck feels as though it is being clenched in an unseen grip. It first happened to me at boarding school at Stowe, which is housed in the magnificent Palladian mansion built by the family which became Dukes of Buckingham. One brilliant summer’s night I went for a walk under the full moon and was coming back up a grassy rise when I saw two figures, a man and a woman, walking towards the massive flight of steps up to the portico of the school with its Greek columns. It was midnight. Everyone was in bed (bar myself), and these people had nothing to do with the school. Who were they? I hastened to confront them, but by the time I reached the building they had turned up the steps and mounted them close together as if in conversation. Before I could catch up, very out of breath, they had disappeared over the top step into the dark shadows of the portico. Scroll down for video . Evidence? The ghostly figure was in the rear of this photograph taken by Amy Harper, who was on a day trip . By the time I reached the portico, it was empty. The big doors had not opened or light would have spilled out. And the sheer drop from the side would put off anyone from jumping. That was when I froze with the reactions I have described above. I was stunned by two things. First, their antique clothing — long skirts on the woman, an oddly long-hanging jacket on the man and weird hats. Then there was the fact that they had made no noise, no footsteps on the stairs, no murmur of voices. And they never once looked round at me. I had been watching a pair of ghosts from another century. After investigating costume history, I came to the conclusion that their dress was most like the Regency style, and that therefore they could have been the second Duke and his Duchess, who inherited Stowe in that period. They had strolled up the steps as if they owned it. I said nothing about my ghost sighting at the time for fear of being laughed at. Then, 60 years later, to my great surprise, I found a description of an uncannily similar couple walking along the ridge, mounting the steps and vanishing among the columns of the portico. It was in an anniversary issue of the school magazine. The account was dated ten years earlier than my experience. So I was not alone. I could believe my eyes with more confidence. Spooky: Peter Lewis saw ghostly figures on the steps of his school, Stowe in Buckinghamshire (pictured) The next ghost I encountered was when I worked in Fleet Street. As a night-time newspaper sub-editor, I used to take a supper break in a pub around 10pm. Coming back from Tudor Street near the river one night, a female colleague and I were late. A short-cut then existed, a narrow footpath between silent black buildings which was called Hanging Sword Alley. It was swept away during later redevelopment, though the street sign is still there. It was a murky, ill-lit passage, but we were in a rush so began to climb it. You could see the uphill pavement was empty all the way. Halfway along, as we reached the crossing with another passage, there was a street light, the only one. As we passed across, we both suddenly stopped — and froze. Slowly both of us looked back the way we had come. Perched on a step to a building doorway was a large sack which we had not noticed on the way past. From the neck of the sack protruded a large human hand. With every nerve in my spine on edge, I gingerly approached it. It was not a glove. I could see the knuckles and veins, even the texture of the skin with uncanny clarity in the light of the street lamp. It looked very dead. I bent closer but — I don’t know why — couldn’t bring myself to touch it. The sack was more than waist-high and it could well have contained the rest of a body. I rejoined my companion. ‘It’s a hand,’ I said, unnecessarily, for she could see it as well as I. We hastened back up to Fleet Street. We agreed that I ought to phone the police, but I thought I’d better go back and check first. I wanted to make sure what it was. I returned down Hanging Sword Alley and reached the crossing with the street light. The passage was empty. Nothing there, no sack, no hand, even the building entrance looked different from the one I’d seen only two or three minutes previously. Where could it have gone? The doorway looked firmly locked and unused for years. There were no other hiding places. Could someone have come to collect the sack and vanished? In that short time, it seemed impossible. Anyway, what were the contents intended for? I did not phone the police but I watched the newspapers in vain for stories of a body being found round there for the next week or two. In darkness: The author saw a withered hand in an alleyway off Fleet Street (pictured) during a late night shift . Of course, my colleague and I discussed it in every detail — and in every detail we agreed on what we had seen. Particularly the unearthly clarity of the vision and the very disturbing feeling it gave us both. There were two of us sharing one experience. It could not be dismissed as imaginary. I wondered if we had time-travelled into a previous century for those few moments. Or else the sack had done so into ours. Forty years later, I found confirmation of this theory when I was telling a friend the story. ‘Hanging Sword Alley?’ she exclaimed. ‘But that’s in Dickens!’ Indeed, it appears in A Tale Of Two Cities, set in 1775. In Hanging Sword Alley lodged Jerry Cruncher, doorman of a Fleet Street bank with a night-time hobby — body-snatching. Enduring appeal: TV shows such as Most Haunted (pictured) flourish with large audiences . He and his gang called it ‘fishing’ — slinking into cemeteries to exhume recently buried bodies. There was a brisk demand for corpses for dissection at the city’s medical schools. An intact cadaver would fetch 20 guineas. And the centre of the trade operated in Hanging Sword Alley. The records of Old Bailey trials bear this out, and it’s why Dickens lodged his unsavoury Mr Cruncher there. So I believe in ghosts. I believe there are places where some kind of memory persists which can be activated by the psychic energy of suitable people. I suppose I am one of them - though not a remarkable example - not only because I have seen three ghosts, but because I have heard many more. I have lived in three old houses, disturbed regularly by loud footsteps crunching heavily upstairs, knockings and dragging noises, the swish of long skirts and some sudden, strange smells of something metallic. I’ve stayed in several old country houses and hotels where I have been woken in the night by a tremendous knocking on the door or a pandemonium of voices in the next room. Next morning I would tell reception and get such a reply as: ‘No, there was no one in the room next to yours last night.’ Scoff as you may, there is more interest nowadays in ghost-hunting and in psychic phenomena than at any time since the Victorians. Ghost-hunting weekends at old sites are very popular and TV shows such as ‘Most Haunted’ flourish. I welcome this because I am convinced there are further powers hidden in nature, especially in the human consciousness, to be discovered. There are far too many experiences of haunting and inexplicable presences or disturbances of normality, which have been recorded throughout the centuries, for anyone to dismiss them as mere superstition or fraud.","Author PETER LEWIS reviewed for national press for several decades .

"Meet some of the world's rarest and adorable baby animals. From rare river otters giving their pups swimming lessons to baby Sunda pangolin hitching a ride with its mother - these creatures are among some of the most endangered and native species to Singapore. More than 400 baby animals were born or hatched at the Wildlife Reserves Singapore across four of its parks - Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari and Singapore Zoo since January. Orange is the new black: Javan langur baby staying close to its mother in Singapore Zoo . Nearly one in four babies are among the critically endangered or 'threatened' species, which includes the cotton-top tamarin, javan langur, proboscis monkey and the southern river terrapin. Found throughout the forests of South-east Asia, the Sunda pangolins from the Night Safari is one of the most iconic and rarest creatures at the park. Night Safari is the world’s first zoological institution to house the elusive, solitary and nocturnal creatures. Exercise (and looking this good) is exhausting work: River Safari’s giant river otter, Carmen, and two of her pups basking in the sun . In recent years, the Sunda pangolin have been driven closer to extinction by illegal animal trafficking, habitat loss and being hunted for their meat and scales at an unsustainable level. The rare species of javan langur, also known as an ebony leaf monkey,  features a distinctive deep orange coloured fur and can measure up to 87 centimetres in length. Another exciting animal comes from the giant river otters at River Safari, which displays the rare species for the first time in Asia. After their pup didn't survive in 2013, the newly parents Carlos and Carmen have become more experienced in raising their pups, while teaching them how to swim as well. Hey, can anyone hear me down here? Jurong Bird Park's Goliath palm cockatoo chick squawking . Over at Jurong Bird Park, the Goliath palm cockatoo are the largest of all cockatoo species and can grow up to 50 centimetres. They have one of the lowest hand-rearing success rates among the parrot species due to their specialised diet. WRS' Chief Life Sciences Officer Dr Cheng Wen-Haur said: 'Each of these births represents a precious glimmer of hope in our effort to help save the planet’s biodiversity. 'Many of them are part of coordinated conservation breeding programmes to safeguard against extinction in the wild,' he said. 'All of them are invaluable ambassadors for their species to connect our visitors to the need for their protection.' Jurong Bird Park welcomes more than 900,000 visitors, 1.1 million at Night Safari and 1.7 million at Singapore Zoo each year. Pups first swimming lesson.

"A prison psychologist has been deregistered after pursuing a relationship with an inmate who was doing 21 years behind bars for murder. Bobbie Bergmeier met the inmate - who can be referred to only as Client A - after she began working as a psychologist at Junee Correctional Centre in the NSW Riverina region in April 2010. At the time, Client A was serving the final years of his 21-year sentence for murder and malicious wounding. The Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) alleges Ms Bergmeier began intimate telephone conversations with him, declaring ‘she loved him and couldn't wait to be with him’ and ‘he was sexy and she wanted him forever’. Bobbie Bergmeiert has been deregistered after pursuing a relationship with an inmate who was doing 21 years behind bars for murder . She resigned from the prison job in August 2011 but continued to stay in contact with him, visiting his family and friends, and applying to be his sponsor for weekend leave. In an attempt to cover up the relationship, Ms Bergmeier used a colleague's password to log into Client A's case notes and change them to create ‘distance’ between herself and him, the HCCC alleged. In a judgment handed down on Wednesday, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal NSW found her guilty of professional misconduct, saying she ‘has been involved in a serious boundary violation and placed her client at risk’. The tribunal said Client A had been in jail all of his adult life with little opportunity to explore relationships and was described as ‘needy and dependent and psychologically vulnerable’. When asked why she didn't end the relationship when the stakes were so high, Ms Bergmeier told the tribunal her feelings were ‘so strong’ that she didn't think to. Bergmeier met the inmate after she began working as a psychologist at Junee Correctional Centre (pictured) in the NSW Riverina region in April 2010 . Ms Bergmeier said she accepted responsibility for her actions and acknowledged that what she did was wrong and understood her conduct had breached her professional code of ethics. The tribunal cancelled her registration, saying: ‘Her insight into the seriousness of her conduct and its impact on her client, her colleagues and the profession as a whole remains questionable.’ Client A was released on parole in March and it is believed the pair are continuing to see each other. Ms Bergmeier is now enrolled in a degree in primary school teaching at Charles Sturt University.","Bobbie Bergmeier met an inmate at Junee Correctional Centre in NSW in April 2010 who was convicted of murder .

"A school district has decided to allow senior students to pose with guns in their yearbook photos - as long as the pictures 'don't depict violence towards humanity'. The school board unanimously voted 6-0 on Monday to allow students, aged 17 and 18, at Broken Bow Public Schools in Nebraska to have firearms and knives after coming under pressure from parents. Superintendent Mark Sievering told MailOnline today that the policy was implemented due to the 'climate and culture' of the region but added that the images must be 'respectable, appropriate and tasteful'. Jillian Dixson of Grand Island has grown up in a hunting family. She wanted to incorporate her rifle and her trophy from her favorite hunt . The photographer's caption, provided with the image, read: 'Dustin Langenberg of Bertrand has a strong interest and a healthy respect for guns. Dustin's senior pictures were a reflection of all his interests' Students, for example, cannot be pointing the gun at the camera in a photograph, in a way which would seem threatening. There are no restrictions on what types of guns the students are allowed to pose with, according to the newly-adopted policy - but their outfit must adhere to a strict school dress code. Guns are still banned from Broken Bow school grounds so the yearbook pictures must either be taken by parents or by a professional photographer. Baer Photography, for example, has taken portraits of male and female students posing with their guns. In one image, a student poses with his weapon perched over his shoulder alongside a truck; in another, a female student has her gun slung on one shoulder with a set of antlers perched on the other. Another boy has his rifle next to a stag's head while he pets the family dog. The decision to allow guns in yearbook photos came after the school district found last year that it was a popular concept among students. The new guidelines state that students are allowed to pose with game they have killed - which is allowed if the animal is dead but not if the creature 'is in obvious distress'. The school allows students to pose with other props related to their hobbies such as sporting equipment and musical instruments. There are bans on clothes which do not apply with school dress code which is deemed as  clothes 'disruptive to the education program'. Drugs, alcohol and tobacco are, perhaps as expected, strictly banned. Mr Sievering said: 'Shooting sports are very popular in the area and we have a number of national champion shooters at the school but we didn't have a policy in place, so we decided to outline it.' Kalen Mazenkowski poses with his dog, trophy mount and a rifle given to him by his grandfather . Mr Sievering said after discussing the issue with other school districts, he found mixed opinions on the pictures but that he was not alone in allowing weapon images in the yearbook. In 2014, school and college shootings in the U.S. has led to 20 deaths and left 42 people injured. Mr Sievering told MailOnline that he understood that the gun yearbook pictures would be controversial. He said: 'We certainly understand that this is a sensitive topic for many folks. We know that there are many people with very strong opinions on both sides. 'We looked at our community and established a policy that suited our community and decided to allow the pictures, as long as they are not done in a manner that would depict violence towards humanity. He added: 'We certainly understand that it will have its critics.' Broken Bow sits in the heart of Custer County and has a population of around 3,500. There are around 3,500 acres of surrounding land available for the hunting of water fowl, ducks, geese and deer.

"The company behind Doughnut King and Michel’s Patisserie is set to buy coffee chain Gloria Jean's for $163.5 million from Hillsong board member. Retail Food Group will buy the global franchising and coffee roasting business from Gloria Jean’s executive chairman Nabi Saleh’s private company. The store  opened its first Australian outlet in 1996 in Miranda, southern Sydney, when Saleh and Peter Irvine brought Gloria Jean's to Australia. Retail Food Group is buying the coffee chain from the man who brought the franchise to Australia . Saleh, who is also the Hillsong church board member, has committed to remain with the business for a minimum of two years, along with his senior management team. He said Retail Food Group's reputation as a food and beverage operator and expertise in building franchise businesses made them ideal to lead the continued expansion of Gloria Jean's. 'We have long known that Gloria Jean's Coffees has extraordinary potential for growth, but we couldn't have been more impressed by how quickly RFG recognised this potential,' he said. 'Their reputation as one of Australia's best food and beverage operators, deep expertise in building franchise businesses, and their proven commitment to successfully growing aquired brands, made RFG the ideal choice for the future success of our much'loved Gloria Jean's Coffees brand.' Retail Food Group is buying the coffee chain from the man who brought the franchise to Australia . Retail Food Group also owns Donut King (pictured), Michel's Patisserie, Brumby's Bakery, Esquires Coffee, Crust Gourmet Pizza Bar and Pizza Capers . The 35-year-old cafe group has 800 outlets in more than 40 countries, which includes 358 stores in Australia and 87 in the United States. The deal comes four months after Singapore-based Global Yellow Pages pulled out of a deal to buy Gloria Jean's. Retail Food Group said the global coffee chain had long been a target and will pay $153.5 million in cash plus $10 million in its own shares, plus up to a further $16.4 million depending on Gloria Jean's performance. Its purchase of Gloria Jean's is expected to be settled by December . It will raise $55 million to help fund its purchase through the issue of new shares to institutional and sophisticated shareholders. The company has also increased its senior debt facility with National Australia Bank, from $135 million to $253 million. Its purchase of Gloria Jean's is expected to be settled by December. It is also buying privately-owned gourmet coffee maker Cafe Palazzo.","Takeaway and cafe giant is buying the coffee chain from the man who brought the franchise to Australia .

"From the erratic football act once dubbed ‘The Walking Foul’ by former boss Paul Sturrock, here was ‘The Diving Headbutt’. Bilel Mohsni was sent off for a crazed lunge at two-goal Scotland international Chris Martin with 14 minutes to go as the defender’s temper flared up in friendly action. Martin appeared to barge late into Mohsni and, as both players were lifting themselves off the turf, the Rangers man sought revenge by launching himself head-first to slam into the Derby striker’s side. Marching orders: Bilel Mohsni was sent off for an alleged headbutt on Derby County's Chris Martin . Easy pickings: Martin netted twice for the Rams as they beat Rangers 2-0 on Saturday afternoon . Derby County: (4-1-4-1) Grant; Christie, Keogh, Forsyth, Naylor; Hughes; Russell (Ward 70), Hendrick, Bryson, Dawkins; Martin (Sammon 75). Subs not used: Roos, Eustace, Bennett, Hanson, Bunjaku, Sammon, Freeman, Calero, Santos. Booked: Martin. Rangers: (4-2-3-1) Bell; McGregor, McCulloch, Mohsni, Wallace (Templeton 68); Hutton (Smith 60), Black; Macleod, Law, Aird (Boyd 60); Miller (Zaliukas 75). Subs not used: Simonsen, Crawford, Shiels, Gallagher . Sent off: Mohsni. Referee: Mark Heywood . The jolting collision will doubtless earn Mohsni a suspension to start the competitive season to go with a rebuke from Ally McCoist that his actions were ‘unacceptable’. The Rangers manager is not finished with him yet, either. McCoist turned his back and had no interest engaging with the Tunisian international as he ambled towards the tunnel. Words were kept brief and to the point in the dressing room afterwards. Mohsni can expect more talks over an incident that further taints a disciplinary record that McCoist will be wary of carrying into Championship battle if there remains the danger of a key player letting himself and colleagues down with a top flight return at stake. 'There are no excuses for it,' said McCoist, whose team face Hibernian in the Petrofac Training Cup on Tuesday then Hearts in the league kick-off on Sunday. 'It’s a big disappointment to see that happening. He’s going to have to learn. The team need him and we all need each other. 'He’s not a daft boy. When his head is in the right place and he’s focused, he’s an integral part of our team. But he’s let himself down. 'You can only point him in the right direction. He knows it’s wrong and unacceptable. 'At this moment we don’t know if he can play on Tuesday or Sunday. Straight away it’s given us a headache we could’ve done without. 'We spoke briefly but I don’t think that’s the best time to look at a situation. Sometimes you let the dust settle and assess the whole thing and have a chat with him. 'We will watch it again and talk about it further.' A charming individual off the park, Mohsni is a combustible competitor drawn to wild mood swings on the pitch. While Luis Suarez wheels out the same old biting act, Mohsni doesn’t have a signature move of indiscipline. Plenty to ponder: Gers boss Ally McCoist saw his team comfortably swept aside at the iPro Stadium . Pyro: A flare was thrown on to the pitch by one of Rangers' 8,000 travelling supporters . He has a far more creative streak, finding all manner of ways to be sent off. The charge sheet before this moment of madness included three reds and 17 yellows in only 52 appearances for Southend United. At previous clubs he’s argued with his own team-mates after a dismissal. Last season he saw red for clashing post-match with Airdrie boss Gary Bollan. There are dangerous fouls and fits of temper. Could Saturday's all-new manoeuvre be the 27-year-old’s last in a Rangers jersey? There was interest from Abu Dhabi team Baniyas Sports Club during the close season. With Darren McGregor at right back yesterday and Marius Zaliukas starting on the bench, McCoist does have centre half options. Mohsni bailed out McGregor after an early slip let in Simon Dawkins but that last ditch tackle to prevent an early strike and a goal-line clearance late in the first half were highlights in front of 9000 travelling supporters. He wasn’t the only Rangers player guilty of dodgy distribution issues that plagued efforts to work the ball to classier acts up the pitch in Nicky Law and Kenny Miller who, on limited evidence, are on the same wavelength. Fraser Aird should’ve fared better with a back post header carved out by one such Law and Miller combination. Good day's business: Derby manager Steve McClaren watched from the stands . A lone striker for Derby in a struggling Premier League season of 2007/08, Miller’s return to the iPro Stadium saw him deployed in that role for an hour before the introduction of Kris Boyd to make a pair. By then Derby’s up tempo opening to the second half had paved the way for victory. Johnny Russell caused problems and the Celtic fan and ex-Dundee United attacker was berated by Rangers fans right up until he gave the away end the sarcastic thumbs up at his substitution. But it was Derby’s schemer on the opposite flank, Dawkins, who was the main danger and he smacked the base of Cammy Bell’s left hand post. On 58 minutes, his speedy burst into the area was too much for Lee McCulloch and, as he drew Bell out of goal and into a collision with – you’ve guessed it - Mohsni, Dawkins picked out Martin lurking eight yards out. Last season’s top scorer bundled home. For the second on 74, Martin’s movement evaded McGregor and he latched on to a Will Hughes pass to cleverly tuck home past Bell. Martin craved a hat-trick but then clashed with Mohsni, was booked for his part in the flashpoint and swiftly replaced by Conor Sammon.","Ally McCoist's side kick off their season against Hearts next Sunday .

"Everybody loves to write their own bucket list but few rarely get the opportunity to fulfill all of their lifelong dreams before they die. Intrepid duo, Jennifer Adams and Clint Bizzell, are fortunate enough to have travelled all over this Great Brown land for their jobs as television presenters on Channel Ten’s Places We Go and decided to reveal their top 100 best places across Australia. To share their special journey, the couple took along their 18-month daughter, Charlie, and both of their mothers in two cars and a caravan in tow on their Down Under adventure. Bizzell, a former AFL player, talks about seven of his best experiences that stood out for him while on the road trip with his family four years ago: . Favourite natural wonder: Mitchell Falls, Western Australia . 'The first time I saw it was from the air in a helicopter because it was the wet season. 'It's four-tiered - breathtaking and beautiful - a real sight to see.' 'Then we landed and trekked to it - it's such enormous water with so much power.'

'Breathtaking and beautiful' : Mitchell Falls in Western Australia chosen as favourite natural wonder . Favourite beach: Jervis Bay, New South Wales . 'It's in the Guinness Book of records for the whitest sand in the world. If you take your sunnies off when the sun is bouncing off the sand if you've got to put them back on. The marine park is phenomenal when you're paddle boarding and dolphins are greeting you and whales are constantly there. It's especially good for families because there are no crazy dumping whales.' Bizzell recalls dolphins greeting them while they were paddle boarding at Jervis Bay in southern NSW . Of all beaches in Australia, Bizzell chose Jervis Bay for it's gleamingly white sand - said to be the whitest in the world . Favourite country town: Birdsville, Queensland . 'It has a really great sense of community - it's very tight knit,' he said. 'It's in the middle of nowhere and had that real feel of country with enormous amounts of cattle.' 'Like any great country town it has a great pub with memorabilia. Spending time drinking beers with the locals is something I will always really treasure. 'They envelope you with their warmness - it's really overwhelming.' Bizzell chose Birdsville, Queensland as his favourite country town.

The overwhelming sense of community at Birdsville is something city slickers Adams and Bizzell will never forget . The Big Red : can be found near Birdsville . Favourite adventure: Diving with the Whale Shark, Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia . 'It's the biggest fish of the ocean so your heart is in your mouth because you are not sure where it is or how big it's going to be - then they tell you to look under the water and because it's 15 metres long it looks like an underwater building effortlessly swimming along.' 'You are feeling excitement, exhilaration and fear at the end of the your fingertips. Then you swim alongside and realise it's harmless and you want to keep up with it but you're too tired after a couple of minutes. 'Then you go on and look for another one - it's a real thrill seeking adventure.'

Whale Shark (pictured) being filmed by divers at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia . A close up picture of a diver taking a photograph of a whale shark at the Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia . Favourite historical destination: Mount Borradaile, Arnhem Land, Northern Territory . 'You fly in on a Cessna through all of the river systems and the airstrip is cut out of the jungle.' 'It has the greatest rock art in Australia but you would never expect it because it's in the middle of nowhere - surrounded by incredible history.' 'It's like a documentary of the Amurdak people who inhabited the land for over 50,000 years - its rock art depicting their everyday lives - it blew me away.' The rock art is like a documentary depicting the everyday lives of the Amurdak people who inhabited the land for over 50,000 years . Adams (pictured) and Bizzell could not believe the incredible amount of rock art at Mount Borradaile, Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory . Favourite city: Melbourne, Victoria . Despite being a Brisbane boy, Bizzell has lived in Victoria's capital city for 12 years and wouldn't have it any other way. 'It's got everything you could want - culture, art, sport, coffee which I  never drank until I moved here and a mate told me I had to start drinking it,' he said. 'There's always something happening every weekend. I even like the weather - Jen doesn't though she likes it warmer.'

"After working flat out for a long period, I was desperate for a holiday. When a friend suggested going to Bali, I jumped at the chance. I had stopped off there for two days a year ago on my way back to Britain from a tour of Australia and New Zealand and fell in love with the place. This time I could look forward to 12 days of sun, sea and exercise. Staying fit is really important to me – it helps me cope with stress and also with my weight. As a chef and owner of restaurants such as The Fat Duck, I obviously spend the greater part of my life with food, mostly tasting it, so extra pounds can easily creep on. Our first stop was Como Shambhala, a wellness retreat hidden away in the hills outside the town of Ubud. The setting is incredibly beautiful – parts of it are like something out of The Lord Of The Rings, with huge mossy banks underneath soaring trees where you relax, sleep or read. Heston Blumenthal rediscovers meditation in the tranquil setting of Como Shambhala Retreat  in Ubud, Bali . Daybeds looks out onto the dramatic rainforest relaxation haven of Como Shambhala Retreat . For the first time in my life, I tried a juice detox. It was amazing. After the initial shock, I never felt hungry. I had vegetable juice five times a day and vegetable broth in the evening – and lost 8lb in four days. The juices were all freshly made and so imaginative. The various concoctions were sharp, with just a hint of sweetness. I did my exercises in the gym every day, had some great massages and also started meditating once again. I had tried meditation before a couple of times, but wasn’t quite sure how to find time in the day for it or whether I really had the patience needed. But this was more mindful meditation, which you can do wherever you are. I liked practising it down the hillside near the water where I could hear the river and the birds singing. It was about being in the moment and I really loved it. After four days there, we moved on to the Alila Uluwatu, an amazing clifftop resort on Bali’s south coast. The views were spectacular. The Alila Uluwatu has a really good gym which I used every day, and I did yoga every morning as well as enjoying the occasional massage. After my juice detox at Como Shambhala, now it was time to tuck into some Balinese specialities, such as a delicious roast suckling pig. The views Alila Uluwatu are spectacular - this is a three-bedroom cliffside villa at the clifftop resort . The surface of the water runs into the sky in this at Alila Villas Uluwatu at the southern tip of South Kuta . Balinese food is spicy but delicate, and I loved the combination of fragrance and heat you get in the dishes, especially in sambals and salads, where chefs combined ingredients including lemongrass, chilli and mango. By now I was seriously into relaxation mode as we had our own villa with a pool … and a butler called Ruri. Most of the time Ruri was marvellously inconspicuous, but I only had to think I’d like a beer or a juice, and suddenly there he was. We also found time for sightseeing. One thing that shouldn’t be missed is Pura Luhur Uluwatu, a temple built in the 11th Century to keep evil spirits away from Bali. The 11th century-built Pura Luhur Uluwatu Temple, created to warn off evil spirits, is a must-see . We then moved up the coast to another villa, this time on the beach at Alila Soori. We arrived in the evening – by the way, in Bali it always seems to take two hours to reach your destination – and staff presented us with garlands which they then hung around our necks. The garlands were made from tuberose – and I have never smelled anything so beautiful. These plants grow everywhere in Bali. As I’m like a baby in that I have to taste everything, I immediately bit into the petals to see what they were like. There was absolutely no bitterness at all, so I’m determined to use them in a dish soon. To maintain my fitness regime, I ran on the black volcanic sand at Alila Soori. In a certain light it looked as if diamonds were sparkling in it. An ocean pool villa at Alila Villas Soori, which is surrounded by UNESCO World Heritage Listed rice fields . The black volcanic sands near Alila Soori looks as if diamonds are sparkling in in, in a certain light . One day I headed to the beach for a different mission – to cook some chicken. The hotel chef joined me and first we made a fire pit with coconut tiles (these are used in the local village for roofs and can get very hot but retain the heat), then cooked the chicken which had been marinated and wrapped in banana leaves. When it was ready, we ate it on the beach. It was one of the most memorable things I tasted there. Best of all, another of the chefs gave me his grandmother’s recipe for a sambal which I will use in Britain. This was one of the best and most relaxing holidays I’ve ever had. Would I go back? In a flash. Heston cooks chicken in a fire pit heated with coconut tiles, which locals use for their roofs .

"The first motorbikes to be made by the legendary Brough Superior marque in over 70 years are set to be rolled out onto British roads. A limited production run of 300 Brough Superior SS100 machines that were made between 1925 and 1940 is nearing completion after a British businessman bought the rights to the company name. Mark Upham, of Taunton, Somerset has already secured dozens of orders for the modern-day version of the vintage SS100 bikes that were described as the 'Rolls Royce' of motorcycles and were the fastest machines in the world. A limited production run of 300 Brough Superior SS100 machines (pictured) that were made between 1925 and 1940 is nearing completion . The original SS100 bikes (pictured) were described as the 'Rolls Royce' of motorcycles and were the fastest road-going machines in the world . TE Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, is pictured on one of his Brough Superiors talking to manufacturer George Brough . Playwright George Bernard Shaw owned one the motorbikes as did TE Lawrence - Lawrence of Arabia - who was killed after crashing one near his home in Dorset in 1935. Only 3,000 SS100s were made before the outbreak of war ground production to a halt. Back then they were such a luxury item that only the very wealthy could afford one. Today, a fully-restored period SS100 can sell for upwards of £300,000. Mr Upham's new gleaming models will be sold for £50,000 each from next year to mark the 90th anniversary of the launch of the SS100. Mark Upham's new gleaming models will be sold for £50,000 each from next year to mark the 90th anniversary of the launch of the SS100 . While they look almost identical to the classic Brough bikes and have the same 'saddle' petrol tank and speedo, they are made using high-tech components such as aluminium-magnesium and titanium. Other modern-day advantages the new bikes have are a four-disc ceramic brake system and a 1,000cc V-twin engine which can deliver 140bhp. Mr Upham, 57, said he wanted to carry on manufacturing the SS100s as he believes it is what the late George Brough would have wanted. Bough Superior SS100 motorbikes were made by George Brough in his 'Brough Superior' works on Haydn Road in Nottingham, from 1925 to 1940. Dubbed the 'Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles', around 3,050 were made before the outbreak of war ground production to a halt. Back then, they were such a luxury item that only the very wealthy could afford one. It is understood that around a third of those made still exist today. The motorbikes were made by George Brough (pictured) in his 'Brough Superior' works on Haydn Road in Nottingham in the 1920s and 1930s . Brough Superior motorcycles were produced using British-made parts and were coveted by the rich and famous, including playright George Bernard Shaw. TE Lawrence, known as Lawrence of Arabia, owned seven of the motorcycles and died after crashing one in Dorset in 1935. George Brough named his company Brough Superior to out-do his father who was also a motorcycle manufacturer. Each motorcycle was assembled twice. It was put together first to ensure all the components fitted properly before it was taken apart, repainted and individually styled. Only then would it be reassembled before being test driven and then personally certified by George Brough. TE Lawrence, known as Lawrence of Arabia, owned seven of the motorcycles and died after crashing one in Dorset in 1935 . The SS100 model would be tested at 100mph or more before being driven and if it did not meet specifications, would be returned to the workshop. At the time, they were the most expensive road-going motorbikes in the world with 1920s and 30s prices ranging from £130 to £180. Today, a fully-restored period SS100 can sell for upwards of £300,000. He said: 'George Brough made 3,000 SS100s over 20 years until 1940 and had to stop because of the war. Brough Superior did made the crankshaft for the engine in the Spitfire during the war. 'After the war he wanted to get back into manufacturing but he was becoming an older man and there was also a lot more competition around from bikes like Vincent. 'Next year will mark the 90th anniversary of the launch of the SS100 and our idea is to emulate the past. 'George Brough's dream was to create an SS100 with its own bespoke engine which is what we have achieved. Other modern-day advantages the new bikes have are a four-disc ceramic brake system and a 1,000cc V-twin engine which can deliver a whopping 140bhp . Mr Upham, 57, said he wanted to carry on manufacturing the SS100s as he believes it is what the late George Brough would have wanted . 'It is designed as a tribute to the most famous Brough Superior model in the company's illustrious history, replete with technical innovations and high-tech components. 'We have respected Brough's heritage by making an all-new motorcycle without any compromises in terms of technical components or design.' George Brough named his company Brough Superior to out-do his father who was also a motorcycle manufacturer. He produced his custom-made machines out of a factory in Nottingham using British-made parts. Mr Upham is manufacturing the new bikes out of a factory in Toulouse in France and has sourced parts from all over Europe and China.

Mr Upham is manufacturing the new bikes out of a factory in Toulouse in France and has sourced parts from all over Europe and China . He said: 'We have used high quality materials in the creation of a true bespoke motorcycle, just as George Brough made in the past. 'We launched a prototype bike at the Milan Motorshow last year and got a really good response. We have taken 35 orders already just for the UK and many more from customers across Europe. 'I think people would love to see these bikes back on British roads again.' At £50,000, a new SS100 is slightly cheaper than some top-of-the-range Japanese superbikes. Mr Upham, a former dealer of Triumph and Ducati motorbikes, said manufacuring the new SS100s was a long-term profit and it wouldn't be until at least three years before Brough Superior Motorcycles will turn a profit on them.","Brough Superior SS100 motorbikes originally made between 1925 and 1940 .

"We show a strong bias toward people of the same ethnicity when it comes to romance . Online dating sites are now an established way for modern singles to find love, providing a vast pool of other hopeful romantics from all walks of life. And despite the fact that nearly all users reported being in favour of inter-race relationships, users of at least one site showed a strong bias toward people of the same ethnicity as themselves when it came to responding to potential matches. And interestingly it is women who show this preference most strongly, showing more preference for a partner of their own race than men do. Co founder and chief executive of OkCupid Christian Rudder is quick to point out that this does not mean that the dating sites users are ‘racist’ in the traditional sense of the word. ‘An individual can’t really control who turns them on. I do think the fact that race is a sexual factor for so many and in such a consistent way, raises deeper questions.’ The only exceptions to this trend are black men who tend to favour Latin American women, and both Asian and Latin American women, who showed a preference for white men over men of their own ethnicity. The results, which come from data collected from over three million OkCupid members, also confirm some age-old stereotypes. While women search for a partner around their own age, men are in the market for a 21-year-old woman, however old they are. The data also revealed how ultimately predicable our romantic choices are. Chief executive of OkCupid Christian Rudder is quick to point out that this does not mean that the dating sites users are ‘racist’ in the traditional sense of the word . While we may like to believe that how we choose a partner down to the nuances of our personality and the deepest darkest aspects of what makes us unique, the survey shows that in fact our romantic choices can be fairly accurately predicted using some depressingly mundane questions. Answers to such scintillating questions like 'do you like scary movies?' and 'have you ever travelled alone to another country?' were the same for over three quarters of the matched couples on OkCupid, suggesting that far from being written in the stars, romantic success is more down to day-to-day compatibility.","People show a preference for people of the same ethnicity .
