"An Islamic extremist group called Dawlat al-Islam has reportedly claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings of three teenagers who went missing from settlements on the West Bank on Friday. The organization, linked to ISIS, distributed pamphlets about the kidnappings in Hebron, Haaretz reported. Israel security services are investigating the claims. ISIS are the group of bloody-thirsty jihadists behind this week's Iraq insurgency. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for the missing teenagers, who are also feared kidnapped by Palestinian militants. Scroll down for video .

An extremist group linked to the jihadists has claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings of three teens in Israel . Israeli soldiers deploy near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday. Israeli soldiers searched the West Bank on Friday for three missing teenagers from nearby settlements, one of them a U.S. citizen, amid fears Palestinian militants abducted them, authorities said . Authorities . offered little detail, with local media only reporting the hitchhiking . teenagers left their Yeshiva, or religious seminary, on Thursday night . and had not been seen since. Soldiers near Hebron combed the rocky hills . of the West Bank searching for them on Friday. The disappearances come after the formation of a Palestinian unity government following . the collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks. Two Israeli defense officials said authorities believed the teens likely were kidnapped by Palestinian militants, without elaborating. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to brief journalists. 'The main mission is to ensure their return,' said Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz, a military spokesman. Tsuri Tsuf, a spokesman for a settlement where one of the teens is from, told Israel's Channel 10 television that his community was 'greatly worried' and gathered to pray for the safety of the youths. Authorities found a burned-out car during their search that investigators were examining. Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency initially imposed a gag order on Friday morning blocking local media from reporting on the incident. Later, an official familiar with the investigation said that one of the teens was an American and that Israeli authorities notified U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to publicly brief journalists. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the U.S. Department of State. The three teens are from settlements in the West Bank, territory Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and that Palestinians are demanding as part of their future state along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. A burnt car which is reportedly connected to the disappearance of three teenagers is taken away near the West Bank city of Hebron on Friday . If Palestinians abducted the teens, it would be the first serious incident to challenge relations with Israel since the formation of a Palestinian unity government earlier this month, led by President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party and backed by the Islamic militant group Hamas. The West and Israel consider Hamas a terror group because of its deadly attacks targeting civilians. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Abbas to talk about the missing teenagers and likely will call Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as well, a senior State Department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Netanyahu told the teens' families that Israel is 'making every effort' to find them, his office said in a statement. He earlier said the Palestinian Authority is responsible for the teens' safety. Adnan Demeiri, spokesman of the Palestinian security services, dismissed Netanyahu's claims, saying the teens' disappearance happened in an area under Israeli security protection. Hamas frequently calls for the abduction of Israelis and militants have kidnapped Israelis in the past. The Israeli military has said it has foiled multiple Palestinian kidnapping attempts in recent years and warns soldiers and civilians not to accept rides from strangers. Despite the warnings, hitchhiking remains common in Israel.

"It may sound like the plot from a desperate Hollywood reboot - but in reality it's far more chilling. The U.S. Navy has developed a state-of-the-art underwater spying machine designed to look and act like a shark - so that it can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions undetected. The drone is five feet long, weighs almost 100lbs and can dive as deep as 300ft while gathering data. Scroll down for video . Drone shark: The GhostSwimmer can dive to 300ft while recording data and transmitting it in real time . As well as resembling a shark the device swims like one, flipping its tail back and forth to navigate waters. The Navy calls it the latest in a series of 'science-fiction-turned-reality' projects to come out of its Silent NEMO experiments for developing unmanned biomimetic vehicles as an underwater fleet, CBS News reports. The word biomimetic refers to human-made devices mimicking biology - in this case the ocean's most feared predator. The autonomous drone is called GhostSwimmer - and the US military hope it will boost the Navy's underwater capability. State-of-the-art: The Navy calls it the latest in a series of 'science-fiction-turned-reality' projects to come out of its Silent NEMO experiments . Michael Rufo, director of the Advanced Systems Group at Boston Engineering that designed GhostSwimmer, said: 'It swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth. 'GhostSwimmer will allow the Navy to have success during more types of missions while keeping divers and sailors safe.' When it's not hovering just below the surface of the water, the drone can dive to great depths while gathering data on tides, currents, wakes and weather conditions. The machine is able to operate without being controlled - but can also be connected to a laptop by a 500ft tether and be driven from on board a vessel. By doing this, any data collected can be transmitted in real time. It is believed the technology could also replace the bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions the Navy trains to recover equipment and spot underwater mines.

"Two patients have died after contracting a hospital infection in an outbreak that has hit another 14 people. Edinburgh Royal Infirmary is now investigating a ‘cluster’ of cases of deadly Clostridium difficile, it was confirmed last night. It comes only weeks after the damning inquiry into the Vale of Leven hospital outbreak, which killed 34. Edinburgh Royal Infirmary is now investigating a ‘cluster’ of cases of deadly Clostridium difficile, it was confirmed last night . The two patients who died were killed by underlying conditions, NHS Lothian said, but tested positive for the C.diff bug. The 14 patients still fighting it have been placed in isolation and infection control procedures are being followed. Melanie Johnson, executive nurse director at NHS Lothian, said: ‘We have identified a cluster of C.diff at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases. ‘As is usual practice, we isolate symptomatic patients, emphasise the importance of infection control precautions and undertake additional cleaning. We always act as if cases are linked and implement action to prevent cross-transmission. ‘Our robust surveillance procedures meant that we were able to identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action.’ C.diff is a bacterium found naturally in the gut which does not cause any problems in healthy people. But antibiotics used to treat hospital patients can disrupt the balance of ‘good’ bacteria, causing severe diarrhoea and fever. Elderly and frail patients are most at risk of infection and the most likely to die, with the bug often named as a contributory factor on their death certificates. It comes only weeks after the damning inquiry into an outbreak at the Vale of Leven hospital (pictured in 2008), in which 34 people died . Last month, a report found at least 34 patients at Vale of Leven hospital in Dunbartonshire died as a result of ‘systemic failures’ by hospital managers. Doctors failed to notice the infection tearing through the wards for five months, while the hospital’s infection control doctor had not been there for more than a year. The outbreak in 2007 and 2008 infected 143 vulnerable patients, which victims described as ‘a shame on the conscience of the NHS’. Cases of C.diff have fallen in recent years. Figures also show doctors are prescribing fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are associated with a higher risk of C.diff. Edinburgh Royal Infirmary had seen the patients infected over six weeks in five different wards. NHS Lothian said all affected patients in wards and their relatives had been told about the infection. The affected wards at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary remain open. Meanwhile, a ward at the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary has been shut temporarily due to an outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea. Ward 16 has been closed to new admissions, transfers and routine visiting, NHS Dumfries and Galloway confirmed.","Edinburgh Royal Infirmary probing 'cluster' of cases of Clostridium difficile .

"Lewis Macleod insisted on Friday he would have been happy to stay at Rangers and only left for Brentford when it became clear the club weren’t trying to keep him. The midfielder completed his cut-price £850,000 move last weekend as the crisis-hit Ibrox outfit cashed in on their prize asset. Macleod, 20, has committed to the London side until 2018 but still had two-and-a-half years left on his deal in Govan and had been valued at more than double the fee he was sold for. With the Light Blues short of money and getting by on loans, they accepted the first bid that came in – and that told Macleod it was time to move on. Lewis Macleod puts pen to paper after agreeing to join Championship side Brentford from Rangers . ‘When you’re a Rangers fan, it’s hard to let go and I’ve never experienced anything else in football up to now,’ he said. ‘I definitely wasn’t eager to get out the door but when the opportunity came, with everything that was happening outside football at the club, I leant towards moving away. ‘It all happened very quickly. If things had maybe happened differently off the pitch with regards to the club trying to keep me when someone came in, I might have stayed. I didn’t have much time to process it but it’s done now and I’m looking forward to a different challenge.’ Macleod is adamant on-field results didn’t influence his decision, despite Rangers lagging 13 points behind Hearts and struggling in the fight to win promotion. The 20-year-old midfielder said he was not eager to leave his boyhood club . ‘After a couple of defeats it was maybe the case that realistically we were starting to look more at the play-offs. Obviously you go out to win every game but we knew a couple of months ago it was going to be hard to win the league. ‘Hopefully Rangers get to the play-offs at least. If I’d still been there, they would have been good games for me to play in so none of that was a factor in trying to get out. Nothing on the playing side made me want to move but a different opportunity came up.’ Macleod is looking forward to life in the English Championship with promotion-chasing Brentford - albeit a hamstring injury has ruled him out of Saturday's visit of Rotherham - but admitted he’s already pining for a return to Rangers later in his career. ‘It’s exciting to be starting out with a new team but the surroundings here are nothing compared to Ibrox. You realise how massive Rangers are when you go elsewhere but there’s still a good atmosphere at Griffin Park. Macleod claimed the Ibrox club did not try and keep him and that made his mind up to leave . ‘I’ll be thinking about Rangers this weekend and hopefully they can get a win at Alloa. I looked out for their score last week as well when our match finished and I was pleased they beat Dumbarton. ‘I’m not really thinking about what I’ve walked away from. I’m just trying to look forward instead and it will be good to get started with Brentford when I’m fit again. ‘I’d love to go back to Rangers later in my career. The most disappointing thing about leaving is the way I went. I’ve been injured so I wasn’t able to play my last game knowing that would be the case and say goodbye to the fans. ‘I’d obviously like to be welcomed back at some point but I understand why some supporters might not appreciate my reasons for going. Macleod boards the Rangers team bus before travelling to Dumfries in December . ‘Whenever I’m back up in Glasgow, I’ll try to get along to a few of the games. But I’d love to return to play for the club at some point, too, however many years down the line that is.’ Everton and Burnley were among Macleod’s suitors and would likely have paid more money. But the Bees moved first and, while Macleod couldn’t control what Rangers received, he was keen to join them because of how quickly opportunities to play might arise. Under Mark Warburton and No2 David Weir, Brentford won automatic promotion from League One last season and are well placed to challenge for a second consecutive rise. They are keen for Macleod to play an integral part. ‘The one thing I’ve always said is if I was ever to leave Rangers, I wouldn’t go somewhere where I wouldn’t really play. I wanted to give myself the best chance of getting games and Brentford seemed the right option. Macleod kisses the Rangers badge, and admits he would love to return to the club one day . ‘The club have come really far just this season alone and won a lot of games. They’ve got a new stadium to move into in two years as well and everything is going in the right direction. ‘I’m hoping to improve with playing at a higher level. That’s one of the main reasons I left Rangers. Working under the new manager and Davie, a lot of analysis goes on behind the scenes. 'It’s good for a young player to come in and see a different way of doing things. ‘Although we lost to Brighton last Saturday the boys were unlucky. I feel I can fit into the way they play.’ Macleod netted eight goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Rangers before signing for Brentford . Macleod’s injury is short-term but he won’t rush back because he wants to be in the best condition possible to do himself justice. His lay-off will also give him time to adapt to new surroundings he admits seem strange having been with Rangers since he was 10. ‘I’m not sure when I’m going to be back playing. It’s the type of injury that can take a bit of time to heal. But with me just getting started, I don’t want to rush back and get injured again. ‘Being about a different team will be weird but everyone’s welcomed me with open arms. That makes things a lot easier.’","Lewis Macleod left Rangers for Championship play-off hopefuls Brentford .

"Colorado's top law enforcement official promises to vigorously defend the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states. The two states filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent Colorado from enforcing the measure known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012 and allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21. The complaint says the measure runs afoul of federal law and therefore violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal laws trump state laws. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the lawsuit was without merit. Scroll down for video . Opposed: Jon Bruning, attorney general for Nebraska, has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare marijuana unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states like Nebraska and Oklahoma . 'Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,' he said. 'However, it appears the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado.' The lawsuit says Colorado marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws. 'This contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state,' Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said at a news conference in Lincoln. 'While Colorado reaps millions from the sale of pot, Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost.' Colorado has raised more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, which has been sold in stores since January. The lawsuit says the sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems. Police are spending more time and money making arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, seizing drugs and handling other problems related to Colorado pot. Bruning, a Republican, blamed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado. In a policy statement last year, the U.S. Justice Department noted it doesn't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law. It laid out eight federal law enforcement priorities that states need to protect if they want to authorize 'marijuana-related conduct.' They include keeping marijuana in-state — something Oklahoma and Nebraska says Colorado has failed to do. The suit doesn't contain statistics to support the claim. Law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug. But there's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado. The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area wrote in a recent report that the amount of Colorado pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013. The weed was headed for at least 40 different states. Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Mark Overman, in western Nebraska, said Colorado marijuana is extra potent, making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there. 'I think this is overdue, and I think other states should jump on board,' Overman said of the lawsuit. 'I'm very frustrated. I take an oath of office, as does every other police officer in this country. I don't just get to pick and choose which laws I enforce.' Legal: Marijuana is legal for recreational use in Colorado to the chagrin of neighboring states who fear the drug may trickle into their territory . Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told The Denver Post he spoke with Nebraska and Oklahoma officials about their concerns. 'I'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are,' he said. Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case or if it will even accept it. 'Right now, these regulations exist in legal no-man's-land,' said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor. 'It's incredibly unusual for a state to be suing another state. (The lawsuit) certainly was a surprise to me given the movement at the federal level, which seems to be in favor of allowing states to experiment.' It was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action. Attorneys general in Utah and New Mexico said they had no immediate plans to join the suit. Brian Vicente, a Colorado attorney and legalization advocate who wrote Amendment 64, said the challenge is ""political grandstanding"" without merit. He said 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws, and none have been overturned because of federal law. 'I think it shows they are on the wrong side of history,' Vicente said. 'Colorado voters passed this measure, and more and more states are passing these laws. If the attorney general has a problem with how federal laws are being enforced he should bring that up with the U.S. attorney.'","Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states .

"A couple who refused to reveal how their three-month-old son sustained 'horrific' injuries have been condemned by a judge for their possible 'conspiracy of silence' which allowed them to avoid jail. Tracy McKenzie of Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, and her former partner Scott Colman of Bishop Auckland were both handed eight-month suspended sentences despite admitting child cruelty against their son Harper. Burnley Crown Court heard how the baby was left with multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs and also suffered multiple brain and retinal haemorrhages. Little Harper was also only admitted to hospital five days after the injuries emerged. Scott Colman, 30, (pictured left in wheelchair) and Tracy McKenzie (pictured far right in right picture) were condemned for their possible 'conspiracy of silence' after failing to reveal how their son was left with 'horrific' injuries . But neither parents would reveal  what happened to the  boy, despite the court being told the injuries were consistent with 'shaking, twisting, bending and hitting'. Instead, both defendants pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis that neither of them had sought medical assistance for Harper's head injury. The court was told how 30-year-old Colman even tried to suggest that the injuries were inflicted by Harper's twin while they were playfully 'flicking each other with their hands'. Handing them an eight-month jail term suspended for two years, Judge Woolson said he had been 'unimpressed' by the couple's silence. But he said he was only able to sentence the pair on the basis they had failed to obtain medical help. He said: 'I am unimpressed by the silence over whichever of you knows what has happened. It may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you, both of who knows what has happened. 'The injuries were appalling and inflicted over five days. I have to sentence on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital.' The court heard that McKenzie, 41, had claimed she had come home from work on December 11, 2012 and seen a bruise on the child's forehead. The court heard the baby had also been 'generally lethargic' and vomiting. He had also not wet his nappy in the days before he was admitted to hospital. McKenzie covered her head after she left Burnley Crown Court today . Five days later, on December 16, Colman - said to be the carer of the children - called NHS Direct and explained his son's symptoms. Harper was then taken to hospital by ambulance, where doctors noticed the bruising to his head, the court was told. Prosecutor Robert Smith said: 'The doctor advised he needed to be placed on a drip. 'A senior doctor immediately noticed something was wrong, significant bruising to the left side of the temple and asked how it was obtained, he described a ""vague"" explanation, something about the twins banging heads.' A further CT scan showed fractures to each side of Harper's skull and acute haemorrhages. Medics also detected a collection of bruises. A full skeletal survey further showed multiple skull fractures, fractures to the spine and five rib fractures. There were also back and ankle injuries, as well as haemorrhages behind the eye, the court heard. During the case, it emerged that Harper's skull injuries were in keeping with being hit against a flat surface or something striking his head. Meanwhile, the hemorrhages were in keeping with the baby being shaken, while the fractured ribs could have been caused from forceable compression to his chest, the court was told. The spinal injuries were consistent with the child being bent or allowed to fall heavily, experts said. Mr Smith said that doctors had unanimously agreed that the injuries were not accidental and would have caused the baby 'such pain and discomfort' that the parents, 'should have known and intervened if they had known the perpetrator'. Mr Smith added: 'Both were arrested and interviewed and gave entirely implausible evidence. Scott Colman said he had slipped on the ice whilst holding Harper.' The court heard that Colman suggested Harper and his twin could have 'headbutted' one another while playing. He further suggested that he had rolled out of the Moses basket, but medical experts dismissed the claims. During the hearing, Philip Parry said that McKenzie had assisted the prosecution in becoming a witness after pleading during her trial. In her basis of plea, the prosecutor Robert Smith told the court that McKenzie had said she had not been aware of the underlying injuries but accepted that she should have sought medical assistance after the bruising had occurred. Colman, 30, had previously denied child neglect but admitted the charge before standing trial. Burnley Crown Court heard how Harper was not taken to hospital until five days after his injuries were noticed. Both parents admitted child neglect for failing to seek medical attention . For Colman, Philip Holden said: 'Regrettably we will never know who caused these injuries, not to the criminal standards. There is no doubt that this is an extremely sad case.' He argued that the duo, who are now separated, should be given the same distinction in sentencing, adding that the child had made 'a good recovery'. In passing sentence Judge Woolman said that their basis of plea had been the failure to take the child to hospital. He said: 'In the five days or so leading up to admission at A&E it must have been obvious that the child was severely unwell. 'It is obvious to any decent person that something urgent needed to be done. Having said that I have to be true to the basis of plea in that you entered, namely that you failed to take the child to hospital. 'I am and I should make it clear that I am unimpressed by the silence by which one of knows what happens, it may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you and both of you know what happened. 'I can only sentence you on what you have entered and what can be proved. 'The injuries were appalling, inflicted over a period of say five days but I have to sentence you on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital. 'The sentence of imprisonment which this case justifies is in months and not years. I am prepared to suspend, the only reason is to be honest with the basis of plea.'","Baby Harper left with multiple fractures and severe brain haemorrhages .

"Hospital patients are claiming they were left freezing on a cold dialysis ward for two weeks after a boiler broke down. Pensioner Reg Hansell said he and fellow kidney patients had been forced to wrap up in hats and scarves to keep warm after suffering 'unacceptable' temperatures in the Thomas Becket Unit at Kent and Canterbury Hospital. The 70-year-old said up to 40 patients were encouraged to bring in extra duvets and blankets to ward against the cold, which dropped to 15C, and that staff were left shivering when they were told they could not wear extra layers. Pensioner Reg Hansell was forced to wrap on the freezing ward while having dialysis at Kent and Canterbury Hospital because of a boiler breakdown . Mr Hansell, a former council leader, was diagnosed with kidney failure four weeks ago and has dialysis treatment three times a week. He said: 'Dialysis is not a pleasant experience and to endure the cold for four hours at a time in those conditions was uncomfortable to say the least. 'Some of the patients who come in for dialysis are quite frail and it was tortuous for them because it was freezing. Visitors complained about it too. 'The hospital claims the ward was kept at 22 degrees but that's rubbish. My house is kept at that temperature so I know what it feels like and it was definitely much colder - more like 15 degrees. 'My nose was cold and I even considered wearing a balaclava. Some patients even brought in duvets. 'I don't blame the nurses, who were cold themselves and had to give out extra blankets and suggested we bring in our own fleeces. Finbarr Murray, director of Kent and Canterbury Hospital Trust's Estates and Facilities, said the ward is now back to its usual temperature . 'I felt awful for them, they started to wear cardigans but were told they couldn't wear them, I think because of germs.' Mr, Hansell, a retired engineer and ex-leader of Dover District Council, has now received an apology from the ward manager Lesley Alexander this week. The hospital has confirmed the temperature is  back to normal but bosses refused to accept the temperature had dropped lower than 20C. Finbarr Murray, director of the Hospital Trust's Estates and Facilities, said: 'We are sorry that our patients in the Thomas Becket Unit at Kent and Canterbury Hospital have been inconvenienced by one of the two heaters serving the unit becoming faulty. 'Renal patients require a higher room temperature whilst undergoing dialysis for four to five hours, three times a week.

'Our staff have been helping our patients to keep warm during their dialysis with the help of additional blankets for a few days whilst alternative heating was arranged. 'A second boiler has continued to be operational during this time maintaining a temperature of at least 22 degrees with the assistance of portable electric heaters, increasing the temperature of the underfloor heating and turning off of the cold airflow system. 'Our Building Management System sounds an alarm if the temperature drops to 20 degrees or below, which has not happened during this time. We keep spare parts for all our critical equipment; however parts for these boilers must be fitted by a specialist Gas Safe registered engineer which has been the cause of this delay. 'The ward is now back to its usual temperature. We have not received any formal complaint regarding this.' But Mr Hansell, who used to manufacture boilers, claimed the hospital did not have the necessary spares which was why patients had to suffer the cold conditions for two weeks. 'That's no way to run a hospital,' he added. 'The question now is will the hospital buy spares for the next time this happens?.'","Reg Hansell had been undergoing dialysis at Kent and Canterbury Hospital .

He was taken in for a mental health evaluation, at which point police say he was found to be under the influence of drugs, likely PCP. Officers had to restrain Higgs as he was transported back to the station. Chitwood said Higgs has a nasty criminal record dating back to 2000. Prior infractions include, according to Philly.com, terroristic threats, assault and possessing controlled substances.

"Tyler Vallance, 21, has been jailed for nine years for killing his 12-week-old daughter Isabella (pictured) A father has been jailed for nine years for killing his 12-week old baby after shaking her so violently that she suffered catastrophic brain injuries. Tyler Vallance, 21, described as a 'violent and unpredictable man', left his daughter Isabella 'effectively dead' after carrying out the 'extremely violent assault' in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire in November 2012. The court heard how Vallance twisted Isabella's legs in such a violent way that she sustained fractures to both, as well as eight broken ribs. He then gripped and shook her, causing her to lose consciousness while still in his arms. The little girl -  who had successfully overcome a premature birth at 34 weeks - died five days later. Vallance had previously pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his daughter Isabella. Today, at Worcester Crown Court, he was also sentenced to 18 months to run concurrently after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm in an earlier attack on Isabella months earlier. The child's mother Jessica Wiggins, 20, from Redditch, was also sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for 12 months. She was convicted of allowing Isabella's death at the hands of her ex-partner. Sentencing, Judge Juckes said Vallance was a 'violent and unpredictable' man, who had issues with anger management and ADHD, for which he took medication. Addressing the defendant, he said: 'What undoubtedly, Tyler, you had done in that moment was to twist Isabella's legs in such a way so violently as to fracture the left femur and right tibia, gripping and shaking her so violently you caused catastrophic brain injury so that bleeding began and led to her very quickly losing consciousness. 'It was an extremely violent assault, from which she never recovered.' He added that Vallance 'must have been aware how badly' he hurt his daughter. During the hearing, the court heard how Isabella's injuries were so serious that the first paramedic on the scene described her as looking 'completely dead and lifeless'. The court heard how Vallance also 'knew immediately' what he had to his daughter, but offered no indication as to what had happened. It was only after Isabella's death that a post mortem discovered the tell-tale internal injuries he had inflicted on the vulnerable baby on that occasion. He later sought to blame Wiggins' parents for the initial attack, the court was told. The little girl (pictured left and right) was left with catastrophic brain injuries, eight broken ribs and fractures in both legs following the 'violent' assault at the house in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire . Judge Juckes said Isabella was 'a baby who had been fine, and in many ways thriving' but had 'suddenly collapsed'. The judge praised the medical care at both the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, and later Birmingham Children's Hospital as swift and professional. But he said that, from the moment of Vallance's violent outburst, his daughter had been left 'effectively dead' and nothing could be done to save her. Life support for the little girl was withdrawn and she died five days later. The judge added that violent assault was the result of a 'sudden extreme loss of temper', but whether born of 'anger or exasperation' there was still intent to cause harm. Judge Juckes also said he accepted that Wiggins, who the court heard raised her own siblings, was 'a good mother'. He accepted evidence in court from both social and healthcare workers that she was 'skilled' and competent. Isabella's mother Jessica Wiggins (pictured with Isabella) was also handed a nine-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, for allowing the death of her daughter . But he said he could not square the 'truly remarkable imbalance' of her fine ability as a mother with her apparent failure to share concerns about Vallance with the hospital doctors and police. It was only when a friend in whom Wiggins had confided threatened to tell police about her suspicion Vallance had carried out the fatal attack, that she 'hinted' her fears to police, the court heard. Judge Juckes told Wiggins: 'At the heart of what is worse is what you did throughout what followed (the fatal assault). You lied to doctors and police about what you knew or suspected.' Vallance, who also has a mild form of Tourette's, had sat impassively as the judge spoke. As his sentence was passed down he started chewing the inside of his mouth and looked across at Wiggins. Yesterday in court, Vallance was described by the prosecution as a manipulative man who had threatened Wiggins with suicide if she ever left him. The court heard Vallance (pictured left and right), who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, 'knew immediately' what he had done to his daughter but did not reveal any information to paramedics or police . In evidence, the court heard how he had attacked her in public on at least two occasions, once grabbing her throat and hair in front of friends. QC for the Crown Christopher Hotton said Vallance 'had little or no part' in the care of his baby girl, adding 'it is clear Jessica Wiggins did not trust Tyler Vallance with the care of Isabella'. He spoke of a text Wiggins had sent a friend in which she described an incident at the family home where Vallance had nearly accidentally struck his daughter. Mr Hotton said the young couple's relationship was stormy and they had once broken up, before being reconciled when Wiggins learned she was pregnant with Isabella. The judge said it seemed clear Isabella 'did not take to her father'. He also made it clear that health and social workers, as well as Vallance's relatives, had done everything to offer support to the young family. He added that it was an aggravating factor that the attack happened 'in spite of and in the face of' that assistance. Neighbours reported hearing a row in the family home on the morning of the fatal assault. A later one-second phone call made to 999 from Wiggins' phone was never explained by either parent. tje coirt was told. It was an hour-and-a-half after that phone call that Wiggins rang for an ambulance, saying her baby had suddenly collapsed. The judge accepted from hearing the call's recording, she was 'plainly a mother in real distress'. Judge Juckes said a letter of apology from Vallance expressed his 'sense of loss', but needed to be weighed against another letter he had written to a female girlfriend while in prison in which he had attempted to shift the blame for the killing onto others. Vallance was convicted in August last year of sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl, and of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to six months in custody.","Tyler Vallance, 21, left his daughter 'effectively dead' after violent attack .

"Mothers of serving soldiers have posed for a raunchy calendar to raise money for military charities. The fundraiser was the brainchild of Karen Roper, from Stockton-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, whose 18-year-old son is in the Army. She managed to convince fellow army mothers to take part - with some being more daring than others.

Serious posing: While most of the women took their photograph themselves, others seem to have gone down the professional route like Miss September . All of the mothers got involved following an appeal from Karen via Facebook and then submitted selifies or more professionally posed pictures. The woman are in various states of undress in the calendar, which will hit shelves by the end of next week. Some chose to go for a good-humoured shot, donning army camouflage, face paint and pulling funny faces - while others pout provocatively into the lens with little preserving their modesty. Money raised will go to two charities, Soldiers Off The Streets, which helps homeless ex-servicemen, and Talking2Minds, which helps veterans dealing with PTSD.

"A review of the evidence used to convict Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing has confirmed beyond doubt he was responsible for the killings, it has been claimed. Sources close to the review, carried out by the Crown Office and Police Scotland, have said there is 'not a shred of evidence' to support suggestions he was wrongly convicted. The Libyan intelligence officer was convicted in 2001 for killing 270 people in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but more than two decades on, there are lingering suspicions he was a scapegoat used to cover up the involvement of other Middle Eastern countries. Scroll down for video . Convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi pictured in bed in 2011 as he was dying of  cancer . Here Megrahi is pictured being escorted by security officers through Tripoli in 1992. A new review of the case against him has found there is not a 'shred of evidence' to support conspiracy claims . It's also been claimed his imprisonment was a price worth paying by Libya for the lifting of crippling sanctions, imposed for several years after Megrahi was identified in Scotland and the US as the likely bomber. However, sources close to the recent review have told The Times that pursuit of the case in Libya only confirmed the evidence against Megrahi  - and even further implicated Lamin Fhimah, who was originally accused but acquitted. Police claim any planting of evidence to frame Megrahi would needed to have been done within a very short space of time and furthermore, it would require knowledge of all the evidence in the case still to come, the paper reported. Megrahi died two years ago after being controversially released from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer. His release, based on the understanding he had only three months to live, caused outrage in the U.S., which lost 189 citizens in the terrorist attack. Relatives in the US said they remained convinced that Megrahi had been freed to appease the Libyan government, smoothing the way for a string of lucrative deals. All 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed, as were eleven residents in Lockerbie when the plane crashed into the Scottish town of Lockerbie . Police and investigators work on what remains of Pan Am Flight 103, which was downed after a bomb was planted on it . The man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing (pictured) was later freed from prison on compassionate grounds to widespread international criticism . At the time, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said: 'The whole deal smelled of a deal for oil for this man’s freedom. I still believe that the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, created a major injustice when they let him out.' A year after his death, it was revealed Megrahi's release was linked to a £400million arms deal with Libya. Documents showed 'reprehensible' connections between the Labour government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of Britain’s worst terrorist atrocity. An email sent by the then UK ambassador in Tripoli to former premier Tony Blair explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once Libya 'fulfils its promise' to buy an air defence system.","A review of the Lockerbie bombing case confirms the basis for conviction .

"The Cairns suburb of Manoora, where the bodies of eight children were found on Friday, has a reputation for crime and violence. Manoora, along with the suburbs of Manunda and Mooroobool, forms the Cairns West area, which has developed a reputation over several decades as an area where crime and violence are higher than average. While Cairns is broadly known as an iconic Australian city, and is a popular tourist destination, Manoora is one of several 'problem areas' known to police and local politicians as in need of constant surveillance. Scroll down for video . High crime rate: Manoora in western Cairns is notorious for having a high crime rate . Manoora (pictured) lies in the Cairns West area of Cairns . Murray Street, Manoora (pictured) ihas had CCTV cameras installed by police . Just kilometers from the glittering Coral Sea and international natural gem, the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is often categorised as an affluent area despite problems which are obvious to local residents. In the wake of the tragic events which claimed the lives of eight children and left one adult in a serious condition, one Twitter used asked, 'How did i know it'd be an M suburb before i read the story?' 'Eight children dead?' one woman mouthed as tears streamed down her face after hearing the news that the victims, aged 18 months to 15, had been found in a house on Murray Street. Residents, along with family and friends of the deceased, took refuge together near a children's playground at a small park on the street. Some said they were waiting anxiously to hear whether their child one was one of those who had died. 'I felt sick when I saw the picture (of the house on TV),' local Pastor Nicole Dalla Vecchia said. Ms Dalla Vecchia was one of the local community members to comfort relatives of the children, calling the events heartbreaking. 'It doesn't matter if you know them or not, it breaks your heart.' Shd said that although the area had been branded as notorious in past years, the area housed a  close-knit community that stood by each other. Two teenage sisters who live nearby and knew one of the older children laid flowers under a tree. 'They're a close, tight-knit, loving family,' Jade Aitkinson, 14, said. 'We're all very tight and this is a very big shock to the area.' Police comfort a woman in Murray Street, Manoora, after eight children were found dead . Local state member, Gavin King, had previously noted the high concentration of social housing with a large number of low socio-economic families in the area. Cairns has seen a population boom, with government statistics revealing that two-thirds of recent population growth in North Queensland had happened in the city. Murray Street had CCTV cameras installed by the police after the street was one of four areas identified by Cairns Regional Council in their funding submission to the Queensland Government in need of permanent surveillance. In June, media revealed the suburb was at the centre of a secret government report into youth sexual abuse and domestic violence. Up to 80 per cent of homes in the suburb are public housing – the highest concentration in any regional Queensland city. 'We do need to change the physical make-up, environmental make-up, of that area because it absolutely contributes to the problems faced in that community,' Mr King told the Cairns Post earlier this year. Mr King noted that 'problem spots' had been ignored, and that the introduction of CCTV into the area was being introduced to address that. Local website Cairns Lifestyle reported that the 'M suburbs' were not recommended by locals for being worthy places to buy or rent. 'The Cairns M suburbs are densely populated with housing commission rental properties, and due to the presence of this demographic these suburbs should be considered a write off,' the post said. 'Violence and crime are common in these suburbs.' In September a 63-year-old Manoora man was charged the attempted murder of a 31-year-old man, and in February 2013 three men were found to be holding a man prisoner. Murray Street resident Rebecca Levers said that the whole neighbourhood was shocked and heartbroken that something this tragic had occurred. 'I've liver here seven years and this is the first major crime that's happened,' Ms Levers said. ‘It’s heartbreaking knowing there were kids involved, I think it’s a big shock to the community’.

"Parents who went to watch their children perform in a Christmas carol concert were barred for being late to the primary school, which was inspected as part of Trojan horse scandal. Staff at Welford Primary School in Birmingham, West Midlands, refused to let more than 25 people in to watch their children sing, after they turned up late because of heavy traffic. Among those was a grandmother who had travelled more than 130 miles from London to see the show, which was put on by children aged between five and 11. Parents who turned up late to a Christmas carol concert at Welford Primary School in Birmingham were turned away by staff on Friday . One outraged mother who witnessed the incident last Friday said latecomers were being denied entry by head teacher Jamie Barry. She said: 'Some parents who turned up five minutes late were told they couldn't go in. They were absolutely devastated. 'They were told they would interrupt the choir. But as I was sat in the performance the bell rang twice. 'One gran had come up from London. It was very sad and some parents were understandably very angry. 'I've never known anything like it. 'Some people were coming straight from work and got caught in traffic. 'It is Christmas time and it felt very wrong to do it to the children.' But head teacher Mr Barry, who previously caused outrage at the school after he gave children books on tackling homophobia, has defended the decision. He said that the school's policy is to refuse admittance to audience members arriving more than ten minutes after the start of performances. 'It wasn't done to be vindictive,' he said. 'Ten minutes is a long time, and if people continue to come in after that time it is disruptive for the children and other parents. 'I always have to put the interests of the children first and we have had this rule for a long time. Families had been caught in traffic and were said to be 'angry' and 'devastated' at not being allowed in . 'In hindsight we could have made it clearer before the performance we will make it clearer for future performances.' The concert was put on by most of the school's 478 pupils, between Year 1 and 6, and started at 2pm last Friday. Parents had been warned in advance that places were limited and it could only allocate two tickets per family. The school was among 21 others in Birmingham to be inspected by Ofsted this year in connection with the Trojan horse scandal, which saw secular schools  being infiltrated by extremists. The report found Welford Primary School, which has a large Muslim intake, to be 'meeting requirements' in terms of safeguarding children from extremism. In October a meeting at the school between Mr Barry and parents became heated and police were called, but the head teacher denies being escorted from the premises, following earlier reports. Between 1997 and 1998 Christmas festivities in the city were given the name 'Winterval' by Birmingham council to reflect the diverse nature of the population. At the time the council said it was making the change to create a more welcoming, multi-cultural atmosphere due to the large proportion of ethnic groups. However the move was widely criticised and the Bishop of Birmingham, the Rt Rev Mark Santer, said it was political correctness gone mad.","Head teacher refused to let more than 25 parents in after they arrived late .

"Labour has received tens of thousands of pounds in donations from one of the law firms criticised over false claims British soldiers were involved in torture and murder in Iraq. Leigh Day and Co gave the party or its MPs a total of £33,000 over two years, official records show. The law firm was criticised on Wednesday after the £31million Al-Sweady inquiry found the shocking allegations were ‘wholly and entirely without merit’ and based on ‘deliberate and calculated lies’. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband has been urged to give all money donated by Leigh Day and Co - criticised by the Al-Sweady inquiry - to armed forces charities . Yesterday former defence minister Sir Nicholas Soames, wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband calling on him to donate the same sum of money to charity for wounded military personnel. In the letter, the Tory grandee described the legal action as ‘vexatious and malicious’. Sir Nicholas added: ‘It says everything about today’s Labour Party that – rather than supporting our troops – they take donations from those who seek to undermine them. ‘Ed Miliband needs to forfeit this money immediately. Otherwise people will conclude that he is a weak leader and utterly unfit to be Prime Minister.’ Labour said it would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation by the legal watchdog, the Solicitors Regulation Authority, into the conduct of some of the lawyers, was still ongoing. Official records show Leigh Day & Co gave £14,500 to Emily Thornberry which was declared in her register of interests on December 8. Miss Thornberry was a senior ally of Mr Miliband’s and the shadow Attorney General until she resigned over a ‘sneering’ row after posting on Twitter a picture of a house with a white van outside during the Rochdale by-election. The donation was to pay for a legal research assistant for Miss Thornberry’s office. Detained Iraqis being guarded by a British soldier that was shown at the The Al-Sweady Inquiry. The long-running inquiry found that British troops mistreated nine Iraqi detainees following a fierce battle a decade ago, but false allegations of murder and torture were the product of 'deliberate lies' Electoral Commission figures also show the firm gave £18,250 to pay for Labour Party staff costs in January 2012. Another £875 was given for the same purpose six months later. Sir Nicholas said Mr Miliband should make a ‘suitable financial donation’ to the work of Help for Heroes ‘as an acknowledgment of previous poor judgment’. In the letter he wrote: ‘This would be the simplest way for you to clarify whether Labour are on the side of those who defend our country and our freedom or those who seek to undermine it.’ Sir Nicholas Soames said Labour should give all money received from Leigh Day and Co - criticised by the Al-Sweady inquiry - to armed forces charities . Another firm criticised after the inquiry was Public Interest Lawyers, which is led by Phil Shiner. In 2005, he shared a platform at a meeting about ‘alleged abuses in Iraq’ with Labour MP Sadiq Khan, who is now the shadow justice secretary. The meeting in the House of Commons was held to discuss ‘all cases of alleged torture, abuse or ill treatment by UK armed forces in Iraq’. On Wednesday the Al-Sweady probe exonerated British troops, saying the Iraqi men they were accused of torturing were not innocent farmers but insurgents killed or captured during a firefight, The Battle of Danny Boy, in 2004. Ministers reacted with fury to the conclusions, with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon saying the claims were a ‘shameful attempt to use our legal system to attack and falsely impugn our armed forces’. A Labour spokesman said: ‘As Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker made clear Labour supported the conclusion of the Al-Sweady inquiry which found that serious allegations made against British service personnel were wholly without foundation and that the failure of legal representatives to disclose evidence gave significant cause for concern. ‘The Solicitor Regulation Authority is now fully investigating whether there have been possible breaches of professional standards by the legal firms involved. ‘It would be completely inappropriate for us to comment further until this inquiry is complete.’ After the inquiry Leigh Day said it was ‘not responsible for representing the Iraqis at the Inquiry and were not asked by the Inquiry to disclose all relevant documents in our possession until August 2013. ‘The Arabic document detailing the detainees association with the militia “remained in our files until it was handed to the inquiry in September 2013 following a request from the team”. ‘On this occasion we did not get things right. We have apologised to the Inquiry for not realising the significance of this document sooner.’","Labour received thousands of pounds in donations from Leigh Day and Co .

But after she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in September, the Indiana Children's Wish Fund worked to make her dream come true far sooner, and the family took the trip last week. Yet just a day after she returned on Monday, Emma suffered a seizure and was rushed to hospital, where she never regained consciousness, the IndyStar reported.

"A century on, the four seasons bring constant changes to the scarred landscapes and ruins of the World War I battlefields in Belgium and northern France. Spring has its red poppies; summer its sun-kissed green foliage; autumn stuns with vibrant colours; and winter brings the bleakness of rain and mud. Soldiers of the 1914-1918 Great War had precious little time to appreciate the colour. Instead they endured the mud as relentless shelling destroyed woods and villages and created desolate, treeless landscapes, while many cities were reduced to heaps of rubble. One hundred years and the force of nature have slowly changed those haunted places, yet many of the relics still exist, both above and below the surface. Some bunkers have turned into stables; shell craters became drinking ponds for cattle. Many trenches and tunnels remained largely untouched on what was known as the Western Front, a battle line stretching from Belgium to the Swiss border. Each season offers a different view to the relic hunter. A road that seems to yield nothing in summer due to heavy foliage unveils a trove of treasures in the desolate winter. The Ziegler Bunker in Boezinge, Belgium, is one of the best preserved on the Ypres Salient, and the line of bunkers on Aubers Ridge in France give the viewer an idea of how important high ground was in World War I... Scroll down for video . A WWI bunker at the Fort of Walem in Walem, Belgium. The fort was built in 1878 as part of the fortifications around the city of Antwerp. After heavy shelling during WWI in 1914, the fort surrendered and under the rubble still lie the bodies of Belgian soldiers . A wooden cross with a poppy is left at a bomb crater named the 'Pool of Peace' in Heuvelland, Belgium. The crater was created by the largest of 19 mine explosions detonated to signal the start of the Messines phase of the Third Battle of Ypres. The explosion was set off on June 7, 1917 underneath one of the then highest German front-line positions on Messines Ridge. The blasts were reportedly heard as far away as London . The Ziegler bunker in Boezinge, Belgium. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Viking Ship' due to its shape. The bunker was constructed by the German Army and later conquered by the French . Two German bunkers on farmland in Pervijze, Belgium. One hundred years after the guns went silent, thousands of bunkers still exist along what was the Western Front which stretched from Belgium to the Swiss border. Many are protected by local historical authorities while many others decay slowly . Anzac Camp bunkers in Voormezele, Belgium. The bunkers were originally constructed by the British. Their location was close to the front line with trenches running both in front of and behind the bunkers . The Lettenberg bunker is situated in Kemmel, Belgium. One of four British concrete shelters built into the hill, it was constructed in 1917. The shelters were captured by the German Army in 1918 . British trenches are preserved at Hill 62, Sanctuary Wood in Ypres, Belgium. The farmer who owned the site was required to leave his land in 1914 when the war began. After returning to reclaim the land, much was cleared away, but he continued to maintain part of the trench . The remains of the Chateau de la Hutte, in Ploegsteert, Belgium. The chateau, due to its high position, served as an observation post for the British artillery but soon afterwards was destroyed by German artillery. The cellars would serve as a shelter for a great part of the war and Canadian soldiers soon nicknamed it 'Henessy Chateau', after the name of the owner . A German commando bunker next to a house in Zandvoorde, Belgium. This bunker has been a listed monument since 1999 . A bomb crater from World War I named 'Ultimo' is surrounded by a fence and trees in St Yves, Belgium. The crater is a result of one of several explosions under the German front line . An artillery shell lies at the opening of a bunker near Beaucamps-Ligny, France. Fifteen British WWI soldiers were re-buried at nearby Y Farm Commonwealth cemetery in Bois-Grenier, France on Oct 22, 2014, nearly a century after they died in battle. The soldiers, who served with the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, were discovered in a field five years ago in Beaucamps-Ligny and identified through a variety of means, including DNA . The remains of the German Lange Max gun pit in Koekelare, Belgium. It was originally designed to be a naval gun, but was later adapted as a railroad gun which was capable of long range . A German-built bunker next to the roadside in La Bassee, France. The bunker was named Le Trois Maisons (the three houses). La Bassee was occupied by the Germans from October 1914 and was part of the battleground of what is known as the 'Race to the Sea'. This 'race'  saw reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army through Picardy, Artois and Flanders - rather than an attempt to advance northwards to the sea . The remains of a German bunker (left) at the Australian Memorial Park in Fromelles, France. The park is situated on what would have been the German defensive line during battles in 1916 against Australian forces. Right, a bunker on Aubers Ridge near Illies, France.

The Western Front circa 1916: British infantrymen occupy a shallow trench in a ruined landscape before an advance . Some 7.5million men lost their lives on the Western Front during World War One. The front was opened when the German Army invaded Luxembourg and Belgium in 1914 and then moved into the industrial regions in northern France. In September of that year, this advance was halted, and slightly reversed, at the Battle Of Marne. It was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the North Sea to the Swiss border with France. This line of tunnels remained unaltered, give or take a mile, for most of the four-year conflict. By 1917, after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side, new military technology including poison gas, tanks and planes was deployed on the front. Thanks to these techniques, the Allies slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war's end in November. But the scars will forever remain.

"Nigel Farage today defended a disgraced Ukip candidate taped mocking ‘poofters’, referring to a Chinese woman as a ‘Chinky bird’ and threatening to ‘shoot peasants’. The Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments, which were not considered offensive in TV shows like Only Fools and Horses. Mr Farage hit back at claims it was not further proof that Ukip is racist and homophobic, claiming people who live in London are ‘snobbish’ about ‘colloquial language’ which is common amongst people who live in council houses. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments . Mr Farage said Mr Smith (right) was not suitable to be a Ukip candidate, but was only speaking like people outside 'snobbish' London . Ukip has had a torrid few weeks, dogged by in-fighting over candidate selection and gaffes by Mr Farage which have seen his personal ratings plummet to a record low. The party’s general secretary Roger Bird was suspended over allegations of behaving inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress. She had been a front runner for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock, but after pulling out of the race, Mr Smith was selected. But days later, tape-recorded phone calls made by Mr Smith emerged in which he: . Mr Farage initially refused to sack Mr Smith, with Ukip insiders hoping an apology would help the row to ‘blow over’. But he stood down on Monday ‘by mutual consent’. However, today Mr Farage leapt to Mr Smith’s defence, insisting that there was nothing ‘evil’ about his comments. The Ukip leader told LBC radio: ‘I’m a bit sad because Kerry Smith is a rough diamond, a council house boy from the east end of London, left school early, and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do. ‘If you and your mates are going out for a Chinese what do you say you are going for?’ When host Nick Ferrari insisted he would not use the word ‘Chinky’, Mr Farage insisted: ‘A lot of people would… I don’t think I’ve ever used that word. ‘The point is this: I feel a bit sorry for Kerry Smith, I think even the poofter comment – the next sentence he was saying how good the candidate was and the fact he was gay would be an asset to the party. ‘I think he has had a tough time. However, he is not suitable to be a parliamentary candidate. ‘I think we are very snobbish in London about condemning people perhaps for the colloquial language they use particularly if it’s not meant with really unpleasant intent.’ Nigel Farage today insisted he was only joking when he blamed immigrants for a traffic jam on the M4. The Ukip leader was mocked this month for the bizarre excuse for turning up late to an event where party members had been charged £25 to meet him. He complained at the time: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' But today he denied believing immigration policy affected his traffic flows: 'It was a joke, I’ve learned something. Never joke. 'There’s no point is there? Nobody has a sense of humour any more so there is no point doing that. A month of gaffes by Nigel Farage has led to a slump in voter satisfaction with the Ukip leader. Rows over breastfeeding, immigrants causing traffic jams and demanding a wreath at the Cenotaph have combined with allegations of a sex scandal involving the party's general secretary and a candidate. The new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction – the percentage of voters satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied - in Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader is at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied. This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year. But Mr Farage questioned the credibility of IpsosMori, adding: 'I know that personal ratings are a fickle thing, and this is a very, very volatile time that we are in.' However, he conceded: 'We’ve had a difficult couple of weeks.' Mr Smith initially suggested that he had been under great stress at the time of the controversial comments and was taking strong pain killers. He blamed the rant on 'strong morphine based prescription medication for a back injury'. Mr Farage tried to laugh off the excuse, adding: ‘I haven’t found sedatives have had that effect on me I have to say. ‘I might have said a few things after other forms of medication that perhaps I shouldn’t have done, but then again we all have haven’t we?’ Mr Farage went on: ‘Kerry himself said that he used language that Del Boy used to use on Only Fools and Horses and nobody objected then. ‘Kerry Smith is not fit to be a parliamentary candidate. I don’t think that in the comments he used he meant malice, that’s the point I’d make.’ Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg yesterday dismissed Ukip as 'just a movement of angry blokes' trying to become a political party. On his LBC Radio phone-in show Mr Clegg said: 'Of all the excuses for this kind of bile and racist, homophoboic vitriol - 'I was on a sedative' - most people on a sedative don't become Alf Garnett on stilts, do they? Most people on sedatives go to sleep. 'But apparently if you are in Ukip, if you are on a sedative, you just become even more unpleasant.' The latest IpsosMori survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with Nigel Farage as Ukip leader . After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention. As the Ukip leader left the LBC studios this morning he was photobombed by  Kevin Lee Light, aka Jesus of Hollywood. The professional Jesus impersonator, who arrived in the UK from LA this week, appeared in the background of photos in central London . But Mr Farage hit back: ‘Thus spoke the man from Westminster school, of vast wealth and the European College in Bruges. ‘If he looked a bit more closely what he would see is we had seven women elected to the European Parliament this year without using all female shortlists. They did it absolutely on merit, with no advantage given to them whatsoever. ‘Nick can abuse us all he likes, I’m not going to return the compliment.’ He insisted that people with offensive views make up a ‘very small proportion’ of Ukip members and candidates. ‘We do not have a monopoly on stupidity, I promise you.’ Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin. He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so. Sex education policy confusion . Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.' Ostentatious breastfeeding . Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' General secretary sex scandal . Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications . Rate an immigrant game .

"Dust devils on Mars can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes, with a funnel more than 330ft (100 metres) wide stretching up to 12 miles (19km) above the surface. Their smaller counterparts on Earth form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air above. Now, a new study has found that it's not just their size that sets Martian dust devils apart; they also require a stronger updraft create a similar vortex than on Earth. Spinning a dust devil in the thin air of Mars requires a stronger updraft than is needed to create a similar vortex on Earth, researchers claim. Pictured is a dust devil reaching above the plain of Mars' Amazonis Planitia . The discovery could help scientists analyse how dust affects the Martian weather system - a piece of information that will impact deep space missions to the red planet. 'To start a dust devil on Mars you need convection, a strong updraft,' said Bryce Williams, an atmospheric science graduate student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). 'We looked at the ratio between convection and surface turbulence to find the sweet spot where there is enough updraft to overcome the low level wind and turbulence. 'And on Mars, where we think the process that creates a vortex is more easily disrupted by frictional dissipation – turbulence and wind at the surface – you need twice as much convective updraft as you do on Earth.' Dust devils on Mars can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes, with a funnel more than 330ft (100 metres) wide stretching as much as 12 miles (19km) above the surface (left). Their smaller counterparts on Earth form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air (right) Dust devils and tornadoes are common on Mars. Here they have lifted the thin bright dust on the surface of the Schiaparelli Basin, exposing darker material underneath . The team looked for the dust devil sweet spot by combining data from a study of Australian dust devils with meteorological observations collected during the Viking Lander mission. They are now looking at the effects dust devils have on lifting dust into the Martian atmosphere, and changing the planet's climate. 'The Martian air is so thin, dust has a greater effect on energy transfers in the atmosphere and on the surface than it does in Earth's thick atmosphere,' said Professor Udaysankar Nair. Dust in the Martian air cools the surface during the day and emits long-wave radiation that warms the surface at night. Nasa scientists in California have revealed evidence that suggests there is life on Mars based on readings taken by the Curiosity rover (shown). They said methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria. And at the moment there is no alternative explanation for the spikes . In the past few months, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, but one greater question remains: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well? Scientists may be on the brink of answering that question with an equally conclusive 'yes', as convincing evidence has been detected by Nasa's Curiosity rover. An instrument on the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface - and it could be the first alien life ever detected. 'This temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localiSed source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden 'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. While spotting dust devil tracks is relatively common, catching these whirling dervishes on the Martian surface can be tough. Earlier this year, observations from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter caught three dust devils in action. Despite their reputation, they can actually help solar panelled robots on the Martian surface. For instance, the Mars Rover Opportunity underwent a 'cleaning event' this year, when a dust devil blew off material stuck to its surface. Earlier this year, observations from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter caught three dust devils in action .","On Mars, dust devils can stretch up to 12 miles (19km) above the surface .

"Parents have been warned about the dangers of buying budget car seats online after another illegal batch was spotted on sale that could be fatal in a crash at just 30mph. Shocking slow-speed footage shows the unbranded Chinese-made seat disintegrating on impact and forcing the child's head  through the front of the car - causing potentially fatal injuries. The blue and black child seat was tested by safety experts Britax, who revealed that it ripped apart at a 30mph impact - well below EU guidelines. Scroll down for video . Shocking slow-speed footage shows the unbranded Chinese-made seat disintegrating on impact . Child seat was tested by safety experts Britax, who revealed that it ripped apart at a 30mph impact . They appear to be made of weak nylon straps and sub-standard stitching and were priced around £18 - less than half the cost of the cheapest standard toddler car seat. West Sussex County Council has removed more than 100 vendors from selling the cheap seats after an initial complaint about a Surrey sale. But other foreign websites are still flouting UK law and selling the seats online to British customers, prompting the council to alert the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Peter Aston, West Sussex County Council's Trading Standards Manager, said: 'With a truly global market these days, foreign companies with no EU presence are increasingly advertising in the UK and shipping direct to customers. The seats appear to be made of weak nylon straps and sub-standard stitching and were priced around £18 . Specialist testing revealed the car seats, meant to be designed for toddlers, were woefully unsafe . 'Such companies are incredibly difficult to regulate as they are not subject to UK law. 'We are aware of similar car seats that have been tested and this has shown that they provide totally inadequate protection and I have no doubt that in a car accident there is a strong possibility that any child in one would be killed.' In order to be sold in the UK car seats must pass two crash tests, one front-on at 30mph, and another from the rear at 20mph. Crash dummies are strapped into the seats and sensors are used to measure damage, which must be below certain levels. Passing such tests will allow a seat to go on sale in this country, but road safety groups will usually carry out additional tests before giving each seat a rating.

Jackie Boyle, Community Fire & Road Safety Officer for West Sussex Fire & Rescue Service, said: 'As a fire service, sadly, we see the aftermath of road traffic collisions on a regular basis. 'Even in a minor collision if a child is not properly restrained in a correctly fitted car seat, the consequences can be devastating. 'These seats are downright dangerous. There is no such thing as a bargain when it comes to buying a car seat so please don't put your child's life at risk. 'Go to a reputable retailer and look for a label showing a capital 'E' in a circle. That means its EU safety approved.'

"President Barack Obama stepped into an oil-slicked Keystone Pipeline mess on his way out of town Friday, contradicting the findings of his own State and Energy Departments. The pipeline, a 1,179-mile long planned conduit stretching from Albert, Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, has generated environmental controversy that the administration pledged to weigh against the project's economic impact. Obama claimed Friday during a press conference before he left for an extended vacation that America would hardly notice the $8 billion enterprise's impact on their pocketbooks. 'At issue in Keystone is not American oil. It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada,' he told a packed press briefing room. Obama made no mention of oil from Montana and North Dakota that will be incorporated into the three-foot-wide pipeline's load if the project gets a green-light from Congress in the new year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NOT IMPRESSED: Obama said the Keystone pipeline will bring little benefit to Americans and won't include oil from American wells. The three-foot-wide pipeline, pieces of which are seen here, will wend its way through 1,179 miles of North America on a path from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf coast of Texas . North Dakota Senator John Hoeven (left) disputes Obama's contentions about the pipeline, and has helped recruit key Democrats including West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to is side with arguments about energy independence . 'It would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf,' he said, casting the enterprise as a sop to businesses north of the border. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week that a Keystone approval bill will be his chamber's first agenda item in January. But the president hedged his bets on what he would do if a united, Republican-led Congress dropped that legislation on his desk. 'I'll see what they do,' he said. 'We'll take that up in the New Year.' A reporter asked Obama if he had been short-selling the economic benefits of the pipeline, and he shot back that 'I don’t think I’ve minimized the benefits, I think I’ve described the benefits.' And those, he said, were slim. 'There is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices – what the average American consumer cares about – by having this pipeline come through,' he claimed. 'There’s a global oil market. It's very good for Canadian oil companies and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers.' 'It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers,' Obama said, putting an exclamation point on his argument. Republican North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven fired back, telling DailyMail.com that the president's judgment was 'just not accurate.' 'The president said that the pipeline would move only Canadian oil and that it would all be exported. He’s wrong on both counts,' said Hoeven. 'The Keystone XL pipeline will also carry light sweet crude from North Dakota and Montana, and the president's own Department of Energy produced a report that said the oil would be used in the United States.' That report, a June 2011 memorandum, came from the desk of Carmine DiFiglio, the department's deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis. NORTH DAKOTA CRUDE: Rancher Bob Banderet stands in front of the Keystone pumping station that will move oil from the state into the main pipeline – something Obama said Friday won't happen . Hoeven also had an answer for Obama's insistence on Friday that the project's chief negative remains the threat of an outsize environmental footprint that could drive new levels of climate change. 'I want to make sure that if, in fact, this project goes forward, that it's not adding to the problem,' Obama said. 'If we've got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.' But Hoeven said Obama forgot to count the environmental impact of the Alberta tar sands oil's current mode of transportation. TransCanada, the company that has been angling to build the pipeline since 2008, is shipping the oil 'through rail or trucks,' the president said during his press conference. The North Dakota senator suggested that he should read the latest environmental impact report from his own State Department. That report, he said, concluded that 'it would take 1,400 tanker rail cars every day to ship the same amount of oil as the pipeline.' 'Ironically, not building the pipeline will result in more emissions from trucks, trains and oil tankers than would ever be produced by the Keystone XL pipeline.' NOT QUITE: Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, was one vote shy of passing a Keystone pipeline approval bill in November, and her failure helped a Republican snatch her seat away in an election runoff . It's unclear whether Obama is laying the groundwork for a veto. But ultimately the Nebraska Supreme Court could have as much to say about the outcome as the White House. Governor Dave Heineman has approved the pipeline's route through his state, but a group of landowners challenged that decision. If they prevail, TransCanada will have to start over with Nebraska's Public Services Commission and find a new path through the Cornhusker State. That could take as long as a year. Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu tried to make approving Keystone the cornerstone of her failed bid to keep her seat in November and December.

"A speeding biker gave the middle finger to a motorist moments before he mowed down a woman pedestrian, killing her and himself, an inquest has heard. James Fryman, 23, was said to have been travelling at up to 80mph as he overtook a line of traffic on his Honda bike, prompting one driver to sound his horn. Witnesses described seeing the biker flick the middle finger of his left hand up at the disgruntled driver before he carried on and crashed into Janice Short. Tragic: Grandmother Janice Short, 63, had been crossing the road with her husband, Andrew, and their pet dog, Toby (pictured together, right), when James Fryman (left), 23, crashed into them, killing himself, her and Toby . The 63-year-old grandmother had been crossing the road with her husband, Andrew, and their pet dog, Toby, at the time. Both she and Mr Fryman died of multiple injuries. The pet dog was also killed in the horrific collision in Weymouth, Dorset, in July. An eye-witness told the inquest that the biker had overtaken six cars at speed seconds before the fatal crash. Howard Williams said the biker was travelling '20 to 30mph' quicker than the speed limit of 50mph. Too fast: An eye-witness told the inquest that the biker had overtaken six cars at speed seconds before the fatal crash in Weymouth, Dorset, in July . 'Erratic': Another witness said she thought Mr Fryman was 'travelling at about 80mph' and that his 'poor riding' was unnecessary and the overtaking was 'unsmooth' and 'erratic' He said he sounded his horn at the 'aggressive' overtaking manoeuvre and added: 'The rider on the bike gave me the middle finger in his left hand.' Susan Burrows said she thought Mr Fryman was 'travelling at about 80mph' and that his 'poor riding' was unnecessary and the overtaking was 'unsmooth' and 'erratic'. She added: 'I heard a horn and saw the rider give the middle finger to a Volkswagen driver who had honked the horn.' But another eyewitness, Nicola Hallam, told the inquest she didn't think Mr Fryman had been speeding prior to the collision. She said Mrs Short had 'hesitated' and pulled her dog back before she decided to cross the road. PC Kelvin Edge, who investigated the crash, said: 'The point of impact was 0.3 metres away from the central reservation. Contradictions: But another eyewitness told the inquest she didn't think Mr Fryman had been speeding prior to the collision, saying Mrs Short had 'hesitated' and pulled her dog back before she decided to cross the road . 'In practical terms, this indicates she almost cleared the lane and reached the central area when she was hit. 'Mr Fryman braked very hard which resulted in his wheels locking and he strayed to the off-side of the carriageway.' PC Edge said in police investigations, calculations by experts estimated Mr Fryman was travelling between 48mph and 58mph on the road, although it was likely to 'be at the higher end of that scale.' Mr Short who was unharmed in the collision, said he tended to his wife as she lay in the road afterwards. Mr Sheriff Payne, the coroner for Dorset, recorded a verdict that Mr Fryman and Mrs Short died as a consequence of a road traffic collision.","Witness said James Fryman, 23, was riding at  80mph in Weymouth, Dorset .

"Images of 12 of London's most wanted individuals have been released by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) as it intensifies its crackdown on the capital's most evasive suspects this Christmas. The photos, which show six people being sought for burglary and six people sought for violence with injury offences such as grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm, have been uploaded to the Crimestoppers website in a public appeal for help. The dozen include Alan Goodin, 64, wanted by Ealing, who has 27 aliases and is accused of fleeing a series of bed and breakfast guesthouses without paying his bills; and another man, Jay Wheeler, 26, who allegedly attacked a neighbour with a metal bar after an argument over loud music and is wanted by Greenwich Police. Scroll down for video . Ionut Chirila, 19, wanted by Redbridge borough for five burglaries . Jay Wheeler, 26, wanted by Greenwich borough for actual bodily harm and recall to prison . Pedro Marquez, 36, wanted by Brent borough for burglary . Victor Valko, 58, wanted by Hounslow borough for grievous bodily harm . Danny Cooper, 30, wanted by Hounslow borough for burglary . Daniel McCollins, 34, wanted by Haringey borough for attempted grievous bodily harm with intent . Michael Pritchard, 45, wanted by Tower Hamlets borough for four burglaries . Patrick Kosolo, 33, wanted by Enfield borough for grievous bodily harm . Gillian Keogh, 46, wanted by Kensington and Chelsea borough for two burglaries . Donatas Bagdzius, 35, wanted by Barking and Dagenham borough for actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm with intent and breach of court order . Alan Goodin, 64, wanted by Ealing borough for burglary, failing to appear for burglary, recall to prison and theft/fraud . Rafal Szpiec, 35, wanted by Barnet borough for grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm . Dedicated fugitive teams made up of officers from the Met's Territorial Support Group (TSG) as well as officers from boroughs, are in action across all parts of the capital tracking down wanted suspects in support of ongoing Operations Bumblebee and Equinox. The London-wide hunt for wanted offenders is part of a range of tactics being used to crack down on burglary and violence, as part of the Met's ongoing commitment to drive down these type of crimes, arrest offenders and support victims. The TSG teams - which specialise in intelligence-led operations - have successfully arrested hundreds of hard-to-find wanted offenders including 30 burglars since November and dozens of individuals who have committed violent offences such as grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and attempted murder. They have also apprehended individuals wanted for domestic violence, child sexual exploitation offences and rape. Latest figures show that between October 17 and December 8, 368 wanted offenders were arrested for burglary and a total of 657 wanted offenders were arrested for violence with injury offences (grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm, manslaughter, attempted murder and murder) across the Met. Commander Simon Letchford, of Territorial Policing at the MPS, said: 'We are stepping up our activity to locate and arrest outstanding wanted suspects as part of our ongoing response to tackling burglary and violence in the capital. 'We will not give up in the search to find people who flout the law and cause people misery and we will use every means available to catch them. 'The use of fugitive teams and other daily operations will continue to ensure those wanted are caught, so they can face justice.' Operation Bumblebee launched on October 20 to target the 25 per cent rise in residential burglary offences traditionally seen during autumn and winter. A range of pro-active measures, including traditional tactics and the use of science and technology are being put to use, including high visibility patrols in burglary hot spots, driven by the use of predictive crime mapping. The MPS is making good use of predictive crime mapping, which takes historic crime data and models the likely locations of future criminal acts. This allows them to direct officers and other resources to key areas. The police now produce automated crime maps for every ward in London covering 14 different crime types. Officers are using super cocooning to support victims and prevent offences in the surrounding neighbourhood, as following a burglary it is not uncommon that burglars will target a number of houses in the same street. Super cocooning works by encouraging residents to be extra vigilant and security conscious. Safer Neighbourhood Teams pay a home visit to victims and their neighbours as soon as possible after an offence is reported to give crime prevention advice and gather local intelligence, while patrols are stepped up in the area. The police are constantly introducing new initiatives to help the public protect their property such as the free traceable liquid marking systems that mark property with a unique code identifiable to any police officer or second-hand goods buyer. Treatment of 5,000 London homes across ten hot spots saw 767 fewer burglaries and an average drop in crime of 54 per cent in the last ten months of 2013. Under Operation Neptune, the MPS maps second-hand markets, negotiates a voluntary Code of Conduct for premises to record sellers' personal details, checks property with the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit and informs local police when stolen property comes into their possession. There are regular visits and audit checks by local officers. Latest figures (rolling 12 months figures up to December 15, 2014) show burglary offences have fallen by 12.8 per cent across the Met compared to the previous rolling 12 months (11,247 fewer offences) with the biggest reduction seen in residential burglary at 13.3 per cent (7,563 fewer offences). In mid-October, the Met launched Operation Equinox to reduce the number of violence-related offences across London. It has seen boroughs across the capital join forces in a coordinated crackdown to target activity against a number of licensed venues, geographic areas and fast food outlets where violent offending disproportionately occurs. MPS latest figures show there were 67,855 violence with injury (this category mainly comprises grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm and assault with injury) offences in London (rolling 12 months up to December 15 compared to same period last year). This shows a 19.8 per cent rise from 56,651 the same period last year. Research carried out on the figures indicates that the rise is likely to be attributable to improved recording practices rather than a rise in violence per se. A high proportion of these crimes typically occurs between the times of 6pm and 6am, and is often focused around licensed venues such as pubs, nightclubs and fast food outlets. In November and December, there is also traditionally a spike in such crimes as robbery, burglary and anti-social behaviour, the latter often fuelled by alcohol, which can be linked to violence. Operation Equinox is deploying resources across a wide range of activities - from problem-solving and crime prevention initiatives within wards/boroughs to an intensified focus on forensic retrieval and partnership work with licensed venue operators. It includes licensing inspections, enforcement of no-drinking zones and rigorous spot checks carried out in high-profile venues in collaboration with local authority licensing officers.","Crimestoppers website shows six people sought for burglary and six more wanted for violence with injury offences .

"Damien Baxendale was jailed for 10 years after he left his girlfriend so badly injured doctors said it was like she had been in a 'serious car crash' A vicious thug punched and kicked his girlfriend so hard doctors said it was like she had been in a car crash after she suffered a bleed on the brain, a fractured vertebrae and a fractured eye socket. Damien Baxendale was jailed for 10 years after he left 23-year-old Chelsea Hayes unconscious, her clothing torn and blood splattered around the rooms at his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester. She was so badly swollen her three-year-old daughter, Shernia, did not recognise her and she now suffers from back pain, headaches, nausea, dizziness, poor memory and depression. Rachel White, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court that a neighbour saw the 24-year-old outside his flat at 3am on August 3 last year, kicking someone in the face 'as if he was kicking a football'. When police officers arrived, Baxendale refused to let them in, claiming Miss Hayes was asleep, but relented when they threatened to force their way in. Miss White told the court: 'Inside was covered with blood all over and it looked as if a struggle had taken place. 'Chelsea Hayes was severely injured, gagging and unconscious.' Baxendale claimed Miss Hayes had been drunk telling police it was 'all her own fault' and claiming she had banged her head. While his girlfriend lay unconscious in hospital Baxendale told officers: 'When she wakes up she will verify everything I have said.' The court heard Miss Hayes spent 10 days in hospital and could not remember anything about that night. Chelsea Hayes, 23, pictured left after her attack and right, bruised and swollen after she was beaten by her boyfriend Damien Baxendale. She had a bleed on the brain and needed her eye socket reconstructed . Miss Hayes had to have a metal plate installed in her cheek bone to reconstruct her face and surgeons went in via her eye socket, which is now scarred (pictured) Miss White said: 'It is the kind of injury usually seen in road traffic collisions.' He left her with a bleed on the brain, two fractured vertebrae, a fractured eye socket which had to be reconstructed, damaged neck ligaments, black eyes and lips so swollen she could not open her mouth. The court heard Baxendale was granted bail in February this year but almost exactly a year later, on August 2 he was arrested again after a violent street attack on another girlfriend. At 5am a resident called police after seeing Baxendale kick the woman in the side and repeatedly punch her in the face. Her injuries included a fractured nose and bruised and swollen face. Baxendale, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing grievous bodily harm. The couple pictured together, left, and Miss Hayes three-year-old daughter Shernia, right, who did not recognise her mother after the attack because she was so badly swollen . Colin Buckle, defending, said his client 'knows he does not deserve the clemency of the court'. Baxendale was jailed for ten years, with a further four on licence for the attack and second violent assault. Judge Peter Davies said: 'They were savage, brutal, ferocious and frenzied assaults.' He told him that he regarded him as a dangerous offender who posed a serious risk to the public and he did not accept he was remorseful. Members of Miss Hayes' family cheered and applauded as Baxendale was sentenced.

"An Indian farmer has decided not to sell his prized bull it fetched a world record price of £1.23million because he already earns more than £30,000 a month selling its highly-sought after semen. If Karamvir Singh had gone ahead with the sale, it would have made his three-year-old bull, called Bheem Donor, the most expensive in the world. But after selling off the bull's brother, Yuvi Donor, for the equivalent of £860,000, Mr Singh is not in a rush to get rid of the 1,200kg bull. Farmer Karamvir Singh is keeping hold of his prized bull Bheem Donor, pictured together, despite the animal fetching a world record price of £1.23million at auction . The Murrah breed bull would provide plenty of meat, but his real value comes from the 4 to 5ml of high quality semen he produces every day, which is in demand across the country. Mr Singh, who lives in Sunario village located in the Kurukshetra region of Northern India's Haryana State, said: 'I don't see the need to rush into selling him given that I can earn over £30,000 a month from selling his semen.' He also makes a similar amount from the bull that fathered Bheem. He added that Bheem Donor was 'like a son to him' - and a very profitable one. The 1,200kg Murrah breed bull produces 4 to 5ml of semen a day, which earns Mr Singh £30,000 a month . The bull consumes around £20 worth of food every day, but it's a worthwhile investment as its breed is known for selling for high prices . One of the reasons that semen from the family is so expensive is due to the fact that the mother of Bheem and Yuvi, produces up to 26litres of milk every day - a record-breaking amount for a Murrah buffalo. But while Mr Singh regularly brings in a small fortune from the bull, it consumes around £20 worth of food every day. This is a considerable amount considering the monthly wage for many people in rural communities across the country is around £100. The auction took place at a three-day fair organised in Jagraon by the Progressive Dairy Farmers' Association. The Murrah breed of Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a type of domestic water buffalo kept for dairy production. They originate from the Punjab and Haryana states of India and Pakistan and are jet black in colour, have closely curled horns and sometimes have white markings on their face and legs. The bulls are used for improving the milk productivity of dairy buffaloes, usually through artificial insemination. Murrah bulls are widely used in countries like Bulgaria, Italy and Egypt and the breed is noted for the fact that animals sell for such high prices. Source: Karamveer Dairy Farm .

"Movie maker Ben Pickering (pictured) was the ring leader in a multi-million pound mortgage swindle in South Wales, Swansea Crown Court heard . A film producer who once worked with actor Burt Reynolds has been jailed for his part in a £5million mortgage scam. Movie maker Ben Pickering was the ring leader in the  swindle which involved 30 properties in South Wales, Swansea Crown Court heard. The 35-year-old - a former Conservative party candidate who once directed a pilot for a drama called 'How To Get Away With Murder' - invented a string of characters as part of the eight year fraud, the court heard. Pickering, who has produced a series of crime thrillers, lined his pockets after making fake mortgage applications. But he ended up in court over the scam after admitting conspiracy to defraud and was today jailed for six years. Judge Keith Thomas told him: 'These offences were fuelled not by economic necessity, but by greed.' Pickering had his own production company called Jericho Lane Pictures and worked on a number of motion pictures. He was on the production team for the £1.2million-budget comedy Party Pieces starring Burt Reynolds and Jane March. Pickering's career started in 1995 when he was just 16 when he produced and starred in his first feature, a coming-of-age drama called Backstreet. He then made a low budget gangster film called Tragic Irony, described as a cross-between Pulp Fiction and Shallow Grave. Pickering directed a pilot for a series called 'How To Get Away With Murder' in 1999 and a short film called Beached which stared Ray Gravell and was shown at Cannes. He directed a crime thriller Two Days in the Smoke and horror film Welcome to Curiosity. Pickering had also been a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party in Swansea, South Wales in 2000, before moving to Truro in Cornwall. But between 2003 and 2011 he ran a complex fraud operation with Mark Cainen, 46, Paul John, 44 and Emma Davey, 34. A court heard how the 35-year-old (pictured left and right) invented a string of characters as part of the eight year fraud . The court heard how the four behind the plot made more than 30 mortgage applications for properties across South Wales  using false names and fictitious employment details to lenders including the Leeds Building Society. Swansea Crown Court heard how they conspired to make cash out of the housing market by defaulting on the loans they had secured - and then looking to buy back the properties on the cheap. In some cases, the court was told, they drove down the prices even by making up land ownership disputes to make the homes less desirable. Judge Thomas said: 'I have been told in letters on behalf of Pickering the economic downturn and its effect on the housing market was the driving factor. 'I don't accept that argument in any shape or form, these offences were fraudulent from the outset. This was fuelled not by economic necessity but by greed.' Carl Harrison, prosecuting, said: 'Pickering and Cainen acted as buyers, sellers and points of contact in the conspiracy and they provided false information such as shadow salary payments, invoices, pay slips and P60 documents giving details of tax said to have been paid. Between 2003 and 2011, Pickering ran a complex fraud operation with Mark Cainen, right, Paul John, left, and Emma Davey . Pickering was jailed for six years, Cainen for eight years and John for three years and four months at Swansea Crown Court (pictured) 'They were effectively stealing the identities of other people and companies and taking the identities of people of a similar age to get mortgages approved.' During Cainen's trial at Swansea Crown Court, emails showed Cainen saying to Pickering: 'Get your smoke and mirrors out' and on one occasion Cainen is said to have criticised Pickering 'for not being a good crook'. At one time Cainen had more than 20 bank accounts in different names and Pickering obtained software to make false pay slips. The four fraudsters used false names and fictitious employment and salary details to secure loans off lenders totalling £5million between 2003 and 2011. They would back up their applications using fabricated pay slips. But they would soon default on the mortgage repayments and then set about trying to buy back the properties at a cheaper price. The court was told that sometimes they would even drive down the value of the homes by making up land ownership disputes to make the property seem less desirable - before snapping them up at lower prices using . Some 20 fake bank accounts were set up as the group serviced the elaborate scam and Pickering even had software to make the fabricated payslips. It is not yet clear how much the gang made from the enterprise. Paul John was sacked by a Swansea finance firm in 2008 when a colleague found a false mortgage application for his wife in his desk drawer. Pickering, John and Davey admitted conspiracy to defraud while Cainen was found guilty after a trial at Swansea Crown Court. Pickering was jailed for six years, Cainen for eight years and John for three years and four months. The judge suspended Davey's jail term due to previous good character and the fact she was 'prevailed upon' by Cainen to get involved. She was given 200 hours unpaid work.","Movie maker Ben Pickering was ringleader of the swindle in South Wales .

"The once dignified faces of famous historical figures have been transformed by a graphic artist, who replaced them with those of infants. The series, called 'The True Faces of History's Kings', was created by Swedish advertising photographer Emil Nystrom. The 26-year-old enlisted the help of his daughters Hilma and Signhild and the work of several Old Masters. Confused: Graphic artist Emil Nystrom used Photoshop to superimpose his daughters' faces onto famous figures in paintings by Old Masters. Pictured, baby Napoleon Bonaparte from a painting by Joseph Chabord . Royal: Michael Dahl's portrait of Queen Anne of Great Britain has been transformed after Mr Nystrom planted a picture of his daughter over the monarch's face . Using photographs of his young children, Mr Nystrom placed their faces over 18th and 19th century figures, including Napoleon Bonaparte, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II of the Habsburg empire, and British naval officer, Edward Pellew 1st Viscount Exmouth. Mr Nystrom, who is from Umea in Sweden, said: 'This is not the way the kings, queens and admirals saw themselves, but rather the way we see them a few hundred years later. 'I imagine all these leaders being childish and fighting over things that really weren't there to fight over, like how children would behave. 'The images are created by using old paintings by Old Masters, taking new photographs of infants in the same poses and using the same light as in the old paintings.

Happy: The artist's smiling daughter has her face pasted over King Gustav III of Sweden in this painting by Alexander Roslin . 'To create the final result, I took the babies and put their faces on top of these paintings in Photoshop.' The original paintings were created by artists such as James Northcote, Francis Cotes and Charles Wellington Furse. Mr Nystrom added: 'With planning, finding the right painting, setting up the lighting and doing the Photoshop work, it takes about one day per image. 'People tend to find the set of photographs humorous. 'It's something different that you don't see every day so the first reaction is usually a laugh. 'From what I can remember I started to get really interested photography when I was about 14 years old.

"When Kevin Moran casually offered his girlfriend Molly McGinnis to duck into a photo booth for some fun pictures, she had no idea that with the click of a shutter her life would change forever. McGinnis, Moran's high school sweetheart, did not know that her boyfriend of seven years had come up with a creative way to propose to her in an intimate setting but in such a way that their special moment would be preserved for posterity. As the two sat grinning inside the photo booth on Tuesday, Kevin quickly reached into his pocket and popped open a jewelry box revealing an engagement ring inside - just in time for the camera to capture the priceless expression of surprise on Molly's face. Lovebirds: Molly McGinnis had no idea she was in for the surprise of her life when her boyfriend of seven years, Kevin Moran, pulled her into a photo booth at an Iowa mall . Priceless look: As the two were taking pictures, Kevin reached into his pocket and pulled out a ring box . She said, 'yes!: Molly was stunned and delighted, and of course she accepted Kevin's proposal . A video of Moran's off-the-beaten-path proposal, which has since gone viral on Reddit and YouTube, shows Molly breaking into a smile and saying the one word Kevin was hoping to hear: 'Yes!' The happy couple smile and giggle, with Molly appearing shell-shocked and utterly delighted. The final picture of the two inside the photo booth shows the lovebirds sealing their engagement with a kiss. The backstory of the heart-melting proposal is that Moran lured McGinnis to an Iowa mall under the pretense that they had to buy some presents for the holidays, ABC 7 Chicago reported. As it so happened, the impromptu shopping trip fell on the couple's seventh anniversary. After the proposal, the couple went out for dinner to celebrate their engagement. Sealed with a kiss: Kevin confessed on Reddit that he was very nervous and had been practicing opening the ring box . Toast to love: Molly and Kevin are seen celebrating their engagement and seven-year anniversary at a restaurant after the unforgettable proposal .

On Twitter that night, an overjoyed McGinnis gushed: 'Happiest day of my life is an understatement. So so excited to be the future Mrs. Moran! Cheers!' Moran said when he pulled McGinnis into the photo booth outside one of the stores at the mall he had no idea that it was equipped not only with a camera, but also with a video recording device that captured the entire proposal, with all the sweet in-between moments. He later uploaded the minute-long clip onto Reddit, where he confessed that he had been nervous and had spent a lot of time practicing opening the ring box.","Kevin Moran proposed to his girlfriend, Molly McGinnis, inside Iowa mall photo booth .

Ms Martin, who used to work for a company that designed gyms for high-end residential buildings, launched SIN Workouts in New York and has since expanded to Miami, with plans to set up shop in Chicago in the near future. She admits that her business fills a very specific niche - but that doesn't mean it's short of clients. 'People are like, ""You do what for a living?""' she told the New York Times. 'But some people will pay for anything that makes their life easier.' The 20 'ambassadors' for SIN Workouts, which stands for 'strength in numbers,' are part-personal assistant and part-personal trainer. For $100, they can greet you at your apartment with coffee and motivate you to get to class. Another $25 will buy you car service to the gym, not including the cost of the ride. Part of their job is to investigate each fitness studio for you to make your workout as seamless as possible. Streamlined: 'It sounds silly, but it stresses people out to figure out how the lockers work and where the weights are,' explains Ms Martin. Pictured: A SoulCycle class . 'It sounds silly, but it stresses people out to figure out how the lockers work and where the weights are,' explains Ms Martin. 'My job is not to leave people with any little excuse not to work out.' A team of massage therapists are on hand to provide treatments in the comfort of your own home, and they'll even do your laundry for you while you work out and drop it off when it's done. One fan of SIN Workouts is Denzel Washington's wife of 31 years Pauletta. 'When you're busy, the last thing you want to do is start figuring out where to go,' she explained. 'And you don't want to waste your time on a class that isn't good. With Vanessa, that has never happened.' Not only does SIN make scheduling in a workout a cinch, but it has also been shown to make a drastic difference to the waistline. Real estate agent Estee Gurwitz said she used to have a personal trainer but soon found that group classes were better for motivating her to work harder. Since hiring Ms Martin to accompany her to the 'daunting' workout sessions 18 months ago, Ms Gurwitz has dropped an impressive 25lbs. 'She's always like, ""Hey, high five,"" and it's really motivating to be with her,' she added. Price to pay: For $100, a SIN employee can greet you at home and motivate you to get to class. Another $25 will buy you car service to the gym, not including the cost of the ride. Pictured: Ms Martin doing a stretch . Liz Hershfield, who is vice president of sourcing and production for menswear retailer Bonobos, told the New York Times that having someone else coordinate her schedule 'keeps me on the straight and narrow!' SIN Workout ambassadors can work out with you at home, and now even select hotels are beginning to provide workout concierge services. The Benjamin in Midtown Manhattan, for instance, recently partnered with SIN to offer hotel guests two levels of workout session - the $75 Sinner or the $175 Sinner Elite, both of which involve a consultation and a workout. Those who sign up for the Sinner receive wake-up texts and motivational messages from a SIN employee, who also relays feedback from fitness instructors. With the Sinner Elite, the SIN staff member will attend class with you, making sure you have a towel and water at the ready and nab the best bike or yoga mat in the room. 'There's a lot of commotion when classes change over. If you're a novice, it's daunting and overwhelming, and right from the get-go, it's not a pleasurable experience,' Ms Martin told Lodging Magazine in July. 'We work to eliminate all that stress.'","SIN Workouts provides clients with a 'concierge' who can book classes for you, provide a car service and even join you in class to keep you motivated ."
"The son of a disgraced former Virginia governor has been charged with drunk driving, authorities have revealed. Bobby Ryan McDonnell was arrested at 3.25am on Thursday in Virginia Beach and refused to take a blood test. According to The Washington Post the 23-year-old was detained and released at 11am on a non-secured bond. In September his father, Bob McDonnell, and mother Maureen were convicted on public corruption charges. Bobby Ryan McDonnell, the son of former Virginia governor Bob was arrested at 3.25am on Thursday in Virginia Beach and refused to give a blood or breath sample . They lent the prestige of the governor's office to Richmond businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. in exchange for $177,000 in loans, vacations and luxury goods. As the case went on, members of his family were forced to take the stand. Bobby was made to testify as a witness for the prosecution and described his father’s insistence that his son return a golf bag and golf shoes given to him by Williams. A federal jury in Richmond convicted  McDonnell of 11 of the 13 counts he faced; Maureen McDonnell was convicted of nine of the 13 counts she faced. Both bowed their heads and wept as the court clerk read a chorus of 'guilty' verdicts. Widely considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign, McDonnell was reduced to living with the family's priest in a church rectory during the trial. Now he and his wife face up to 20 years in prison for each conspiracy, fraud and bribery conviction. Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 6. The couple's defense strategy depended in large part on convincing jurors that their marriage itself was a fraud and that they were unable to speak to each other, let alone conspire to accept bribes. They left the courtroom separately — first Bob and then Maureen, who hugged one of her daughters and wept loudly on the way out. Bob McDonnell was ashen as he was mobbed by TV cameras before climbing into a waiting blue Mercedes. 'All I can say is that my trust remains in the Lord,' he said quietly. His attorney said he would appeal.

"Science fiction fans take note: Next month on 7 November sees the release of Interstellar, a space epic from  director Christopher Nolan, who also directed the Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception. But while the prospect of Interstellar travel might seem like something shrouded in science fiction, the film actually delves into science fact - or theory at least - and it might have spawned some important scientific discoveries. When calculating how to model a giant black hole in the film, the team created one of the most accurate depictions of such an object that could explain what they would actually look like. Scroll down for video . A CGI model of a black hole for the upcoming movie Interstellar (shown), based on calculations by Dr Kip Thorne from the California Institute of Technology, has revealed they have warped halos of light and matter around them. The model is thought to be the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever . The science of determining what a black hole would look like was left to astrophysicist Dr Kip Thorne, who is also an Executive Producer for the film. Last month a scientist controversially claimed it is impossible for black holes to exist, based on her mathematical calculations. The research was conducted by Professor Laura Mersini-Houghton from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the College of Arts and Scientists. She claimed that as a star dies, it releases a type of radiation known as Hawking radiation - predicted by Professor Stephen Hawking. However in this process, Professor Mersini-Houghton believes the star also sheds mass, so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole. Before the black hole can form, she said, the dying star swells and explodes. The singularity as predicted never forms, and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape. ‘I’m still not over the shock,’ said Professor Mersini-Houghton. ‘We’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about.’ He found that the black hole warps space so that it looks sort of like a funnel with a black circle in the middle. It draws in matter from its surroundings into an accretion disk, shining incredibly brightly and brilliantly. This had previously been known - but the visual effects team found when they modelled it, the gravity of the black hole twisted the disk of gas into weird shapes. This created a rainbow of fire across the top of the black hole. When they used a flat accretion disc around the spinning black hole in their model, the warped space also warped the disk. ‘So rather than looking like Saturn’s rings around a black sphere, the light creates this extraordinary halo,’ said Paul Franklin, VFX Supervisor for the film, reports Wired. The resultant black hole is one of the most realistic depictions ever made of such a phenomena - and Dr Thorne says their research will result in two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community and one for the computer graphics community. Dr Thorne says the effects they’ve discovered of gravitational lensing interacting with rapidly spinning black holes is something that was not known before. Dr Kip Thorne is an astrophysicist from the California Institute of Technology. He has received numerous accolades for his work and, aside from being a close friend of the late Carl Sagan, he is also a good friend of Professor Stephen Hawking (middle), seen here with director Stephen Finnigan of the movie 'Hawking' Interstellar hits cinemas on 7 November. It sees a crew travel in a spaceship beyond the solar system, and possible the galaxy, in a bid to save humanity. It stars Matthew McConaughey (right) and Anne Hathaway (left) In the film Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper - a trailed pilot, engineer and widowed father - who leaves his two children behind on a dying Earth in a bid to save humanity. The film has already been praised for its accurate depiction of Interstellar travel as McConaughey and his crew, including Anne Hathaway, travel across the cosmos. From the ship itself, based on a design by Mexican theoretical physicist Dr Miguel Alcubierre, to the physics of travelling through a wormhole as light bends around the spacecraft, it seems to have got most things spot on. But one of the key moments in the film involves the spacecraft travelling near to a black hole - for purposes that have not been revealed. However, figuring out what a black hole looks like was somewhat of a problem. ‘Neither wormholes nor black holes have been depicted in any Hollywood movie in the way that they actually would appear,’ astrophysicist Dr Kip Thorne, and Executive Producer, for the film, explained in a video for Wired. ‘This is the first time the depiction began with Einstein’s General Relativity equations.’ Director Christopher Nolan added: ‘We had determined when we started down this road that if it didn’t look like something that looked comprehensible to the audience we would have to manipulate it in some way. ‘But what we found was as long as we didn’t change the point of view too much, the camera position, we could get something very understandable.’ Interstellar opens worldwide on 7 November - when moviegoers themselves will be able to see the most scientifically accurate black hole ever modelled.

"Christmas hasn't felt very jolly for former public servant Ngoc Luan Ho Trieu after he was given a cruel 'Secret Santa' gift at an end-of-year work party two years ago. Mr Ngoc, who was working as an economic modeller with the Australian Department of Finance, says he was humiliated by the anonymous gift of a plastic reindeer that poo-ed chocolate pellets when its tail was pulled. He says the toy, presented at a function with forty colleagues from the division, ruined his public service career of 37 years. It came with a piece of play dough written with the words 'Luan's modelling kit'. 'I remember one of the division asked me laughingly, what did I get? and I said: ""A reindeer modelling poo s***"" and I walk out,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Economist Ngoc Luan Ho Trieu was humiliated to be given  a plastic reindeer that poo-ed chocolate from a Secret Santa at his work Christmas party two years ago, saying 'someone was saying they thought my economic modelling was S***' The economist, who had been working on financial models for aged-care, disability support and job-start programs with the department for seven years, says he has suffered psychological trauma and a loss of confidence since the incident. 'Somebody was saying they didn't like my work, they didn't understand and value the modelling, that my modelling was S***,' Mr Ngoc said. He never found out who the gift was from, but discovered through colleagues that is was someone in a more senior position in the Australian Public Service. 'I can accept if it had come from a person below me - and I could try to explain it and not get upset about bullying, it's just ignorance then, ' said Mr Ngoc. 'But what I'm most afraid about is that this was a person above me, in a position of authority. This kind of thing is an offence to me and to the profession.' He said an apology from the offender would not help, the damage was done. 'Nobody talked to me to resolve the problem, some of my colleagues and friends said the person should send me an apology, but I'm a proud a person,' said Mr Ngoc. When Mr Ngoc discovered the anonymous gift had been given by someone more senior to him in the department, he quit his job with the Australian Public Service and says he has suffered psychological and emotional damage since . Mr Ngoc returned to work in the New Year but said he felt uncomfortable and sad, and when a redundancy was offered soon after, he grudgingly took it. 'Even my wife, she was complaining to me about why I would so easily get bad-tempered since the day I quit the APS - but I am not a person to burden other people with my problems so I didn't tell her at the time.' It was only after reading an article about the 'dangers' of public service Christmas parties, that Mr Ngoc approached a journalist at the Canberra times to tell his story. 'I feel much relieved after speaking with the media and I received support from some of my finance colleagues. At least now my wife understands why I was so angry now,' he said. 'It's just unfortunate that some idiot played a joke, maybe someone was jealous or thought that I was a trouble-maker but I always try to do my best.' Mr Ngoc is not working at the moment and says he doesn't know what's next on the horizon. 'After this event, I don't know if I want to work with the APS again. I want to get a job that will make use of my experience and my analytical skills in particular but I'm not sure where.' He says he can't get away from the 'sad feelings' that the Secret Santa present left him with two years ago and hopes people will think more kindly about the office gifts they buy this year -  because what might seem like a harmless joke can be hurtful.","Ngoc Luan Ho Trieu says an office Secret Santa gift ruined his career .

"Almost 3,000 attempts to enter Britain are made each month by illegal immigrants, figures released by the Home Office have revealed. The number, which has almost quadrupled in just three years, does not take into account those who made it into Britain undetected. From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK. Scroll down for video . Attempts: Almost 100 immigrants have been trying to enter Britain illegally every day, statistics reveal . Each day, almost 100 illegal immigrants try to enter Britain, the statistics released following a freedom of information request sent by The Daily Telegraph newspaper reveal. If current rates continue, by the end of the year, there could have been more than 35,000 attempts by immigrants to sneak into Britain. That would be a huge increase on previous years. In the year April 2013 to April 2014, 19,000 attempts were made, in 2012/13 it was 11,731, and in 2011/12 the figure was 9,632. On Wednesday, John Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration said in his final report that the Home Office was still failing to ‘get the basics right’ on immigration. The report added that it was ‘frustrating and disappointing’ to encounter the same problems ‘over and over again’, he added. Solidarity: As lorry drivers were told not to stop within 130 miles of Calais,  this group marked International Migrants Day yesterday by hanging handrwitten messages of support on the ferry port's security fence . Lord Green of Deddington, the chairman of Migration Watch told The Telegraph: ‘The sharp rise in the number of clandestines might reflect more effective detection but an increase on this scale is more likely to be due to increased pressure on our borders. ‘Part of that may be due to deteriorating conditions in the Middle East and Africa, but there is little doubt that the freedom of our society, the existence of a black market in labour and the presence of relatives and friends add up to making the UK a very attractive destination.’ The figures come after lorry drivers were warned not to stop in a 130 miles radius of Calais to avoid illegal immigrants hiding in their vehicles. More than 2,500 are thought to be currently living in shanty towns around Calais in the hope that they may be able enter Britain. James Brokenshire, the Immigration and Security minister said: ‘We continue to strengthen the security of our borders to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. ‘Using some of the best technology in the world, our officers prevented more than 18,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally in the year to April 2014 – a rise of more than 60 per cent on the previous year.’","11,920 attempts made between April and July, government figures show .

"The luxury home of Aston Villa's £18million striker Darren Bent has been burgled in the countdown to Christmas, with thieves snatching two top-of-the-range cars from his driveway. Raiders struck in the early hours of Saturday morning, breaking into his Little Aston property near Sutton Coldfield while he was fast asleep, swiping keys to a high-spec Range Rover worth £80,000 and a luxury Audi RS6. Police confirmed the home was occupied but would not say if the player was there. The Audi RS 6 quattro, commonly referred to as the RS6, is the highest-performing version, and a top-of-the-line £80,000 specification of Audi's A6 executive motor. Scroll down for video . Footballer Darren Bent pictured in 2011 beside the luxury Range Rover stolen from his home at the weekend . Striker Darren Bent's home was targeted early Saturday morning after thieves broke in through a window . England international Bent, signed by Villa in 2011, is currently on loan with struggling championship side Brighton and Hove Albion. Staffordshire Police were called to the address at 3.15am and discovered locks on a uPVC window had been snapped. Following an 'orderly' search, thieves had found car keys and driven off with the vehicles. Following a record-breaking move to the Midlands, he made only one start for Villa this season before joining Brighton in November. Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said the break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows. 'Offenders have snapped the lock cylinder in two by applying force to the cylinder,' he said. The method of 'lock snapping' is becoming more prevalent among thieves as it can be completed within a matter of seconds. Bent (pictured left, and right playing for Brighton and Hove Albion), has had a frustrating year on the football pitch . The crime caps a frustrating year for Bent, who has also played for Premiership sides Spurs, Sunderland and Villa. But 80 per cent of fans taking part in recent survey wanted the 30-year-old to be a part of Villa's starting 11. Bent said of his month-long stint at The Seagulls: 'I wasn't getting a lot of game time at Aston Villa and it doesn't bother me that I've had to drop down a division to play football. 'I've seen Brighton play and they play like a Premier League team. They play good football. That's why I wanted to come here and join them.' Bent's representative did not respond to a request for comment. Bent joins a growing list of football superstars who have been targeted by criminals. Bent also had an Audi RS6 (similar to the one pictured) stolen from his home during the burglary. Thieves broke into his home and took the keys to his luxury cars from inside the house . Police are warning homes using cylinder locks, like those the thieves broke at Bent's home, are extremely vulnerable to burglary. A practice known as 'lock snapping' has been disseminated among criminals whereby  locks featuring a cylinder are able to be easily snapped. Once broken and removed, thieves can then manipulate the locking mechanism and open the door. Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said Bent's break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows. He said: 'Thieves have devised methods of snapping these types of cylinders locks in a matter of seconds while still being able to operate the lock to open the door. 'They’re then able to look for the keys to the cars they’ve seen outside and drive them away. 'This threat can be reduced simply by upgrading the cylinder to one that is specifically designed to prevent this method of attack. We recommend that all vulnerable doors using Euro-Profile cylinder locks be upgraded to incorporate ‘Break Secure’ cylinders.' In 2001, then Everton striker Duncan Ferguson (pictured) fought off two burglars from his Merseyside home . Stoke striker Peter Crouch and his wife Abbey Clancy have also been the victims of two break-ins. The couple were said to be 'distraught' after thieves broke into their Cheshire home and turned the house upside down looking for jewellery in 2011. Entering through a kitchen window, the criminals made off with a number of rings, thought to belong to Clancey, as well as a watch and a laptop computer. And in 2010, Martin Wilson, 22, admitted to his role in the burglary of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's home. Gerrard's wife Alex Curran was home with the couple's children when Wilson and the gang smashed into their home, threatening to take her children if she did not hand over jewellery and cash. Gerrard was in Marseille at the time playing in a Liverpool Champions League tie. Former Scottish footballer Duncan Ferguson also once detained a man who broke into his home in Rufford, near Liverpool. Playing for Everton at the time, the striker confronted a pair of thieves. Although one managed to flee, his partner in crime spent three days in hospital after having been detained by Ferguson until police arrived.","Premier League striker Darren Bent's  Range Rover and Audi both stolen .

Mrs Virgo added that her charity of choice is Forest Dog Rescue - Green Gap Kennels in Far Forest, Worcestershire, a small charity rescue centre that  cares for abandoned dogs. These two pals both have Christmas outfits, while one wears reindeer ears the other has its Santa hat on . While not as cute and cuddly as a dog or cat, buying a hat small enough for this lizard is a feat in itself . She said: 'They don't receive any financial support from councils or the government and work hard raising funds doing car boot sales and raffles to enable them to continue their fantastic work trying to re home dogs.' While Honey was the overall winner, many of the other pet owners went to great lengths to impress the judges. One labrador was dressed as a snowman complete with carrot and a green tinsel necklace, while a collie looked the part in a green-and-white striped elf suit. While another managed to dress their long-haired cat in a red Santa suit - a prize-winning feat in itself.

"Tuskegee Airman Lowell Steward pictured in 1943 . Lowell Steward, a former member of the Tuskegee Airmen who flew nearly 200 missions over Europe during World War II, has died in California at the age of 95. His son Lowell Jr. says Steward died Wednesday of natural causes at a hospital in Ventura. After graduating with a business degree from Santa Barbara College in 1941, Steward joined the Army Air Corps and trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama. He was shipped to Italy in 1944 with the 100th Fighter Squadron of the famed all-black unit. From Capodechino Air Base in Naples, Steward completed 96 missions, flying P-39 Airacobras and P-40 Warhawks.  Later based in Ramitelli, Italy, he flew 96 escort and strafing missions in P-51 Mustangs. America's first black military pilots faced an unprecedented level of scrutiny under racial segregation. As a result they held themselves to a higher standard, Steward often said. 'He would say, 'we had to be better because we were looked at harder. The odds were stacked against us. Some people wanted us to fail,'' Lowell Jr. said. Steward was ultimately awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. After being discharged in 1946, he moved to Los Angeles and tried to buy a house, only to be repeatedly denied bank loans because he was black. 'After several encounters like that he said, 'I need to figure out how to finance my own home.' That's when he went to real estate school,' Lowell Jr. said. Lowell C.

He also founded a scholarship foundation in the name of the airmen. In 2007, Steward was present at the U.S. Capitol when President George W. Bush presented members of the Tuskegee Airmen with the Congressional Gold Medal. Steward's wife of 60 years, Helen, died in 2004. In addition to Lowell Jr., he is survived by daughters Shelley Lambert and Pamela Mills, along with 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

"When Daly River Mango Farm owner Margaret Ray arrived to work on Tuesday, she wasn't expecting to be greeted by a mammoth saltwater crocodile. The 4.7 metre animal, which was caught in a trap near the boathouse of the farm, had been attacking local dogs and menacing the community. Ms Ray called the crocodile catchers at the Parks and Wildlife Commission, who escorted the colossal croc out of harms way. A 4.7 metre saltwater crocodile is pulled from the Daly River Mango Farm . Farm owner Margaret Ray called Parks and Wildlife Commission to hire some crocodile catchers . Northern Territory croc-catcher Tommy Nichols, who has been working with salt water crocodiles for over 32 years, told Daily Mail Australia it was among the largest he had ever come across. ‘It was certainly up there. It was almost five metres, even with 25 cm of it’s tail missing. We didn't get a chance to weigh it, but it would have been easily over 500kg,’ Mr Nichols said. Daly River, which is about bout 240 kilometres south-west of Darwin, is a popular recreational fishing area that is also inhabited by a vast number of crocodiles. ‘It’s a high density area. There have been a number of fatalities there in recent years. The local police set up traps because it’s wet season and the flooding brings them in.’ Croc-catcher Tommy Nichols, who has been working with salt water crocodiles for over 32 years, said it was among the largest he had ever come across . The Parks and Wildlife team tied the animals jaws up, gave it some sedatives and drove it to a crocodile farm in Darwin. Parks and Wildlife received a call from local police, who were told the trap had been sprung by workers in the Daly River Mango Farm. ‘They said they had found a big one, and the cage was sitting quite low in the water, but I was still surprised when we towed it up,' he said. 'He was enormous, and he had no scars on his body, which shows he was a dominant male. The crocodile had been taking dogs and posing a threat to the community, so we needed to take care of him as soon as possible.’ Mr Nichols advised locals to only swim in designated areas, and to camp at least 50 metres from the water .

"FIFA has agreed to reveal the details of two controversial World Cup bids after their corruption investigator resigned amid claims of an alleged cover up. American lawyer Michael Garcia was tasked with investigating corruption claims concerning the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids won by Russia and Qatar. Mr Garcia resigned as FIFA's ethics investigator on Wednesday after the association refused to allow him to challenge findings that cleared the Russian and Qatari bids of any wrongdoing during the selection process. Scroll down for video . Former FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia resigned on Wednesday accusing the association of suffering from 'a lack of leadership', prompting president Sepp Blatter, pictured today, to call an emergency meeting . Michael Garcia, pictured, was tasked with looking into the bidding process concerning the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions which were awarded to Russia and Qatar amid allegations of corruption . Mr Garcia accused FIFA of suffering from 'a lack of leadership' and announced his resignation on Wednesday. He resigned on the eve of a major meeting of FIFA's executive committee which is responsible for running world football. The committee has been under considerable pressure over allegations surrounding the process used to choose the venues for the next two World Cups. At today's meeting in Morocco, FIFA agreed that the 430-page report should be published, with certain names and details redacted for legal reasons. However, the report's publication will be delayed until the ethics committee considers charges against three of FIFA's ruling executive committee. American lawyer Michael Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. He quit on Wednesday as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. Today's meeting was addressed by Domenico Scala, head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee who advised that an 'appropriate form' of Mr Garcia's report should be published, with names and other details redacted for legal reasons. This was agreed unanimously by the executive committee. German member Theo Zwanziger wanted to change FIFA's ethics code rules to publish the report immediately and in full, but this proposal was not considered by the committe..

Eckert says it will not be made public, with only his summary published. OCTOBER 2014 . Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’ NOVEMBER 2014 . Eckert publishes his summary, which clears Russia and Qatar of corruption, but claims England had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign. Garcia says the findings contain ‘erroneous representations ’, and says he will appeal. DECEMBER 2014 . FIFA dismiss Garcia’s complaint to their Appeal Committee. Garcia resigns from the Ethics Committee. He said: 'I am pleased the the FIFA executive committee decided without a vote to publish this report. It shows that people at FIFA at the moment do desire transparency and the sooner we can get on with talking about the game of football that we all love, the better.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: 'I am pleased they have agreed. It has been a long process to arrive at this point and I understand the views of those who have been critical. 'We have always been determined that the truth should be known. That is, after all, why we set up an independent Ethics Committee with an investigatory chamber that has all necessary means to undertake investigations on its own initiative.' Mr Garcia, who said himself that the report should be published, spent 18 months investigating allegations of corruption in the bidding process, during which he interviewed 75 witnesses. In November, FIFA's ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert issued a 42-page summary based on Garcia's report which identified cases of 'inappropriate conduct' in a number of the bids but said there was not enough evidence to justify re-opening the bidding process. In Friday's statement, MrBlatter reiterated that the bidding process for the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would not be re-opened. He said: 'We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts commissioned by Mr Scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the Executive Committee's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. 'Now it is important that the work of the Ethics Committee continues and that any instances of wrongdoing are fully investigated and their perpetrators pursued and sanctioned.' Mr Garcia, who appealed against the summary of his investigation, saying it contained misrepresentations, resigned on Wednesday, one day after a FIFA tribunal ruled his application to be inadmissible. The executive committee also appointed Zurich-based Swiss lawyer Cornel Borbely to replace Mr Garcia in an acting capacity. He had previously been Garcia's deputy and investigated the Russian and American World Cup bids. Mr Garcia said: 'It is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. No independent governance committee, investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation.’ Sepp Blatter, pictured today in Morocco, said that he 'understands the views of those who have been critical'","FIFA agree to publish report into Qatar and Russia World Cup bids .

"Gary Porter, leader of the Tory group at the Local Government Association, says cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections are inevitable . Bins could be collected just once a month across large parts of Britain, a senior Tory council leader warned yesterday. Gary Porter said cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections were inevitable after funding for local authorities was slashed again. Council chiefs said Communities Secretary Eric Pickles’ latest cuts – part of wider plans to tackle Britain’s budget deficit – would reduce funding by around £2.6billion next year. But Mr Porter, leader of the Conservative group at the Local Government Association, said years of cuts meant budgets were already facing huge pressure from rising school rolls and soaring social care costs. A handful of councils are already considering a move to general rubbish collections every three or four weeks to save money. Mr Porter, leader of South Holland District Council in Lincolnshire, suggested the number is now almost certain to rise. ‘To a certain extent we are our own worst enemy – we have managed the reductions really well,’ he said. ‘We are getting reductions out of the services people don’t really bother about. But we can’t keep doing that – another £3billion [of] cuts will be pushing some councils close to the edge. 'Some of our councils, probably 60 or 70 per cent, will start reducing services that people notice next year. ‘Already some of our members are talking about emptying the dustbins once every four weeks. People will notice that.’ The warning is a blow to Mr Pickles, who is under fire for failing to keep his pledge to restore weekly bin rounds. A spokesman for the minister said they still had scope to make ‘sensible’ cuts without hitting services. She added: ‘This settlement is fair and a lot better than local government was expecting. 'Refuse collections are negotiated over a period of years so any council trying to use this an excuse to move to monthly collections is trying to play politics and not being honest with taxpayers.’ Government sources last night accused councils of scaremongering, and said local authorities were still sitting on large reserves. But shadow local government secretary Hilary Benn said there was mounting evidence that cuts are driving reductions in bin collections. Rubbish: Problems are piling up, with council chiefs warning more councils will consider doing bin collections every three or four weeks . Mr Benn said: ‘Eric Pickles used to boast that he would protect weekly bin collections – then he was found out. Now even Tory council leaders are saying he has failed and that his policies are actually making things worse.’ Earlier this month, the Daily Mail revealed families are now having to wait an average 12 days to have their general rubbish collected. A survey of local authorities found just 6 per cent now collect all bins on a weekly basis. Council chiefs say Eric Pickles' latest cuts will reduce funding by around £2.6bn next year . This despite the Conservatives’ repeated pledge that they would restore people’s ‘fundamental right’ to have their bins emptied once a week. Mr Pickles and David Cameron have spent almost a decade pledging to restore the weekly bin round. In office Mr Pickles unveiled a £250million fund to help councils deliver on the pledge – but the number of councils operating weekly bin rounds has continued to decline. A number of councils have already floated the idea of restricting household rubbish collections to once every three or four weeks. But Doretta Cocks, founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said: ‘It’s one thing talking about doing monthly collections in the winter, but in the summer there will be all sorts of problems. ‘The obvious one is odours, but there are also problems with maggots because of infiltration by flies.’ Yesterday it emerged Mr Pickles has also lost a Coalition battle to force councils to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax bills by more than 1 per cent. The move was opposed by the Lib Dems, and the existing 2 per cent level will now be kept. But, for the fifth year in a row, councils will be offered cash to help them freeze council tax bills if they want. Announcing the settlement in the Commons, the local government minister Kris Hopkins said councils’ overall spending power would be trimmed by just 1.8 per cent – one of the smallest cuts since 2010. Mr Hopkins said no council would lose more than 6.4 per cent of its total spending. But the Local Government Association said central funding for councils was being slashed by 8.6 per cent. Buckinghamshire County Council leader Martin Tett warned of ‘cutbacks in a whole range of areas that people are going to really start noticing now’.","Eric Pickles' latest cuts will reduce funding by £2.6bn, council chiefs claim .

"A ruthless Mexican girl gang is accused of using their prettiest member to lure men to secluded spots where a female body builder would put him in a headlock so the others could beat him up and rob him. Mexican police  arrested the gang of six women who they suspect targeted dozens of men, many of whom were thought to have been too ashamed to report the matter to police. The gang, operating in the popular tourist city Cancun in the southeast Mexican state of Quintana Roo, used attractive Maria Sierra, 20, who targeted single men or at the most pairs of men to attack. Heavy mob: This gang of six women allegedly lured dozens of men to secluded spots where they would be beaten and robbed . After flirting with them she would either lure them alone or with one of the other women to her home, but in reality she just wanted to take them to a secluded spot where the other members of the gang were waiting. Then led by burly Yesenia Lara, 30, who would put them in a headlock, they would then get a beating by the other women and be robbed of their wallets, mobile phones and other valuables. Police say that Yesenia lifts weights at a local gym in order to get the strength to take on the men. Another of the women Griselda Naranjo, 19, was a former female boxer and could knock victims out with a single punch. The police spokesman said: 'The people may have been cautious when going off with the young woman, but they were not suspicious when they walked past the other women as they just didn't expect that females would attack them.'

He said that the gang counted on the fact that local men were too embarrassed at admitting being robbed by the women, and said nothing at all about the circumstances of the robbery, allowing the women to escape. However they were finally caught when they targeted a tourist, who not only raised the alarm but told police he thought they were all members of an organised gang and gave them clear descriptions of all six. Police were able to arrest all of them, dubbed the honey trap gang in local media, and discovered that there were many more victims after interviewing all of the women separately. The other members of the gang were Andrea Martinez, 28, Yesenia Lopez, 21, and Roxana Maldonado 19.","Pretty Maria Sierra, 20, 'seduced single men luring them to secluded spots'

Chunks of ice the size of pound coins rained down on the the village of Ness on the Isle of Lewis in a freak winter storm last night. The back screen of a car window was broken as the hail fell and thunder and lighting rumbled across the island. Chunks of ice the size of pound coins rained down on the the village of Ness on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, last night . The biggest hailstone recorded in Britain weighed 141g and fell in Horsham, West Sussex on September 5, 1958. And in June 1968, a tennis ball sized stone fell at Cardiff Airport. But the heaviest hailstones on record (according to Guinness World Records) were the size of grapefruits. They weighed up to 1kg and fell in the Gopalganj district of Bangladesh on April 14, 1986. They reportedly killed 92 people. Unusually large hailstones form in thunderstorms, mainly during the summer - and can be large enough to dent cars, injure, and even kill people. Local crofter Donald MacSween, who posted images of the damage on Twitter, said: 'It happened at the back of 11 last night. 'There was loud thunder less than a mile away. Then there were these marble-sized hailstones. 'I've never seen them that big before in real life.' Mr MacSween said he looked out the window and some of his sheep were 'going bananas'.

"A trainee accountant has been caught selling fakes on Facebook under the name of his alter ego Rodney Trotter. A covert sting operation was set up to catch Ryan Flood, after trading standards noticed his Facebook page, named after one of Only Fools and Horses'  Trotter brothers, was selling dodgy goods. The 25-year-old, a talented table tennis who has competed internationally, was then caught offering £150 of counterfeits including a Rolex watch for £20 and DVDs. Ryan Flood, a keen table tennis player who has competed internationally, admitted selling dodgy goods online under the name 'Rodney Trotter' Flood, from South Wales, admitted 19 offences under the Trademarks Act and was given an eight month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months. Justin Davies, prosecuting, said  officers had spotted the Facebook page selling the dodgy items as part of ongoing internet monitoring. 'It offered for sale what appeared to be designer products that cost significantly less than if genuine,' said Mr Davies. A sting was set up and goods worth £150  were ordered through the Facebook page. They arranged to meet Flood on October 21 last year outside a Spar shop in Merthyr. Flood disappeared around the corner before returning a few minutes later with the items. He told the officers that if they wanted any more then orders would have to be placed before a specific day because he would be playing football. The real Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst), Del Boy (Sir David Jason) and Grandad (Lennard Pearce) in Only Fools and Horses always had a get rich quick scheme which usually backfired . His home was raided at the beginning of December and a hoard of counterfeit goods were discovered. Flood claimed to be unaware that selling the goods was illegal. Mr Davies told the court that had the 32 items found been genuine, they would have been valued at £151,146.95. Wheeler dealer brothers Rodney and Del Boy Trotter always had a get rich quick scheme on the go in the BBC's comedy classic Only Fools and Horses. They are convinced their dodgy goods and fake merchandise will one day make them millionaires, but, almost without fail, their plans backfire. One of Del's dodgy schemes included the purchase of twenty-five briefcases that are locked with the slip of paper containing the combination lock number inside. Another unsuccessful plan came when the brothers offer their chandelier cleaning service. But in one of the programme's most famous scenes, Grandad accidentally unscrews the wrong chandelier. He added that no buyer would have been deceived into thinking a £60,000 Rolex watch was being sold for £20. The court heard there had been a spike in the sales of counterfeit goods. Andrew Davies, defending Flood, said buses had run from the area to the Bristol fruit market where dodgy goods were being openly bought and sold. He said Flood, who first moved to Cardiff in August 2010 to study at Coleg Glan Hafren and train at the Welsh Institute of Sport, was a talented young man, both academically and in sport, having trained with the national table tennis squad with a view to competing in the Olympics. Mr Davies said Flood, who has no previous convictions, was being backed by the Welsh Table Tennis Association to help him set up a local academy. He said Flood, who has a daughter with his partner and is father to her older child, had also taken on the parenting of his partner's family following a death. 'At the time these offences were committed there were particular pressures on the family unit,' added Mr Davies. Flood, from South Wales, admitted 19 offences under the Trademarks Act and was given an eight month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court . Sentencing Flood, Judge Richard Twomlow said: 'All the transactions happened away from the address, which suggests that you did not think that what you were doing was proper. 'All your customers knew very well they were buying counterfeit goods so nobody was being deceived. 'Having strayed from the proper path you seem to be back on it.' Flood, who faces a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing next year, will have to pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Ryan Flood sold counterfeits as his Only Fools and Horses alter ego .

"BBC News better serves ‘rich, old, white people’ than those from poor backgrounds, according to the corporation's director of news James Harding . BBC News better serves ‘rich, old, white people’ than those from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities, its most senior executive has claimed. James Harding, director of news, said the corporation must ‘redress the balance’ and cater for all licence fee payers equally. Mr Harding based his claims on research by both the corporation and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom which says that BBC News, along with other major news broadcasters, fails to attract young, poor, non-white audiences. In a speech yesterday, Mr Harding said: ‘There is a real issue of information inequality in this country. Rich, old, white people are getting a better diet of news than poorer, younger, non-white people.’ His comments echo those made by former director-general Greg Dyke, who in 2001 said the BBC was ‘hideously white’ and had worse race relations than some police forces. However, Mr Harding came under criticism from politicians for declaring that certain audiences have a ‘better diet’ of news than others. Tory MP Angie Bray, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, called his views ‘patronising’. She said: ‘I think he needs to define his terms, what does he mean by better? People get the news they are interested in and that’s why you get such a wide range of newspapers. It’s all different but I’m not going to put a value judgment on it. ‘It doesn’t say much for the BBC, with all its claims that it has by far the widest audience of all. It sounds a bit patronising but I don’t really see what his point is. People take their news from where they get the news they want in the way that they want it.’ Mr Harding, who earns £340,000 for his role at the BBC, levelled the criticism at his own organisation during a speech on the future of BBC News and the corporation’s restructuring in the digital age. Mr Harding, who earns £340,000 for his role at the BBC, levelled the criticism at his own organisation during a speech on the future of BBC News . Conor Burns, a Conservative MP and also a member of the culture select committee, said the BBC struggles to represent audiences from poorer backgrounds because it is dominated by wealthy men. He said: ‘I suppose as a BBC executive, [Mr Harding] would be a bit of an expert on older, white males, who permeate and dominate the senior echelons of the BBC. My problem sometimes with the BBC when they talk about diversity is that they talk about diversity through a rather metropolitan, elite prism. ‘They think they will make their organisation more diverse if they can get some black privately educated men as well as some white privately educated men. ‘[These comments] seem to be an all-encompassing caricature of the problem. I think it’s a challenge for all broadcasters but I think the BBC has a particular responsibility because it is funded by the licence fee.’ In his speech, Mr Harding said the BBC is working hard to improve diversity both on and off screen. He said: ‘We are also going to keep on when it comes to diversity, disability and equality in the BBC: We have made real progress in the past year, on screen and off it but, to my mind, it’s not enough. We’re going to have to go further, faster. ‘We need to make sure we’re alive to the interests and concerns of all our audiences. We have to broaden the tone of what we do.’ A spokesman for BBC News said: ‘Internal BBC audience research suggests that BBC news typically reaches more people from higher social grades each week than people from lower social grades and that we also reach fewer younger people and fewer people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. That isn’t patronising, it’s simply a fact – and one that we continually strive to address.’ Former BBC Director General John Birt said the BBC was not tackling 'difficult questions' The BBC is failing to address the ‘awesomely difficult questions’ facing modern Britain such as the threat of radical Islam, its former chief said yesterday. John Birt, who was director general from 1992 to 2000, praised the BBC’s day-to-day news operation but said it ‘faces a challenge’ on its current affairs shows which are supposed to give a more considered take on events. Lord Birt, who oversaw a radical modernisation programme during his time in charge at the BBC, said digital journalism had given people access to more information than ever before. However, he warned: ‘What it is not creating is more quality journalism. We get more knowledge of things happening around the world but pulling it all together and addressing the big policy questions – what should we be doing in respect of radical Islam, the National Health Service – that’s what we’re not doing very well and nobody’s doing very much.’ He added that the BBC must ‘get back to those very high purposes which are appropriate to a publicly funded broadcaster’.","BBC News is better for 'rich, old, white people' than others, says BBC exec .

"A woman living beside the house where eight children were stabbed to death has revealed she saw the mother and kids clearing out their home the day before the tragedy occurred. A neighbour said she saw the mother and a number of children carrying a number of unwanted items out into the street, apparently getting rid of personal possessions. She said the items included children's toys, which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother's mind. Scroll down for video . Neighbours in Cairns have been left distraught after eight kids were stabbed in a house on their street . A sea of people have come to the floral tribute to pay their respects to the victims of the stabbing . 'It would be terrible to think that she was getting the children to help her clear up, knowing that she was going to do something bad to them - if that was what happened,' said a Torres Strait islander neighbour. Mersane Warria, the mother of seven of the children killed inside the home, has been charged with murder following the horrific incident. The 37-year-old was charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital this morning. The woman was remanded in police custody, and currently remains in hospital. When relatives were told the news that the mother had been arrested for the murder of seven of her children and her niece, three relatives put their heads in their hands and wailed. Mourners and police embrace next to a memorial in the park next to the home of the multiple stabbing . A woman can be seen tearing up at the makeshift floral memorial near the house where eight children were stabbed to death . Close relatives sitting in the local playground can be seen crying after the horrific tragedy . 'No, no, my babies, my babies.' They asked for the information to be repeated three times, unable to believe that the mother could be responsible. 'No way, no way could this ever happen... How could she do this? How is this happening to my family?' A number of cousins who were sitting on park equipment where the children played everyday said the stabbing was 'unfair' and paid tribute to the happy children. Members of the public lay flowers at a memorial in the park next the home of a multiple stabbing in the suburb of Manoora . A police officer helps to arrange a floral tribute near a house in which eight children were stabbed to death in the Cairns suburb of Manoora . A woman lays flowers near a house in which eight children were stabbed to death . 'This is their park, this is their place. They just wanted to have fun.' 'This is so unfair. This is so wrong. No matter what life threw at them, those kids were so happy and bright. 'They were beautiful. All good mates.' The father of the youngest four children was not living with the family at the time. Relatives said he stayed there sometimes, but 'they were always breaking up and getting back together'. 'They fought a lot. But he saw the kids and then he left. He wasn't at the house yesterday,' 'Their dad was with them just yesterday. His babies... My babies...' Police have removed the bodies of the children from the house after they spent the night at the scene . Acting Queensland Premier Tim Nicholl lays down a bunch of flowers at the memorial in a park next to the house . Members of the public pay their respects at a makeshift memorial across the road from the scene of a multiple stabbing in the suburb of Manoora . They said the father of the children was not doing well, but said he was being looked after by friends and family. 'He's not good. He's with family but he's not good.' The children were also with their cousin at the time of the accident. The child, a girl, often spent time with the family and lived nearby. 'Her parents are with family and with the children's dad. They are not okay. We can't sleep, we can't do anything.' Family members have revealed that the mother wasn't religious and did not attend a church. 'The rest of the extended family was religious, but she wasn't. They wouldn't go to church every week or anything like that.' Cairns residents leave flowers, gifts and messages to the children at the floral memorial site . Flowers and stuffed toys are laid opposite the scene . 'But the rest of the family is religious which will be a big help. Knowing that there's something else.' Neighbours Lucy and Lency Piva told Daily Mail Australia that the incident has come as a big shock to the community and will be a 'big lesson' for people living on the street. 'This is a big lesson for us to look out for our neighbours. You here a sound and you don't even look over,' the neighbours said. 'We need to take care of each other and make sure that everybody is okay. People don't want to get involved but this is a big lesson. This is a big shock'. Some Torres Strait Islander community members speculate that it could be months before a funeral, as per tradition, which requires a long period of mourning. A plastic container has been put down in the community garden at the base of a tree. 'Any contribution will help this family through this hard time. Thanks,' the note reads. 'Any money will got towards the funerals,' their relative explains. 'They don't have the money. It's a big stress. 'Any money left over will go to the police and emergency people. They need help as much as the family.' He sits in silence for hours, staring at the tributes. Mourners gather at a memorial which has been established in a park next to the home . Eight children have been found dead and a 37-year-old woman is in hospital with chest injuries at a home in North Queensland. Mersane Warria's cousin, Torres Strait Regional mayor Fred Gala, told The Australian Warria left the Torres Strait ten years ago and was from a 'well-respected family'. Mr Gala said the tragedy is 'immensely distressing' for the family. Another neighbour told The Australian that she heard loud noises and screaming coming from across the road, but didn't think to call the police, as neighbours on the street are always screaming at each other. 'I heard a lady screaming and carrying on for 20 minutes or so,' she said. 'She was getting angry at someone and screaming at a person; I heard swearing, . A mother told yesterday of her relief that her 12-year-old daughter was 'just by chance' not at the house  in the 'backpacker Mecca' city of Cairns. The mother, who identified herself only as Sophie to protect the identity of her child, said her daughter was a friend of several of the children who died because they all attended the nearby high school. The local community has been left devastated by yesterdays tragedy, with many mourners paying their respects at a floral memorial . Many mourners have left handwritten tributes to the victims . 'They're always mucking about in each other's houses and I'm just relieved that this was a day when my daughter wasn't here,' said Sophie as she stood some 30m from the house of death in the dark at the end of another day that has sent shock waves not only around Australia but the world. Throughout the day complete strangers had walked along leafy Murray Street, in the suburb of Manoora, to place flowers as close to the home as possible - police had blocked direct access to the street near the fibre-cement house where the Torres Strait islander family lived. 'We're all trying to work out what happened,' said one of her friends who had supported Sophie as the shock had hit her that her daughter - or one of her daughter's close friends - could have been at the house where a generation of children had been wiped out. Even in the darkness of the poorly-lit street people continued to arrive as close as they were allowed to stare at the house, the front of which had been shielded off with tarpaulin by police, who were continuing to work through the night under arc lights. The brutal deaths of the children aged from 18 months to 14 years has raised many questions, the main one the lips of everyone in the street tonight being: 'Why?' 'There's no doubt that if she did this she obviously just 'lost it',' said one neighbour. A group of distressed mourners gathered at the floral site this morning to pay their respects .

"A student accused of helping a 17 year-old boy leave Britain to join terrorists in Syria is to stand trial at the Old Bailey next June. Forhad Rahman, 20, allegedly assisted Aseel Muthana to get a replacement passport and bus tickets from Cardiff to the airport. Muthana, from Cardiff, left Britain in February, but in the following month, Rahman was caught with two lists of equipment, entitled ‘Remember me’ and ‘Need’, to take to Syria, it is alleged. Rahman today appeared at the Old Bailey (pictured) where he was told he will stand trial next year . The documents apparently contained items like binoculars and multi-tools, which were discovered when he was stopped at an airport on his return from Saudi Arabia. Rahman appeared at the Old Bailey today charged with engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorists acts and two counts of possessing a record of information likely to be useful to terrorists. He appeared from HMP Lewes wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit, and spoke only to confirm his identity. Prosecutor Louise Gray said the Crown was considering applying to join the case with that of Kirsten Brekke, 19, a fellow terror suspect from Grangetown, Cardiff, who is also accused of assisting Aseel Muthana. Miss Gray added that ‘police officers from around the country have assisted in this case’. After the brief hearing Mr Justice Sweeney remanded Rahman in custody, telling him: ‘You have heard that I have fixed your trial for 1 June. ‘That trial may be you alone or it may be you and Mr Brekke, depending on the prosecution making or not making an application to join the two of you together and whether that application succeeds. ‘In the meanwhile, you will be remanded in custody and your plea and case management hearing will take place on 10 April before the trial at this court.’ Rahman, of Chesterton, Gloucestershire, will enter pleas at the Old Bailey on 10 April next year. A trial is provisionally fixed for 1 June, also at the Old Bailey, and is likely to last two weeks. If Rahman’s case is joined with that of Brekke, the trial will last three weeks. Brekke, who also known as Kaleem, allegedly assisted Aseel Muthana to get a replacement passport and bus tickets from Cardiff to the airport. If the two cases are not joined, Brekke will face a trial alone at the same court on 22 June. Brekke, of Grangetown, Cardiff, is yet to enter a plea to a single charge of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorists acts.

"A Utah man whose dog was killed by police officers this summer plans to sue Salt Lake City for at least $1.5 million. Sean Kendall's 2-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, was shot on June 18 while cops were looking for a 3-year-old non-verbal boy who had been reported missing. While looking for the boy, Officer Brett Olsen entered Kendall's backyard and — feeling 'threatened' by the dog — shot him dead. The boy was found less than an hour later, sleeping in his own basement. Sean Kendall (left) is going after $1.5 million in damages from Salt Lake City after a cop killed his 2-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, during a search for a missing boy . Geist confronted cops when they entered his human's backyard in June. Officer Brett Olsen said he felt 'threatened' by Geist and shot him dead. The missing child was found sleeping in his own home minutes later . Kendall, 27, on Wednesday filed the initial paperwork necessary to sue Salt Lake City. 'Geist was robbed of the vast majority of his life, and Kendall was robbed of Geist’s continued life with him, which cannot be replaced any more than a child or other family member can be replaced,' Kendall wrote in his notice of claim, filed by attorney Ross Anderson, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'Also, Kendall has suffered, and continues to suffer, severe and intense emotional pain, anguish, grief and trauma.' Hundreds of people have rallied outside Salt Lake City police headquarters to protest Geist's shooting. Many took their pets to the demonstrations as they demanded for Officer Olsen to be fired. Kendall, 27, says Geist was robbed of his life and that he has suffered intense anguish after his dog was killed . Happier times: Kendall says his dog had been his best friend for years and has struggled with his death . Geist had been with his human from the time he was a puppy, a couple years before he was shot dead . An internal investigation found that Olsen, a 10-year veteran at the police department, violated no policies. City officials offered Kendall $10,000 as a settlement, but he turned it down. He said he wants for officers to be properly trained on how to handle animals. He also wants Salt Lake City PD to change its policies on using force against animals. 'I understand the concern for a missing child,' Kendall has said. 'But that doesn't negate my rights as a property owner — and it doesn't replace my dog.' Geist's death has inspired hundreds of people in Salt Lake City to demand better training for cops on how to handle domestic animals and when to use force against them .","Sean Kendall's  2-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, was shot while cops sought a non-verbal toddler who had been reported missing .

"David Cameron has 'serious questions to answer' about whether he abandoned crunch talks in Northern Ireland to prepare for a rave-style party for his wife Samantha, Labour has claimed. The Prime Minister has been forced to deny pulling the plug on negotiations in Belfast last Friday so that he could fly home to supervise preparations for the lavish party at Chequers. Politicians on both sides of Northern Ireland’s divide were said to be surprised and dismayed when Mr Cameron abruptly announced that he was flying home from talks to find a solution to the Province’s budget crisis which is threatening to bring down the power-sharing administration. David Cameron has faced questions about whether he left talks in Belfast with Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny early last week to prepare for a rave at Chequers . At the time, Downing Street said that Mr Cameron and the Irish Taoiseach had concluded that no further progress could be made after 10 hours of talks. But yesterday the Mail revealed that Mr Cameron also had a pressing need to return home to host a belated 40th birthday party for Samantha at his country retreat Chequers. No 10 yesterday insisted there was no link between the two. But the Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis last night said the revelations raised questions about whether Mr Cameron had been ‘less than truthful.’ Mr Lewis said: ‘I have no problem with David Cameron attending a family celebration. ‘However, his unwillingness to remain in Northern Ireland for a longer period in order to broker progress, caused serious concern at the time. ‘This is an incredibly fragile time for political stability in Northern Ireland and the prime minister had a duty to either stay the course or visit at a time when he could give the situation his fullest attention. ‘He now has serious questions to answer about whether he was less than truthful about his reasons for an abrupt departure, which made an already fraught situation worse.’ Edgy dance DJ Sarah HB (left) performed to around 200 people for Samantha Cameron’s (right) belated 40th . The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman yesterday denied Mr Cameron had flown early for the party. He told reporters: ‘You know the reason why the Prime Minister and Taoiseach, who were jointly at these talks, made the statement they did jointly about why agreement wouldn’t be possible.’ The political talks in Belfast are aimed at resolving outstanding disputes over flags, parades, the legacy of the Troubles and the Province’s budget crisis . Experts warned last week that the power-sharing coalition could come ‘crashing down’ unless a deal is struck by Christmas. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, two former Northern Ireland secretaries raised questions about why Mr Cameron pulled out of the talks early. Peter Hain said: ‘I was both troubled and astonished that the Prime Minister left the summit prematurely in the way that he did. My experience is that a prime minister has to coax and progress the discussions and negotiations, and there is a chemistry about those and a momentum that it is possible to develop. ‘Walking away as he did leaves a kind of political paralysis which I suspect and fear may continue. That is extremely damaging and I am extremely worried about the situation.’ The music at the party was more reminiscent of the contemporary scene in Ibiza (pictured) Fellow Northern Ireland veteran Paul Murphy said: ‘How on earth can the Prime Minister come to the conclusion after 24 hours that there is no realistic way of reaching a consensus?’ Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Cameron had paid for the Chequers party from his own money. The 200 guests included celebrities such as comedian Harry Enfield, designer Karen Millen, actress Helena Bonham-Carter and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. Club DJ Sarah HB was selected to run a rave-style disco at the stately home, and the Prime Minister was reportedly seen ‘throwing shapes in an open-necked collar and jeans.’","Prime Minister forced to deny pulling the plug on Northern Ireland talks .

"Ex-serviceman Bill Ramsay, 82, has been left outraged after learning an off-duty fireman who attacked him in his home in Farsley, Leeds, will not face charges . An off-duty fireman who attacked an 82-year-old veteran in his own home will not face charges after police decided an apology was enough. Cancer-stricken ex-serviceman Bill Ramsay was beaten by Adam Talbot during a row in the hallway of his eighth floor flat in Farsley, Leeds, last Friday. Talbot was arrested and admitted assault for the attack - but was later released with a fine and told to write a letter of apology. The police decided not to hand the case to prosecutors and it was instead dealt with using new laws known as an Out of Court Disposal. But Mr Ramsay - who has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye - is outraged at the move and has demanded Talbot be prosecuted. Retired Mr Ramsay, who served with 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment in the 1950s, said: 'That law is fine if somebody nicks an apple from a shop - but this is a serious crime. 'The most terrifying thing was being hit in my eye where I have a cancerous tumour, that can't be operated on because I would have to go into too deep a sleep. 'I'm not far away from it being curtains. It's disgusting that Talbot is going to get away with attacking me in my own home.' Police said a suspended prosecution under the new government measures which replaces police cautions. Talbot was handed conditions with his punishment which were to pay £150 compensation and a fine of £50. He was also told to write a letter of apology to Mr Ramsay and banned from entering his street. If he does not comply with the conditions, Talbot will be hauled before a court. Mr Ramsay, who has 16 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, spent 28 years being a Santa Claus for sick children at schools and hospitals in Leeds. Mr Ramsay, who is a longtime friend of Emmerdale actor Chris Chittell, said he was verbally abused before Talbot forced his way inside and hit him causing a cut and a black eye. West Yorkshire Police said the appropriate action was taken because Talbot had no previous convictions, he admitted his guilt and expressed remorse. Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Atkinson, Head of Leeds District Reactive CID, said: 'A suspended prosecution was the most appropriate disposal for this offence of Section 39 Common Assault due to the offender having no previous convictions, fully admitting the offence and showing genuine remorse for his actions. Veteran Mr Ramsay suffered a small cut and black eye in the attack. The 82-year-old has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye . 'Prior to that decision being made the victim was consulted and, at that time, was satisfied with that outcome. 'Under the current two-tier out of court disposals pilot project a suspended prosecution is the stronger of two options - the lower being a statutory community resolution. 'The suspended prosecution means that if the offender fails to fulfil the conditions imposed they will face action at court. 'The conditions applied in this case included writing a letter of apology to the victim by December 31, paying £150 compensation and a fine of £50, plus a ban from entering the victim's street. 'Had the matter been progressed to court it is unlikely the offender would have received any greater penalty and possible he could have received a lesser sanction. 'The victim was spoken to again and raised concerns about the amount of time the offender had been given to write the letter of apology. 'The letter has since been submitted to the investigating officer and forwarded to the victim. Mr Ramserved  pictured during his army days with the 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, said he was 'disguested' that Talbot had got away with it . 'The victim's son contacted officers to raise concerns and the reasoning has been explained to him. 'The victim was spoken to again by the investigating officer and had changed his mind and was no longer satisfied with the use of a suspended prosecution. 'While the process does take account of the views of victims, police officers will use their professional judgement to assess the circumstances and decide on the most appropriate outcome.' A West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: 'We are investigating an incident that occurred on Friday evening involving an off-duty firefighter. 'We are not able to comment on on-going investigations.'","Bill Ramsay, 82, was beaten by Adam Talbot in his flat in Farsley, Leeds .

"The Lindt Cafe gunman may have planned his Monday attack for Channel Seven's Martin Place studio but was put-off by high security, according to a report by The Saturday Telegraph. Man Horin Monis was reportedly caught in security footage pacing outside the Seven building at about 8:30am, suggesting he may have intended to take hostages during the network's live Sunrise broadcast, a program he reportedly detested. But security at the studio, heightened following recent threats by Islamic State extremists to behead a person in Martin Place, may have spooked the man who staged the fatal 17-hour siege 50 metres away at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe. 'There are several things to suggest that (Monis) may have initially set his sights on Channel 7 during their live morning broadcast,' a senior government source told the Saturday Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Man Horin Monis was reportedly caught in security footage pacing outside the Channel Seven Studio an hour before he seized the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning . In 2009, Channel Seven's Today Tonight show exposed Monis for sending abusive 'condolence' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. The program, which labelled Monis a 'Fake Sheik', led to the conviction of he and wife Amirah Droudis in the High Court over the letters. On several occasions after the program aired, Monis protested on the steps outside the Seven Studio with pro-Islamic leaflets. In the early hours of Monday morning, it's understood the gunman walked around Martin Place before entering the Lindt Cafe and sitting for up to an hour before taking customers and staff hostage. One of Monis' former lawyers encountered the man in the cafe by chance on Monday morning and described his behaviour as distinctively calm. 'He was cool as a cucumber, not agitated, not scoping the place out, not looking over his shoulder,' said the lawyer. 'He kept asking, ""Why are you here?"". I think he was genuinely surprised to see me there.' The Channel Seven studio is just 50 metres from the Lindt Chocolate store in Martin Place, where the crazed gunman took 18 people hostage on Monday, killing two. The evidence comes after reports that the siege gunman told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week. Man Haron Monis also wrote letters to Qantas's chief executive in 2009 suggesting he had information about sabotage at the airline that would lead to mass casualties. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has launched a major investigation into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list  despite numerous examples of extremist views and behaviour, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Man Haron Monis told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week . The scenes after the shootout that resulted from a 17 hour siege that saw Monis seize control of a busy café in Martin Place and hold staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours . The references to protests in Martin Place and Qantas are contained in long, rambling posts that fill a web site attributed to Monis. The site is now coming under closer scrutiny following the siege, in which Monis seized control of a busy café in Martin Place and held staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours before police stormed in. Two hostages - Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson - and Monis himself died in the resulting shootout. In one post, Monis writes about a meeting alleges he had with New South Wales police in 2008 in which he said one of the detectives asked him about a protest outside the Seven Network studios in Martin Place against the way the network's program Sunrise had reported a terrorist attack overseas. The protest was carried out by Monis' wife, Amirah Doudis. According to the post, Monis was asked by police if he planned further protests in Martin Place, to which he replied: 'Well, it depends if the Australian government condemns the terrorist comment which was broadcast by Sunrise (then) I don't have to continue but if the Attorney-General doesn't condemn Channel 7 for its terrorist act I believe it is my religious duty to continue.' Siege victim Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the shootout that resulted from the 17 hour incident . The revelations comes as a major investigation called by Prime Minister Tony Abbott gets underway into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list in 2009 . He wrote that he also told police during the discussion: 'If our fair defence against your unfair attack is called terrorism we are proud to be called terrorists.' The Seven studio is immediately opposite the Lindt café on Martin Place that Monis raided this week. A separate post in August 2008 revealed Monis writings to then-Qantas chief executive office Geoff Dixon. Monis wrote to Mr Dixon: 'I have sent you a letter warning dated July 28 about upcoming technical problems which will be caused deliberately by some people within Qantas. '.. if you do not take my warning seriously Qantas will witness similar technical problems. .. if you keep ignoring my offer for sharing information you will be responsible for the death or injury of people..' Qantas reportedly referred Monis' letters to Australian Federal Police at the time. Monis was also on bail for a long list of charges, including sexual offences, conspiracy to murder his ex-wife and a series of abhorrent letters. In September 2013, Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service for a series of letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009. In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell. Amirah Droudis, the wife of the café gunman, is pictured in these photographs with her former partner. Monis was on bail on a charge of conspiring Ms Droudis to murder Noleen Hayson Pal . Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis (pictured) Monis was also on bail on a charge of conspiring with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, who is allegedly a Muslim convert, to murder Noleen Hayson Pal. Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis. Monis and Amirah Droudis were arrested on November 15 last year and charged. Monis also had outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'. He was due in court due in court in February next year for the sexual assault charges, which included 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault against seven women, including one 27-year-old who answered his ads placed in ethnic Sydney newspapers. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned that why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists . Speaking to ABC, Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned  why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists. 'These are the questions that we'll be having our officials ponder because he was a person who had been of interest to our security agencies,' Mr Abbott said. 'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism.' The Prime Minister said Monis was inadequately dealt with, and that the events of the siege should serve as a grave learning lesson. He announced an urgent review to examine why  Monis had access to firearms and why he was granted citizenship in Australia.","Security footage reportedly shows Monis pacing outside the Channel Seven studio an hour before his attack on the Lindt cafe, 50 metres away .

"The Home Office risks accusations of political correctness  after saying that foreigners sneaking into Britain should not be referred to as illegal immigrants. The department said those trying to get into Britain unlawfully should be referred to as 'clandestine entrants'. The debate about the correct term to use was ignited after John Vine, the independent immigration watchdog, described them as 'irregular migrants'. Scroll down for video . John Vine, the independent immigration watchdog, described people trying to enter the country as 'irregular migrants' It comes after it emerged almost 3,000 attempts to enter Britain are made each month by illegal immigrants. The number, which has almost quadrupled in just three years, does not take into account those who made it into Britain undetected. From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK. Each day, almost 100 illegal immigrants try to enter Britain, the statistics released following a freedom of information request sent by The Daily Telegraph newspaper reveal. If current rates continue, by the end of the year, there could have been more than 35,000 attempts by immigrants to sneak into Britain. That would be a huge increase on previous years. In the year April 2013 to April 2014, 19,000 attempts were made, in 2012/13 it was 11,731, and in 2011-12 the figure was 9,632. Mr Vine appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today to discuss how the number of illegals attempting to reach Britain had soared in 2014 and described them as 'irregular migrants'. Referring to inspection reports on the immigration system, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration said: 'We found that people found in lorries were being released to the French authorities but no record was being kept of who they were. 'And of course these people when they try again and very often succeed in getting into the UK as irregular migrants, the authorities in Britain have no record of who they are.' The Home Office later said that the preferred term for 'illegal immigrants' was 'clandestine entrants'. A spokesman said: 'If you say 'illegal immigrants' there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong. There are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods, for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups.' On Wednesday, Mr Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration said in his final report that the Home Office was still failing to 'get the basics right' on immigration. The report added that it was 'frustrating and disappointing' to encounter the same problems 'over and over again', he added. Attempts: Almost 100 immigrants have been trying to enter Britain illegally every day, statistics reveal . Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migrationwatch, warned that the rise was likely be caused by increased pressure on Britain's borders. He told The Daily Telegraph: 'The sharp rise in the number of clandestines might reflect more effective detection, but an increase on this scale is more likely to be due to increased pressure on our borders. 'Part of that may be due to deteriorating conditions in the Middle East and Africa, but there is little doubt that the freedom of our society, the existence of a black market in labour and the presence of relatives and friends add up to making the UK a very attractive destination. 'The Government is seeking to make it more difficult to live in Britain illegally but it will take some time for recent measures to take effect.' Around 2,500 migrants are camped in Calais, France, wanting to try to travel to the UK. The Government has already earmarked £12m to improve security and has urged lorry drivers and tourists to take extra precautions to stop would-be migrants boarding their vehicles. Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said: 'We continue to strengthen the security of our borders to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. We have made significant investment in ports in Northern France to improve security and infrastructure. 'Using some of the best technology in the world, our officers prevented more than 18,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally in the year to April 2014 - a rise of more than 60 per cent on the previous year. 'We have also committed £12 million to further bolstering security at Calais and driven down the cost of back-office functions, allowing us to invest more in front-line operations.' David Hanson, shadow immigration minister, said: 'The Government has ignored repeated warnings from Labour and hauliers about the growing crisis at Calais. 'David Cameron needs to realise how serious this problem is and take urgent steps to work with our allies in Europe to sort it out. Under this Government, illegal immigration is getting worse. That's why Labour has put forward funded plans for 1,000 more border staff to help sort the problems out. 'It is unacceptable that the same people are trying night after night to enter Britain illegally. If they do not have the right to remain in Europe, why are the French authorities taking no steps to remove them?'","11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK between April and July .

"A teenager has claimed that her 'controlling' ex-boyfriend punched her so hard in the stomach when she was pregnant that she lost her baby. Brian Kerr, 21, was found guilty of assaulting 18-year-old Danielle Keenan and is facing jail after sending her a chilling message saying: 'I should have done more than hurt you.' He flew into a rage after Miss Keenan found the courage to move out of their home in Glasgow and followed her down the street before grabbing her and spitting in her face, a court heard. When Miss Keenan, who was 11 weeks pregnant, tried to defend herself, he allegedly responded by  punching her in the stomach. Danielle Keenan, 18, (left) as claimed that her 'controlling' ex-boyfriend Brian Kerr, 21, (right) punched her so hard in the stomach when she was pregnant that she lost her baby . 'He punched me in the stomach and it was such agony. I cried out in pain,' she told the Daily Record. 'Soon after, I knew I was bleeding. I got home and realised I was heavily bleeding and needed to get to the hospital. 'When the doctor told me I was miscarrying, I broke down in tears. 'I couldn't believe the person who had treated me like this was the same man that had once said he loved me. Kerr was meant to be sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday but told his lawyer he was too ill to appear. Miss Keenan decided to move out after he destroyed the home they were sharing, badly cutting himself in the process and dripping blood all over the floor. Pictured is Kerr's own blood. The couple met through friends last year and three months later she realised she was expecting his baby. Ms Keenan said he started becoming more controlling and would lock her up in the house if he went out and take her phone and bank card away. She said he would lose his temper at the slightest thing and revealed that he destroyed the home they were sharing, badly cutting himself badly in the process and bleeding over the floor. 'He got so angry. As I mopped up his blood, I kept thinking I could be next,' said Ms Keenan. He launched his vicious attack in August this year after she moved her belongings out of their shared house and even tried to lock her inside at one point. 'I stood up to him and got out on to the street, but then he just flipped. All I kept thinking was, 'my baby, my baby'. But I couldn't get away,' she said. 'I just kept walking and he grabbed me and spat in my face – it was so humiliating.' She also claimed that Kerr started taunting her on Facebook after the attack calling her 'fat' and a 'slag' and saying: 'See you at the scan.' When Miss Keenan replied saying she was bleeding, he said: 'Good, hope it hurts.' She went to police the next day and Kerr denied grabbing her and spitting on her, but was convicted. Although the charge that he punched her on the body was dropped, Miss Keenan is adamant that he caused her miscarriage. Kerr's sentencing hearing will now take place next month. Miss Keenan is hoping to warn other potential victims of domestic abuse not to ignore the warning signs that they are in an abusive relationship.

"A mother of nine who was shot a dozen times in her own hallway pleaded with her attacker: 'Do you think that's more than enough?' Catherine Delaney McCormack was shot at her home on June 13, 2008 in Clondalkin, south west Dublin. The 49-year-old victim answered a knock to her front door when the gunman attacked. Catherine Delaney McCormack was shot on Corcagh View, Clondalkin, pictured,  on June 13, 2008 . Speaking to RTE Radio, Ms McCormack said: 'I had shouted to them I was coming because they were waking the children. I opened the hall door. The person saw me. [Suddenly] I’m holding my stomach then and I’m on the ground. ‘I had funny sensations in my legs and I’m wondering like “what is this?” and then it dawned on me, “Oh my god, I’m being shot”. ‘I think I said something like “do you not think that’s more than enough?” and I shut the door. Then another two shots were fired through the door.’ Of the 14 bullets fired, 12 hit her in the legs, hip, back and stomach, piercing her bowel. Ms McCormack said: ‘I was constantly turning and shouting to the children to get back because I was afraid that they’d be hurt.’ A priest administered the last rites after the shooting in Clondalkin, Dublin, but she was discharged from hospital two weeks later. When she was interviewed by Irish police, they asked her whether she owed any money. 'I owe the ESB [an electricity supplier], i owe Eircom [a telephone service provider]. I have bills to pay. I didn't do anything illegal and I never have.' Nobody has been arrested an questioned in connection with Ms McCormack's shooting. On March 11, 2008, Ms McCormack was collecting a friend from Dublin Airport when an unidentified gunman fired four shots through her front door. Then on May 13, 2008, someone poured an inflammable liquid on her car and set it alight. Ms McCormack said she wanted Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan, pictured,  to help her with the case . One month later she was fighting for her life in Tallaght Hospital in Dublin. Ms McCormack said she informed detectives who she believes is behind the attacks. She earlier told  BBC Radio Five Live: 'I had all entry wounds and no exit wounds, which is a miracle in itself as I wouldn't be here now if they would have gone through. 'One of the detectives told me, that, normally if they are called out and somebody has been shot three times, they are being called out to a corpse.' She added: 'Bad things do happen to good people. People are inclined to judge you by what happens to you and that you really deserved it. That really hurts.'

"The decomposing bodies of two infants or fetuses have been found stashed in an abandoned storage unit after its new owner reported a foul stench. Regina Zimmer called deputies in Placer County, California in November after looking through the container at Sierra Self Storage when she won its contents at auction. She said the bag of decomposing bodies was found inside an ottoman that was sealed with tape. Inside were numerous garbage bags filled with food, toys and other items. 'As soon as we removed all the tape, got the lid off, it smelt really, really bad,' she told KCRA. 'It was a little skull. It looked like it was in three pieces, some hair. And you could see a jawbone.' Scroll down for video . Shock: Regina Zimmer found the remains of the babies in a storage unit she had just won at an auction. She said the bodies were in a bag stashed in an ottoman that had been sealed with tape . A deputy coroner later confirmed the remains were human. Investigators told the channel that the previous owner had defaulted on the rent for the storage unit and had not been there in months. The bodies are believed to have been there for around six months, CBS reported. 'You just don't just throw your child - your baby - into a trash,' Zimmer said. Sheriff's officials say detectives have interviewed a woman believed to be the mother - a 32-year-old woman. They are securing a search warrant for DNA tests and medical backgrounds. They're now waiting for the results of forensic and toxicology tests before determining how to proceed. Scene: The remains were found in a container at Sierra Self Storage, pictured. Authorities say the previous owner defaulted on the rent and they believe the bodies had been there for around six months . They will need to determine whether or not the babies were alive when they were born, as well as a cause of death, before they consider pressing charges. If the babies were alive at birth, the woman could face double-murder charges. The state allows healthy babies to be dropped off at locations, such as hospitals and fire stations. 'We're trying to determine the age of the fetus, if it was a viable fetus or if it was a miscarriage, and then it's just the illegal dumping of human remains if that's the case,' said Lt. John Poretti. 'A lot of things are thing are waiting on toxicology reports because they were in such poor shape. a lot of things we can't tell if it was a viable fetus or not.'

"Saying the word 'Redskins' on the air isn't obscene or profane - at least not according to the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC late Thursday afternoon dismissed a petition that called for one of the team's flagship radio stations not to have its license renewed.

But the FCC said that the law defines profanity as sexual or excretory in nature - meanings that don't relate to the name of the football team. Scroll down for video .

Snyder has vowed to keep it, despite mounting pressure over the past two years. Thursday's ruling affects the Snyder-owned station WWXX-FM.

"Will England qualify for the knockout stages? Will England qualify for the knockout stages? Now share your opinion . This time Andre Pirlo did his damage without touching the ball. It was a beautiful dummy, one which suckered in Daniel Sturridge and created the space for Claudio Marchisio to fire Italy ahead, with the crispest of drives. The Italians (and the natives of Manaus) celebrated in style and without injuring anyone in the process, but there would still be work to do in a wide-open contest. Here were two teams with reputations for strength at the back, who can be turgid, especially in the group stages of a tournament like this, producing an absolute thriller. The master at work: Andrea Pirlo played a key role as Italy kicked off their World Cup campaign . Crisp strike: Claudio Marchisio fires Italy ahead after Pirlo's step over . The round-by-round Rumble in the Jungle verdict . Round 1 (0-15 minutes): The old master and his young challenger stand off each other at first, with Welbeck more concerned with attacking and Pirlo unbothered, but the Italian fools England’s number 11 seconds before the end of the round with a dummy which eventually leads to nothing. Round 2 (15-30 minutes): Pirlo is dictating the play for Italy now. Welbeck looks dangerous out wide but leaves his man to take over in the middle with the two fighters backing off each other for now. Round 3 (30-45 minutes): The bearded maestro almost turns Welbeck’s cross into his own net before inspiring his team’s best moment, dummying on the edge of the area to fool the Englishman and allow the ball to break to Marchisio who slams home the opener. Round 4 (45-60 minutes): Pirlo controls the contest from range, not allowing himself to get drawn into a battle with his younger counterpart. Round 5 (60-75 minutes): Seconds into the 60th minute and it’s a knock-out as Roy Hodgson throws in the towel for Welbeck and he’s withdrawn from the contest. Italy left . holes, England left more and what a delight it was for Pirlo, one of the . finest midfielders of his generation with a gift for visualising the . game, and unpicking it with his passing and control. Two years on from . Kiev, a few degrees hotter with more hair on his face, he is still a . delight to watch and a master play-maker. Each . touch of the ball has an effortless caress, be it a two-yard roll of . the ball or the sort of 40-yard pass he threaded behind Leighton Baines . in the opening couple of minutes, or which he slid through on the . counter-attack late on for Ciro Immobile. So . much for the friendly handshake in the tunnel with Roy Hodgson, the man . he claimed called him Pirla, a light-hearted term of offence in . northern Italy, when he was manager of Inter Milan. He meant business. Pirlo . captained his team in the absence of Gianluigi Buffon, but could . England tame him? That would be the key from the outset. Jordan . Henderson had worked in training to monitor his movement, with Jack . Wilshere as the Pirlo double. Yet . Henderson did not want to leave Steven Gerrard’s side as they tried to . shield their back-four and Pirlo was content to play from deep, . particularly when he worked out Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva – . Italy’s dominant forces - were tormenting England’s left side. In control: Pirlo keeps the ball from Daniel Sturridge . Taking instructions:  Cesare Prandelli speaks with Pirlo and Mario Balotelli . All . the threat came from the Italian right. Pirlo noted this, and . manoeuvred the ball that way, sliding passes into the gaps where Wayne . Rooney had not tracked the runner or Leighton Baines had been dragged . out of position. It . is a sign of his understanding of the game. He stands where there is . room and the game gravitates his way. It is not an accident. There is . no-one in English football to match. He protects the ball never gives it . away and his head is always swivelling around, looking for openings, . checking out the movement around him.

"A schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his 'extreme' haircut grows out, which could take months. Liam Pegg, 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies - despite having the cut for a year. The Year 8 pupil now has to stay in isolation and will not be allowed to go out and socialise with other students, even at break times, until his hair grows out - which could be months. But Liam's father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception. Liam Pegg (pictured) 12, was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies . Tim, a 30-year-old carpenter, said: 'His haircut is a mix of a mullet and a mohawk. He spikes up the top, but leaves the back flat for school. 'He has had this haircut for well over a year and no-one has had a problem with it before, so I don't understand why it has been raised as an issue now. 'It's hardly an extreme hairstyle. I would understand if he had dyed it bright pink and had it spiked up all over the place, but it isn't.' Liam arrived at Nailsea School, in North Somerset, on Monday to be told he was no longer allowed to attend lessons with his friends and must report to isolation. Staff at Nailsea School (pictured) ruled he would have to stay in isolation until it grows back which could take months . The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before . The punishment involves students being taught in a room on their own, where they are set work and supervised by a member of staff. They are not allowed to go out and socialise with other students even at break time. The case is similar to that of Anthony Mousiou who was told he must study in isolation by Samuel Ryder Academy after his short-back-and-sides was just 4.5 millimetres too short and breached their uniform policy. Liam's parents, Tim and Claire, were informed their son had been placed in the special measure indefinitely when he arrived home from school. They say Liam has had the same hairstyle since he started at the school in September 2013. Mr Pegg added: 'We only found out that he had been placed in isolation when Liam came home and told us. We had no contact from the school. Liam's father Tim claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception . 'He has been in isolation all day, every day, since Monday. He is not in the classes he should be, socialising with other students nor taking any exercise. 'Surely this is against his human rights. When we went up to the school to discuss it we were told he would have to stay in isolation until his hair grows back. 'The headteacher said that in his opinion Liam's hair cut was inappropriate and extreme. There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide. But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy. The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy. A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion. 'If he has to wait until his hair grows back, he could be in isolation for months. This is outrageous and is effecting his education.' The school, which became an academy in September 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll, has been criticised for its strict dress code before. A number of years ago it hit the headlines after it banned female students from wearing skirts after problems with ones that were too short. Head teacher Chris Wade said: 'The governors and staff at Nailsea School are united in setting high standards as we firmly believe our role is not just to enable students to pass exams, but to prepare them for life as an adult in their future work. 'It is also important to instill in students an awareness of rules so that they can be functioning members of society. I do not apologise for having these high expectations and for reserving the right to take action when our standards are not met. 'On this occasion it appears the parents disagree with the school about what is seen as acceptable but I remain open to discussing this in person with them. 'Ultimately if parents are not convinced that the rules we adhere to are of benefit to them or their children they may choose to attend another school.' When students join Nailsea School, parents sign a home/school agreement in which they promise to ensure the children follow the rules. The school's uniform policy says: 'If students arrive inappropriately dressed for school, they will in the first instance, be spoken to by their teachers and, if necessary, by their head of house. 'We reserve the right to send home any student whose clothing, hairstyle or personal appearance is inappropriate for school.'","Liam Pegg was told he must be taught in isolation until his hair grows back .

"One can't help but stare at Phil the homeless kitten born in Boston without upper eyelids. The brave little feline would have gone blind had he not had life-changing surgery on December 9 to help him see again. The three-month-old kitten received successful surgery at the hand of Dr.Martin Coster from Angel Animal Medical Center, announced the MSPCA on Wednesday. Survivor: A homeless kitten named Phil received sight-saving surgery at Angell Animal Medical Center last week after he was born with no eyelids three months ago . Brave: Phil is expected to recover fully from the surgery and will be put up for adoption with his best friend, another adorable cat named Vixen . Phil was born with a condition called Agenesis which makes it impossible for him to blink and therefore would have caused his eyes to dry up and eventually stop functioning. MSPCA’s Boston adoption center manager Alyssa Krieger first came across Phil and Vixen at the Boston Animal Control shelter in Roslindale on November 24. 'I was immediately struck by Phil’s personality, in addition to the unusual situation surrounding his eyes,' she said. 'Even though his lack of eyelids caused painful irritation, he was still a typical and playful kitten. We were eager to get him back to Angel where we knew he could get the operating he needed to save his sight,' she added. Dr. Coster agreed to perform the operation with a novel form of surgery by taking some of tissue from the cat's lip and using it to form an eyelid. 'A cat’s upper eyelid is very similar in form and function to the tissue in their lip,' he said. 'By taking some tissue from Phil’s lip and attaching it to the muscles that enable him to blink, we can, in effect, reconstruct his missing eyelids.' Just one week after the surgery Phil is able to blink again and can lubricate his own eyes. 'I expect Phil to recover completely and there’s no reason to believe he won’t have a long and healthy life—with the pain and discomfort of his condition finally resolved,' said Coster. In around two weeks Phil is expected to recover and be put up for adoption with another cat named Vixen who is Phil's best friend. Recovering: Phil is expected to recover fully from the surgery and has maintained his playful spirit .

"A former Marine who stole a fire truck while naked and used it to kill a pedestrian has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Kalvin Hunt, 28, from South Carolina, was told of the verdict at Beaufort County Courthouse on Thursday before being remanded to a secure state mental health facility. Three qualified psychiatric forensic psychiatrists had analyzed his behavior linked to the 2012 incident, and ruled at that time he was 'not capable of controlling himself.' Former Marine: Kalvin Hunt, 28, from South Carolina who stole a fire truck while naked and used it to kill a pedestrian, has been found not guilty by reason of insanity . Hunt will now remain in care until he regains his sanity. If he is ever recommended for release there will have to be a new hearing. On February 24 2012 Hunt fled naked from a Naval Hospital in Beaufort where he was undergoing a mental evaluation and stole a Port Royal fire truck that was responding to a medical call at a nearby apartment complex. He then struck and killed 28-year-old Justin Nicholas Miller before crashing into woods. Along with murder, he was charged with six counts of hit and run with injuries, two counts of resisting, grand larceny and assault and battery in the first degree. Following his arrest, he was dishonorably discharged from the Marines. Prosecutors said Hunt's mother was concerned about his mental state at the time and was trying to get him help from the Veterans Administration. Flashback: Hunt joined the Marine in 2003 - Over the years he served at six different military bases and spent about seven months in Iraq earning various good conduct medals . Hunt joined the Marine in 2003. Over the years he served at six different military bases and spent about seven months in Iraq earning various good conduct medals. However, according to military officials, he was dismissed from the services in April 2011 after a court-martial in which he was found guilty of assault, communicating a threat, resisting arrest, and other charges. It was from this point that his behavior appeared to spiral out of control. Defense attorney Cory Fleming called it one of the saddest cases he has ever seen. 'We felt like this is where we were going from the beginning,' Fleming said of the insanity plea. 'It's heartbreaking, and I hope now Kalvin can get the treatment he needs.'","Kalvin Hunt, 28, from South Carolina, was told of the verdict at Beaufort County Courthouse on Thursday .

"HM Rvenue and Customs chief exeuctive Lin Homer will face questions on Monday about the strategy to not pursue criminal charges against tax avoiders . Hundreds of tax dodgers will escape prosecution and will be allowed to keep their identities hidden. Tax officials have decided to offer them immunity in exchange for payment of a penalty and their tax bills. The head of HM Revenue and Customs will be questioned on Monday by MPs about why at least 500 British tax dodgers investigated over the ‘Lagarde List’ will be protected from prosecution. The wealthy individuals all have secret Swiss bank accounts with HSBC, details of which were disclosed by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund. Lin Homer, HMRC’s chief executive, will be questioned by the Commons public accounts committee over ‘sweetheart’ deals which will give immunity to hundreds of tax evaders who have not paid tax on their offshore assets. Some 6,000 British names linked to HSBC bank accounts in Geneva were handed to the tax authorities in 2010 by Mrs Lagarde, who was then France’s finance minister. HMRC investigated 500 individuals for suspected fraud but only one has been convicted. After the Greek government failed to take action against the 2,000 industrialists, financiers and politicians on their version of the list, investigative journalist Costas  Vaxevanis published their names last weekend. To the fury of Press freedom campaigners, he was arrested and accused of breaching privacy laws before being acquitted on Thursday after a fast-track trial. Over the last two and a half years, HMRC’s investigations have only led to one prosecution. Property developer Michael Shanly – who is estimated to be worth £160million – was fined £400,000 after failing to pay inheritance tax on money left to him by his late mother in a Geneva account. Two years ago Christine Lagarde, who was then French Finance Minister, handed over details of 6,000 people who had HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland . editor . Critics have accused tax officials of . offering immunity deals to almost everyone on the HSBC list, whether . they owe a few pounds or billions, but this was denied by HMRC. Most of the bank account holders are . to be offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for paying their . outstanding tax bills plus a penalty. The deal means they will have . their anonymity protected. Only those who owe more than £25,000 . will face the threat of being exposed but even then they can appeal . against such a decision. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of . the public accounts committee, said she wanted to hold HMRC to account . ‘for whether they have been effective in collecting tax’. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, today said there was a growing sense that people not treated equally by the tax authorities . She added: ‘All these issues around . sweetheart deals and their ability in closing down tax avoidance schemes . are going to be the subject of endless questioning. ‘The mood of the country is really . changing. Wherever you sit on the political spectrum, people feel it is . just not fair that we are not treated equally by the tax authorities.’ Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, an . accountant, called for the culprits to be prosecuted. ‘We should name, . shame and prosecute in order to stop people from evading their taxes,’ he said. ‘HMRC has let things go for the last decade and the state of the UK’s finances mean it is time for them to show a firmer hand. ‘It is unfair to the millions of . hard-working taxpayers who contribute through PAYE that others sidestep . their fair share. It sends the wrong message.’ British residents have to pay capital gains and inheritance tax on any assets that are held abroad. The Inland Revenue has defended its actions, saying it has used ‘civil settlements’ for years. A spokesman said: ‘HMRC’s handling of . the HSBC data continues to be a major success. To date, over 500 . individuals have either been the subject of an investigation for serious . fraud or are under investigation. Some of these cases go back 20 years. ‘Additionally, we have successfully . prosecuted one individual and further criminal investigations are in the . pipeline. 'We expect to recover hundreds of millions of unpaid taxes and . our message to anyone who has not come forward is that they should do . so now.

"Migrants waiting in Calais for a passage to Britain have taken to burning the piles of rubbish that fill their makeshift camps amid 'health fears'. More than 2,500 migrants are thought to live in shanty towns which are strewn with rubbish around Calais, with some taking to burning the refuse that has built up around the camps. But despite the unsanitary conditions, the French authorities are simply releasing migrants caught trying to enter Britain, allowing them to make fresh attempts to cross the border. Migrants waiting for a passage to Britain have taken to burning the piles of rubbish that fill their makeshift camps amid 'health fears' More than 2,500 migrants are thought to live in shanty towns which are strewn with rubbish around Calais . Hundreds of tents are crammed into abandoned warehouses which have no access to running water or food . The camps are mainly populated by men hoping to start a new life in Britain, but hundreds of mothers and their children also live in unsanitary conditions in tent villages dotted around the port. Hundreds of tents are crammed into abandoned warehouses which have no access to running water or food. The squalid conditions are no place for young children, but pictures taken in the camp today show young boys and girls are among the migrants waiting for their chance to cross into Britain. Despite the unclean and rubbish-strewn environment, the number of attempts to cross into Britain has quadrupled in just three years, according to Home Office figures. Almost 3,000 attempts are made every month, which does not include those who made into Britain undetected. From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK. Meanwhile it emerged yesterday evening that more than 390,000 immigration cases have been built up by the Home Office – equivalent to the population of Cardiff. And last night it was revealed that rather than deporting the stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to make new attempts at breaching Britain’s borders.

Despite the unclean and rubbish-strewn environment, the number of attempts to cross into Britain has quadrupled in just three years . Almost 3,000 attempts are made every month, which does not include those who made into Britain undetected . Earlier this week, chief inspector of immigration John Vine said that the number of missing migrants in the UK totalled 89,000. But the Home Affairs Select Committee said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system – including asylum seekers and foreign criminals, with a report describing Britain's immigration system as being in 'intensive care'. On the backlog, Labour MP Mr Vaz added: ‘Our immigration system has left A&E and has entered intensive care.’ A string of explosive investigations by Mr Vine have been delayed for months, with ministers accused of slipping them out on busy days in order to try to bury bad news. Despite the unsanitary conditions, the French authorities are simply releasing migrants caught trying to enter Britain, allowing them to make fresh attempts to cross the border .

A report revealing citizenship had been granted to illegal immigrants and foreign criminals, including a killer, was issued at 10.30am on a Thursday, preventing MPs from being able to ask an urgent question about it in the Commons because of Parliamentary rules. The Home Affairs committee said: ‘It is unacceptable for the Home Office to withhold from public view reports produced by the independent chief inspector of immigration and borders for longer than one month without providing a good reason.’ Separate figures on immigration attempts, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request, show that in the year April 2011 to April 2012 migrants were caught trying to enter Britain 9,632 times. By last year the figure had almost doubled reaching 19,003. But this year the number has risen sharply. At current rates, more than 35,000 illegal immigrants could have been caught by the end of the year.","Migrants in Calais burn rubbish in their shanty towns amid 'health fears'

"David Cameron was engrossed in his daily 4pm strategy meeting with George Osborne in 10 Downing Street when an aide appeared and slipped a sheet of paper in front of him. It was a copy of a gushing profile of Theresa May in Spectator Life magazine. The article was about to be published – deliberately timed in the days running up to the Home Secretary’s appearance last month as a castaway on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. Both were key elements (along with a TV interview with Andrew Marr) in what was seen as a carefully-orchestrated media blitz by Mrs May. Scroll down for video . Theresa May is the overwhelming choice of Tory activists to be their next party leader - and No10 has been looking for the chance to punish the increasingly confident Home Secretary . Understandably, this triggered speculation that she was ‘on manoeuvres’ to position herself as the prime candidate to take over the Conservative leadership should Mr Cameron lose May’s general election and step down. What’s more, the profile – the author of which had clearly got the co-operation of the Home Secretary’s colleagues who wanted to show a more human side of her – contained withering criticism of Mr Cameron. The PM soon spotted a devastating quote from an unnamed friend of Mrs May, saying: ‘She doesn’t rate Cameron any more… slowly she has seen just how incompetent that operation is. How the PM will say he will do one thing, only to be drawn in another direction. She’s given up on him.’ Not surprisingly, particularly at a time when the Tories should be pulling together to fight off the dual threat of Labour and Ukip, these incendiary remarks were seen by Mr Cameron and his Downing Street team as a declaration of war by the ambitious Home Secretary, who is the overwhelming choice of Tory activists to be their next party leader. But what also leapt from the page was a quote from Nick Timothy, Mrs May’s longest serving special adviser. Glowingly, he said: ‘Read her speeches. They go way beyond being a mere technocrat, they have a vision what the future should be about and what politics and the party should be about.’ David Cameron (right) reportedly 'signed off' a recommendation to suspend two aides of Theresa May (left) after they refused to take part in canvassing for the Rochester and Strood by-elections . Such an encomium from a minister’s special adviser was unprecedented. In 25 years reporting at Westminster, I can’t recall a special adviser – a temporary civil servant employed to help a minister on matters where the work of Government and the work of the minister’s party overlap – being quoted in the media by name. Anonymity is not merely Whitehall convention, it is a clear Civil Service rule that special advisers, who are political appointees paid for by the taxpayer, should not be named in such briefings. The fact is that Mr Timothy, who is paid £74,000 a year and has been with the Home Secretary since 2010, must have spoken on the record with her knowledge. Nick Timothy (pictured), the Home Secretary's most senior aide, was quoted in Spectator magazine praising Mrs May - and has now been blocked . The assumption, therefore, is that Mrs May authorised her staff to promote her image and vision for the future of Britain. The co-operation of Mrs May’s advisers with Spectator Life magazine was seen by Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and Tory party chairman Grant Shapps as just the latest act of treachery from the Home Office team. The poisonous briefing against Mr Cameron to a magazine, regarded as the in-house journal of the Tory right, is all the more remarkable considering that in June, Mrs May was left badly bruised after the traitorous behaviour of another of her special advisers, Fiona Cunningham, who was revealed to be the source for a vituperative newspaper attack on Mrs May’s Cabinet rival Michael Gove over Islamic extremism in schools. No10 has been looking for the chance to punish the increasingly confident Mrs May. The perfect opportunity came when her most senior aide, Mr Timothy, sought selection as a candidate for a safe Tory seat. He was blocked and another of Mrs May’s team, Stephen Parkinson, has also been suspended from the party’s approved candidates list after Mr Cameron signed off a recommendation from party chairman Mr Shapps. Ultimately, the two men’s political ambitions have been sacrificed as part of Mr Cameron’s brutal reaction to Mrs May’s campaign to succeed him. Many Tories say that Mr Timothy’s devotion to his boss has backfired. A ministerial source told me: ‘For two years, he’s been running a thinly-disguised leadership campaign for Theresa May. He has not been playing by the rules and is very rude. Rather than stab people in the back, he’s brazen enough to stab them in the front.’ With less than five months to go before the general election, Theresa May and her team of aides are playing a potentially suicidal game – for history shows that voters punish parties that indulge in pointless and petty civil wars.","Senior aide Nick Timothy quoted in magazine praising the Home Secretary .

"They brought us roads and a clever sewer system. But it seems the Romans also knew a thing or two about making concrete. While Britain’s 1960s concrete towerblocks and flyovers are crumbling, Roman monuments such as the Pantheon and the Colosseum are still standing. Now scientists have discovered the secret ingredient behind the longevity of Roman concrete – volcanic ash. Scientists have discovered a secret ingredient used in Roman concrete which explains why some of their greatest monuments, such as the Colosseum (pictured), are still standing . The study by the University of California, in Berkeley, found Roman concrete showed no corrosion, with a smooth surface suggesting long-term stability. Manufacturing modern cement requires heating a mix of limestone and clay at 1,450C. But Roman architectural mortar uses 85 per cent volcanic ash, fresh water and lime, which is cast at a much lower temperature, significantly reducing its carbon footprint. Now the researchers want to take the Roman techniques and apply them to modern cements. Dr Marie Jackson said: ‘If we can find ways to incorporate a substantial component of volcanic rock in the production of specialty concretes, we could greatly reduce the carbon emissions associated with their production. We could also improve their durability and mechanical resistance over time.’ The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, involved using beams of X-rays on a reproduction of Roman volcanic ash-lime mortar. While Britain’s 1960s concrete towerblocks and flyovers are crumbling, the Pantheon in Rome is still standing . In the concrete walls of Trajan’s Markets in Rome, constructed around 110 AD, this mortar binds cobble-sized fragments of tuff – consolidated volcanic ash – and brick. The team observed the mineral changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900-year-old samples of the original. They discovered that the concrete contained particular water-based elements that prevented it from cracking.","Volcanic ash made up more than 85 per cent of Rome's architectural mortar .

"PC Neil Doyle, 36, died after an early morning assault on a group of three officers near a city centre nightclub - just weeks before his honeymoon . Detectives investigating the death of off-duty police constable Neil Doyle have arrested a man on suspicion of murder, Merseyside Police said tonight. The 28-year-old suspect handed himself in to police this evening and is currently being interviewed by detectives, officers said. Pc Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon by three men in what his boss described as an unprovoked and vicious attack. He may have been targeted because of his job. Badly beaten, he lost consciousness and died in hospital. Two colleagues were also injured in the incident. Police say it appears the gang of attackers knew their victims were off-duty officers. Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, said: 'Constable Doyle was enjoying a Christmas night out with his work colleagues. 'They were subjected to an apparently unprovoked and vicious attack by a group of males. There is no indication whatsoever that they were involved in any kind of argument or altercation earlier in the evening. 'The officer I have spoken to has indicated that the individuals who approached them referred to them as police officers. 'They then assaulted the officers, leaving two with nasty head injuries and resulting in the tragic death of Neil.' The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt. Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. The street remained cordoned off last night as forensics officers looked for clues. Ryan McMahon, who owns the Aloha club outside which the attack happened, said his doormen told him the officers and their attackers appeared to know each other. 'There were two groups of three men walking past Aloha when they started fighting each other,' he said. 'A couple of punches were thrown, then one of them stumbled over toward a car on the other side of the road – he didn't fall down at first. 'After a couple of minutes when he didn't get up his mates went to help him. 'Our doormen went over and tried to resuscitate him, performing CPR until the ambulance came. There were a lot of off-duty police officers there by that time. 'Some female officers were really upset, screaming and shouting.' Scroll down for video . He was attacked today along with two other off-duty policemen near Aloha Bar, in Liverpool (pictured), prompting a murder investigation . Merseyside Chief constable Sir Jon Murphy has revealed that an officer told the force the attackers appeared to have recognised their victims . The two off-duty officers who were with Mr Doyle needed hospital treatment – one for a fractured cheekbone and the other for a less serious facial injury. Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. Sir Jon said the constable was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years. He had won a commendation for arresting three violent robbers. The Chief Constable said it was a 'sad day' for Merseyside police and sent his 'heartfelt condolences' to Mrs Doyle and the officer's family. Flags were flown at half-mast at police stations across Merseyside as a mark of respect and Peter Singleton, chairman of the area's Police Federation, said colleagues were devastated. 'He was a good, well-liked, hard-working bobby who did his best to support the community,' Mr Singleton said. 'He had commendations from the force for his good work. Sometimes it seems hollow and false to say these words but he really was a good, skilled, dependable cop, who would always do his best for the public. 'If you're a sergeant, police constables like Mr Doyle are exactly what you want. He will be sorely missed.' Mr Doyle's wife, his mother, Theresa, 61, and brother, Greg, 42, were too upset to talk and were being comforted by friends and family last night. One neighbour, Margaret Murphy, 61, said: 'It's such a shock. Neil was a lovely lad, very quiet and unassuming. I can't get over it. I saw his wife and brother this morning, they were very upset. 'They told me Neil had passed away after an incident in town. It's so terrible, especially so close to Christmas.' Another neighbour, Theresa Doyle, who is no relation, added: 'Neil was a lovely neighbour, very polite. 'He wasn't the type to get into trouble – if anything I would guess he had stepped in and tried to solve a problem. He was a really good character. They kept their lives very private. To be honest you would never have known he was a police officer. 'I just feel for Sarah now, and how she copes without him. It is such a shame. It is such sad news.' Last night police said anyone with information should contact Merseyside police on freephone 0800 230 0600 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. A murder investigation has been launched and the scene has been cordoned off while forensic examinations take place . Two other off-duty policemen, who were with the victim and were also assaulted, were taken to hospital this morning and have now been discharged .

"Martin Bell has been jailed for at least 12 years for the brutal killing of Gemma Simpson, whose body was not found for 14 years . A family of a woman who was attacked with a hammer before having her leg sawn off have been left furious after her killer was ordered to serve just 12 years behind bars. Martin Bell, 45, said God told him to kill 23-year-old Gemma Simpson when she was at his flat in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 14 years ago in May 2000. Today, Judge Peter Collier QC said Bell's prison term was limited by the laws at the time and the fact Bell pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Speaking outside court, Miss Simpson's father, Glenn, said he was 'disgusted' by the sentence, but did not blame the judge. He believes Bell manipulated the legal system and says he hopes Bell  'rots' for what he has done. Mr Simpson said: 'He brutally killed Gemma - our Gemma - and left her buried in the ground for 14 years. We served that 14 years. He has 11 (left) to serve. We believe he has manipulated the system.' Jailing Bell for a minimum 12 years at Leeds Crown Court today, Judge Collier said: 'The killing of Gemma Simpson was brutal. Your treatment of her body after death was dreadful. But your culpability was considerably diminished by your mental illness.' The court heard Bell had been sectioned in a mental hospital for around nine months in August 1999 and was released around six weeks before he killed Miss Simpson. Simon Myerson QC, prosecuting, told the court Bell launched a 'frenzied' attack in which he repeatedly struck Miss Simpson with a hammer and then stabbed her in the back and neck an 'uncountable' number of times with a kitchen knife. Bell then filled a bath with water and left Miss Simpson in it for four days with her hands tied behind her back because he was 'frightened she would come back to life'. Mr Myerson said Bell closed the shower curtain so he did not have to see the body and repainted his flat with lilac paint to cover the blood stains. He hired a car but found  he could not fit Miss Simpson's body in the boot, so he sawed off the bottom of his victim's legs. Bell, who has been diagnosed with a psychotic illness, told police he did this 'as fast as I could so I wasn't sick'. He wrapped Miss Simpson's body in a sleeping bag and secured it with chains and a padlock 'so she couldn't get out'. Gemma Simpson (left) was  killed in May 2000. Her father, Glenn, (right) today slammed the sentence handed to her killer, who he claimed had manipulated the legal system . Bell then drove her to Brimham Rocks, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, where he dug a hole with a shovel and buried her. Mr Myerson told the court that Bell, who was 30 at the time of the attack, had known Miss Simpson for around five years. On the day of her death, the pair met at Leeds railway station before going back to Bell's flat in Harrogate. Bell was questioned by police after Miss Simpson was reported missing and said the young woman had called him to ask if she could stay with him but he had not seen her that day. In July this year, Bell rang a former girlfriend and told her he had killed someone 14 years ago. He then handed himself in at Scarborough police station. During his interviews, Bell took police to Brimham Rocks and showed them where he had buried Miss Simpson, and her remains were recovered. He said he had visited the site four or fives times since Miss Simpson's death. Police forensic teams at Brimham Rocks near Leeds earlier this year, after Miss Simpson's body was found . Bell told police he had considered confessing in the past but his mother was still alive and he was concerned about losing his freedom. Paul Greaney QC, defending Bell, told the court the defendant heard voices telling him to do things and had 'developed complex delusional beliefs' which saw him moving around the country because he believed a group of men were trying to kill him. Mr Greaney said the doctor who discharged Bell in 2000 accepted that the delusions had not disappeared at that stage. A psychiatric report carried out after Bell's arrest diagnosed his mental illness as schizophrenia. Judge Collier earlier told the court it was a difficult and unique sentencing exercise as he had to consider the law as it was 14 years ago and, also, the fact that Bell is not currently showing the psychotic illness he was suffering from at the time. The judge also noted he has not committed any acts of serious violence since he killed Miss Simpson. Emma's father, who was comforted by his daughter Naomi Carrick, said outside court: 'All we can say now is we hope he rots.' Police searched Bell's home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire after he confided to a friend about the killing . The family issued a statement through West Yorkshire Police which said: 'Gemma was a young woman in the prime of her life who raised a smile and lit up every room she entered. 'Her family will never come to terms with the loss of Gemma. We are victims as well.' They added: 'There is no sentence which can be imposed which will reduce the pain and suffering Martin Bell has caused Gemma's family during the past 14 years, whilst all the time he was leading a normal life. 'He left us in limbo for each one of those years. A total of nearly 5,000 days of pain in which we worried constantly for Gemma and her wellbeing. 'That chill in our hearts became an integral, perpetual part of our lives and the knowledge that Bell could watch all of our and the police's efforts to find her while going on with his own affairs for so long quite simply beggars belief. 'While we now know what happened to our daughter, there is a shadow on our lives which will never be lifted and Bell is the cause of that. 'Our beautiful Gemma was a bright shining light in our world. A light which Martin Bell extinguished.'","Martin Bell attacked Gemma Simpson with a hammer and knife in 2000 .

"If you have time on your hands and the urge to wander, it could be the ideal proposition for you. A luxury travel firm is offering a 365-day tour spanning four continents and 32 of the most exclusive hotels on the planet. The only catch is the price – because at £220,000 per person, it is likely to be well outside most people’s price range. Starting in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the holiday takes in Asia, North Africa, Europe and the United States – ending 19 countries later in India. Scroll down for video . And in case it didn’t seem decadent enough already, the trip also includes an 11-night stay in the Aman Canal Grande hotel in Venice – where George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin held their lavish wedding ceremony in September. The year-long jaunt is being offered by Asia specialist Ampersand Travel and hotel group Aman, and it is understood a number of wealthy clients have already expressed an interest. James Jayasundera, managing director of the company, said: ‘This trip will feel like being part of a private club and guests will be treated like royalty. It aims to appeal to high net worth individuals in need of a pampering sabbatical.’ However, should travellers really need to get in touch with the office, Mr Jayasundera promises that ‘each hotel offers connectivity’. The itinerary is designed to celebrate the best of each country, with visits timed to take in the most awe-inspiring sights. It begins in March 2015, with spring in Bhutan – when the Himalayas are alive with flowers. Next is Thailand, where travellers will have access to a private white sand beach and the opportunity for excursions on the Andaman Sea. Then it is a tiny tropical island, Pamalican, in the Cuyo Archipelago in the Philippines. The idyllic atoll is less than 600 yards across, and the surrounding Bohol Sea is the perfect spot for sailing, windsurfing, fishing or snorkelling. The year-long trip also includes an 11-night stay in the Aman Canal Grande in Venice, pictured . George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin held their lavish wedding ceremony at the Aman Canal Grande in September . Following that is Beijing, with a chance to explore four of China’s Unesco World Heritage sites including the Summer Palace. Sushi and Tokyo’s Mount Fuji come next, then a Balinese marine reserve. And despite this extensive tour of Asia probably being enough for most holidaymakers, the tour then heads for Europe after a relaxing cruise down the Indonesian archipelago. The first stop is Greece, and – after a stay on the Turkish coast – the trip heads to a 15th-century village in Montenegro. Late September is spent in Venice. Then, as the northern hemisphere braces itself for winter, the tour returns to Bhutan. And just in case the trip becomes a bit too relaxing, travellers can get their blood pumping on the ski slopes of Utah, Wyoming and the French Alps. At the end of January the tour heads to Sri Lanka, before finally ending in rural India. However, the company is keen not to exclude those whose diaries are looking a bit too full to justify a whole year on holiday – and they are also offering the trip in a series of 90-day breaks.","Tour spans four continents and 32 of the most exclusive hotels in the world .

"Betty Williams, 86, has reserved every table at a local pub so that lonely people can enjoy a festive dinner together this Christmas . A widowed former school teacher has hired out a pub to lay on a Christmas lunch for 50 strangers - likely to cost £1,000 - just so they won't feel lonely over the festive season. Betty Williams, 86, who lives in West Hill in East Devon, has reserved every table at the Lamb and Flag pub in Ottery St Mary and will foot the bill for the traditional turkey dinners and bottles of wine. The pensioner, who was originally going to keep her identity a secret, lost her husband 12 years ago and has found herself along over the Christmas period in recent years due to a lack of close family and an inability to travel. And this year, determined not to eat by herself again, she made the reservation and extended an open invite to people who would otherwise be on their own. The former Italian and French secondary school teacher said: 'I've been watching programmes on television about food banks and people by themselves being in trouble. 'Every time my post comes there is a request for money, and I thought rather than send the money abroad, why not help local people? 'I just thought it was the sort of gesture I could make to people in the local community who might be in trouble. That was my only intention. It has completely snowballed.' Mrs Williams, who doesn't have any children, has since received donations of more than £1,000 from as far as America and Holland after her news of her plight went international. The Oxford University graduate added: 'I don't have any close relatives at all. I was an only child, my husband was an only child, and we live miles away from other relatives. 'My nearest relatives at the moment are in Derbyshire or Kent - a long way away.' She first approached the town's mayor, Glyn Dobson, to see if he thought the idea was reasonable and after little persuasion he stepped in to help organise the event. He said: 'It's a very kind gesture. I think it is because she has been on her own. 'It is people who wouldn't be having a Christmas lunch or spending it alone. Most of them are local people and they are mostly elderly.' He added that the lunch on Tuesday, December 23, for those who live in the parish will start at 12.30pm. The Lamb and Flag pub in Ottery St Mary will host the Christmas lunch, set to cost around £1,000 on Tuesday . Along with a full dinner with all the trimmings, the generous pensioner has also ordered two bottles of wine for each of the 12 tables. At the full price, such a spread will cost £21.95 per person for food and £14.95 per bottle of wine - a total of £1,097.50 if 50 people turn up. However, the pub is offering an undisclosed discount. Cllr Dobson added:  'The pub are very happy. They thought it was lovely. In the town, it's all been very positive. 'She [Mrs Williams] hopes to come but she said don't count on it. If she does come, I will say the generous lady is here and we will give her a round of applause.' And the generous benefactor will not be spending Christmas Day alone in her £490,000 house in the small village either. 'I have been invited out by some friends to go to their house [on Christmas Day] and by other friends on Boxing Day,' she said. 'I thought I was going to be on my own with a tin of soup.' .","Betty Williams, 86, has reserved every table at the Lamb and Flag pub .

"Police are searching for a woman who is brazenly stealing packages from doorsteps in a Dallas, Texas neighborhood. Surveillance cameras outside two separate homes have captured the woman climbing out of a car, casually approaching the front of the house, snatching mail and then jumping back in the vehicle. One couple, Missy and Ken Clinchy, shared their footage on Facebook and are offering a $100 reward for any information that leads them to the identity of the thief. Mrs Clinchy said she was expecting three packages to be outside her home but when she returned, they were not there - and on looking at the surveillance footage, she was stunned by what she saw. Scroll down for videos . Brazen: A woman can be seen casually strolling towards a house in Dallas on surveillance footage .

Her husband added: 'I think we were shocked at how casual she was walking up to the door.' When they posted the video online, they discovered another piece of footage from another resident who lives 10 minutes away showing the same woman - in the same clothes - stealing packages. From that home, she stole an electric smoker that had been outside the home for an hour. The Clinchys said the package stolen from their home came from Amazon and contained some Christmas presents and dog food, but they fear for other families. 'While I am upset about the stuff someone stole from us, I've heard someone had their wedding invitations stolen,' Mrs Clinchy wrote, the Dallas Morning News reported. Not the first time: Another security camera outside a home 10 minutes away, caught her stealing three packages from the doorstep on the same day. The owners are now appealing for information . Victims: Missy and Ken Clinchy said they were stunned at how casual the woman appeared on the tape . 'Someone else had [personalized] gifts for their kids stolen, and they can't replace them in time for Christmas. I put myself in their shoes. Our stuff can be replaced. But I don't want this to happen to someone else with stuff that really means something to them.' The couple hopes by posting the footage on social media, someone will recognize the woman. She is seen climbing out of the passenger door, suggesting she is working with someone else. Police are now searching for the woman.

"Kursish forces are celebrating their greatest victory over ISIS after claiming they have broken the five-month siege of Mount Sinjar - liberating thousands of trapped Yazidis. Around 8,000 fighters launched a two-pronged attack which they said had succeeded in opening a wide corridor to allow members of the Yazidi minority to escape. In the initial phase of the assault they recaptured eight villages - killing 80 ISIS militants in the process - and Peshmerga commanders say the evacuation of those trapped on the mountain will begin today. An estimated 7,000 to 10,000 members of the religious minority have been stuck in the mountains and not able to reach safety. Scroll down for videos .

Masrour Barzani, the son of the Kurdish president and the intelligence chief for the Iraqi autonomous region, confirmed that the peshmerga advance had broken the siege on Mount Sinjar. The Kurdish advances came during a two-day blitz into the Sinjar region with some of the heaviest air strikes since a US-led coalition started the campaign four months ago . Kurdish peshmerga soldiers began their offensive on Wednesday to break the jihadists' siege and announced yesterday that they had been successful in opening a corridor through which Yazidis could escape . 'Peshmerga forces have reached Mount Sinjar, the siege on the mountain has been lifted,' he told reporters from an operations centre near the border with Syria. The fighters said they recaptured eight villages on the way and killed about 80 ISIS fighters in the initial phase of the offensive launched from Rabia on the Syria border and Zumar on the shores of Mosul dam lake. They also lost seven men on Wednesday in Qasreej village when they failed to stop a suicide attacker who rammed an explosives-laden armoured vehicle into their convoy, officers at the scene told AFP. Breakthrough: Iraqi Kurdish forces gather to see bodies of ISIS militants killed during fighting on Mount Sinjar on Wednesday . Liberated: The Kurdish advances succeeded in opening a wide corridor to allow members of the Yazidi minority to escape the siege - they will be evacuated today . The peshmerga lost seven men on Wednesday in Qasreej village when they failed to stop a suicide attacker . 'This operation represents the single biggest military offensive against IS and the most successful,' a statement from Mr Barzani's office said. A devastating ISIS attack on the Yazidi minority's Sinjar heartland in August displaced tens of thousands of people and was one of the reasons put forward by US President Barack Obama for launching a campaign of air strikes in September. Amid fears of a genocide against the small Kurdish-speaking minority, tens of thousands of Yazidis fled to the mountain and remained trapped there in the searing summer heat with no supplies. Kurdish fighters, mostly Syrian, broke that first siege but remaining anti-ISIS forces were subsequently unable to hold positions in the plains and retreated back to the mountain in late September. Kurdish officials said the operation had dealt the jihadists a blow by cutting their supply lines and forcing them to retreat to urban bastions such as Tal Afar and Mosul, their main hub . Trapped since August: Thousands of Yazidis fled to Mount Sinjar five months ago as ISIS militants swept across their homeland - but soon became stranded as jihadists closed in around them . A Yazidi member of the Iraqi-Kurdish peshmerga at their base on the top of Mount Sinjar prior to this week's victory - which commanders have called their greatest over ISIS yet . The peshmerga commander for the area said troops had reached the mountain and secured a road that would enable people to leave, effectively breaking the siege. Several thousand are still thought to be trapped there. 'Tomorrow most of the people will come down from the mountain,' Mohamed Kojar told AFP by phone, explaining the offensive had secured a corridor northeast of the mountain. Kurdish officials said the operation had dealt the jihadists a blow by cutting their supply lines and forcing them to retreat to urban bastions such as Tal Afar and Mosul, their main hub. ISIS still control the town of Sinjar, on the southern side of the mountain, and many of the surrounding villages. In Washington, meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that three top IS leaders in Iraq had been killed in US air strikes in recent weeks. The US bombed areas in Sinjar ahead of the Kurdish peshmerga's successful attempt to liberate the city . On guard: A Peshmerga fighter stands behind sandbags at a checkpoint in Zummar city yesterday . 'I can confirm that since mid-November, targeted coalition air strikes successfully killed multiple senior and mid-level leaders' in ISIS, spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement. 'We believe that the loss of these key leaders degrades ISIS's ability to command and control current operations,' he added. The most significant figure was identified as Haji Mutazz, better known as Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who was deputy to the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. There was no hint that Turkmani had been killed on the jihadist social media accounts and forums that usually relay such information. The jihadist group proclaimed a 'caliphate' over parts of Iraq and Syria nearly six months ago after sweeping through Iraq's Sunni heartland and throwing the country into chaos. The U.S.-led coalition in the Middle East launched 11 air strikes against ISIS targets today, hitting six targets in Syria and five in Iraq (file photo) A peshmerga fighter runs past a building  with Arabic writing scribbled on it that reads 'Stop the Islamic State' in this photo taken in Zummar city in the northern Iraqi Governorate of Nineveh yesterday . A second wave of attacks in August against Sinjar and towards the borders of Kurdistan triggered a US intervention that has now grown into a 60-nation anti-IS coalition. The strikes were extended into Syria on September 23. The military fightback appears to have gradually turned the tide on the jihadists, who have suffered a string of setbacks in Iraq in recent weeks. Battle lines are more static in Syria, where the West is not coordinating its air campaign with the regime.","Up to 8,000 peshmerga fighters launched assault opening up escape route .

"Women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time, a report will recommend today (file picture) Just 34 women will be tough enough for front line action, it has emerged. It comes as the first female to command an all-male squadron has warned that putting women on the front line could make the army less effective. Major Judith Webb said that women were 'physically different' - even though she believed in 'equality'. Her comments came as a report recommended that women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time. The Ministry of Defence is moving towards the historic change after a six-month review into whether women should be able to serve in infantry and tank regiments. Female fighters could be in combat roles as soon as 2016, senior defence sources have told the Daily Mail. But the review estimates that, on current levels of recruitment, around seven women a year would pass through training to qualify for infantry units and around the same number for the RAF Regiment, according to The Telegraph. About 14 would qualify for the Royal Armoured Corps and only six for the Royal Marines. The review has quashed doubts within the MoD that allowing women to serve in frontline roles would damage the ‘cohesion’ of the armed forces on the battlefield. Military top brass will say there needs to be further research into the ‘physiological demands’ placed on those in close combat roles. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Major Webb, who retired in 1986, said: ‘We had a maximum of four women in my squadron and it was perfectly natural and normal for the guys would do all the heavy jobs and those jobs that were physically demanding while women would do the slightly less physical it was just the normal course of events. ‘When we are talking about an infantry section of eight guys and you’ve got one person who is not actually as physically strong or as physically capable as the other seven over possibly an extended period of time, which is what has not been tested, that could create an effect on our combat effectiveness,’ added major Webb, who was the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the British Army. A senior defence source told the Mail: ‘The review has concluded ministers are minded to approve women in combat roles.’ Last night politicians welcomed the findings, which are due to be published today. Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Defence Select Committee, said: ‘This is a challenging but hugely welcome step forward that will help make our armed forces the very best they can be. 'Keeping our country safe is too important to exclude anyone who can play a role – that means giving women the chance to serve on the frontline in addition to all the other ways in which they are excelling already in the forces.’ But some senior officers fear that repealing the centuries-old rule will lead to a drop in standards in the armed forces. Major General Patrick Cordingley called the change a ‘mistake’. Mr Cordingley, who commanded the Desert Rats during the first Gulf War, told the Mail: ‘There is a political imperative. However, I think that it is a mistake from the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence is moving towards the historic change after a six-month review into whether women should be able to serve in infantry and tank regiments (file picture) 'I can understand why politically it is a good thing to be seen to be doing – on the other hand, the practicalities of women in the infantry and armoured corps are considerable and should not be overlooked. ‘Being in a fighting unit, you need to concentrate on the enemy, you don’t want distractions looking after women, which inevitably you will do. It is a diversion.’ Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, previously said women fighters would harm the ‘warrior ethos’ and damage the fighting capabilities of the soldiers. Women can already find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers. They also serve with distinction as combat pilots. In light of the findings, a senior military source said: ‘There is a real desire among ministers and the military to open up ground combat roles to women. ‘This detailed review is a big step forward in the process, however, it is clear further work needs to be done before a final decision is taken. Labour MP John Woodcock (left) said allowing women into infantry and tank regiments 'a challenging but hugely welcome step forward', but Major General Patrick Cordingley (right) called the change a 'mistake' ‘The wellbeing of all our personnel is of the utmost importance, but there is genuine hope this will be a reality come 2016.’ If the plans go ahead, women on the frontline will be subject to the same physical tests as men. It is understood only a small minority of the 16,000 women serving in the armed forces would want to or be capable of passing the tests. The next research programme is expected to deliver a report in 2016, which will inform a final decision on whether the exclusion can be safely lifted. Britain is behind the times on the matter compared to other countries. Of the 28 members of Nato, just two others, Turkey and Slovakia, still bar women from combat roles. The US lifted its ban last year, joining countries including Germany, Canada, France and Israel. As part of the UK review, thousands of officers and members of other ranks across the armed forces were invited to fill in a confidential questionnaire.","MoD moving towards change after review into women on the frontline .

"The great Christmas getaway is under way, with 20 million cars expected on the roads today as people travel home for the festive period. This evening is expected to be the busiest time of the Christmas period with the combination of the usual Friday peak, the start of the school holidays and early break-ups for some workers being blamed. There have been several accidents on motorways across the country this evening, which has led to severe delays and a heavy build up of traffic. Motorists on the M25 at Dartford in Kent sit in traffic as motorists gear up for what is set to be the busiest day on the roads during Christmas . There are currently severe delays on the M62 in West Yorkshire and two lanes are closed because of a crash involving three vehicles. Elsewhere, there is one lane closed on the M6 in Lancashire between Carnforth and Lancaster due to an accident involving a lorry. There are delays on the M60 in Manchester at Ashton Under Lyne because of an accident and there is disruption and slow traffic at Bishops Stortford because of barrier repairs on the road. On the M42 in Worcestershire, one lane is closed at Portway due to a broken down lorry. There are also delays on the M6 West Midlands due to an earlier accident, but all lanes have now re-opened. There is heavy congestion on the M20 in Kent and queuing traffic on the slip road at the Channel Tunnel. The M4 in Berkshire is grid-locked because of earlier broken down vehicle and there is heavy traffic on the M1 between Daventry and Dunchurch, in Warwickshire. Motorists were already caught up in tailbacks this morning, as several families made attempts to beat the rush, and police reported a steady build-up of traffic across the country. There were several crashes across the country this morning including three in the space of half an hour in Brighton, East Sussex, and in one incident, six cars were involved in a pile-up at a busy junction of the A23, blocking two lanes. In another incident, a car span off the road. No one was hurt in those incidents but police said they 'caused widespread traffic congestion' north of Brighton, on the day where the most cars are expected to take to the roads. On one of the busiest days for travel in the year, motorists crawl out of Bradford, in West Yorkshire, this evening . This evening is expected to be the busiest time of the Christmas period - pictured, cars make their way home in the lashing rain in Bradford . Police forces across the country reported a steady build-up of traffic this morning, which is believed to peak after 4pm today . Liverpool Street Station in London is busy even at lunch time today as passengers start to make their commutes to loved ones by train . Earlier today, in Surrey, a main road through Epsom was blocked, causing chaos in the area, after a lorry slammed into a railway bridge. The Maxi haulage lorry was 'crumpled by the encounter' said Surrey Police roads unit. While the busy B3068 Blandford Road in Poole, Dorset, remains closed in both directions between the Rigler Road junction and the Ivor Road junction, because of a gas leak. Diversion are in operation via the Twin Sails Bridge. The main A6 through Northamptonshire is blocked at the Obelisk Road junction in Finedon after a crash involving at least two vehicles. Meanwhile, approach roads to Heathrow and other main airports and cross-Channel terminals were congested as travellers battled to board planes and ferries. Delays on the rail network also led to hold-ups for passengers attempting to get to two other major London airports. For Gatwick-bound travellers, there were problems for the third day running due to, initially, signalling problems at Burgess Hill in West Sussex and then staff shortages on the Thameslink and Great Northern routes. Those travelling towards Stansted were delayed by a signal problem at the Essex airport's rail station around lunchtime. There were also other delays on the network during rush-hour, causing chaos for thousands of passengers today. Passengers join the queues at Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport in London as they prepare to get away for the Christmas holidays . AS many as four million Britons are expected to head overseas over the festive period, which is slightly more than last year . Top winter sun destinations include the Canary Islands, Tunisia and Morocco, while the leading long-haul destinations are Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Egypt . Approach roads to Heathrow and other main airports and cross-Channel terminals were congested today as travellers battled to board planes . South West Trains' passengers were held up by a broken-down train at Wimbledon in south-west London, while a signalling problem near Canley in the West Midlands led to delays to services run by the CrossCountry, London Midland and Virgin Trains companies. In Kent and East Sussex, signalling problems between Ashford International and Rye caused hold-ups and in northern England, safety checks at Crossflatts in North Yorkshire led to delays to trains between Keighley and Shipley. On the England/Wales border, flooding meant trains had to be replaced by buses between Shrewsbury and Machynlleth, with the disruption expected to last until at least 8pm. In Devon there were delays of up to an hour between Plymouth and Exeter St Davids after a person was hit by a train at Totnes. Travellers on Thameslink and Great Northern routes were warned to expect short-notice cancellations, delays and alterations to services owing to the staff shortages. Chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, Charles Horton, apologised to passenger saying: 'Regrettably, despite our best efforts, some services have been cancelled because we have not had enough drivers for all our rail services, especially given the essential training we are undertaking at the moment to deliver Thameslink Programme works. 'We inherited this issue when we took over the franchise in September and we are determined to address it. Thank you for your patience and please accept our apologies. We are determined to make things better.' Tweeting passengers appeared less than impressed. Aran Beedham said the Thameslink situation was 'now descending into a farce' while a tweet under the title Trainslate spoke of 'the ridiculous driver-shortage excuse'. Candy Cane Staiano tweeted: 'Thameslink (formerly run by equally rubbish First Capital Connect) your train service has been shocking this week! Hang your head in shame.' This Maxi lorry got stuck after it slammed into a railway bridge in Epsom, Surrey, this morning. Police say it was 'crumpled by the encounter' Traffic flows on the M4 near Datchet earlier today. By this evening it is expected to be congested as motorists make their Christmas journeys . Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has warned motorists to stay out of flood water as they head off after revealing last Christmas Eve was the busiest day in the last five years for flood rescues. More than 640 vehicles were rescued from flood water on Christmas Eve last year by the AA, while the Environment Agency issued 450 flood warnings and alerts on the same day. The RAC, which predicts more than 12 million cars will take to the roads between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, is urging drivers to prepare well for journeys. RAC national operations manager Matt Dallaway said: 'December has seen the UK's weather take on a distinctly unsettled and for some of us wintry flavour, and the signs are that this could continue through the week when many of us will be taking to the roads. 'So the message is for drivers to plan for their journeys ahead of time, and make sure their vehicles are properly winter-proof.' As many as four million Britons are expected to head overseas for the festive period, which is slightly more than last year. Top winter sun destinations for Britons included the Canary Islands, Tunisia and Morocco, while leading long-haul destinations included Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Egypt. Pinch points: The ten worst spots on the roads, according to the report today by traffic specialists INRIX . But those staying at home might have to contend with disruption to train journeys over the holiday period as a £200million rail engineering programme gets under way. Among routes being disrupted is the West Coast line where major work is going on at Watford, Hertfordshire and between Stafford and Crewe, Cheshire. There is also work at Reading, Berkshire, while tomorrow will see the start of a 16-day part-closure of London Bridge station for work involving the £6.5billion Thameslink programme. Network Rail and industry body the Rail Delivery Group have stressed the need for the work to go on during a time when few commuters travel. But customer watchdog Passenger Focus said: 'For passengers wanting to travel over the Christmas period, engineering works can be a major inconvenience, especially if it means having to use rail replacement bus services.'","After 4pm today is expected to be the busiest time of the whole Christmas period to be on the roads across the UK .

"An Afghan veteran and another soldier have been convicted of running an illegal payday loans business. Lance Corporal Charles Trouliotis made thousands by charging squaddies interest rates of up to 40 per cent. He used money from an Army compensation payout to lend £31,000 to around 30 soldiers, using his senior rank to threaten them with punishment duty if they did not pay him back on time. Trouliotis and Corporal David Crouch, both of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, denied two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one of money laundering but were convicted by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court. Charles Trouliotis, left, and Corporal David Crouch, right, both of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, denied two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one of money laundering but were found guilty . Trouliotis, 25, of Victoria, London, who is no longer a soldier, was given a 12-month community order with 160 hours of unpaid work. Couch, 28, of Woolwich Barracks, was fined £300 and told to pay a £30 victim surcharge. Stuart Jessop, prosecuting, said father-of-one Trouliotis used his senior rank to bully and threaten his subordinates to pay back 'exorbitant' amounts of interest. Mr Jessop said: 'There's no doubt that you were a first class soldier and a brave soldier. You were highly decorated. 'But you were running an illegal money lending business for profit. 'You used the fact that you were respected and well liked to help you with this money lending business.' One private gave evidence to say that an initial loan of £400 spiralled into a £1,800 debt and he was threatened with punishment duty if he failed to pay. Mr Jessop added: 'He was struggling to pay you back because you were charging exorbitant interest. The two men ran their illegal payday loans business at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, pictured . 'You would say 'where's my f***ing money you will go on standby if you don't pay this money'.' Standby is army slang for a punishment where superiors order someone to do unwanted jobs. A text from Trouliotis's phone to Couch accused him of having 's**t' money lending skills. It read: 'You realise the palava you have caused us with your shit money lending skills. You are a f**king c**t Dave and I should never have trusted you.' Trouliotis, who is no longer a soldier, told the jury of seven men and five women that he hadn't sent the text. He accepted that he had lent the money and accepted 'good will' overpayments from 23 subordinate privates as well as four lance corporals and two corporals. But he denied that he set interest rates and threatened them if they failed to pay by payday.

"Families can look forward to a bargain Christmas with prices falling at their fastest rate in 12 years. Black Friday and a raft of offers drove retail prices down by 2 per cent in November compared with a year ago, triggering the biggest rise in sales in a decade. At the same time, supermarkets are in the grip of a price war and food bills have fallen by 1 per cent. Scroll down for video . Retail prices were down by 2 per cent in November compared with a year ago, triggering the biggest rise in sales in a decade . Stores are slashing prices to get customers through the doors and grab a share of an estimated £5billion that is expected to be spent between now and Christmas Day. Promotions are being ramped up at major department stores, such as House of Fraser and Debenhams, plus the likes of Gap, H&M, Argos and Marks & Spencer. John Lewis has been dragged into the fray because it has to match rival department store prices under its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ promise. As families prepare for the biggest shopping weekend of the year, it seems the cost of a turkey dinner and presents for the family will be lower than in 2013. The growth in retail sales hit a ten-year high in November, largely driven by special offers around Black Friday and Christmas, according to the Office of National Statistics. The number of items going through tills in the High Street and online rose by 6.4 per cent on the same month last year, which is the biggest increase since 2004. Heavy price cutting fuelled a 15.4 per cent rise in sales through department stores in the month, while sales of electrical goods were up 32 per cent on a year ago. The net result was that despite significant price cuts, shoppers spent an average of £400million a week more in November than last year, taking the total up to almost £32billion. The figures were much stronger than expected by analysts, who said the rise was largely down to promotions ahead of Christmas. At the same time, wage rises are now beginning to outpace inflation with the result families feel a little better off and confident about their finances. Economist Sam Alderson, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ‘The falling cost of essential items such as fuel and food has brightened the economic environment facing UK households in recent months and freed up income for families to enjoy over the holiday season.’ The ONS said: ‘Average store prices fell by 2 per cent in November 2014 compared with November 2013, this was the largest fall since August 2002. The largest contribution to the year-on-year fall once again came from petrol stations, however, prices in food stores showed their largest fall since June 2002, decreasing by 1 per cent.’ The head of retail at accountants Deloitte, Ian Geddes, said price cuts and promotions in November drove the spending binge. The growth in retail sales hit a ten-year high in November, largely driven by special offers around Black Friday (pictured) and Christmas, according to the Office of National Statistics . ‘This year most of the boost provided by the biggest ever Black Friday has been felt in November, and this is reflected in month-on-month volume growth and strong year-on-year increase online,’ he said. ‘The extent to which sales have been promotionally driven is highlighted by the steepest decline in store prices for 12 years.’ Economist Alasdair Cavalla said: ‘Continuing price falls, rising real wages and the Black Friday “retail holiday” combined to push the figure to its highest annual growth rate since May 2004. ‘Growing sales volumes were supported by average price falls in stores of 2 per cent. ‘Price discounts at large retailers boosted sales at department stores by 15.5 per cent and household goods stores by 16.8 per cent year-on-year. The volume of electrical household appliances sold rose at the highest annual rate since records began, gaining 32 per cent on the year. ‘Falling oil and commodity prices are certainly helping consumers to keep spending.’ Some analysts suggested families brought forward their Christmas shopping to November because of Black Friday. If that is the case, it seems stores will have to step up price cuts in the coming days to shift stock. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to forecasting group the EY ITEM Club, said: ‘November’s Black Friday proved a boon for retailers ahead of the Christmas period with retail sales growing at their fastest rate for over ten years. Electrical goods in particular saw a storming performance. ‘However, November’s spending splurge could presage a disappointing Christmas period for retailers. Black Friday and other temporary factors will have brought forward some sales activity so a sharp reversal in sales growth in December seems likely. ‘That said, there is reason for optimism looking forward. The fundamental drivers of consumer spending are looking more solid and growth in earnings may finally be starting to pick-up.’ The ONS said sales through web stores in November were an average of £753.4million a week, which was up by 12.9 per cent on the same month last year. Figures published earlier this week suggest online spending for 2014 is likely to burst through the £100billion barrier for the first time. A household income tracker published by Asda today suggests families have £11 more per week to spend on festive treats for family and friends than they did the same time last year. The study pointed out that wages are now growing at 1.6 per cent a year, which is above the official inflation rate of 1 per cent. It said people typically have £179 per week in their pockets, after taxes had been deducted and bills paid for. Retail expert Fraser McKevitt, of Kantar World Panel, believes food price falls are likely to continue into 2015 as the price war rumbles on.","Cost of a turkey dinner and presents will be lower this year than in 2013 .

"Mariella Frostrup has urged parents to be aware of the danger of online paedophiles when buying tablets or smartphones for Christmas . They are now must-have gifts for many children. But Mariella Frostrup has urged parents to be aware of the danger of online paedophiles when buying electronic devices such as tablets or smartphones for Christmas as they provide youngsters with access to a risky ‘unknown universe’. The presenter, 52, revealed her fears for her daughter Molly, 10, and son Danny, eight, as they begin using social media. Despite their young age they both have tablet computers. And Miss Frostrup, who is married to their father, human rights lawyer Jason McCue, 43, said she has been left checking their devices every night, after hearing stories from her friends about their children being targeted on sites such as Instagram. Miss Frostrup, who presents the Radio 4 programme Open Book, said: ‘I like to think of myself as a liberal, not driven to heights of hysteria by prevailing media headlines, but when it comes to the sexualisation of our children and the predatory presence of paedophiles I’m starting to feel the fear. ‘A friend emailed me the other night to say she’d deleted her daughter’s Instagram account after finding, among 70 or so school friends in a supposedly private stream, the profiles of three grown men who displayed disturbing enthusiasm for her photos of 10-year-olds.’ Earlier this year Miss Frostrup also learned of another friend’s teenage son’s ordeal after being targeted on YouTube. In the age of celebrity culture, some children seek to emulate their favourite stars by gaining thousands of online followers. And Miss Frostrup said the teenager was left traumatised and needing therapy after being targeted by a predator who used the promise of more followers on the video sharing website to lure him in. She said: ‘[He] found himself inundated with new friends on Facebook after posting a particularly “entertaining” video on a site recommended by his favourite YouTubers. These new friends assured him he had star potential and promised to quadruple his following if he met them on an unregulated site. ‘For kids who dream of the superstar status of YouTube sensations like the Jacksgap twins [sibling video bloggers who found fame with their channel about gap year travels], the quest for followers can be a dangerous obsession. Warning: Miss Frostrup, 52, said she was beginning to fear the 'predatory presence of paedophiles' online . 'He befriended one in particular, a supposedly abused girl who wanted his help and began sending him pictures of her abuse. Pandora’s box flew open and an avalanche of pornography involving men and kids poured forth which he found deeply disturbing but was too embarrassed to tell anyone about. ‘In a matter of weeks he’d been enticed into hell and his new “friend” was revealed as an adult man. Luckily, he eventually broke down and told his mother. Several visits to the police station and many hours of counselling have returned her traumatised son to the happy-go-lucky, confident creature he once was.’ Miss Frostrup made her comments in her Waitrose Weekend column, becoming the latest in a number of high profile names to voice concerns about the safety of children online. She said: ‘As we flock this festive season to purchase our kids their dream presents – tablets and smartphones, laptops and similar devices – I offer this as a salutary reminder that it’s not just in news stories that young people are being targeted and abused. We are buying our kids entry to an unknown universe and with “location access” switched on, a tracking device for strangers.’ Miss Frostrup she went on to say she had been compelled to check her children’s tablets every night for ‘visitors’ after hearing about the ordeals of fellow parents. She said: ‘I like to think of myself as a liberal, not driven to heights of hysteria by prevailing media headlines, but when it comes to the sexualisation of our children and the predatory presence of paedophiles I’m starting to feel the fear.’ Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron revealed a criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created . Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron revealed a criminal offence of sexual communication with a child is to be created - closing a staggering loophole in the law. Paedophiles who currently solicit explicit pictures of children routinely escape punishment if it can’t be proved they have received an illegal image. But the new law will allow police and prosecutors to pursue those who send text messages or ‘fish’ for victims online, irrespective of the outcome of their behaviour. The new offence criminalises anyone over 18 years of age who communicates with a child under 16 if the communication is sexual or intended to elicit any sexual response. Experts believe it could prevent interactions from escalating to more serious forms of criminality such as grooming or actual abuse. And Miss Frostrup said she fears for the safety of children online, with the education system ill-equipped to teach children about the true dangers of the web. Miss Frostrup said: ‘With sex education a luxury tag-on in most hard-pressed Ofsted-regimented schools, a generation of young people are being confronted with disturbing imagery they can’t process, predatory adults masquerading as their contemporaries and the continued objectification of girls and women (and increasingly young boys). ‘It’s on my mind every night when I check my children’s tablets for unwelcome visitors and wonder about the grave new world they are growing up in.’","Mariella Frostrup urged parents to be aware of risky tablets and phones .

"A drunk 18-year-old driver who killed a father-of-three just moments before he crossed the finish line of a charity bike ride has been jailed for five years. Bethany Mackie admitted to killing Christian Smith, who was raising money for mental health charity Mind by cycling 248 miles between Kent and Sussex in just 24 hours. On March 22, moments before he finished the race, the 38-year-old was struck by a car near Whitstable, Kent. Police said Mackie drove for another 400m before stopping. Jailed: Bethany Mackie (left) admitted to killing Christian Smith (right), who was raising money for mental health charity Mind by cycling 248 miles between Kent and Sussex in 24 hours. She was jailed for five years . Mackie, who was driving a blue Peugeot 206, was arrested at the scene and admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being at the wheel with excess alcohol in her system  last month. Since Mr Smith's death, more than £82,000 has been donated to mental health charity Mind on his JustGiving page – breaking his original target of £1,000 by more than 8,000 per cent. A black box device fitted by Mackie's insurance firm to her car revealed she had been driving at up to 76mph on the 60mph road moments before the crash. Mackie, of Herne Bay, Kent, sobbed throughout her sentencing hearing at Canterbury Crown Court today as Mr Smith's widow Katie Smith read a deeply emotional victim impact statement. Mrs Smith spoke movingly of her struggle to deal with their three children's devastating questions about their father's death. These included 'Why is Daddy gone?', 'Why didn't the car stop?', 'Where has Daddy gone now?' and 'Please make daddy come back'. Heartbreaking: Mr Smith's widow, Katie, pictured outside court today, fought back tears as she read an emotional victim impact statement. She described the moment that her husband was hit by Mackie in March . Fighting back tears, Mrs Smith told the court: 'I was alone with him on that road and I tried desperately to save him, but I couldn't. 'This is something I will always feel guilty for. A short time later I had to wake up my 12, nine and five year old to tell them that their daddy was dead. 'The sounds that they made can only be described as horrifying. I have heard that sound many times over the last few months - from my own mouth as well as theirs. 'My husband Christian was a very present father who loved his family more than anything, and the gaping hole that has been left in our lives will never be filled. 'Since the morning of his death I have tried daily to answer the questions of my three children. These questions always have the same theme, asked with varying degrees of sophistication. Sentenced: Mackie, seen arriving for sentencing today, admitted causing death by dangerous driving . 'Why is daddy gone?, Why didn't the car see him?, Why didn't the car stop and help? Was daddy dead straight away? 'Why didn't the ambulance save him?, Where has daddy gone now? What has happened to his body? Is daddy's body still in the road? What is cremation? 'If daddy's body is at the hospital where are his head, arms and legs? What did daddy look like in the road? Please make daddy come back. 'Will we be bankrupt now daddy is gone? Will we be homeless? 'As a parent my job is to help my children with any questions and worries they may have. 'I chose to do this with Christian and now he is gone I am doing this alone with the worst possible questions that any person should have to answer.' Mrs Smith went on to speak of the heartbreak she suffers from preparing for events such as Christmas and school plays without her husband's support . And looking to the future, Mrs Smith told of her anguish that her husband will not be around to walk their daughters down the aisle. Prosecutor Amy Packham said Mrs Smith accompanied her husband on sections of the ride, as well as a friend, Marc Farr. At the time of the crash, Mrs Smith was driving in front of her husband, with Mackie travelling in the same direction in her Peugeot. Miss Packham told the court: 'Mr Smith was wearing appropriate clothing for the night's cycling. 'In fact, earlier he had put on reflective clothing, including on his shoes and the back of his trousers and his top half, and he also wore a cycling helmet.' Miss Packham said Mrs Smith became aware of a 'noise' from behind her and soon realised her husband had been struck. In her statement to police, Mrs Smith recalled seeing a car in her rear view mirror, and how she had to pull over to prevent a collision. Mrs Smith returned to her husband and called an ambulance but despite 'significant efforts' to revive him, he was declared dead at the scene, Miss Packham said. A post-mortem examination confirmed he died from multiple injuries, which included a fractured skull and 'devastating' internal organ injuries. Emotional: Mrs Smith told Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) of the heartbreak she suffers from preparing for events such as Christmas and school plays without her husband's support. Mackie sobbed throughout . Two police officers who attended the area spotted two people - Mackie and a male friend who was her passenger - walking away from a parked car with a damaged windscreen, roof and near-side. Miss Packham said alcohol was smelt on Mackie and more than two hours later she gave a reading of 73mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than twice the drink-drive limit. She told police: 'I didn't see him. He didn't wear any reflectives at all.' Wrongly thinking that the speed limit was 70mph, she added: 'I'm sure that I was doing 69mph.' Miss Packham said the aggravating features of the case included Mackie's excess speed, her alcohol consumption and the fact she left the scene. Mackie's defence counsel Tom Allen said: 'I want to openly acknowledge on behalf of Miss Mackie her awfulness of what has happened and an acceptance on her behalf of her culpability.' He said Mackie had held a driving licence for four months. She had been out that night in her home town and was driving a male friend home after he had split from his girlfriend, he added. Mr Allen said Mackie was 'extremely inexperienced both in life and in driving'. He went on: 'This would appear to be the chief contributory factor in what led to this offence.' Mackie who has nine GCSEs, had started working as a childminder and was on an apprenticeship at a nursery working towards an NVQ at the time of the crash. 'Subsequently, all of that has been put on hold,' Mr Allen said. He said Mackie came from a 'warm and loving' family and was of previous good character. Jailing Mackie, Judge Adele Williams said: 'I have no doubt that because of alcohol, your ability to drive was seriously impaired and you failed to see Christian Smith.' She added: 'It's plain that Christian Smith was a loving and loved husband, father, son and brother. His family's loss, grief, pain and anguish are very great indeed and will continue to be. 'The sort of questions that his children ask of their mother are heart-wrenching. Nothing I can say or sentence I pass can make their loss any easier.' Mackie showed no emotion as the judge also banned her from driving for five years and said she would have to take an extended driving test. Sergeant Glyn Walker, from the Kent Police Roads Policing Unit, said afterwards: 'This was a tragic incident that has had far-reaching consequences for everyone affected. 'Christian Smith's death has had a devastating impact on his family, friends and everyone else who knew and loved him, and our thoughts are with them today. 'Bethany Mackie must now live with what she has done for the rest of her life.'","Bethany Mackie admitted to killing father-of-three Christian Smith in March .

"When Steven Isles' father went missing five years ago in highly publicised circumstances, he was touched by the outpouring of support he received from friends and strangers. This week Mr Isles, from Townsville in Queensland, was devastated by the deaths Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. But he was particularly upset at the prospect of Ms Dawson's three children having to spend their first Christmas without their mother. So the 34-year-old decided to start a Christmas card drive to let Oliver, Chloe and Sasha know that the whole of Australia was thinking of them at this difficult time. Scroll down for video .

Mr Isles' father Senior Sergeant Mick Isles disappeared on his way to a training course in 2009 and his body was never found. While an inquest was held in 2012 Steven Isles suggested there was foul play involving other police. His father had been investigated over money laundering and drug trafficking, and while he was cleared of any wrongdoing his relationship with other officers suffered as a result. The inquest eventually found that Mick Isles 'intentionally took his own life', after his car was found abandoned with keys on the floor under the steering wheel, and a shot gun and ammunition were missing from the family home.

"Heavyweight boxer Dereck Chisora threatened to kill a man who blocked his Mercedes in a car park and has been ordered to do community service . Heavyweight boxer Dereck Chisora shouted and swore at two men who blocked in his car and threatened to 'smash their faces in' and 'kill' them during a parking rage row, a court has heard. Chisora, of Golders Green, north London, pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour, with intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence, towards Majid Rezaei and Mansor Nikpor in nearby Finchley Road on December 8. The 6ft 1in former British and Commonwealth champion was sentenced to a year's community order including 60 hours community service work. Prosecutor Miss Inder Gohlar told Hendon Magistrates Court: 'One of the complainants lives at the address, a house of multiple occupancy with a communal car park. 'When they returned the car park was full and the resident, who was in a friend's car, decided to park in such a way it blocked the vehicles in the car park and they left a note inside their windscreen with a mobile phone number if anyone needed them to move. 'The driver, Mansor Nikpor, states: ""Having left the contact number we walked towards the Post Office and were passed by a large black man wearing sunglasses, a red jacket and dark tracksuit bottoms. 'He immediately started shouting and swearing at us, saying he was in a hurry and wanted us to move the car. 'We said that we would move it and there was no need to swear and continued walking to the Post Office. 'We returned and again the man began swearing and shouting at us and said: ""If you don't move your car I'm going to punch you, smash both of your faces and then the car.''' The 30 year-old fighter had lost his European heavyweight title a week earlier after retiring in the tenth round during his bout with Manchester's Tyson Fury at London's Excel Arena. Miss Gohlar added: '[Chisora] continued to swear and they went into the building because of his aggressive behaviour. 'This defendant followed them into the building and continued swearing and Mr Rezaei stated that he was going to call the police.' The row erupted after Chisora's car was blocked in near this property in Golders Green, north London . Miss Gohlar added: 'The defendant said: ""Call the police, they won't do anything, you're wasting my time. I'm late for my appointment, I'll kill you."" 'He poked Mr Rezaei in the chest with his finger as he said this and stood in the doorway swearing at them, saying he was going to smash their faces and punch their heads in.' Police arrived and an agitated Chisora, who was 'frantically shaking his hands', told the officers: 'I told him to move his damn car. I've been waiting for ages. 'When I leave here I'll be getting my guys to come back and deal with them.' Miss Gohlar said: 'He continued his aggressive behaviour in front of the police. In summary It was a continuous tirade of behaviour and an indication of threats, saying that he was going to kill.' Chisora must also pay £100 compensation to each victim, £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. The court heard Chisora has two previous public order convictions, plus an offence of violence, for which he received a suspended prison sentence in November, 2010. His lawyer, Michael Neofytou, said: 'He's made no bones about it and he has pleaded guilty. This series of events began through no fault of the defendant, but he accepts his behaviour was unacceptable.' The incident happened  a few days after Chisora was beaten by Tyson Fury (right) and lost his European title to his rival at the ExCel Arena in London . Mr Neofytou added: 'The complainants parked the vehicle in an obstructive way, blocking in this defendant's vehicle and when he asked them to move it they continued to cross the road towards the Post Office.' 'This would not have happened if they had moved their vehicle. They refused to move it because they did not like the way he was talking to them. 'Having been blocked in he lost his cool and his frustration got the better of him. He's a professional sportsman, an athlete, he's a professional boxer and he is in a position to pay.' The court's probation officer, Denise Ryan, dealt with Chisora when he received the previous suspended sentence. She told the court: 'He trains and he boxes in the evening so a night time curfew would be too restrictive, it's his livelihood, he's the breadwinner, he's got a seven month-old daughter. 'There's an up and coming fight in February and he would like to get done before that. He could do one day a week to complete the work. 'I would recommend forty to sixty hours work. That would allow him to concentrate on the training.' Chisora was stripped of his licence to fight for a year in 2012 after an ugly brawl with fellow boxer David Haye at a press conference after a boxing match in Germany . Bench chairman Mike Wallace told Chisora: 'We've heard of threats to smash both of the victims' faces, you poked one of them in the chest, made threats to kill both of them, followed them to the address and continued to make threats to smash their faces in and continued when the police arrived.' Zimbabwe-born Chisora, nicknamed 'Del Boy', was stripped of his fight licence after a press conference punch-up with David Haye in February, 2012, which followed a catalogue of disciplinary offences. He had to pay for £250 an-hour anger management sessions after also slapping Vitali Klitschko at their weigh-in, spitting water at the Ukrainian boxer's brother Wladimir and biting an opponent.","Dereck Chisora admitted in court to having lost his temper .

"Tragic: Choudhry Zishan, pictured, a father of one, was brutally murdered by two brothers as he headed to work in the early hours of the morning . Pictured for the first time, this is the face of father-of-one Choudhry Zishan, the hard-working newsagent who was brutally murdered by two brothers as he headed to work in the early hours of the morning. The release of Mr Zishan's photograph today comes as the men convicted of his murder, Jonathan McKinley, 23, and Samuel McKinley, 25, were jailed for life. The McKinleys will both serve at least 28 years behind bars before being eligible for parole over the killing of the 35-year-old in March, a court official confirmed. Mr Zishan, 35, had left his pregnant wife, Sabina, and five-year-old son in bed as he left his flat to work at one of his stores in Southampton, Hampshire. But as he walked towards his car at about 4.30am, he encountered the McKinley brothers who were 'spoiling for a fight', jurors heard. The drunken thugs launched the attack on Mr Zishan and demanded his money before savagely beating him, ramming his head into a parked car. Prosecutors told the trial that what began as a robbery turned into 'gratuitous violence' by the brothers against father-of-one Mr Zishan in Eastleigh, Hampshire. Winchester Crown Court heard that the McKinley brothers had spent much of the previous evening drinking in the Litten Tree pub. CCTV footage shown to the jury captured the moment the McKinleys met their victim at a pedestrian crossing, and further footage showed some of the attack in the distance. Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC told the trial Jonathan McKinley put his arm around Mr Zishan and began to talk to him before they started to follow him as he walked away down the High Street. It became clear that Mr Zishan wanted nothing to do with the brothers, Mr Langdon said, before the pair embarked on a 'bewildering' and 'deeply shocking' attack. This week, Jonathan McKinley, of Chandler's Ford, and Samuel McKinley, of no fixed address, were both convicted of his murder. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Brothers Samuel (left) and Jonathan McKinley (right) murdered Mr Zishan in a mugging outside his home. They will both serve at least 28 years in jail before being eligible for parole . Following the brothers' convictions, relatives of Mr Zishan paid tribute, describing him as someone who 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. His family said the McKinleys deserved to spend the rest of their lives behind bars to protect others. Mr Zishan's younger brother, Ali Fayyaz, 32, said: 'He looked after everyone, his whole family. 'He was very hard-working and was always thinking of the future. He never really cared about money. He respected the elderly and youngsters.' Mr Zishan's older sister, Tayyaba Iqbal, said: 'He was my best friend. There are four sisters and two brothers. He was everything to me. He was close to my heart.' 'He wouldn't hurt a fly. I just wish he had been able to save himself.' She said the family was still reeling from his death. Caught on camera: A police video revealed yesterday shows the moment two brothers who brutally murdered Mr Zishan were arrested, with one asking police officers: 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke' Protest: During Samuel McKinley's (pictured) arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for'. The attack on Mr Vishal was described as 'senseless' and 'brutal' She added: 'We cannot even think of doing anything without him, especially my mother.' The family said they found it hard to put into words their thoughts on the McKinleys. Mr Fayyaz said: 'They should spend their whole life in prison. At least then other people will be safe.' Zafar Iqbal, his brother-in-law, said: 'He was a saint. He was even looking after an elderly neighbour. He was a great gentleman.' Crime scene: Mr Zishan, who had a five-year-old son and a baby on the way with his pregnant wife, could not be saved and died from extensive brain injuries after the attack in Eastleigh . Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive. 'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage. Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes. 'But thanks to local people who came forward with information, we were able to quickly piece together what happened, arrest the suspects later that morning and build the case against them. Police videos revealed yesterday showed the McKinleys' apparent confusion at being told they were being arrested on suspicion of killing the 'family man'. Several hours after the attack in the early hours of Sunday, March 30, police arrested both McKinleys on suspicion of murder and filmed the arrest with covert cameras. When arrested, Jonathan was secretly recorded saying, 'What?!  'Are you f****** stupid?! Are you actually being stupid?! Nah, come on, seriously. Nah, be serious.' During Samuel's arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for. I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke.' Three calls from witnesses to the police describing their accounts of the attack have also been released. One caller said: 'There are three youths outside my house. Two of them seem to be beating another one up, demanding money off him. 'One of them is yelling 'Give me your money. Give me your money.' And one said 'It's okay, I've got him in a headlock.' And they seem to be crashing into cars and things.' Another said: 'I think that someone's been mugged or attacked. I can see someone on the floor, and someone's saying 'Give me the money now'. Someone else was saying 'I will stab you if you don't give me the money.'' A witness added: 'There's a savage attack going on. They're battering him. They're hitting cars, going behind vans. They're chucking him around. You can hear it.' Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There are agencies that can try and help people but some people are beyond help unfortunately. I suspect the McKinleys are in that situation. 'Choudhry Zishan was a family man and a businessman who was well known and liked within the community in Eastleigh. Witnesses described how the father-of-one was crying in pain as the brothers carried out their violent attack . 'He'd been walking to work on the morning of Sunday, March 30, when he was approached by the McKinley brothers who tried to rob him. 'They'd been drinking throughout the night and things escalated quickly to the point where they threatened him and began beating him. 'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive. 'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage. 'Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes.

"Mohammed Rafiq (pictured) 80, organised a horrific revenge acid attack on his teenage ex-girlfriend . A pensioner who organised a revenge acid attack on his teenage girlfriend after she broke up with him was jailed for 18 years yesterday. Mohammed Rafiq, 80, paid Steven Holmes £50 to spray a corrosive liquid in the face of Vikki Horsman in April. The care worker, who was 19 at the time and had coverted to Islam for him, spent five days in intensive care after suffering burns to her face, neck and body. Rafiq, Holmes and Shannon Heaps, who identified the house in Tividale, West Midlands, where Miss Horsman was staying, were found guilty last week of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Nicholas Webb, sitting at Wolverhampton Crown Court, said the attack was a ‘wicked’ act. Jailing Holmes, 25, for 14 years, he described him as ‘callous and lacking in true remorse’. Heaps, 23, was jailed for 12 years. Rafiq persuaded the pair to carry out the attack after he became convinced that Miss Horsman had a new boyfriend. Judge Webb told the pensioner: ‘She had decided she didn’t want to continue her relationship with you and you became jealous and angry. ‘You obtained the acid and left it at the front door of the house for Holmes to pick it up and throw.’ He added: ‘Acid attacks are not uncommon in certain parts of the world. Thankfully, they are rare in England. Quite often they are to punish a woman who has refused to bow to the demands of a spouse. ‘In such cases it is done to leave a permanent reminder of what happens when a woman rejects attempts to control her.’ Vikki Horsman, pictured before the attack (left) and leaving Wolverhampton Court (right) was sprayed with a corrosive liquid after answering the door to Holmes on April 15 this year, and later spent five days in intensive care after suffering burns to her face, neck and body . The judge pointed out that Miss Horsman had been vulnerable when she met Rafiq following the death of both her parents. Speaking of the attack, she said she thought it was ‘the end’ and could feel her skin lifting ‘layer by layer’. She said: ‘I could feel my airways going tight, my lips blistering and just swelling ... agonising pain.’ Doctors told her she faces years of reconstructive surgery. Rafiq was also convicted of perverting the course of justice after he lied to police and blamed innocent people for the attack.

"A deadly 15-foot Burmese python looking for a place to crash slithered its way to a real estate office in Florida's doorstep on Thursday and employees lined up to pose with the incredibly strong reptile. Employees at Beau Middlebrook's Sun Realty office got quite a surprise when they saw the gargantuan snake wriggling its way closer and closer to their work space located on the Isles of Capri. David Beatty captured the python and held onto the snake until the FWC trapper could arrive, reportsWTSP. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big catch: Employees at Beau Middlebrook's Sun Realty office got quite a surprise when they saw the gargantuan snake wriggling its way closer and closer to their work space located on the Isles of Capri . Not a pet: Because pythons are sometimes kept as pets, wildlife workers scanned the animal for a microchip to see if it belonged to anyone but as it turned out it came from the wild . Eight of the employees posed for a photo with the giant Python not unknown to Florida. 'I always said living on the Isles of Capri brings you closer to nature,’ Realtor Beau Middlebrook wrote on his Facebook page following the incident. 'Here is some more evidence of that. Yesterday Capt. Bubby Hail (Florida’s Finest Fishing) was returning to the dock from a fishing charter and spotted this 14.5’ Burmese Python catching some sun on the deck behind my office. After a few minutes, it crawled under the wooden steps to my office lanai,' he continued. Patch.com reports that The Isles of Capri Fire Department and a representative from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission were able to nab the snake. Because pythons are sometimes kept as pets, wildlife workers scanned the animal for a microchip to see if it belonged to anyone. 'It was not tagged so then a licensed collector came out, put it in the back of his truck and drove it home.' Careful boys!:  Pythons are not venomous but can potentially kill humans by using their body to squeeze them to death without much of a chance of them surviving . While discovering a momentous python outside the door of one's workplace may seem like an uncommon event, it's not uncommon for wild pythons to roam around Florida. The Patch reports that back in July a python that measured 2.5 feet less was found in a family's barbecue grill in July. The largest Python ever captured was 18.2 feet and it was caught in the Everglades. Middlebrook was surprised to see the snake but he isn’t scared in the slightest. 'I can’t wait to see what happens next,' he wrote. According to  Reptileknowledge.com, Pythons are not venomous but can potentially kill humans by using their body to squeeze them to death.

"Frustrated cabbie Kugannesan Balasubramaniam (pictured) had rammed into the back of a classic sports car and killed the driver during the morning rush hour, a court heard . A taxi driver who shunted the back of a classic sports car so hard it 'folded like a penknife' and killed the driver is facing jail. Kugannesan Balasubramaniam had ploughed his Peugeot van into the back of the 1963 MGB convertible roadster at 48mph on the A40 Westway in London. The court heard the 31-year-old had become 'frustrated' while driving in traffic shortly before the crash. Teacher Nick Sennett, who had only hired the classic car for a few days, suffered serious head injuries as his car was shunted forward violently in the four-car crash. Paramedics spent an hour trying to save the 58-year-old, who taught economics at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Balasubramaniam had claimed the vintage car had pulled out in front of him suddenly. But jurors unanimously found the taxi driver guilty of causing death by careless driving, an alternative to the original count of causing death by dangerous driving. Speaking after Mr Sennett's death chef Heston Blumenthal, who attended the £15,700-a-year school, had said: 'What made Nick stand out was his very calm, playful banter. He was one of those teachers you could be very comfortable around. He was really lovable, really funny, chilled out.' Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Balasubramaniam: 'You will be sentenced at this court for causing death by careless driving on the 15 January next year. 'You should understand that the law makes it clear that a custodial sentence is likely but as you are a man of previous good character I order a pre-sentence report for that day.' The minicab driver had just collected a sixth-form student from Heathrow Airport and was taking her to an address in northwest London, Southwark Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Nicholas Bleaney told the court: 'Shortly before the collision she noticed the defendant making a mobile phone call, she thinks the phone was put to his ear rather than using a hands-free system but perhaps more importantly she started to pay attention to what was going on in front of her. 'She noticed that the traffic was building up and first thing in the morning it is by no means unusual for the traffic to build up,' he said. 'She noticed this defendant was starting to get frustrated and slapping the steering wheel with his hands and she then noticed the line of traffic in front of their car and it wasn't clear to her whether it was completely stationary or moving slowly but she noticed around that point that the defendant started to speed up to a speed that would be appropriate to an empty road. Nick Sennett, who previously taught chef Heston Blumenthal, was killed when Balasubramaniam ploughed his Peugeot van into the back of hsi car at 48mph on the A40 Westway . 'She simply watched as the defendant drove into a car in front. 'That proved to be Mr Sennett's MGB, he had hired it from a classic car club for a few days and the impact shunted it into the car in front,' added Mr Bleaney. The force of Balasubramaniam's ramming also shunted cars ahead of the MGB in the four-car crash, jurors heard. 'Essentially it (the MGB) folded like a penknife,' said Mr Bleaney. 'He hit his head on the windscreen top and suffered some chest injuries but the main injury was a very serious head injury and sadly he did not regain consciousness and he was pronounced dead at the scene.' Balasubramaniam told officers at the scene that the vintage car pulled suddenly in front of him into his braking distance. Sam Robinson, for Balasubramaniam, said the soft-top roadster had changed lanes and pulled just in front of the minicab at the same time the traffic slowed. He told jurors: 'Unfortunately at the point that the MG made the manouvere from the middle lane to the outside lane was the point at which the traffic had back up over that hill. 'The stop-start which was going on further up the road had stopped again. 'What was 100 metres of clear road in front of this defendant suddenly became a whole lot less. 'He couldn't stop, he tried as we all would, the result was a terrible accident.' The 1963 MGB convertible roadster 'folded like a penknife' when it was shunted forward violently in the four-car crash (stock image) Although the defendant was speeding, he said it was 'not dangerous if the conditions are right' and dismissed the prosecution case as having 'no physical evidence' showing how fast the vehicle was going. Balasubramaniam had been driving a replacement vehicle while his own car was at the garage. A tracking device inside the vehicle recorded the minicab driver was speeding at 48mph on the 40mph road. He was also overworked, having worked 90 hours in the previous seven days for the cab hire company One to One. Mr Bleaney said: 'It is the prosecution's case that he was over-tired when he was driving and over-tired in circumstances where he had gone into that situation for commercial gain.' The short-sighted driver also failed a basic number plate-reading eye test when officers attended the scene. Balasubramaniam, from Wembley, northwest London, denied a single charge of causing death by dangerous driving. He was convicted by the alternative charge of causing death by careless driving and released on conditional bail ahead of his sentence on January 15.

"Twitter should automatically block racist words, a Labour MP who was a victim of online anti-Semitism has said. Luciana Berger, shadow minister for public health, said she received 2,500 hate messages at the height of an internet campaign against her. She said the social media site 'let me down' and took a 'sporadic and haphazard' approach to removing offensive posts. Luciana Berger said she received 2,500 hate messages at the height of an internet campaign against her and claimed Twitter 'let me down' and took a 'haphazard' approach' Miss Berger revealed the abuse had been orchestrated by white supremacists and neo-Nazis from the US and the UK. She has since stepped up security at her houses in London and her Liverpool constituency. In October, Garron Helm, from Litherland, north of Liverpool, was handed a four-week custodial sentence at Merseyside Magistrates Court for sending an anti-Semitic tweet to Miss Berger. The 21-year-old Nazi sympathiser sent a 'grossly offensive' anti-Semitic tweet to Miss Berger showing a Holocaust-era yellow star superimposed on the MP's forehead with the hashtag 'Hitler was right'. When police searched Helm's home they found Nazi memorabilia including a flag bearing the SS symbol and material from British extreme right-wing group National Action. Helm referred to himself online as The Noble Wolf and used a Twitter account called Aethelwulf, which translates from Old English as Noble Wolf. But in reality Helm was an immature loner who found friends online in extremist groups. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Miss Berger called on the social networking site to do more to stop abuse. The MP for Liverpool Wavertree said: 'At the height of the abuse, the police said I was the subject of 2,500 hate messages in the space of three days using the hashtag 'filthyjewbitch'. 'Online hate needs to be taken as seriously as offline hate - but it isn't. Twitter's response isn't good enough. It has a responsibility to do more to protect its users. 'The site is letting me and many others down who have been the subject of lots of hate. It could start by automatically banning racist words which aren't allowed to be printed in newspapers or broadcast on TV that could never be used in a positive way - such as kike (a derogatory term for a Jewish person).' The Liverpool Wavertree MP claimed Twitter took a 'sporadic and haphazard' approach to removing offensive posts . Miss Berger contacted Twitter's UK head of Public Policy, Nick Pickles, direct in an attempt to have her abuser's accounts suspended. She added: 'Twitter let me down. It took well over a week for some of the abusive content to be removed and even when it was, the approach was sporadic and very haphazard,' Miss Berger told The Telegraph. 'Twitter has made some improvements on the site and it's important that you can report people – but when you are getting the level of abuse I was, it's an onerous task reporting each and every person.' Miss Berger said she had been forced to increase security at her home, including fitting a 'bomb bag at the back of my post boxes'. She has also had a new alarm system and CCTV fitted and shatterproof film applied to windows. A spokesman for Twitter told the paper the firm was 'working hard' to combat abuse but blocking individual words was 'generally ineffective at stopping unwanted behaviour'.","Shadow public health minister says social media site let her down .

"Young people are now employing a raft of new abbreviations for their social media discussions . An emerging list of new-age abbreviations have begun to dominate the way social media users connect and communicate - and it is only set to get longer. The minefield of new meanings, at least according to social media marketing agency wearesocial.com.au, have grown from the days of the simple yet effective LOL (Laughing Out Loud) abbreviation to a list as long as 60. And the social media savvy are now employing them in every day communication. Those using the abbreviations do so as a tactic for speed in text communication, a university professor on linguistics said, while others just choose to do so because they are a code that older people don't quite understand. WeAreSocial.com.au managing director Julian Ward said the various different shortcuts, which range from the the compassionate ILY (I Love You) to the more profain WTF (What the F***) are commonplace now and indicate the changing way people harness social media. Using social listening tools, WeAreSocial.com.au monitored trending terms used by Australians on Twitter from April 1 to June 30. The top ranking term was, LOL which was used a total of 1,242,935. 'We can see a range of clever to practical acronyms as people look for speed and limited thumb work - plus of course it feels good to be in the know, especially on more subversive terms,' Mr Ward said. But now the abbreviations have become so complex that if sent alone without an accompanying graphic or visual element to give them context, have no meaning. 'The use of abbreviation should not be considered in isolation, rather as a set of activities that enhance efficiencies but importantly satisfy our need for a greater range of self expression,' Mr Ward said. 'The accelerating trend to express through visual stories. Short videos, plus the pervasiveness of the GIF, exploding out of Tumblr and now even adopted by Twitter.' LOL was the top trending abbreviation used by Australians on Twitter from April 1 to June 30 . And despite the growing list of abbreviations, Mr Ward said people were also returning to using entire words in hashtags 'so people can find something that’s trending'. WeAreSocial.com.au also discovered in their research that using visual images as a form of expression was on the rise in non-public platforms, such as instant messaging services. 'Instant Messaging platforms are enormous in message volume, where messaging of this type is ripe,' Mr Ward said. 'Think WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Facebook Messenger to name a few. WhatsApp alone says it has more daily users than Twitter. 'By the end of 2013, WeChat had 355 million monthly active users. 'Use of emoji or emoticon stickers is the staple here. Expect to see the 250 new emoji keyboard characters enter your feeds shortly to support our urge to tell stories in brief and express associated emotion. 'Look out for sure thing favourites, the Desert Island and of course, the Vulcan salute.'","LOL, OMG and ILY top the list, with more than 2 million uses by Australians .

"A six-year-old girl who is hearing impaired received an early Christmas treat when she visited Santa and he started to sign for her.

Albert had actually been working on the plan with Sadie's mother, Ronelle Adam, who asked if he would be able to learn enough signs to communicate with her daughter.

"The two men assigned to a one-year spaceflight said Thursday that their upcoming mission will allow the world to push deeper into space. Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will rocket into orbit from Kazakhstan in March and move into the International Space Station for an entire year. For Nasa, it will represent a space endurance record; for Russia, it will fall two months shy of its world record. Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly (left) and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Kelly and Kornienko will rocket into orbit from Kazakhstan in March, 2015. They will spend a year aboard the International Space Station. At a news conference Thursday at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Kelly and Kornienko said they anticipate many scientific gains from their mission. Researchers need to know more about the prolonged effects of space on humans, before astronauts embark on Mars expeditions lasting three years, round trip, they said. 'What makes this exciting for me, this one-year flight, is about the science and everything we're going to learn from expanding the envelope on the space station,' Kelly said. 'If we're ever going to go to Mars someday, the International Space Station is really a great platform to learn much more about having people live and work in space for longer durations. It's close to the Earth, and it's a great orbiting facility.' Kelly and Kornienko have been training for this mission since their selection two years ago. Both already have spent a half-year aboard the orbiting lab, on separate flights, and have been advised by previous yearlong space fliers to 'pace yourself.' It’s not just technology that will be an issue with getting to Mars ; owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one, which will take two years in total. Just getting there will take seven or eight months. The astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back. The 50-year-old Kelly, a former Navy fighter pilot, said his goals are the same as they are every time he flies in space: 'No one gets hurt, we don't break anything and we leave as friends.' Kelly noted that his first spaceflight, back in 1999, lasted eight days. At the time, it 'seemed like that was a long time.' His second flight, also on a space shuttle, lasted 13 days, and his space station visit in 2010 lasted 159 days. 'They're getting longer,' he told reporters. Both already have spent a half-year aboard the orbiting lab, on separate flights, and have been advised by previous yearlong space fliers to 'pace yourself.' 'I think if I fly again,' it just goes on forever 'and I never come home.' Kornienko, 54, a former Soviet paratrooper, said the support of his family has helped him deal with the preparations and the flight itself. He had exciting personal news for those tuning in: 'You can congratulate me. I am becoming grandpa.'","Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will blast into orbit from Kazakhstan in March .

"When you're spending long hours at sea on a trawler ship, you have to get creative to keep yourself entertained. At least that's what the crew of The Caledonia believe, keeping their spirits up by making spoof pop videos. The crazy Scots, who spend their days trawling for prawns, even go as far as stripping off in the freezing weather to create their YouTube videos. Deckhand Frank has proved the most popular of the fishermen on YouTube for his spoof of the Miley Cyrus video Wrecking Ball . The team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull . The most popular 'music video' produced so far shows deckhand Frank Ronald starkers on a red buoy pretending to be Miley Cyrus in Wrecking Ball. In another a fellow fisherman dons seaweed for dreadlocks and an enormous chain to pose as a rapper. The team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull. The boat is based at Tarbert, Loch Fyne, which is world famous for its seafood. As well as the Miley Cyrus parody the team have produced their version of the the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi, called Skaterprawn . A rap spoof created by the crew also involves them wearing seaweed dreadlocks and giant boat chains around their necks . Frank said: 'We can be away on the boat all week, but we could be landing our catch every couple of days. 'It's just for a bit of nonsense out in the boat, it's a bit of a laugh when it's quiet out on the deck. There's not much on at this time of year.' As well as the Miley Cyrus parody the team have produced their version of the the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi. Called Skaterprawn, it features live prawns and fishermen skateboarding along deck wearing nothing but boxer shorts. And a painstakingly choreographed dance to recent smash hit pop song 'Timber', by US artist Pitbull featuring K$ha, shows the lads dancing on the roof of the cabin with no land in sight. Frank poses on a skateboard during the Avril Lavigne parody Skaterprawn - which was among the vides filmed on Frank's mobile phone . In some of the spoof newscasts a tame seagull joins Frank for an update on all current affairs from The Caledonia . The crew of five are often out at sea for days at a time, and work long hours fishing for prawns, so keep themselves entertained with videos . Most of the videos feature one or all of the crew in their underwear. Frank said: 'Being in your pants is the best way to report the weather. Us guys have a built-in thermometer.' Frank, who has lived in Tarbert all of his life, posts the videos on YouTube. His version of 'Wrecking Ball' has attracted 19,364 views. Frank said his family are amused by his antics, although he said: 'Obviously they were a bit embarrassed. When they saw that they said they would prefer it if it wasn't me.' Frank defies the cold sea chill to don a racy leopard-print outfit to keep his colleagues humorously entertained . He has worked as a fisherman since he left school aged 16 and insists safety remain a priority for the crew. He said: 'You make sure it's all safe. You are still out at sea and you can't do too much nonsense. We can be out in some rough weather. You all need to pull together.' He recently decided to focus on parody news and weather reports, with several bulletins from the boat uploaded in the last week. Frank and fellow deckhand Bill Macfarlane, 42, use a pile of empty fish boxes as a news desk and a wooden spoon for a microphone. Prawn baskets serve as drums in a remake of Avril Lavigne's 2002 hit Sk8er boi,; their aptly-titled version is called 'Skaterprawn' A Caledonia news reporter Bill Macfarlane makes sure those at home are kept up to date on recent events in the trawler . A tame seagull has interrupted several of the videos by sitting on the boxes and flapping its wings. One report features crew members pretending to be sheep, and another shows a fisherman in yellow oilskins jumping out from under a pile of empty boxes. Frank, who edits the films once safely back on dry land, said: 'It's a lot easier to do the news than music videos. There's a lot more editing with a music video. 'It's all off the cuff. It's not rehearsed or anything. We'll probably keep on with the news for a wee while.'","The Scottish crew on board The Caledonia at Tarbet, Loch Fyne, find amusing ways to keep entertained .

"The Qatari ruling family has been ordered to pay £38million in stamp duty for the purchase of Chelsea Barracks after using an aggressive tax avoidance scheme to avoid the bill. The oil-rich country bought the 13-acre site from the Ministry of Defence for almost £1billion in 2007, making it Britain’s most expensive residential development site. But the Qataris powerful sovereign wealth fund did not pay any stamp duty on the purchase after employing complex tax avoidance methods. Scroll down for video . The Qatari ruling family has been ordered to pay £38million in stamp duty for the purchase of Chelsea Barracks after using an aggressive tax avoidance scheme to avoid the bill . The country’s investment arm sold the land to its own bank and then leased it back, exploiting a tax break called sub-sale tax relief, the taxman said. The loophole enables buyers to avoid paying stamp duty on a property they are buying by transferring it to a trust at the same time as they complete the sale. In doing so, HM Revenue and Customs said ‘they attempted to eliminate all of the stamp duty land tax due on the purchase of the barracks’. The Qataris claimed they had done this for commercial purposes, and not to avoid tax, but their argument was yesterday rejected by the courts. The upper tribunal upheld a previous legal ruling which found the Qataris had unfairly side-stepped the tax. It is unclear if the taxman will now examine the tax paid on other multi-million purchases by the sovereign wealth fund. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who has campaigned against tax avoidance by large corporations, said the tax bill should be paid . Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who has campaigned against tax avoidance by large corporations, said: ‘It never fails to amaze me how extremely rich people will go to such extreme lengths to avoid paying their fair share of tax. ‘If you can afford to pay £1billion worth of property then you can afford to pay a £38million tax bill.’ The famous barracks were sold to the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), a Qatari government-owned body charged with managing the sovereign wealth fund. The QIA has acquired at least £5billion of commercial property in London the last seven years, including famous building such as Harrods, in Knightsbridge, The Savoy Hotel, Park Lane Hotel and the Olympic Village. This is more than half the value of the entire Crown Estate, a wealthy portfolio of and buildings and property which funds the Queen’s expenses. Only last week, the QIA bought the HSBC headquarters in Canary Wharf for about £1.1billion after fending off Chinese rivals. Simon Mallinson, of Real Capital Analytics, said provisional data suggested the Qataris had been ‘the largest commercial property investor in the UK this year’. And the sovereign wealth fund is set to make even more when it builds hundreds of homes on lucrative land at Chelsea Barracks, in central London. The QIA bought the barracks for nearly £959 million – originally in partnership with Christian Candy’s CPC Group – but bought out CPC’s share in 2010. Plans to build modernist towers on the site was axed after Prince Charles wrote an emotional letter to Qatar’s prime minister claiming the designs ‘made my heart sink’ and would be a ‘gigantic experiment with the very soul of our capital city’. Qatar’s prime minister, Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, recently revealed that the country has interests’ in £23billion worth of UK property and business, including Heathrow airport . Qatar’s prime minister, Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, recently revealed the country has ‘interests’ in £23billion worth of UK property and business. He said: ‘Our interests, in companies as diverse as Barclays and Sainsbury’s, Heathrow airport, Harrods and Canary Wharf, total more than £23billion. ‘These are not short-term investments. It is clear that both our countries benefit hugely from them.’ Sandhurst-educated Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has also previously boasted of his British buy-up, saying: ‘We are investing everywhere. Even your Harrods – we took it.’ The Qataris are the latest in a long line of businesses and sovereign wealth funds accused of avoiding UK tax. Google, Apple, Starbucks and Amazon have all been accused of shirking their full tax liabilities through complex avoidance schemes. David Gauke, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘HMRC’s position in this important case has now been backed twice by the courts. ‘The message is clear – tax avoidance is complex, expensive and self-defeating.’ A further 24 businesses and 900 homeowners who used a similar method to avoid their tax responsibilities will also now be told to pay up, which could net taxpayers another £85million.","The Qatari ruling family has been ordered to pay £38million in stamp duty .

"A mother told today of her relief that her 12-year-old daughter was 'just by chance' not at the house where eight of her friends were stabbed to death in the 'backpacker Mecca' city of Cairns. The mother, who identified herself only as Sophie to protect the identity of her child, said her daughter was a friend of several of the children who died because they all attended the nearby high school. ‘They’re always mucking about in each other’s houses and I’m just relieved that this was a day when my daughter wasn’t here,’ said Sophie as she stood some 30m from the house of death in the dark at the end of another day that has sent shock waves not only around Australia but the world. Emergency services attend a crime scene. One mother called Sophie has revealed how her daughter narrowly avoided being at the house where the murders took place . Police carry evidence bags at the scene of the horriffic mass stabbing . Throughout the day complete strangers had walked along leafy Murray Street, in the suburb of Manoora, to place flowers as close to the home as possible - police had blocked direct access to the street near the fibre-cement house where the Torres Strait islander family lived. Sophie was there tonight, standing silently in the darkness with a group of stunned neighbours who could not believe that the tragedy had not only occurred on their doorstep but had focused world attention on their street which is filled with families of mixed cultures. ‘We’re all trying to work out what happened,’ said one of her friends who had supported Sophie as the shock had hit her that her daughter - or one of her daughter’s close friends - could have been at the house where a generation of children had been wiped out. Sophie said neighbours believed that one of the children who perished was not a member of the family, but she said that no-one had been able to confirm that because those who knew the answer - and the more general answer as to why such a crime had occurred - were being cared for by friends and relatives.

Neighbours believe one of the children who perished was not a member of the family . Police comfort a distressed woman. One woman, 34, was injured in the incident in the suburb of Manoora, 10 minutes from the city centre . Even in the darkness of the poorly-lit street people continued to arrive as close as they were allowed to stare at the house, the front of which had been shielded off with tarpaulin by police, who were continuing to work through the night under arc lights. The brutal deaths of the children aged from 18 months to 15 years has raised many questions, the main one the lips of everyone in the street tonight being: ‘Why?’ There were rumours in the street tonight that the mother feared her children were to be taken from her by government authorities because they were living in conditions that were not suitable - but one man neighbour living nearby said that was 'just the talk around here.' Others said they were worried that the mother was unable to cope with such a large family and simply broke down. 'There's no doubt that if she did this, as everyone believes, she obvious just ""lost it"",' said one mother. ‘As she was only 34 and had seven or eight children - depending on whether one of them who died was hers or not - she must have been pregnant for much of her adult life, because the oldest is 20. ‘Did it all become too much for her? And we have to ask whether, with a record of bearing so many children, whether she was carrying yet again.’ Flowers are left at a vigil. Some locals have speculated that the mother was unable to cope with such a large family and simply broke down . Stunned neighbours could not believe that the tragedy had not only occurred on their doorstep . Neighbours have been trying to put a timing on the killing and suggest it had occurred some time after daylight because the 20-year-old had apparently already left the house . Flowers and a memorial note are seen laying up against a fence across the road from the scene of the horrific massacre . It was the 20-year-old who returned to the house shortly after 11am today to find bodies of his siblings everywhere, rooms splashed with blood. He screamed out for help - a cry that was echoed by other neighbours who learned what was inside the house. Police and ambulances raced to the premises where, curiously, neighbour Bessie Mareko said she saw the mother and a number of children clearing up their home, carrying a number of unwanted items out into the street. Ms Mareko said the items included children’s toys, which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother’s mind. 'It would be terrible to think that she was getting the children to help her clear up, knowing that she was going to do something bad to them - if that was what happened,' said a Torres Strait islander neighbour. Neighbours have been trying to put a timing on the killing and suggest it had occurred some time after daylight because the 20-year-old had apparently already left the house, before returning later to find scenes of slaughter.

Ms Mareko said the items included children’s toys, which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother’s mind .

Neighbours closed their doors and turned off their lights last night at the end of a grim day that had left their minds filled with questions and rumours. But police remained on duty with cars blocking the street on each side of the house, the task of their forensic colleagues being to work through the night trying to piece together the tragic chain of events. Among questions that police are asking is how the killer - and the mother is the main suspect in the deaths - had managed to stab eight children without any of them trying to run away. And while police will work throughout the weekend piecing together the evidence that will provide a picture of the run of tragic events, social welfare authorities are expected to come under severe questioning about why no-one saw the tragedy brewing.","One mother revealed how her daughter narrowly avoided being at the house where eight children were found dead .

"Swirling colours, mesmerising clouds of glitter and dust, and bright splashes of liquid - a hypnotic new video could be the latest installation in an art gallery. In fact, the short film - dubbed The Experimenter - captures the moment when Lush bath products hit the water to dissolve and disperse into stunning shapes and shades. The makers behind the video were inspired by David Attenborough documentaries in which the camera zooms in on natural wonders to highlight fascinating natural detail. Scroll down for video . The Experimenter is an artistic video capturing the moments that Lush beauty products are dropped in water . The two-minute film features mesmering clouds of pigment billowing through water as the product dissolves . Many department stores and companies have made festive ad campaigns this year, and Lush bosses explained the reasoning behind their seasonal film. 'After the ominous scenes of Black Friday and the emotional hijacking of corporate Christmas adverts we simply want to show the world a colourful, liberating piece of artistic creativity.' The footage of exploding bath bombs, swirling liquids and glitter was filmed by award-winning visual effects studio The Mill. The Experimenter begins with the statement that the advert was: 'Made using fresh, handmade products and ingredients. Nothing is tested on animals.' One of Lush's signature bath bombs, called Granny Takes A Dip, fizzes as it is dropped into a tank of water . The visually stunning film was inspired by bath art posted on social media under the hashtag #lushtime . Lush said the campaign was inspired by  posts from their fans who had shared their bath art images on social media under the hashtag #lushtime. A behind-the-scenes video of the film shows the  team experimenting with different product and colour combinations and assessing how the products react to water. The visuals are set to an original atmospheric score, Wings At Their Feet, played by a 45-piece orchestra and choral ensemble. Another Lush bath bomb, the bright green energising Avobath, begins to fizz as it crashes into a tub of water . A hallmark of the  company is its use of bright colours in their, ethically-produced handmade cosmetics . The film evokes a nature documentary, in which  features of the natural world are shown in extreme close-up . Simon Richmond, who composed the piece, said: ‘We thought, why are we even thinking about Christmas at all? Why isn’t this more about all the amazing movements and energies that are in every Lush product? ‘You have this idea about what Lush products are, but wait a minute, there’s all this detail. There’s this hidden world. 'It’s a bit like a David Attenborough documentary where you look at a rainforest and you think, “Yeah, yeah big leaves, all green,” and then the camera zooms in and you see these bizarre creatures doing the most unexpected things. 'It kind of feels like the music reflects that, using these beautiful, rich, organic tones.' Lush is particularly vocal about products being cruelty-free and has pledged to fight testing on animals . This looks like a cloud against a clear blue sky, in fact it's a product sinking and dispersing in a tank of water . Lush's digital managing director, Jack Constantine said: 'This piece of art is a beautiful illustration of experimentation delving into the process behind our product invention. 'The collaboration between musical, cosmetic and visual artists has been a challenging creative journey with a rewarding result.' Lush was founded in 1994 and the company is particularly vocal in its support of the fight against animal testing something which its says is the 'core value of our company'. This product, containing glitter shot against a black backdrop, could be a  galaxy of stars in deep space .","Cosmetics company filmed the moment bath bombs hit the water .

"Rejected: Sutcliffe has been at Broadmoor for more than 30 years had asked to be moved to a lower-security unit in West Yorkshire - closer to his family and also near where he killed his victims . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe will die inside high-security Broadmoor hospital after his plea to be moved to a lower security unit was rejected. The serial killer, 68, wanted to be transferred to another location in West Yorkshire to be closer to his family, which would have placed him just a few miles from where he murdered his victims. He blames ‘biased’ doctors for him failing a medical assessment and said it was ‘impossible’ to properly assess his mental health. Sutcliffe has been locked inside Broadmoor for more than three decades after he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. He killed 13 women and tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree that made him the country’s most notorious killer. Sutcliffe wanted to move to a 65-bed unit attached to Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield but his fate was sealed when a senior doctor ruled there was ‘no change’ in him and he should stay at Broadmoor, which is in Berkshire. An angry Sutcliffe told a friend: ‘This is really unfair. They are biased against me because of who I am. The doctor only came to see me for half an hour, so how can he come up with that decision when he doesn’t know me?’ The West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which is responsible for running the hospital, declined to comment due to patient confidentiality. It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 to detain Sutcliffe in Broadmoor, at least five times more than the cost of a prison cell. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. Sutcliffe suffers from diabetes and his health has deteriorated. He had a hernia operation last year and has since been suffering from a debilitating cough. He has been taking medication which has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. Two weeks ago he suffered an attack of angina. Sutcliffe wanted to move around 170 miles north to Yorkshire so his family would be able to visit more often. But it would have also placed him closer to the families of his victims. One source told The Sun: ‘He thinks the powers that be want him to be there until the end. ‘The report says he should not be transferred as nothing has changed and he has not shown any real remorse for his killings. Cost: Sutcliffe is said to have his own private room at Broadmoor, pictured, with a bed, access to email, a TV and a desk where he writes to penpals . ‘This is a real setback for him, especially on top of all his health problems. Peter is now having trouble speaking, he is bloated and looks constantly tired.’ Despite his health problems, Sutcliffe is preparing for a comfortable Christmas inside Broadmoor and has already received more than 60 greeting cards. He has also sent more than 100 cards despite being a Jehovah’s Witness who does not celebrate Christmas. He and other patients, including Robert Napper, who murdered Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992, will sit down to a turkey meal with all the trimmings on December 25. Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England. He believed he was on a ‘mission from God’ to kill sex workers. He rarely discusses his crimes and now tells friends and family it was the Devil rather than God telling him to commit the killings. Broadmoor was designed by a military engineer and was the first custom-built asylum to house criminals when it was developed in 1863. It is designated as a psychiatric hospital rather than a jail. The hospital opened up its doors to cameras for the first time in its 150-year history for an ITV documentary screened last month. Sutcliffe refused to take part, and complained about it during the recording.","Serial killer demanded to be moved to a lower-security Yorkshire hospital .

"It looks like the first day of the Christmas Sales, or early morning Black Friday, but this is an every-day scene at a Chinese Tesco. Up to one hundred eager shoppers queue outside the gates of this Shanghai Tesco every day, in a desperate bid to get their hands on the best deals. The customers, many of them elderly and frail, run towards the doors and fight each other in order to be the first inside the store. Scroll down for video . Me first! Shoppers are knocked off their feet, while others fight and hit others who get in their way, others shun grabbing a trolley or basket in a bid to get into the Tesco store quicker than others . But unlike Black Friday and annual holiday sales, these events happen every morning. The group of 60-100 elderly customers religiously queue up outside the store's cast iron gates before it opens it's doors around 9am. A video shows a Tesco worker opening the gates before hordes of customers quickly rampage across the forecourt and into the store. Many are knocked off their feet, while others fight and hit others who get in their way, others shun grabbing a trolley or basket in a bid to get into the store quicker than others. Jonathon Lim, a film director from Leongatha, Australia, spent seven months shooting a video of the bizarre practice.

'This happens every day. There isn't really a concept of lining-up in China. Some people get quite aggressive, while for other's it's a big game. 'You see people pushing each other, but they laughing at the same time. 'I would estimate that between 60 to 100 people queue there, but it fluctuates from day-to-day.' Mr Lim's project to document the daily rush for morning food began in April when his fellow filmmaker Jonathan Meador were sitting on his balcony having breakfast. From the 14th floor of his apartment block, Mr Meador noticed a large group of people and commotion. After watching as the elderly people ran into the story, he decided to film it the next day. According to a team of filmmakers documenting the strange practice, shoppers sometimes fight each other . Tesco madness: The crowd, mainly made up of elderly people, grab and push in order to get inside first . Jonathan Meador and Jonathon Lim spent seven months filming the bizarre morning rush . After collaborating with Mr Lim, the pair began recording the events over several months. Explaining the events, Mr Meador added: 'These people lived through some rough times in Chinese history. 'Exchanging food tickets for rice, one leaf of spinach per person - that kind of thing. 'Saving money and time is super important to them. Better to embarrass yourself or run someone over than go hungry.' The duo have since entered the finished video into the Now And Then exhibition in Shanghai, where the work was sold to raise money for charity.","Tesco in Shanghai is invaded by dozens of shoppers every morning .

They munched on floating bait, leaving Mr Korostelev free to take this snap. Mr Korostelev said: 'Swimming with sharks is like stress relief for me. What could be better? 'It is not very dangerous if you know what are you doing and how to do it correctly and safely. 'Sharks are not interested in humans. They need only a tasty fish to satisfy their hunger. 'You just have to keep everything under control. Do not wave your hands and try to keep the sharks in sight at all times.

Within a few minutes they were surrounded by blacktip and tiger sharks. In search of a free meal, the sharks quickly devoured the fish - completely ignoring the humans in their territory. Describing the dive, he added: 'The main problem when shooting sharks in South Africa is that there are too many! Everything is teeming with sharks. 'They're everywhere - swarming around your face, crashing into the camera, their sensitive noses poking into your legs. 'Therefore, to make a picture is extremely difficult.

He's the third person to face time in prison over the attack. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said McCloskey-Sharp had committed a cowardly crime. 'You hit him after you had indicated that you were no threat to him,' she said. 'He would have had no idea what was coming and was therefore unable to defend himself in any way. 'It was a very cowardly act.' She said the courts must send a message to the community that street violence will be punished with a prison term. 'Un-premeditated violence may be brief, but it can have profound and enduring consequences for all involved, as it has done in this instance.' McCloskey-Sharp pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury and affray. He must serve a minimum of 17 months in jail. Surveillance vision shows the attack.

Dylan Closter is in jail for a minimum six years and fellow attacker Thomas Francis McCloskey-Sharp will serve at least 17 months in prison . David Cassai was killed on new year's eve 2012 when attacked by Dylan Closter on the streets of Rye. In handing down sentence Justice Hollingworth told his assailant 'this was very much a one-sided attack, you started the affray and remained the principal aggressor throughout' Justice Hollingworth said Closter handed himself into police out of pragmatism rather than remorse, given the number of witnesses and surveillance video and said that Closter initially claimed he was acting in self-defence. 'What happened that night was entirely of your making,' the judge told the accused. 'The affray involved a violent, frightening and completely unprovoked attack by you and members of your group on another group, in the middle of the night, on a public street, at a busy time of year.

"David Cameron personally approved the decision to axe two of Theresa May’s senior advisers from the Tory candidates list, the Daily Mail can reveal. Senior sources say the Prime Minister ‘signed off’ a recommendation from party chairman Grant Shapps to suspend the taxpayer-funded aides as prospective MPs. The move was ostensibly to punish them for their refusal to take part in campaigning in the Rochester and Strood by-election, since they believed canvassing was a breach of Civil Service rules.

David Cameron (right) reportedly 'signed off' a recommendation to suspend two aides of Theresa May (left) after they refused to take part in canvassing for the Rochester and Strood by-elections .

He added: ‘I can’t see that this is a proper way for a party to behave.’ The steely Home Secretary, who is expected to run for the leadership if the Tories lose the general election and Mr Cameron quits, is understood to be backing her aides. The row is widely seen as the latest episode in a toxic feud between Downing Street and the Home Office, which has worsened since polls have shown Mrs May has become the activists’ favourite to succeed the Prime Minister. Another of the Home Secretary’s advisers, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit over the summer in a row over extremism in schools. Sir Alan, an international development minister until this summer’s reshuffle, said: ‘It is fundamentally unprincipled and unjust that the central power of a party is being used to destroy someone’s political prospects. ‘It’s almost Stalinist. If they don’t like what Nick Timothy does as a special adviser, they should sack him if they can justify it. Otherwise he has every right to put his name forward to be an MP.’ Nick Timothy (pictured), the Home Secretary's most senior aide, was blocked from running in a safe Tory seat at the General Election . Mr Cameron’s most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, was dragged further into the row yesterday as Labour demanded to know what advice his office had given on campaigning by ministerial aides. The official code of conduct for special advisers says that as public servants, they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so. Previous advice from the Mr Cameron’s political private secretary, Laurence Mann, was that they could use their spare time to stuff envelopes or do ‘back-room’ work during a campaign. But Tory sources insist that Sue Gray, the director of ethics and propriety at the Cabinet Office, approved a change in the rules to also allow telephone canvassing. Other senior figures – including the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and two of his aides who are running as MPs, Oliver Dowden and Laura Trott – are understood to have helped to call voters in Rochester. Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson decided to be ‘bloody awkward’ about taking part, one senior source claimed. ‘You were expected by the Prime Minister to pull your weight in this campaign and unlike everyone else they refused,’ the source said. Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Ashworth last night wrote to Sir Jeremy asking him to publish the advice he issued. ‘Many will suspect that personal political positioning is at the heart of this row, which in fact centres on proper use of taxpayers’ money,’ he wrote. A Cabinet Office spokesman refused to discuss claims that Miss Gray failed seven times to agree to confirm in writing that advisers were allowed to do telephone canvassing.","PM 'signed off' recommendation to suspend aides as prospective MPs .

"An embarrassing mix up between 'Legally Brown' comedian Nazeem Hussain and the new host of The Project Waleed Aly left ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales tempted to make some changes to her usual opening address on the show last night. Yesterday The Age incorrectly printed a photo of Hussain in their entertainment column with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project'. Sales responded to the mishap by tweeting on Thursday afternoon: 'It's so tempting to open 7.30 tonight with ""Welcome to the program, I'm Waleed Aly"".' The idea was met with great popularity as the tweet itself gained nearly 800 favourites and nearly 400 retweets as many pleaded Sales to go through with it. Scroll down for video .

It has since gained more than 750 retweets, sparking comments such as: 'Brown people all look alike', 'Un-freaking-believable' and 'demonstrates why tv needs more non-white face'. This follows last week's announcement that Aly secured a new role as the new co-host of Channel Ten's news program The Project. Although Sales teased her audience on social media, she never went through with opening address she tweeted. It also appears the so-called lookalikes, Aly and Hussain, were together last night as Aly's wife Susan Carlan tweeted a photo of the pair with the caption: 'Singularity.'

"Paul Thrower, 46, pictured, died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex . Three teenagers have been jailed for their part in a 'wicked and unnecessary' axe and knife attack on a drunken man in scenes reminiscent of the film The Shining. Handyman Paul Thrower died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft long axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex, in February. Zakariya Subeir and Kiro Halliburton claimed they acted in self defence when Mr Thrower became enraged at their behaviour towards his girlfriend, Geraldine Roberts. But, following a trial, Halliburton, who delivered the fatal knife wound, was found guilty of murder and Subeir and an accomplice, Mahdi Osman, also 18, were convicted of manslaughter. Halliburton will spend at least 16 years behind bars. Subeir was sentenced to eight years in a young offenders' institution with an extended licence period of four years, and Osman was handed five-and-a-half years for his lesser role. The court heard how the victim had been drinking and became very angry when his girlfriend Geraldine Roberts told him the youths swore, spat and threw a drink at her earlier that day. When Mr Thrower confronted them, Subeir and Halliburton shut themselves into a bin chute on a first-floor communal balcony. As the furious 46-year-old hammered with his fists on the glass partition, another member of their gang found an axe in a shed and Osman passed it up to Subeir, who had managed to get onto the roof of the adjoining porch. Osman told the court he only handed over the weapon to help his friends barricade themselves into the balcony - not to attack Mr Thrower. But when Mr Thrower smashed the reinforced glass and began to crawl through the gap, Subeir hit him twice on the head and once on the shoulder with the axe and Halliburton stabbed him repeatedly in the back with a knife. Halliburton said he delivered the fatal stab to the chest after Mr Thrower grabbed the axe from Subeir, who then ran off. He told jurors that Mr Thrower had the axe in one hand and him in the other and he did not know what else to do. The victim emerged from the bin chute covered in blood, staggering, holding the axe before he collapsed and died from a stab to the heart. 18-year-old Kiro Halliburton (left), who delivered the fatal knife wound, has been jailed for 16 years for murder. Zakariya Subeir (right) will spend eight years in a young offenders' institution for manslaughter . Police have released a picture of the axe used in the attack, which left Mr Thrower covered in blood . As the defendants ran away, Ms Roberts chased after them. She was one of a number of residents who had called 999 to alert police who arrived within minutes. Judge John Bevan told Halliburton: 'I accept Paul Thrower's behaviour was outlandish but he was provoked by you and others. I accept that his behaviour and that of Geraldine Roberts was inflammatory, drunken and pathetic.' But he added: 'This was a wicked and unnecessary crime - a ranting, inebriate being no match for a knife and axe being wielded by young and fit teenagers.' 'The carrying of knives has become endemic among some teenagers in parts of London and it is assumed to aid power and respect to the carrier. That is a delusion. It is the resort of a coward. Mahdi Osman, who handed the axe to the killers, was given a sentence of five-and-a-half years . 'You are a dangerous young man, aggressive when carrying a knife and lacked the courage to tell anything like the truth about this.' The judge went on to sentence Subeir to eight years in a young offenders' institution with an extended licence period of a further four years, and Osman to five-and-a-half years for his lesser role. The court heard Subeir flew to Somalia, via Dubai, after the incident but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at Heathrow airport. Halliburton shaved off his plaits and fled to Leeds in Yorkshire. When he was apprehended, he gave a false name. The red-handled lock knife he used to kill Mr Thrower has never been recovered. Before the murder, all the defendants apart from Halliburton had been involved in an incident earlier that evening at The Great Western pub nearby. They were asked to leave and while they were standing outside, a landlord said one of them threatened to 'shank or jook' him - street slang for stabbing. In the years leading up to the murder, residents of St Dunstan's Close had complained about anti-social behaviour from groups of youths hanging around even though they did not live there. The court heard that Halliburton had two previous convictions of possessing a knife or bladed weapon in 2012. Subeir, of Uxbridge, Halliburton and Osman both of Hayes and the 17-year-old had all denied murder. The court heard that all the defendants had expressed remorse for killing Mr Thrower. Mitigating for Halliburton, Andrew Hall QC said: 'He chose fight over flight and in seconds he made the wrong decision.' Mr Thrower's sister Dawn said in a victim impact statement that the father of one was 'much loved' by the family. She described how he was 'being bullied and victimised and he was doing his best and it got on top of him'. CCTV from the night shows the gang fleeing the block of flats after the attack which killed Mr Thrower . The Old Bailey heard that two of the killers fled Middlesex after the attack, but they were later arrested . He eventually 'succumbed' to bullying because, she said, 'he was not prepared to put up with it and lost his life as a result'. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Simon Deefholts said: 'Mr Thrower was undoubtedly angry that day and rushed to confront the youths who had verbally abused his partner. 'Two took refuge behind a door but it took some time for Mr Thrower to reach them and they could easily have made their escape across the open roof area behind them. 'Instead they were handed at least one potentially lethal weapon by their friend on the ground and barricaded a door, waiting until Mr Thrower burst through. CCTV shows them apparently calm and preparing for the attack. 'They immediately attacked him, causing devastating injuries.' The other member of the gang, a 17-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons, was cleared of involvement in the killing.","Handyman challenged teens after his girlfriend said they spat at her .

"The concept of glorious defeat finds no favour with international footballers. And properly so, since anything less than victory equals failure. So the young men of England will take no consolation from this heart-wrenching result. And yet there was glory aplenty to be found in a genuinely memorable performance Saturday night. This was not one of those sleeves -up, show-your-passion, play-for-the shirt displays beloved of so many earlier England teams. Rather, it was enormously skilful, marvelously heartening and authentically inspired. It took a shrewd, capable and massively experienced Italy team to their mental and physical limits. And it vividly demonstrated the wealth of emerging talent on which the country may now call. Head boy: Mario Balotelli climbs above Gary Cahill to put Italy 2-1 up . Match winner: Mario Balotelli's goal proved the difference between England and Italy . Centre of attention: Mario Balotelli gestures at full time as Italy celebrate victory over England . England have not figured prominently in Brazil’s World Cup calculations. When waiters, taxi-drivers and bartenders — all the usual oracles — have offered their forecasts, they have naturally tended to cite the home team, along with Argentina, Germany and Italy. If England were ever mentioned, we sensed that politeness rather than confidence was the motive. As for English players, Wayne Rooney won the odd glimmer of recognition, but the most popular by far was a non-combatant, D Beckham. And England favoured this relative anonymity. After the wasted years of the so-called ‘golden generation’, this is a quite different camp. By common consent, the preparations were ideal; young men with reputations still to win submerging their egos and eagerly subscribing to the team ethic. Up in arms: Wayne Rooney protests to refereee Bjorn Kuipers as decision goes against England . Smothered: Italy keeper Salvatore Sirigu and Antonio Candreva manage to stop Wayne Rooney scoring . Equally impressive was the approach of . Roy Hodgson. Lazily categorised as a cautiously defensive coach, for . this, the most important match his nation have played in four years, . Hodgson sent out the most adventurous England team in more than a . decade. Only three of the England starting XI had experience of the World Cup finals. On the one hand, it spoke of naivety. On the other, it ensured that the majority had been spared the extended calamity of South Africa in 2010. Back home, it seems, some of the old optimism had finally emerged. It remains one of sport’s most perplexing phenomena, the ability of the English football fan to obliterate past experience and dream of the end of the rainbow. Mercifully, it has been relatively restrained these past months, but it was simply biding its time. Brazilian television chose to illustrate this by visiting a pub in London’s Kentish Town. ‘Who’s going to win, lads,’ inquired the Brazilian Paxman. ‘Ing-er- land!!’ bawled the drinkers, with much fist -pumping. Young guns: Raheem Sterling was one of a number of players playing their first World Cup game for England . Danger man: Sterling (right) was a constant threat through the middle for England . Brave: Jordan Henderson shoots at goal under pressure from Italy striker Mario Balotelli . But while the game began with . appropriate discretion in the Amazonian heat, the chief obstacle to . English ambitions began to assert himself. Andrea Pirlo is elegantly . professorial, treating the game as if it were a series of problems . awaiting solution. He padded stealthily through the heart of midfield, . shaping a pass here, throwing a feint there, generally organising . affairs to his own satisfaction. It was one such deception which allowed Claudio Marchisio a low drive through a crowd to defeat Joe Hart after 35 minutes. England could consider themselves rather harshly done by at that stage, but the spirit engendered over the past months would not be subdued. The equaliser was a small masterpiece, from Rooney’s  exquisite chipped cross to Daniel Sturridge’s thunderous finish. One imagines it went down rather well in Kentish Town. England were fortunate to escape reprisal for the remainder of the half, but the young men never stopped believing, working, earning the right to play. Midfield maestro: Andrea Pirlo (centre) again pulled the strings for Italy in midfield in Manaus . Tormentor: Andrea Pirlo skips past Glen Johnson as Italy start to control the game . It may not have been football to distract the Saturday-night neutrals on Copacabana, but it was honest and thoughtful and utterly compelling. All the more reason, then, to curse the sublime goal which Mario Balotelli, formerly of the Manchester parish, put away in 50 minutes. Mario once revealed his celebrated persecution complex with a plaintive T-shirt slogan: ‘Why Always Me?’. Because, when his mind is on his game, he is capable of goals like this. The more the game progressed, the more we recognised that the selection of Raheem Sterling was no gamble but a piece of irrefutable logic. In years to come, England  followers will speak of the torrid evening in Amazonas State as the night the boy came of age. A dashing, . darting, impish presence, he sought responsibility and used it . admirably. The heart lifted in thrilling expectation each time he found . himself on the ball. Whatever the rest of this World Cup has in store . for England, Sterling will surely emerge as a major international . talent. Head boy: Daniel Sturridge (left) scores for England to make it 1-1 against Italy and celebrates (below) Ultimately, the collective effort proved in vain. A couple of chances from Rooney might have gone in on a kinder occasion, as might Leighton Baines’s free-kick; wickedly struck and urgently saved. But Italy had worked themselves unsparingly, and their reserves of top-class experience finally  prevailed. Indeed, in added time, Professor Pirlo actually found the energy to bounce a free-kick off the England bar. A two-goal advantage would have been cruelly misleading. Things are not over, not by a long way. There is work to be done, important football to be played. But the England youngsters have made their mark on this tournament. Brazil will ignore them no longer. For they know that the boys can play … as Kentish Town could have told them.","Balotelli scores winning goal with brilliant header as Italy triumph 2-1 .

"New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has revealed he feared all of the Sydney siege hostages were going to die in an emotional interview. Mr Baird, who has only been in the job since April, also told the ABC's 7.30 program about the moment he was told a hostage had been gunned down by Man Horan Monis on Tuesday morning.

"The outbreak is thought to have come from caramel apple products (pictured) Scroll down for video . A listeria outbreak believed to have originated from commercially packaged caramel apples has killed five people in the United States and sickened 28 people since November, officials said Friday. Listeria monocytogenes is caused by a bacteria and can cause life-threatening illness. It is particularly dangerous for children, the elderly and pregnant women, in whom it can cause miscarriage. A total of 83 percent of those interviewed so far (15 of 18 people) said they had recently eaten caramel-coated apples. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged consumers in the United States not to eat commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples until further notice. 'Out of an abundance of caution, CDC recommends that US consumers do not eat any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings, until more specific guidance can be provided,' the CDC said in a statement. Of the 28 infected, 26 were hospitalized and five people died. 'Listeriosis contributed to at least four of these deaths,' said the CDC. Nine of the cases were pregnancy-related and involved either mothers-to-be or their newborn infants. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that can cause life-threatening illness. A dangerous complication of listeriosis is meningitis. The bacteria is found in soil, water and animal feces. Listeria can infect raw vegetables, animal meat, unpasteurized milk and processed foods such as cheese dips and deli meats. Listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea, and symptoms typically begin within a few days to a couple of months after eating a contaminated product. Three cases of meningitis - a dangerous complication of listeriosis - among otherwise healthy children aged five to 15 were also reported. The illnesses have spread across 10 states.

"A drug dealer was caught with £6.5million of heroin in the back of a taxi after being picked up outside the world famous Abbey Road Studios. Police found the haul, of 22 parcels inside a laundry bag, when they stopped the taxi nearly 200 miles later on the outskirts of Manchester. Billal Baig, 32, who booked the cab, was today starting an 11 year jail sentence after he was found guilty of being concerned with the supply of heroin. Billal Baig, 32, pictured left, and Joseph Salmon, 37, pictured right, were jailed for a total of 19 years after police found £6.5 million of heroin in the back of a taxi after a pick up outside the world famous Abbey Road Studios . Taxi passenger Joseph Salmon, 37, admitted possessing heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for eight years at Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard that officers from Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit stopped a Mercedes E270 private hire taxi on Chester Road in Mere near Manchester at 8.55pm on May 2. Twenty two wrapped parcels were found in a large laundry-style bag and bin bag. Salmon of no fixed address and the taxi driver - who was later released without charge - were arrested. The parcels were recovered and found to a high-purity heroin. The taxi driver - who lives in London - told police how his friend, later identified as Baig, had asked him to take a fare from Abbey Road Studios in London to Manchester and back. Forensic examination of the drivers phone uncovered messages between him and Baig of Isleworth, West London. The driver complained that the £400 fare was insufficient and Baig told him that he would sort an extra payment from the 'main man.' Greater Manchester Police's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit discovered this laundry bag in the back of the taxi containing heroin with a street value of £6.5 million . Baig was arrested some weeks later, following numerous enquiries to identify and locate him. He told police he asked the driver to take Salmon on behalf of another person who he did not know the name of. Detective Inspector Lee Griffin, said: 'This is one of the single biggest recoveries of drugs in the force's history. 'To prevent such vast quantities of drugs, worth millions of pounds, from flooding the streets, is a massive achievement. 'In one fell swoop we put a huge hole in the drugs supply market and today's sentence reflects great team work from specialist units across the force. 'Both Baig and Salmon have failed to provide any proper account or explanation for their actions and while work is ongoing to fully understand who else is might have been involved at either end - in London or Manchester - today they have been given long prison sentences for their involvement. 'Put very simply, due to the high purity of the heroin and potential for further adulteration, we have halted hundreds of thousands, if not millions of individual street deals from taking place. 'Drugs generally, but heroin particularly, drive other crime, such as thefts, burglaries and robberies, that are committed by people afflicted by addiction. 'This in turn blights communities and we are always working hard to address this scourge on society. If anyone has information about those concerned in the sale or supply of drugs I would encourage them to call us in confidence.'","Billal Baig, 32, and Joseph Salmon, 37, were jailed for a total of 19 years .

"'What a nice coat, ma'am.' That's all Texas fast food worker Cheryl Semien said to a customer who pulled up at her drive-thru cashier on Wednesday morning, but the words were enough to touch the woman sitting in her car. So much so, she pulled the soft grey Mink coat straight off her back and passed it through the Whataburger window in Liberty - outside of Houston - to Semien.

"A Jetstar employee has lashed out at passengers  affected by Saturday's flight delays, calling them 'a bunch of whingers' and 'nuts freaking about delays'. In a Facebook comment, the budget carrier's staff member, Emily Capewell, blamed passengers who were affected by a computer glitch which caused delays of up to 90 minutes on one of the busiest travel days of the year. 'Obviously don't travel enough. Happens to everyone and today it's jetstars day,' Ms Capewell wrote on the Sydney Morning Herald's Facebook page, which has since been deleted. 'You are all a bunch of whingers! Grow up and think about the people that are working today and have to deal with all you nuts freaking about delays!' Scroll down for video . Jetstar employee Emily Capewell lashed out at passengers on social media on Saturday, calling them 'nuts freaking about delays' who need to grow up. The Jetstar staffer complained about painful passengers on the Sydney Morning Herald Facebook page this morning, as flights were delayed because of a computer glitch on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year . The airline had an IT outage overnight which caused issues for flights from early Saturday morning, a spokesman told AAP. More than 60,000 Jetstar passengers' Christmas travel plans were affected across the country. A Jetstar spokesman told SMH the company was in the process of contacting Ms Capewell, adding 'these comments are inappropriate and don't reflect the views of Jetstar or our employees.' The problem has now been fixed but passengers experienced delays of between 60 to 90 minutes throughout the morning. Jetstar passengers are being urged to prepare for delays of up to 90 minutes because of a computer glitch . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, a different Jetstar employee said the system was beginning to come back online earlier today, but delays were to be expected. A Jetstar spokesperson apologised for the disruptions and urged passengers to check their flight status on the company's website. 'We've experienced delays this morning across the Australia and New Zealand network as a result of an IT outage. Flights have been delayed by 60 to 90 minutes. 'Our systems are now coming back online and flights have departed this morning. Please check your flight status on our website.' The problem has now been fixed but delays of between 60 to 90 minutes are expected throughout the morning . 'We apologise for the disruption these delays have caused.' Qantas, who is a partner airline of Jetstar, was not affected by the outage. However, it is not clear whether the airline has yet reviewed its flight plans. Disgruntled passengers took to social media to express their anger at the airline . Russ M told passengers that they should have used Virgin or Qantas as Jetstar is a budget airline . Sydney Airport released a statement, urging people to allow plenty of time to travel to the airport, as this is one of the busiest weekends in Sydney. 'Jetstar is experiencing delays across the Australia and NZ network this morning as a result of an IT outage impacting operations,' 'This is a very busy weekend at the airport - please allow plenty of time for your journey.' Tim Roxburgh took to Twitter to reveal that his flight departed two hours behind schedule . Frustrated passengers were told to expect up to 90 minutes delays today . Outraged passengers took to social media to express their frustration at the outage. Stephen Oxley said: 'Flight delayed? This is so unlike you Jetstar' Mary Beretov took to Facebook to lay into the budget airline. The IT system failure has lead to chaos at airports across the country . Passengers were urged to check the company's website before making their way to the airport . 'Shame Jetstar with your domestic flights so many times you provide excuses and no proper communication with your customers...,, not good enough by lowering your prices you also lower you care,' she said.

"According to a new online poll, playing sick is a young thing. The Future of Work Poll, which comes from University of Melbourne, measured how employed Australians view their work, and who is most likely to fake a sick day.

The Future of Work Poll, which comes from University of Melbourne, measured how employed Australians view their work, and who is most likely to fake a sick day. Professor Peter Gahan, who directed the study, said the results have weighty implications for managers across the country. 'The people less likely to fake a sick day were workers over 45 years old or in executive and senior management positions. These more senior employees were also more likely to look forward to returning to work after their weekend,' Prof Gahan said. The results also found that fulltime employees were more likely to fake a sickie than part-time workers, and generally less likely to feel optimistic about going into work on Monday. 'The results show that if you take a sickie, you're more likely to look forward to going to work on a Monday,' says Professor Gahan. The results also found that fulltime employees were more likely to fake a sickie than part-time workers . 'This may imply that people who take 'mental health days' feel more in control of their working life, and that those who work part-time are more enthusiastic about returning to work.' The study also found that workplace leaders are much more likely than employees to look forward to work, with only nineteen percent of senior and executive managers suffering from 'Monday-it is 'compared to 42 percent of total employees. A future poll, examining small and medium businesses will be released in February in the lead up to the Future of Work 2015 conference in April.","A new poll measured how 1,035 employed Australians view their work .

"Prince Charles regularly visits Romania and owns two houses out there . A British double-decker bus, covered in images from the Carpathian Forest, has drawn up outside the British Ambassador's residence in Bucharest. The top floor has been converted into a classroom, its seats occupied by Romanian schoolchildren. A familiar head appears up the stairs. 'What have I missed?' asks Prince Charles. 'Bears! Wolves! Red squirrels!' the children shout. The Prince of Wales is here to support The European Nature Trust, which has turned the bus into a mobile classroom as part of its campaign to save the forests and wildlife of Romania. It's a subject close to Charles's heart. He first came here in 1998 on an official visit - the only time he's visited on business. He fell so much under the spell of the place that he bought a house in one of the wooden villages, then acquired another property which he's turned into a comfortable lodge. He makes a private visit for a few days every year if he can, preferably in May when the wild flowers are out, and both houses can be rented when Charles isn't there. The meadows of Romania are spectacular with a huge variety of species - as many as six times more to the square metre than can be found in Britain - as they've never been sprayed with pesticides or herbicides. The air is fragrant with the scent of herbs such as wild thyme. 'Stop!' cried the Prince when he spotted a creamy-coloured flower while walking with friends recently. 'Here's the bastard toadflax. I've wanted to see the bastard toadflax for ages.' He's been so inspired he's now planted a Transylvanian Meadow at Highgrove, his Gloucestershire home, using a wild flower seed mix mostly gathered from the hay meadows at one of his properties. Charles first visited the country in 1998 on an official visit - the only time he's visited on business. He is seen here with the then Romanian President, Emil Constantinescu . You don't have to be in Transylvania . for long to realise why the Prince is enraptured by it. The country . looks as England might have done around the year 1800. There are no . fences. Horses are a common sight on the roads pulling trailers and in . the fields yoked to ploughs. Very . little money circulates, but almost everything needed to support life . can be found growing, or is made, in the villages. Everybody is making . jams, syrups and cordials out of every conceivable berry, fruit and . nut. 'It's the last corner of Europe where . you see true sustainability and complete resilience. There's so much we can learn from it before it's too late.' Grapes, sweet from the summer sun, cluster from the vines that twine about the eaves of the farmhouses. Geese waddle out of the farmyards. Fruit swells in the orchards. Sheep are often guarded by gipsy shepherds, accompanied by ferocious dogs capable of repelling wolves. It's a land overflowing with good things, where weaving and embroidery are still practised. You'll be hard pushed to find a mega supermarket. This is the world as Prince Charles may very well feel God intended it to be. As he puts it, 'It's the timelessness which is so important.' The landscape is 'almost out of some of these stories you used to read as a child. People are yearning for that sense of identity and belonging and meaning.' In Transylvania the Prince usually begins by visiting some of the environmental and rural development causes that he supports. He'll then spend a day or two relaxing in the quiet and beauty of the countryside. But that doesn't mean putting his feet up. Walking is key for him - but the walks are accompanied by a bevy of botanists who can help inform and develop his ideas. In this hospitable country, villagers do what they can to make the Prince welcome. On his last visit a surprise was achieved by smuggling 120 children in traditional dress through the back door of a barn while the Prince was sipping an aperitif on the other side. A Field of wildflowers belonging to Prince Charles, in Zalanpatak, near Baraolt, Szeklerland, Transylvania . When the barn doors were thrown open, the Prince was regaled with a concert. So far, the Duchess of Cornwall hasn't been tempted to Transylvania, but it has found favour with the Prince's sons. In 2012, Prince Harry stayed with Count Tibor Kalnoky, who manages Prince Charles's houses, having reportedly flown out on budget airline Wizz Air. It can cost as little as £40 to get to Romania from Luton airport. The Transylvanian landscape looks something like Shropshire, with more woods and no hedges. Centuries-old trees stand in the meadows, giving shade to cattle in the fierce summer heats. The beechwoods are reminiscent of Sussex; only with hardly anybody about and no sign of human habitation for miles. There are more brown bears in Romania's forests than anywhere else in Europe. They're shy animals - even more elusive, for Prince Charles, than the bastard toadflax, since he hasn't actually seen one, even though they have been known to play on the hillside behind his lodge at Zalánpatak. There are more brown bears in Romania's forests than anywhere else in Europe . The forests are also home to wolves and lynx. Scientists believe these large carnivores are essential to the forest ecosystem. If left unchecked, deer would eat every young shoot as it appeared above ground. Wolves and lynx control their numbers, making it possible for the forest to regenerate. At a time when Britain is letting in large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Prince Charles is leading a small counter-migration: of well-heeled Northern Europeans who delight in species-rich meadows and rickety farmhouses (which, incidentally, can still be bought for a song). 'It's the last corner of Europe where you see true sustainability and complete resilience,' says the Prince. 'There's so much we can learn from it before it's too late.' There is sometimes a note of frustration in the Prince's voice when he finds himself fighting a King Canute-like battle against an incoming tide of modernity, as when he speaks to the Travel Channel's Charlie Ottley in a series on Romania called Wild Carpathia being shown tomorrow and Monday. 'You'd think by now we might have learnt a few lessons from the things that have gone wrong,' he says. The Prince's house in Viscri is called the Blue House and he bought it in 2006 for £12,000 . Viscri, where Charles bought his first house in 2006 for around £12,000, still looks like the sort of place Thomas Hardy would have recognised. There are no pavements, no street lighting. Ducks and geese waddle down to the stream. Beyond the reddish tiles of the rooftops are glimpses of unspoilt countryside, without a wind farm or superstore in sight. A pipe dribbles water into a horse trough. 92,043 The number of square miles Romania covers, surpassing Britain's 88,745 . 74.45 The official life expectancy of the country's population of 21.8 million . 97.7 The percentage of Romanians over tha age of 15 who can read and write . 4,400 British businesses worth more than £2bn, operate in the country . 45 Years of Communist rule ended with a revolution in 1989 . The principal commercial activity consists of village women selling a variety of hand-knitted socks in striking patterns. The Prince's house is called the Blue House, after the blue limewash on the facade, against which are set olive-green shutters. Inside, the courtyard, partly cobbled, is planted with vegetables. A vine grows beneath the eaves. The furniture consists of old-fashioned painted chests and time-worn wooden benches. There are only three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a kitchen. The locally embroidered towels and hand-woven throws may be ever-so-slightly reminiscent of an artfully rustic World Of Interiors photo shoot, but the house is unquestionably delightful. The whole village is. At Zalánpatak, the Prince found a farmhouse at the end of a lane where he can walk directly into the meadows and up into woods. When I stayed, the morning began with the sound of cowbells, as cattle swayed out from their barns into the pasture. We heard them again in the evening, as each animal found her way back to her own barn. The nights were velvet-black, their silence only broken by the barking of guard dogs. No ringing of telephones disturbed the tranquillity. Fields of wild crocuses bloomed beside the roads. In summer, hay is heaped into rum baba-shaped stacks. The Prince's guest house in Zalánpatak (left) and its basic interior (right) The main cabin, heated by  log fires and traditional ceramic stoves, has only three rooms.  All the furniture - carved wooden beds, 19th-century chairs, an old oil lamp (converted to electricity) suspended from the ceiling, even an ancient radio - has been restored by hand. It's cosy, rustic and tasteful. As Prince Charles bounds from the bus to the car that will take him to the airport in Bucharest, he shows no sign of slowing down. Romania remains a place that he will visit in a private capacity for a few days a year, but its importance to him is more than that. Wherever he goes, the memory of it goes with him: a place where so many of his most passionately held ideas about humanity's place in the world are played out in everyday life.

"American Apparel's controversial founder is planning a dramatic return to the cash-strapped company days after he was fired over a string of sexual harassment lawsuits. Dov Charney has joined forces with a private equity firm and is planning a takeover bid that values the company at $1.30 to $1.40 a share, the New York Post reported. Sources told the paper that the firm, who's identity is yet to be confirmed, wrote to American Apparel's board of directors to confirm its interest in buying the clothing retailer. Buyout bid: Dov Charney has allegedly joined forces with a private equity firm and is planning a takeover bid that values the company at $1.30 to $1.40 a share . It is the second such approach by the equity company in the past few weeks, according to the paper. 'This whole episode has a lot less to do with pictures of naked women, and a whole lot more to do with a power struggle,' a source told the Post, referring to the board's allegations that Charney allowed a blogger to post nude photos of a former employee who was suing the company in 2011. The Wall Street Journal today named private-equity firm Irving Place Capital as having made a move to buy out American Apparel. It is not clear whether that is the same company allegedly associated with Charney. It comes days after American Apparel fired Charney and named longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider to be its next CEO. Final decision: American Apparel said on Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee' The Los Angeles-based company's board voted to oust Mr Charney as CEO in June, citing allegations of misconduct. He was put under suspension this summer, but still served as a consultant to the company. American Apparel said on Tuesday that it has terminated his position 'for cause' after an internal investigation. Ms Schneider said in an interview: 'I'm very, very excited to be part of something that is such a big influence on pop culture and helps so many Americans.' Calling American Apparel 'the largest manufacturer of apparel in North America,' she added: 'There are a lot of jobs and a lot of people, and we want to keep that going.' American Apparel, which Mr Charney founded in 1998, manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. It is famous for selling American-made goods and for its risque advertising. The Montreal-born Mr Charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers. In 2011, a former employee accused Mr Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise. She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' In 2012, Mr Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Mr Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Mr Bumblis was later fired from his job. Moving on: Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider (left, in 2004), formerly of Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria, has been named as the retailer's next CEO . American Apparel said Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided, based on the results of an internal investigation conducted by FTI Consulting, that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee.' The company has suffered financially. It has recorded annual losses since 2010 and reported three quarterly losses this year. Its stock has dropped 53per cent in 2014. Ms Schneider, who officially starts as CEO on January 5, has been a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria. She said in a statement that she hopes to 'make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, Made in USA manufacturing philosophy.' American Apparel has operated under two interim CEOs since Mr Charney's ouster, most recently Scott Brubaker, who will continue in that role through the end of the year. Shares rose 5 cents, or 8.6per cent, to 63 cents in after-hours trading. The stock closed up 3 cents at 58 cents on Tuesday.","Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider was named as new CEO .

"It is a gripe that frustrates subway riders daily: men with their legs splayed. So one woman decided to confront male commuters about the amount of space they consume. The investigation comes a month before New York City's MTA launches a campaign targeting 'manspreaders'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confronted: A woman confronted men who take up space on New York City's subway by splaying their legs . Questions: She asked each male commuter whether they thought it appropriate to sit in such a way . Campaign: It comes ahead of the MTA's official campaign targeting 'manspreaders' about consideration . Just a male problem? The reporter asked men why they thought male passengers specifically did this . Despite adverts urging consideration of others, Gothamist's reporter did not have trouble finding interviewees. Each man is asked if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them. Many insist this is not normal behavior. One's splay is to accommodate a bag, another is exhausted. A defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space. They are then asked to measure - with a measuring tape - the appropriate amount of space allotted for a considerate 'manspread'. That is where the results differ - from six inches to 18. Measure it up: Handed a measuring tape, each man was asked to determine how wide is appropriate . Different opinions: Each man came up with a different measurement for inner leg to inner leg distance . Explanation: They each had ideas about when it was and wasn't appropriate to 'manspread' Biology: One man insisted it is biologically mandatory that men sit with their legs splayed . Is it a problem?

Steyn had limped off on the third afternoon with a groin problem but showed no signs of discomfort as he steamed in to skittle the West Indies top order in a spell that lasted 90 minutes. Leon Johnson (39) edged behind to wicketkeeper AB de Villiers, before Shivnarine Chanderpaul (four) tried to evade a short ball that did not get up as high as he expected and gloved the ball to the keeper. That left the West Indies in trouble, but their situation became a hopeless one when Marlon Samuels looped up a catch for Dean Elgar off a rampant Steyn with his score on 17. West Indies batsman Jermaine Blackwood plays a shot but their resistance was short-lived . Steyn celebrates again after removing Leon Johnson for 39, AB de Villiers taking the catch . Captain Denesh Ramdin (four), who had called for greater grit and application from the batsmen in the lead-up to the test, lasted just two balls as Steyn claimed his fourth by inducing an edge off the shoulder of the bat to a leaping De Villiers. Morne Morkel picked up his second wicket of the innings when he removed Jermaine Blackwood (15), who could only fend a rising delivery to substitute fielder Temba Bavuma at short leg. The game was up for the tourists and Steyn picked up the final two wickets, with Kyle Abbott taking an easy catch off Sheldon Cottrell at mid-wicket to end the game with bowler Kemar Roach not batting in the innings as he rests his injured ankle. The West Indies were bowled out twice in the test in just under 103 overs, leaving them with much to contemplate ahead of the second test in Port Elizabeth that starts on Boxing day.","South Africa beat West Indies by an innings and 220 runs in first Test .

"Jonathan Trott's return to the cricketing fold received a welcome endorsement yesterday, when he was named captain of the Lions team that will tour South Africa in the new year. Trott has not played for England since his shock return from Australia in the wake of the first Test in Brisbane last year suffering from what was eventually diagnosed as situation anxiety. But his rehabilitation, which faltered when he withdrew from county cricket soon after his return last season, has now reached the point where he is one step away from a full England recall. Jonathan Trott is expected to be named in an England Lions squad to tour South Africa in January . Trott has been named Lions captain following a series of impressive displayed for Warwickshire . First-class squad to face South Africa A . Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jack Brooks (Yorkshire), Alex Lees (Yorkshire), Adam Lyth (Yorkshire), Craig Overton (Somerset), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Boyd Rankin (Warwickshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Adam Riley (Kent), Sam Robson (Middlesex), Jonathan Trott (Warwickshire), James Vince (Hampshire). Jason Roy (Surrey), Stephen Parry (Lancashire) and Samit Patel (Notts) will replace Trott, Robson and Riley in the 50-over squad to face South Africa A . Yet James Whitaker, England’s national selector, urged caution while welcoming the development. ‘It’s exceptional news,’ said Whitaker at Lord’s yesterday. ‘I have spoken to Trotty regularly and the improvement in his state of mind and readiness to get back involved in cricket has been huge for him. ‘He can take great credit for that. ‘Let’s work with him to get the best opportunities for him. 'If it means he’s simply a county cricketer in the future then that’s still fantastic but we’ve given him a step-staged return and he will be going into an environment which is slightly higher than county cricket.

"Kim Jong Un was photographed being mobbed by an adoring crowd just days after the FBI confirmed North Korea's spies were responsible for hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment. The dictator was surrounded by hordes of delirious citizens while visiting a textile mill in the capital city of Pyongyang to offer his guidance. The outing came as his country proposed a joint investigation with the US into the hacking attack - warning of 'serious consequences' if Washington denies North Korea the chance to clear its name. Scroll down for video . Kim's latest outing: The dictator was surrounded by hordes of delirious citizens while visiting a textile mill in the capital city of Pyongyang . Kim barely had room to move during his visit as the crowd, many appearing to cry with joy, mobbed their leader while raising their hands in salute. This week the US vowed to respond to the cyber crime - which the FBI pinned on North Korea - claiming the attack was 'intended to inflict significant harm' on American citizens. The hack resulted in the disclosure of tens of thousands of leaked emails and other materials and escalated to '9/11-style' terrorist threats against US cinemas that prompted Sony to cancel the Christmas release of the movie The Interview. The comedy, written by and starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Statement: Today North Korea proposed a joint probe with the US into the hack - warning of 'serious consequences' if the offer is rejected . Dig at the CIA: A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea can prove its innocence 'without resorting to torture' Today, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea knows how to prove its innocence and insisted the US must accept its proposal for the joint investigation. They said: 'The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures while finding fault with North Korea. 'We have a way to prove that we have nothing to do with the case without resorting to torture, as what the CIA does.' Brought to its knees: The hack resulted in the disclosure of tens of thousands of leaked emails and other materials and escalated to '9/11-style' terrorist threats against US cinemas that prompted Sony to cancel the Christmas release of the movie The Interview . Cancelled: The comedy, written by and starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is about a CIA plot to assassinate Kim Jong Un . Yesterday Barack Obama said Sony made a crucial mistake in cancelling the Christmas Day release of The Interview. Speaking in a press conference, he said: 'Sony's a corporation. It has suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.' 'Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake. I wish they had spoken to me first. I would have told then, ""Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks"".' 'Sony made a mistake': Barack Obama said yesterday that Sony should have spoken to him before canceling the The Interview . Fear of reprisal: George Clooney said Hollywood bigwigs 'know what they have written in emails' and are 'afraid' to support The Interview . Sony claimed it had had no choice but to cancel distribution of the movie since cinemas were refusing to show it. Hollywood star George Clooney recently weighed into the argument by circulating a petition supporting the film. The actor said he believed fellow celebrities and industry figures were afraid to sign it in case they were also targeted by hackers. Speaking to Hollywood showbiz magazine, Clooney described the tactic as 'brilliant', because the hackers humiliated Sony, which subsequently prevented anyone from standing up to defend them. He said: 'After the Obama joke, no one was going to get on the side of Amy, [Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures co-chair] and so suddenly, everyone ran for the hills. 'Look, I can't make an excuse for that joke, it is what it is, a terrible mistake. Having said that, it was used as a weapon of fear, not only for everyone to disassociate themselves from Amy but also to feel the fear themselves. 'They know what they themselves have written in their emails, and they're afraid.'

"She's often spoken of her love of animals but the enormous Mother Goose that greeted Camilla as she arrived at a London horse show probably wasn't quite what she had in mind. The super-sized bird towered over the Duchess of Cornwall as she gamely stopped for a chat with the actor inside, craning her neck in a bid to make eye contact. Camilla's encounter with Mother Goose came as she paid a visit to Olympia, the London International Horse Show, a festive tradition of the Duchess' that has been going on for a decade. It's behind you! Camilla meets performers at the international horse show including a giant Mother Goose . Anyone in there? Camilla cranes her neck in a bid to make eye contact with the actor inside . During the visit, which saw her take the Royal Salute from the President's Box before presenting trophies to the winners of the Christmas Pudding Stakes, Camilla, 67, went backstage to meet performers. These included the Ukrainian Cossacks and members of the Metropolitan Police's mounted force, who were at the show to take part in an annual activity ride. She also stopped to pat some of the tiny steeds scheduled to take part in the Shetland Pony Grand National, which was eventually won by Mighty Mark, who, at 21, is the oldest animal ever to take part. While Mighty Mark was less than impressed by the trophies on offer, he did get a prize of his own in the shape of a polo proffered by the horse-loving Duchess. Festive: Other members of the cast included a fairy, a monkey and a sparkly elf . Giant: The Mother Goose towered over the Duchess of Cornwall - not that she appeared to mind . Group shot: The encounter concluded with a group photograph of the performers and the Duchess . Camilla has had a busy few weeks and, last Thursday, threw a Christmas party for terminally ill children at Clarence House. During the festivities, which saw the Duchess serve the children a lunch of sausages and mash, Camilla helped the youngsters decorate the Christmas tree with strings of dried apple. She also persuaded her assistant equerry, Captain Fred Lloyd George, to turn up in full uniform - including a bearskin hat - and give the delighted children a salute. Next week will see the Duchess join the Prince of Wales and the rest of the royal family at Sandringham for the traditional Christmas celebrations. She will also be part of the group, along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to take part in the annual Christmas Day service at the estate's church. Hungry? One of the pint-sized performers accepts his prize of a polo from the Duchess' outstretched hand . Animal lover: The Duchess of Cornwall has long adored animals, horses in particular . Performer: The mounted division of the Metropolitan Police participate in the international horse show . The Queen has already arrived at the Norfolk estate and was pictured getting off the train at Kings Lynn station yesterday. Sandringham has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of her son Edward, then Prince of Wales. Since then, the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that King George VI died on the 6th February 1952. It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that. Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech. Impressive: Camilla meets Ukrainian Cossacks following their performance at the Olympia horse show . International relations: The Duchess makes friends with one of the Cossack horses . Winner: Camilla presents a trophy to Irish showjumper David Simpson and his horse Richi Rich . Do you know the way to Sandringham? The Duchess is introduced to Father Christmas . Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers. 'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady. 'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.' A Palace spokesman refused to comment, but did point to the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947. Then, the Queen said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.' In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.' Big arrival: The Queen arrived at Sandringham for her Christmas holiday yesterday . On her own: The Duke of Edinburgh has remained in London but will join her in a few days time . Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years. 2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down. The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'. He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year. New ruler: King Felipe of Spain is the newest European monarch after his father stepped down in June . Stepping up: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands ascended to the throne on the 30 April 2013 . Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four. One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe. However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.

"North Korea on Saturday proposed a joint investigation with the U.S. into the hacking attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, warning of 'serious' consequences if Washington rejects a probe that it believes will prove Pyongyang had nothing to do with the cyberattack. The proposal was seen as a typical ploy by the North to try to show that it is sincere, even though it likely knows the U.S. would never accept its offer for a joint investigation, analysts said. U.S. officials blame North Korea for the hacking, citing the tools used in the Sony attack and previous hacks linked to the North, and have vowed a response. Scroll down for video . Mobbed in the street:North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un was surrounded by hordes of delirious citizens while visiting a textile mill in the capital city of Pyongyang today . North Korea on Saturday proposed a joint investigation with the U.S. into the hacking attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, warning of 'serious' consequences if Washington rejects a probe . The break-in resulted in the disclosure of tens of thousands of confidential Sony emails and business files, and escalated to terrorist threats that caused Sony to cancel the Christmas Day release of the movie ]The Interview.' The comedy is about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Saturday, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea knows how to prove it's not responsible for the hacking, saying Washington is slandering Pyongyang by spreading unfounded rumors. 'The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures while finding fault with' North Korea, the spokesman said in a statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA. 'We have a way to prove that we have nothing to do with the case without resorting to torture, as what the CIA does,' he said, adding that the U.S. lacks any specific evidence tying North Korea to the hacking. Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Seoul's Dongguk University, called the North's proposal a 'typical' tactic the country has taken in similar disputes with rival countries. In 2010, North Korea proposed a joint investigation after a South Korea-led international team concluded that the North was behind a torpedo attack that killed 46 South Korean sailors, though Pyongyang denied its involvement. South Korea rejected the North's offer for the joint probe. 'They are now talking about a joint investigation because they think there is no conclusive evidence,' Koh said. 'But the U.S. won't accede to a joint investigation for the crime.' On Saturday, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said North Korea knows how to prove it's not responsible for the hacking . On Friday, President Barack Obama declared that Sony 'made a mistake' in shelving the satirical film about a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, and pledged that the U.S. would respond 'in a place and manner and time that we choose' to the hacking attack on Sony that led to the movie's withdrawal. 'I wish they had spoken to me first. ... We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship,' Obama said at a year-end news conference, speaking of executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony said it had had no choice but to cancel distribution of the movie since theaters were refusing to show it. U.S. options for acting against North Korea are limited. The U.S. already has severe trade sanctions in place, and there is no appetite for military action. Even if investigators could identify and prosecute the individual hackers believed responsible, there's no guarantee that any located are overseas would ever see a U.S. courtroom. Hacking back at North Korean targets by U.S. government experts could encourage further attacks against American targets. President Barack Obama declared that Sony 'made a mistake' in shelving the satirical film about a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader . North Korea and the U.S. remain in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. The rivals also are locked in an international standoff over the North's nuclear and missile programs and its alleged human rights abuses. Earlier Saturday, North Korea angrily denounced a move by the United Nations to bring its human rights record before the Security Council and renewed its threat to further bolster its nuclear deterrent against what it called a hostile policy by the U.S. to topple its ruling regime. Pyongyang 'vehemently and categorically rejects' the resolution passed by the U.N. General Assembly that could open the door for its leaders, including Kim Jong Un, to be hauled before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, according to a Foreign Ministry statement carried by KCNA. The Security Council is due to meet Monday to discuss Pyongyang's human rights situation for the first time. The meeting caps almost a year of international pressure, and even though ally China could use its veto power to block any action against the North, the nonbinding resolution has broad support in the General Assembly and has drawn unusually strong and vitriolic protests from Pyongyang.","Analysts say move is ploy try to show that it is sincere, even though it likely knows the U.S. would never accept its offer for a joint investigation .

"A distraught elderly couple are facing Christmas apart because ‘box-ticking’ social workers refuse to let them spend it in the same nursing home. Raffaello Gerra, 84, and his wife Isabel, 70, have been told they must be separated after more than 50 years of marriage because of council protocol. Mr Gerra, a retired hotelier, had been living in sheltered housing next to the nursing home that looks after his wife, who suffers from dementia. But after a stroke in October, he now needs round-the-clock care and cannot leave his hospital bed to visit her. Raffaello Gerra, 84, and his wife Isabel, 70, face Christmas apart after 50 years of marriage because of social workers will not let them stay in the same care home . Doctors recommend that Mr Gerra join his wife in her home – but social workers say he must go to an ‘assessment centre’ for around six weeks instead. Despite the fact that he cannot walk, dress himself or visit the bathroom, Milton Keynes Council maintain that his ‘needs’ may not meet the correct criteria for a place. The Gerras’ 49-year-old daughter Stephanie, a psychotherapist, said: ‘Mum and Dad desperately want to be together. They’ve been soulmates all their lives. I don’t know how long either of them have left so every week that passes is precious. Dad has become very depressed. Mum is missing him and has even asked if he was dead. It’s heart-breaking. ‘Keeping them apart is nothing but a box-ticking exercise.’ The couple met in London more than 50 years ago, and have worked all their lives without claiming benefits. Mr Gerra, an Italian, fell in love with his Spanish wife ‘at first sight’ when she came to work in the same hotel as him. Soulmates: The Gerras' at their wedding in 1964 . They married in 1964 and raised two children – Stephanie and her brother Alex, now 44 – while running the family hotel in Bloomsbury, central London. They have four grandchildren. But after the couple retired to Milton Keynes, Mrs Gerra was last year diagnosed with late stage dementia, and was forced to move into Ashby House Care Home. She took comfort from the presence of her husband, who visited every day, made friends with staff and came to view it as a second home. But following his stroke two months ago, the medical team at Milton Keynes Hospital say he can no longer live alone and recommend that he joins his wife. As well as mobility issues, Mr Gerra has poor eyesight, poor hearing, failing kidney function, diabetes and high blood pressure. In a letter to social workers, a hospital consultant said: ‘In my opinion, Mr Gerra would greatly benefit from a place at Ashby House. This would enhance his well-being and reunite him with his wife, which would help support his emotional needs.’ But despite pleas from Mr Gerra’s family, the council said he must go to another institution, Orchard House, for ‘assessment’ instead. And after an examination period likely to last at least six weeks, there is no guarantee he will be allowed the funding for a £650-a-week place with his wife. A letter from social services said the process ‘is used to assess all service users where it is not clear what support they will need upon discharge’, adding that ‘the hospital is not a natural environment to establish someone’s needs’. It means the couple could be forced to live in separate care homes for the rest of their lives, as Mr Gerra does not have the means to fund his own place at Ashby House. Their daughter added: ‘My parents have been hard-working taxpayers all their lives and never asked for anything. My mother actually didn’t claim her pension for some years. ‘They wouldn’t dream of claiming benefits and have always been self-reliant. I feel they’ve earned this care in their hour of need. All my dad can say is that he hopes God lets him live long enough to look after Mum. It breaks his heart that she’s slowly disappearing without him there.’ A spokesman for the council said they ‘are very sympathetic to the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Gerra. We are working closely with the family to ensure they are provided with the appropriate support when he is well enough to leave hospital.’ Stephanie Gerra has created an online petition highlighting her parents’ plight here .","A distraught elderly couple face Christmas apart because of council rules .

Since publishing the application request to import the carcass, U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service officials have received 15,000 comments against, and 135,000 signatures on a petition to the same effect. It is an unprecedented response to a U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service application, which normally receives around eight comments per case. Controversy: Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 at a January auction for a rare permit to hunt endangered black rhinoceros in Namibia. His request has received an unprecedented number of responses blocking it . 'I'm not sure we've ever received a petition quite like this one before,' said service spokesman Gavin Shire. Shire said the agency will examine the public comments 'for substantive information' as it weighs whether the hunt in Namibia — where 1,800 of the remaining 4,880 black rhinos live — is a form of conservation. The club said the hunt is postponed until Knowlton gets permission to import the trophy of one of five black rhinos approved by the Namibian government for culling. Namibia sold another hunting permit directly to Michael Luzich, a Las Vegas investment manager who also is seeking a permit to bring the trophy into the U.S. But Luzich has received far less scrutiny than Knowlton, who said in January he hired full-time security because he received death threats after his name was leaked on the Internet. The agency granted a permit to import a sport-hunted black rhino taken in Namibia in 2009, but has said it is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching. This is a stock photo of the rare species of black rhinoceros that Mr Knowlton hopes to hunt . Happy hunters: Knowlton (right) has been leading tourist hunting trips for over a decade . Environmentalists say the animals are already under the gun for their prized horns, and that allowing them to be hunted is wrong. 'Kill it to save it is counterintuitive and flawed logic,' said Jeff Flocken, the North American regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 'The fact that some Americans are showing they will pay any price to kill one of the last black rhinos is not going to help the species in the long run but only continue to put a price on its head.'","Corey Knowlton paid $150,000 at auction to hunt and kill rare rhinoceros .

"Norwich struck late on to deny Derby a return to top spot in the Sky Bet Championship as the Canaries twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at the iPro Stadium. Defender Steven Whittaker was the unlikely saviour for the visitors as his 89th-minute strike earned Neil Adams' men a point. Norwich's first equaliser came from Cameron Jerome early in the second half, after Johnny Russell had netted just before half-time to give Derby a lead they barely deserved.

Scorer(s): Jerome 51, Whittaker 89 . Booked: Cuellar, Tettey . Referee: Paul Tierney . Attendance: 27,974 . The Canaries were not on level terms for long though as their former striker Chris Martin quickly restored the Rams' lead from the penalty spot. Derby looked like they had done enough to go two points clear at the summit ahead of the afternoon kick-offs, but Whittaker was on target to give Norwich the share of the points their performance warranted. Carlos Cuellar and Craig Bryson both collected early bookings before Chris Martin got across his marker to head over the crossbar from a Omar Mascarell corner after 18 minutes in what was Derby's first effort at goal. Norwich were enjoying a lot of the ball, without really creating too much. But it concerned Rams head coach Steve McClaren enough for him to vacate his viewing position in the stand to join first-team coach Paul Simpson by the side of the pitch in the technical area. The Canaries had the ball in the net just after the half hour mark. Alex Tettey, and the majority of the 27,974 inside the iPro Stadium, thought he had given the visitors the lead with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area.

The festive cheer was in full swing at Derby as a Norwich fan dresses in a canary themed Santa outift . However, a very late flag spoiled the celebrations, with the referee's assistant ruling that Cameron Jerome had been offside in front of goalkeeper Lee Grant. Russell saw a shot from the right-hand side of the area deflected into the arms of John Ruddy after Derby were arguably guilty of over-playing the ball, with Jordan Ibe and Martin passing up opportunities to shoot before the Scot obliged. Bradley Johnson narrowly missed the top corner of the net after he was allowed to advance goalwards as Norwich looked the more likely to score.

Some brilliant centre-forward play by Chris Martin saw him bring a long ball down on his chest before turning and getting into the penalty area, where he laid on a square pass for Russell who poked his shot beyond the helpless Ruddy from point-blank range. Norwich probably felt aggrieved at their deficit but they equalised six minutes into the second half when the unmarked Jerome swept home a shot at the far post from Jonny Howson's low ball across the six-yard box. The visitors were level for just two minutes though. Cuellar brought down Martin just inside the area and the big striker picked himself up to score from the penalty spot, sending Ruddy the wrong way with his confidently-struck right-foot shot.

Norwich, as with spells in the first half, had lots of possession as they searched for another equalising goal. Jerome and substitute Nathan Redmond threatened before Whittaker's 20-yard effort skimmed the side-netting. It looked like Derby would hold on for the three points that would take them back to the top of the table, for a few hours at least, but after the Rams failed to clear a corner, Whittaker struck with a shot that went in off the inside of a post. Jerome almost snatched victory for the Canaries in injury time but he blazed his shot over the crossbar from 12 yards out.

"West Ham hope to announce the signing of Canadian defender Doneil Henry. His work permit application will be submitted on Monday and manager Sam Allardyce has high hopes that 6ft 2in Henry will make the grade in the Barclays Premier League. Henry already has 14 caps for the senior Canada team and the high-flying Hammers hope that will be enough to get the application through the stringent work permit test, although caps for Canada do not rank highly. West Ham are hopeful to announce the signing of defender Doneil Henry following a work permit application . Henry has 14 full international caps for Canada and has twice been on trial with the Hammers . West Ham, however, believe the former Canadian U20 player of the year will prove to be a wise signing and will make a strong case. Apollon Limassol signed him, then loaned him back to Toronto and the Cypriot club will get the transfer fee, even though he has yet to play for them. He was due to make his debut for Appollon in January, but West Ham have stepped in with an offer. He has been a team-mate of ex-West Ham striker Jermain Defoe in the MLS and the fee is likely to be around £1.5m. He has played 70 times for Toronto after rising through their academy. West Ham's Winston Reid has not yet signed a new contract with the club and can leave for free in the summer . Henry, 21, has twice been on trial at West Ham and Allardyce has been tracking his performances. Sources say Big Sam was 'impressed' and feels Henry is 'raw, but talented'. West Ham are searching for a replacement for New Zealand defender Winston Reid who can leave on a free transfer in the summer and is reluctant to sign a new contract. Signing Henry now will give him the chance to prove he can step into Reid's boots. Henry was coached by former QPR defender Ryan Nelsen at Toronto. Nelsen has high hopes for his protege. The deal, subject to his work permit being granted, should go through when the transfer window opens on January 1. If the work permit application is a success Henry would be a perfect replacement for Reid should he leave .","West Ham could announce the signing of central defender Doneil Henry .

"Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp is contemplating giving Ravel Morrison his 'last chance' to kickstart his career in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has a history of troublesome behaviour and has recently returned to West Ham after having his loan spell at Cardiff City cut short.

"Yohan Cabaye has been told to quit PSG as his slump in form continues. The former Newcastle United midfielder - who joined the Parisians for £20million in January - is in danger of losing his place in the France side after struggling to make an impact at Parc des Princes.

"Liverpool winger Lazar Markovic looks like he is starting to finally settle into English football after manager Brendan Rodgers urged him to be more aggressive. That advice backfired when he was sent off just 15 minutes after coming on as a substitute in the club's Champions League exit against Basle last week after flailing an arm into an opponent's face. However, employed on the left-hand side of a midfield four, requiring more defensive effort than he is used to, against Bournemouth on Wednesday the 20-year-old impressed and scored his first goal for the club. Lazar Markovic nets Liverpool's second goal during their 3-1 Capital One Cup victory over Bournemouth . 'I thought it was a great finish. I thought he was excellent in a role where we asked different tactical elements from him,' said Rodgers. 'His energy and quality was good and he was a real threat for us.' Rodgers added on liverpoolfc.com: 'It has taken him a bit of time to get going and we have talked to him about being more aggressive in his game. 'In the 15 minutes before he got sent off against Basle - and it was disappointing that he was sent off - because he started really well. That's the Markovic that we know. 'Playing in that role (against Bournemouth) he was outstanding; he was defensively good and pressed the ball at almost all of the right times, so tactically he was very good. Dejan Lovren (centre) looks shocked as Lazar Markovic (right) is sent off against Basle at Anfield . 'And with the ball his speed and movement was excellent. He has got good quality and is a good footballer. It is pleasing. At 20 years of age, he looks like he is improving all the time.' Markovic cost Liverpool £20million when he moved from Benfica as one of Europe's brightest talents but he has so far failed to show many glimpses of his potential. The Serbia international will hope he did enough in midweek to retain a place to face Arsenal at home on Sunday. Liverpool need a good performance against the in-form Gunners, who have scored four goals in their last two matches in the Premier League and Europe. Brendan Rodgers (above) signed Markovic for £20million from Benfica during the summer . They have scored just seven goals in eight matches at Anfield in the league this season, goals which have produced just 12 points at home, and they are five points adrift of sixth-placed Arsenal before this weekend's matches. Having lost to Manchester United last weekend to fall 10 points behind their arch-rivals they can ill-afford another defeat to a top-four competitor. Asked what a victory over Arsenal would do for their season, never mind their confidence, Rodgers added: Internally, it will continue our spirit and our focus. Mamadou Sakho (right) could make his first start since September for Liverpool against the Gunners . 'For us it will good for confidence. But it will be a difficult game. 'They are a top side with outstanding players. They did okay at home last week winning 4-1 against Newcastle and they played really well. 'They have outstanding players but we will look to focus on ourselves.' Defender Dejan Lovren faces a late test to see whether he has recovered from the groin problem which forced him off against Bournemouth but it seems likely Mamadou Sakho could deputise in a newly-formed back three, which would be his first start in the league since mid-September.","Lazar Markovic cost Liverpool £20million when he moved from Benfica .

"After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention. But as the Ukip leader walked through central London this morning he seemed unimpressed by an appearance by Jesus - or at least a very good look-a-like. To make matters worse, the bizarre stunt happened hours before the party suspended Ukip candidate Winston McKenzie, who this week compared Mr Farage to Christ. Scroll down for video . After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention . Ukip has had a torrid few weeks, dogged by in-fighting over candidate selection and gaffes by Mr Farage which have seen his personal ratings plummet to a record low. He failed to see the funny side when confronted by Kevin Lee Light, aka Jesus of Hollywood. Mr Farage took a phone call and walked away with aides, after being grilled on live radio about whether a run of bad headlines had lead to a slump in his personal ratings. The professional Jesus impersonator, who arrived in the UK from LA this week, appeared in the background of photos in central London. Mr Farage took a phone call and walked away with aides, after being grilled on live radio about whether a run of bad headlines had lead to a slump in his personal rating . Winston McKenzie, the party's Commonwealth spokesman, has been stripped of the local role while an investigation is carried out . A senior Ukip figure has been suspended as chairman of the Lambeth and North Croydon branch, the party has confirmed. Winston McKenzie, the party's Commonwealth spokesman, has been stripped of the local role while an investigation is carried out, a spokesman said. The former boxer this week compared party leader Nigel Farage to Jesus. 'Jesus was one man, we're his army. Farage is one man, and we're his army and that's what it's all about,' he said. 'Everywhere he goes, it doesn't matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.' Ukip declined to say what the investigation will look into but the suspension comes after a letter of no confidence in Mr McKenzie was backed by a number of members, according to the Croydon Advertiser. A Ukip spokesman said: 'The Lambeth and North Croydon branch of Ukip has been suspended, along with its officers, pending the outcome of an internal inquiry into its activities. 'Winston McKenzie remains our PPC.' Light has been signed by PR agency Mother to come to Britain, after becoming a minor celebrity in the US. Sasha Markova from Mother said: 'We told him who Farage was and he really didn't like it.' She said every year ad agencies compete to produce the best festive stunt. 'For us, there was something amazing about literally going back to the original idea - just seeing the immediacy of a powerful symbol sent out into the streets and how people are reacting to it.' It comes just days after one Ukip candidate compared Mr Farage to Jesus. Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie, who is a former professional boxer and has previously courted controversy with remarks about gay adoption, said the party leader can 'do no wrong'. 'Jesus was one man, we're his army. Farage is one man, and we're his army and that's what it's all about,' he said. 'Everywhere he goes, it doesn't matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.' But it might take some help from the real son of God to turn around Mr Farage's run of bad luck. Ukip's general secretary Roger Bird was suspended last week over allegations of behaving inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress. She had been a front runner for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock, but after pulling out of the race, Kerry Smith was selected. Mr Smith was then forced to quit this week, after the emergence of taped phone calls in which he mocked a 'f***ing disgusting old poofter' who belongs to a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning group. Mr Smith also joked about 'shooting peasants', mocked Ukip activist Lucy Bostick for printing 'boring c**p' on her leaflets, and referred to a woman with a Chinese name as a 'Chinky bird'. Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin. He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so. And he was mocked after suggesting traffic jams on the M4 were caused by immigrants. A new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction with Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied. This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year. Today Mr Farage questioned the credibility of IpsosMori, adding: 'I know that personal ratings are a fickle thing, and this is a very, very volatile time that we are in.' However, he conceded: 'We've had a difficult couple of weeks.' The bizarre confrontation in central London comes just days after one Ukip candidate compared Mr Farage to Jesus. Taking questions on LBC radio, Mr Farage also insisted he was only joking when he blamed immigrants for a traffic jam on the M4. The Ukip leader was mocked this month for the bizarre excuse for turning up late to an event where party members had been charged £25 to meet him. He complained at the time: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' But today he denied believing immigration policy affected his traffic flows: 'It was a joke, I've learned something. Never joke. 'There's no point is there? Nobody has a sense of humour any more so there is no point doing that.' Sex education policy confusion . Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.' Ostentatious breastfeeding . Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here... What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' General secretary sex scandal . Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications . Rate an immigrant game . Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. Weeding out the lunatics . Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments . Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.","Ukip leader looks unimpressed with stunt by American Kevin Lee Light .

"Who needs a centre-forward when you have David Silva? The little Spaniard rescued strikerless Manchester City on Saturday as Manuel Pellegrini’s men glossed over their injury problems to make it eight wins in a row and join Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. James Milner was given the false No 9 role because of injuries to Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, but it was Silva who provided support and, ultimately, the knockout punch with two quickfire goals in the second half. The 28-year-old is referred to as ‘Merlin’ by team-mates because of his wizardry on the ball and the only surprise was that he waited for more than a year to score at the Etihad.

Silva (right) opened the scoring with a heavily deflected shot during Manchester City's 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace . Yaya Toure completed the rout with his side's third goal from a thunderous strike towards the end of the game . Yaya Toure added a cracking third goal in the 81st minute and City are now level on 39 points with Chelsea and only one behind on goal difference, while Jose Mourinho’s side face a difficult trip to Stoke tomorrow. Pellegrini was happy with his experiment of using Milner up front. It was the player’s seventh different outfield position in his City career. ‘I was always confident because I thought we played well in the first half. We showed patience to create space so I was absolutely sure we would score in the end,’ he said. ‘Milner did well, it was a sacrificed performance. He is a player who works really hard and created a lot of movement. “I am happy the squad as a whole demonstrated why we won the league. We had no Aguero, no [Vincent] Kompany, no Jovetic, and others showed what they can do.’ It was Silva, though, who made the difference and justified Neil Warnock’s assertion that he was “head and shoulders” above any other player on the pitch.

Despite territorial domination, City did not register a shot on target in the first half, with Pablo Zabaleta clipping the best chance wide after 43 minutes. But just as City feared they would not achieve a breakthrough, they were given some help early in the second half. Fernandinho started the move with a clever pass to overlapping Zabaleta. The Argentine cut the ball back instead of shooting and although Silva did not make great contact, his shot went between Scott Dann’s legs, deflected off the inside of his thigh and past Julian Speroni. ‘I can’t blame the wingers for not tracking back, a defender let us down,’ said Palace boss Warnock. The relief was evident and it was no surprise that after 61 minutes Pellegrini and his assistant, Brian Kidd, were punching the air with joy once again. It was another good build-up. Samir Nasri and Toure were involved, and this time the overlapping full-back was on the left — Aleksandar Kolarov. He swept in a cross and this time Silva connected first-time with his left foot to beat Speroni from eight yards. It was a classy finish from a classy player and showed how much City missed him when he was sidelined with a knee injury. Palace had a fleeting chance at 2-0 down when James McArthur headed in Yannick Bolasie’s cross and was wrongly flagged offside because Fernandinho was playing him on.

But given that McArthur was lucky to escape unpunished for a dive in the first half, you could perhaps call it ‘karma’. Silva was substituted soon afterwards to a standing ovation, replaced by Frank Lampard. Palace sent on Wilfried Zaha, on loan from Manchester United, and therefore the recipient of some pantomime boos from City fans. The third goal came in the 81st minute. Jesus Navas used his pace to break from midfield, his pass to Milner was then shifted on to Toure, and he powered through to blast a left-footed finish past Speroni. Milner departed soon afterwards leaving Toure to assume the role of centre-forward and there was even a late rare cameo for forgotten man Scott Sinclair — just in time for other clubs to have a peek ahead of the January transfer window. At the back, injured skipper Kompany was hardly missed and keeper Joe Hart was rarely troubled 24 hours after signing a new four-and-a-half year contract.

Lampard runs to congratulate Toure as Manchester City draw level with Chelsea after closing what was an eight-point gap . Chelsea realise they have a huge job on their hands if they are to take the Premier League trophy from City who have settled after an autumn wobble. ‘You don’t win the title in December but you play so many games, you must be as close as you can if you want to be involved at the end,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe nobody believed one or two months ago that we’d still be in the Champions League or fighting for the title, but we always trust in what we can do.’ Pellegrini does not expect to have any of his ‘real’ forwards to be fit for the Boxing Day trip to West Brom but Jovetic, nursing a hamstring strain, has the best chance of facing Burnley on December 28.

"Gary Lineker has launched a scathing attack on Fifa following the governing body's decision to publish a report into claims of corruption during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. 'The way everything's run at Fifa, it's hugely depressing for those of us who love the game,"" Lineker told the BBC. 'I don't think there is any question that Fifa is at an all-time low.' VIDEO Scroll down to see Sepp Blatter's report publication announcement . Gary Lineker has launched a scathing attack on Fifa following the World Cup bidding controversy . American lawyer Michael Garcia conducted an investigation into the allegations of corruption for both tournaments which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively. Garcia resigned as Fifa's independent ethics investigator after his findings were released as a 42-page summary of the 430-page report. Garcia labelled the the summary as 'erroneous' but Fifa have since backtracked and agreed to publish his original report in full but only after being assured there is no explosive detail within the 430 pages that would require another World Cup election. The report into corruption by Michael Garcia will be published, the FIFA ExCo have decided . Lineker, however, insisted that the governing body was still massively corrupt despite their recent concession. 'The whole thing is a farce,' Lineker added. 'It's said football is the beautiful game, but it's hugely tarnished by what's going on.' 'It's come to the stage really where something needs to be done. Sepp Blatter, the FIFA chairman, saw the day as a personal triumph that there will be no forced re-vote . 'The only way something will really change is if the major federations around the world come together and say 'we have had enough of this'. But don't hold your breath.' Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been a central figure during the recent controversies, but Lineker is adamant the head of football will successfully gain re-election for a fifth term in 2015. 'He's the man right at the top and in any other business or any other political form of life, that person would go and not be voted for. 'But you'll see, he will be voted in again as sure as Christmas is around the corner.'","Fifa have agreed to publish a report into World Cup corruption .

"John O'Shea has said there will be no love lost when he comes face to face with former Sunderland team-mate Jack Colback. The Black Cats skipper revealed he will be avoiding any pleasantries with Colback as the 25-year-old prepares to make his first appearance for Newcastle against his old club. It is just 10 months since Sunderland academy product Colback scored for the Wearside club in the same fixture last season, a fact O'Shea remembers well. Jack Colback  prepares to face his former club Sunderland following his summer move to rivals Newcastle . Sunderland skipper John O'Shea says he will not be shaking Colback's hand before the game . Sunderland currently have the upper hand in Tyne-Wear derbiesat St James' Park having won the last two . 'Whatever happens afterwards – shaking hands – there'll be none of that beforehand. '(Colback)'s been one of their best performers this season and we know what he's capable of. 'He did it to Newcastle last season.' Colback refused to extend his contract at the Stadium of Light last summer, choosing to move over to Tyneside to play with arch rivals Newcastle. He has been in great form for the Magpies this season and O'Shea is aware of the danger he poses. 'I'm sure whoever is playing in midfield, Jack will be looking to get right into them and likewise for us as well.' Having featured in various hich-octane Manchester derbies during his spell at former club Manchester United, Republic of Ireland international O'Shea will not be letting the occasion get the best of him. Sunderland academy product Colback joined Newcastle on a free transfer this summer . Midfielder Colback (centre) has been in impressive form during his budding Newcastle career . The Tyne-Wear derby will be particularly intense as Colback looks to win three points against his former club . 'When you've been successful in these games, that's an important psychological thing,' said the centre-half. 'But you can talk about these things, you have to go out and do them on Sunday afternoon when there's going to be lots of people in the stadium willing you to have a bad game. 'I'm sure the Newcastle lads will be reminded of the recent games, so there's motivation on both sides.' Sunderland boast 3-0 victories in their last two visits to Newcastle, as the Black Cats look to extend their five-game unbeaten run against Alan Pardew's men following their Capital One Cup defeat to Tottenham on Wednesday. 'Newcastle won't have been too happy with the result in midweek. But they've been on a fantastic run of form so we're under no illusions that it's going to be tough. 'We've been very solid though and close to winning lots of matches. 'We just need a bit of a killer instinct all round the pitch to make sure we come away with three points instead of a draw.' Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009 . Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season . 'It's just a fantastic game to be involved in,' he added. 'I used to watch the games on the telly, but then you don't realise until you come and play in them that they're up there with some of the biggest in world football because of the intensity and atmosphere. 'It's why you're a footballer to play in games like this. 'I've had some fantastic moments in derbies and some not so nice ones, particularly so in Manchester. 'But up here, they've gone quite well so far and hopefully that continues.'","Colback moved from Sunderland to local rivals Newcastle in the summer .

"Lewis MacLeod knew something definitely wasn’t right when a lingering sense of fatigue saw him trudge off the Ibrox turf last January and make his way down the tunnel in a daze. Despite his tender years, he had been feeling the pace in recent games for Ally McCoist’s side - but had never felt as shattered as this. Llittle did the talented teenager realise that he was experiencing something far more serious than mere exhaustion following his exertions on the park. Recovery: Rangers midfielder Lewis MacLeod is continuing to make his comeback from a viral infection . Not even in his worst nightmares could MacLeod have anticipated that he would miss the rest of the season or - more frighteningly - be told that his substitution just before the hour mark during that 3-2 league win over Arbroath might be his last-ever appearance on a football field. Yet that was the frightening reality facing the young Rangers midfielder when tests revealed that his excessive tiredness had been caused by a viral infection attacking the muscles around his heart. An awful six-month spell in limbo ensued during which time MacLeod feared that his career in the game might be over. That he has now come through his health scare - and has finally been given the all-clear from the virus by medics after a period of rest and recuperation - has given the youngster what feels like a second lease of life. He duly marked his comeback earlier this month with a spectacular goal in a 4-2 victory over Fulham behind closed doors at Murray Park. Since then he has put in impressive performances on Rangers’ tour of California against Ventura County Fusion and, in particular, during Saturday night’s 2-1 win over Sacramento Republic. Speaking for the first time about his ordeal on Monday, MacLeod, now 20, revealed how the potential enormity of his situation only really hit home when a cousin asked him if he had made alternative career plans. Career-threatening: MacLeod was worried that he may never be able to kick a football again . However, now that he is back in McCoist’s first-team plans, he has declared himself fit and ready to help the Ibrox club return to the Scottish top flight. ‘A couple of months into last season I remember feeling tired, but I just put that down to the fact that I was playing regularly for the first team,’ recalled Macleod. ‘I didn’t think too much about it but then I started getting more and more tired. ‘In the couple of weeks before I finally stopped playing, I was getting so knackered in matches that I sat back and knew that something might be wrong. ‘It was frustrating for me because I wasn’t playing as well as I could and I was wondering what was wrong. ‘In that game when I came off (the League One match against Arbroath) I felt faint and dizzy. ‘I had tests done afterwards and the results were low. Then a second test showed that I wasn’t getting any better – and that underlined it for me. ‘It was kind of a frightening time for me but I did well to try and put it to the back of my mind,’ added Macleod. ‘The doctors couldn’t tell me what was happening, they couldn’t assure me that I would be back in six months or whatever. ‘So it was really just a waiting game to see how the results came back. ‘But a lot of people, even the doctor himself, admitted to me that it could have been the end (of my career). Back in the action: MacLeod is now fully recovered after a period of rest and recuperation . ‘I didn’t really think about it. But then my cousin asked me how I would feel if the results didn’t go according to plan and what I would do. I kind of thought about it then and it was quite scary. ‘But then the results came back after that and they were good and I couldn’t have felt any happier. ‘It was a viral infection that had affected my organs and it was scary – but I’ m back to normal now and hopefully it’s all behind me.’ Even in his darkest days, MacLeod never allowed himself to think about a career without football. But he admits that his recovery and return to the first team feels as if he has been given a second chance in the game. ‘In a way, it makes me appreciate things more, thinking that I might not have been able to play any more,’ said the youngster, who has made 39 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals in the process. ‘That makes you think about it and makes you realise what you have here. ‘And that you have to grab it with both hands. In a way that’s been good for me, because it has made me push on. ‘But I never really allowed myself to wonder what I would do if I wasn’t able to play football. ‘I didn’t want to think about that. I didn’t want to put in my head what I would do if I couldn’t play again. Far flung: Rangers are currently on a pre-season tour of North America and are in Canada right now . ‘But luckily enough that’s not an issue now. ‘It’s so good to be back playing again. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that I am back and kicking a ball around again. ‘So far everything is looking good for me after six months out. ‘I owe a lot to my pals, my family, the manager, coaches and team-mates for their support. And I especially owe the doc and physio because they took a lot of time – their own time as well – keeping me sane and keeping me going.’ For Macleod, the aim is now to help Rangers complete their journey back to the top of Scottish football after the club’s descent to the bottom tier. But the Scotland under-21 international knows they will have to be at their best to pip Hibs and Hearts to the Championship crown ths coming season. ‘I’ve always said I wanted to play for Rangers at the top level. And, hopefully, all going well I can get through this season with no injuries or silly things and then I can look forward to playing in the Premiership. ‘I am feeling good and I am now back to full pelt. ‘Of course, I’ve been out for six months so I’m going to be tired but it’s not like how I felt back then when the problem first arose. ‘I feel good and I just want to work on my fitness and get more games in,’ he said. ‘There’s going to be a lot of interest in the Championship this season because there are a few good teams in that league. ‘It’s probably more difficult and competitive than the Premiership. But we’re all looking forward to the challenge at Rangers and hopefully we can finish top.’","MacLeod suffered from fatigue during matches for Rangers in January .

"Talk about your peaking too early. Normally fans know that these major events are a marathon, not a sprint. And if we did ever forget, then the Olympics comes along every four years to remind us. With a major football tournament, there is often the sense you can still squeeze in a bit of real life early on, before you formally retire to the settee for the foreseeable future. Then Fred goes and flops to the floor for a crucial penalty in super slowmo. And Robin van Persie is neither a bird, nor a plane as he is captured by multi cameras gliding through the air for his headed version of the Marco van Basten volley. VIDEO Scroll down for Thierry Henry on what it means to play for your country . Down he goes: Fred goes down to win Brazil a penalty . In other words, do you remember not many weeks ago when some people were saying ‘England against Italy, 11 o’clock at night? That’s a bit late, isn’t it?’. Cut to Saturday night, and in the words of  a Stevie Wonder classic other than the BBC’s theme tune ‘Another Star’, our nation had caught ‘jungle fever’. Even before we went across to Gary Lineker and the boys in Rio, other BBC folk were already at it. ‘High pressure will dominate’ weatherman Matt Taylor told us prophetically on the forecast. Flying through the air: Robin van Persie scored one of the best goals of the tournament . While the lady on continuity duties - presumably wrapped in the flag of St George in her voice over booth - exclaimed ‘let’s do this’. And - because I’m guessing he missed the old ‘barber window’ before he left - even Gary Lineker’s hair looked excited! When we joined him in the BBC studio, he was doing a reasonable impression of a Harry Enfield Double Take Brother. So much so in fact, that when he told us there was ‘a late injury to Buffon’, you couldn’t help thinking, do you mean your one, Gary? Perhaps not surprisingly, the only person who appeared to be remaining super cool under pressure was, mais oui, Thierry Henry. In the hotset: Gary Lineker anchors the BBC's coverage from Rio . The experts: The BBC had Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand in the studio . While all around him were in shirtsleeves and starting to glow somewhat with expectation, Monsieur Va Va Voom was suaveness itself. And as if to emphasize the point, he was also sporting what might possibly be the only cardigan in the whole of South America. The laconic Frenchman is already proving the perfect foil in a finely balanced pundit line up. Alan Shearer is looking very much at home, to me. He seems to really be relishing the rapport that he and Lineker have been building on Match of the Day. And already in Rio, we’re beginning to feel the benefit. ‘This is Rooney’s biggest game for England. He has to perform’ he insisted. It was a decisive, bold point, and deliberately made. Missed opportunity: Wayne Rooney did not have his best night in an England shirt . Then there’s Rio Ferdinand; in Brazil to continue his burgeoning TV apprenticeship. And as the current Premier League pro in the line-up, he played his role with style. ‘You’ve got to kick him’ was his verdict for handling Mario Balotelli. Which may have sounded rather agricultural, but was part of an astute answer that gave us first hand insight into a man we were about to see in the middle of the action. Not quite with his finger on the pulse was a man who, at times, sounded like someone perhaps ought to check his? Whereas commentator Guy Mowbray sounded like he was in the heart of the action, his co-commentator Phil Neville felt as if he was phoning his work in from his front room. While the missus was upstairs trying to get some sleep! Watching on: Roy Hodgson and Ray Lewington look on as England go behind . And it wasn’t so much what he said, it was just the thoroughly flat lined manner in which he said it. Brother Gary has hit the ground running as a TV pundit. But Phil is going to need some serious producing between now and his next game if he is going to even begin to match his sibling at this tournament. Of course at times, only downbeat will do. And this was the case when Mowbray sighed ‘the anguish of Roy and Ray’ over what could well end up being the enduring TV image of this game. That of Messrs Hodgson and Lewington simultaneously placing their heads in their hands. It was a moment of despair that was reflected on the return to the studio. Shearer in particular was ticking there, having earlier called on Rooney to bring his A game. Backlash: Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter . He made it clear he didn’t think he had delivered. To which Rio put up a boisterous defence of his former team mate. But Al bit. ‘He’s got to score there, Rio’ he said rather tersely. Causing Ferdinand to further defend his old pal. Even Henry got involved by pointing out that Rooney had ‘done everything but score’. But Shearer was not letting it go. ‘The most important thing’, he responded unequivocally. Well, it was hot, and we had lost. But at least it was honest and passionate. And our French friend did manage to lighten the mood a little towards the end when he said of Pirlo’s late free kick, ‘he’s that good he meant to hit the crossbar’. That got a chuckle from a studio that already feels like you can’t wait to get back to it.But let’s just hope that Phil Neville has also embraced some of that spirit the next time we hear from him.","World Cup gets off to a fast start with exciting games and great goals .

"Two centuries after his death, the descendants of the notorious Marquis de Sade have finally embraced their once-reviled relative. The French aristocrat scandalised his contemporaries with his erotic works which saw him locked in prisons and an insane asylum for 32 years. Now, the eldest member of the dynasty, Elzear de Sade, has said the family are no longer ashamed of their controversial ancestor and has reclaimed the title of marquis which has not been used since his  1814. The Marquis de Sade (left) has now been acknowledged by his descendants, including the eldest member of the dynasty, Elzear de Sade (right) who has reclaimed the title . He told The Times: 'The family cut all ties with him after his death and when anyone asked, they would say they had nothing to do with him, pretending they were form another branch. 'Today we are united and proud of our name. It is not at all difficult for us to carry.' Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, written while Bastille, remains one of the most shocking tales of sexual extremism ever published – and often banned for its graphic depiction of the rape and torture of young victims. He went onto write Justine, or The Misfortunes of Justice, which was described by Napoleon Bonaparte as the 'most abominable book ever engendered'. The libertine's controversial work saw him locked up for 32 years of his life in prisons and an insane asylum. De Sade's name even gave rise to the words sadism and sadomasochism. The original scroll on which the Marquis de Sade wrote the draft of his novel 'The 120 Days of Sodom' It is now on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the writer's death at the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris . For  200 years, his family hid all links with the revolutionary philosopher and writer. But on the bicentenary of his death, de Sade's controversial work, much of which has been translated into many languages and even studied in some French literature degrees, has been celebrated. His original 39-ft scroll of The 120 Days of Sodom has also gone on display at the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris. He wrote the masterpiece, about the depraved behaviour of four wealthy French libertines who rape, torture and finally murder their victims in a remote mediaeval castle, in just 37 days during his imprisonment for sexual deviancy and blasphemy in 1785. It was found when the Bastille prison was stormed during the French Revolution. Paris' Orsay museum has devoted an exhibition to de Sade to show his influence on great artists throughout history, including Pablo Picasso and Francisco de Goya. Curator Annie le Brun said she had been 'amazed' by de Sade's intelligence and called his exploration of 'desire and the violence of desire'  a landmark in European literature. The current Marquis' parents, Xavier and Rose de Sade, had been the first to allow researchers into the family library after the Second World War to try and break the taboo around the notorious writer. Elzear de Sade said he found the exhibitions of the Marquis de Sade's life and work 'totally agreeable.' 'A lot of people, writers and philosophers are very happy to show who Sade really was,'  added Elzear who claims his ancestor had never actually taken part in debauchery he wrote about. 'He was a writer and a thinker, not a sinner,' he said. De Sade, was reviled by contemporaries, is portrayed in 'Correspondence de Madame Gourdan' by Marquis de Sade . Marquis de Sade (Donatien de Sade) was born into an aristocratic Provençal family in 1740. A sexual libertine, revolutionary politician and writer, he is best known for his scandalous works, which featured rape, paedophilia, bestiality, torture and necrophilia. The Marquis'  name even forms the root of the word 'sadism' and sadomasochism. He managed to keep his head through the French Revolution and died, aged 74, in a lunatic asylum. His works meant he had also spent much of his life incarcerated. He acquired his notoriety through Justine, or The Misfortunes of Justice. Published in 1791, it was described by Napoleon Bonaparte as the 'most abominable book ever engendered'. He had written The 120 Days of Sodom six years before, penned in just 37 days in Bastille in 1785. After his death, he began to become a hero to writers and artists who celebrated him as a philosopher worthy of debate.","The French aristocrat scandalised contemporaries with his erotic works .

"Accused: San Francisco sheriff's deputy Michael Lewlling was charged with beating a hospital patient in an emergency room . A San Francisco sheriff's deputy allegedly choked and beat a hospital patient who walked with a cane - then lied on the police report to cover his tracks. Michael Lewelling, 33, was accused of approaching a sleeping man as he started to wake up, knocking away his walking cane, grabbing his neck, then arresting him. He then filed a police report claiming that the man started the fight by attacking him with the cane, according to authorities, who say surveillance video proves he was lying. Lewelling, who has reportedly been with the San Francisco Sheriff's Department for five years, was arrested Friday and charged with perjury, filing a false police report and battery. Prosecutors said footage from the November 3 attack shows the victim can be seen hunched over in a chair sleeping in the Emergency Room's waiting area, where he was scheduled to see a doctor later that day. The video shows Lewelling approaching the victim as he is starting to wake up.  When the man attempts to walk away, the deputy grabs the back of his collar, pulls him back into the seat and knocks his cane away. 'A few seconds later, he appears to grab the victim's throat and begins to choke him.  The battery continued, and the victim was then placed under arrest,' prosecutors said. 'The victim never raised his cane in a threatening manner,' they added. The case against the victim was presented by the Sheriff's Department to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office on November 4. Victim: Lewelling was filmed by surveillance cameras attacking the patient at San Francisco General Hospital, according to authorities . That same day the San Francisco District Attorney's Office declined to charge the case and submitted a request for video evidence of the incident, prosecutors said. After the charges were filed, Lewelling turned himself in and was given a bail of $138,000, according to ABC7 News. 'The fact that a Sheriff's Deputy allegedly battered a patient at San Francisco General Hospital is unnerving,' said District Attorney George Gascón. 'What's worse is that he's also alleged to have perjured himself on a police report, unforgivable conduct that led to the arrest of the innocent victim.'

"Former Obama administration Pentagon chief Leon Panetta said Sunday that the president overruled nearly his entire national security team and decided not to arm moderate Syrian rebel groups early on, a decision that helped the ISIS terror army gain power. Panetta also said he favored leaving a residual force of U.S. troops behind in Iraq instead of withdrawing them, another opinion Obama ignored. Panetta, who was Obama's CIA director for two years before leading the Pentagon for two more, told CBS News that entering the Syria conflict earlier, and ensuring that moderate groups gained power instead of the most extreme jihadi elements, could have prevented ISIS from growing and prospering. 'I think that would've helped,' Panetta said. 'And I think, in part, we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS.' And a less complete troop pullout in Iraq 'would've given us greater leverage over Iraq's government,' he emphasized. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was also previously the CIA director under Obama, and served as Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff . Nearly Obama's entire national security team recommended arming moderate Syrian rebel groups who opposed dictator Bashar al-Assad . Obama now stands widely accused of standing by while ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, established a base of operations in eastern Syria and threatened to overthrow Assad, while simultaneously marching across more than half of Iraq. His $500 million 'train and equip' mission there, critics say, is too late to do more than temporarily contain the group. Panetta writes in his forthcoming memoir 'Worthy Fights' that he urged Obama in a 2012 meeting to arm Assad's less-rabid foes – and that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-CIA director David Petraeus and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey all agreed. Clinton, now a presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner, said in an August interview that it was an Obama 'failure' to leave Syria's rebels to fend for themselves, a decision that 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.' Speaking to CNN, former President Bill Clinton said Sunday that he also agreed with his wife at the time. Obama Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in a statement last month that in 2012 the president 'wanted to make sure that we were providing assistance to people who we knew, so that it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands given how many extremists were operating in that area,' Bill Clinton disagreed. The revelations come from Panetta's memoir which is due out on October 7 . Discord: Panetta (left) and Gen. Dempsey (right) both counseled Obama to strengthen Syria's rebels two years ago but he refused . 'Since ISIS has plenty of money – it's one of the great bank robbers in human history, among other things – they were going to get their weapons one way or the other,' he said, 'so I would have risked it.' 'And besides, when we were talking about doing it, there was no ISIS. However, it was an argument she lost within the administration.' Panetta said Sunday that 'it's going to take a long time' to defeat a defiant and strengthened ISIS, 'and I think the American people need to know it's going to take a long time.' The group is 'as dangerous, as fanatical as terrorists as al-Qaeda was,' he said. 'And they have a large number of foreign fighters with foreign passports that make them particularly dangerous to the safety of this country.'","Panetta said 'we pay the price' because Obama decided to overrule his secretary of state, CIA director and chairman of the Joint Chiefs .
Asked if Obama made a mistake by refusing to arm moderate Syrian rebels early on, Panetta said 'that would've helped'
He also clashed with Obama's Iraq policy, saying that leaving some troops behind 'would've given us greater leverage over Iraq's government .

"Click here to view all the stats and graphics from the match at Loftus Road . If Queens Park Rangers do defy all odds and expectations and stay in the Premier League for another season, what price can be placed on the contribution of Charlie Austin? After 17 goals to return them to the promised land last term, Austin took this season’s tally to seven as they recorded an immensely valuable win over fellow strugglers Leicester City. His 74th-minute header settled a thrill-a-minute contest at Loftus Road and lifted Rangers off the bottom of the table. Their place was taken by Leicester, who simply failed to take their chances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: QPR 3-2 Leicester . Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin scored his side's winning goal in the 73rd minute to hand his side all three points . Austin wheels away in celebration after scoring his side's seventh Premier League goal of the season . The QPR striker acknowledges the Loftus Road crowd after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal for the west London outfit . Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring after just four minutes of the match between the two Premier League strugglers . QPR: Green 7.5; Isla 6, Onuoha 7, Caulker 7.5, Suk-Young 7 (Traore 50, 6.5); Vargas 7 (Mutch 76), Barton 7, Henry 6, Fer 7; Austin 7.5, Kranjcar 6.5 (Hoilett 89) Substitutes not used: McCarthy; Ferdinand, Phillips, Wright-Phillips .

Attendance: 18,054 (1,841 away) Star man: Charlie Austin . ‘It was an open, attacking game — an excellent game with both teams going for it,’ said Harry Redknapp. ‘We went one down in the first five minutes and it was their first goal for a while; they’re a dangerous team on the counter. ‘We could have felt sorry for ourselves but we didn’t. We came back and made lots of chances. It was an excellent performance with a lot of pressure on the game today.’ The visitors led after only four minutes, through a classy finish from Esteban Cambiasso, but succumbed to pressure and trailed at half-time thanks to Wes Morgan’s calamitous own goal and Leroy Fer’s opportunism. The Foxes, whose winless streak in London now stands at 17 Premier League matches, levelled in the second half through Jeffrey Schlupp but failed to hang on as Austin scored once again at home. It was his fifth in six appearances here this season, all of great value. It may only be late November, but with Leicester 18th and QPR 20th at the start of play, the term ‘six-pointer’ could just about be justified. QPR will be feeling much more optimistic about their situation. A burst water main at nearby Wood Lane had caused problems earlier in the day, but all Leicester were interested in was ending a drought. It was 500 minutes or five matches since their fans had last been able to celebrate a goal. But that agonising wait ended at 504. On their first assault, Schlupp fed the ball in from the left and Leonardo Ulloa nudged it right to the incoming Cambiasso. With the understated class that has seen him win championships in three countries and the Champions League, the veteran Argentine rolled the ball in off the post. The last time Cambiasso scored, Leicester beat Manchester United 5-3. Was it an omen? A second goal would have helped and Jamie Vardy surged through a few minutes later but a careless first touch let him down and Rob Green pounced to swipe the ball from his feet.

Vardy then left Onuoha for dead on the right and crossed for Riyad Mahrez who fluffed his lines badly when confronted with Green’s gigantic frame and sent the ball wide of the far post. Rangers had enjoyed most of the ball but it took them an age to start creating meaningful chances. Karl Henry waltzed his way into a shooting position but failed to release the ball, much to the crowd’s consternation. He tried to find the bottom corner on 27 minutes from outside the box but it just looked pathetic when the lurking Vargas didn’t bother to stick out a boot. The pressure mounted, with Barton industrious and Suk-Young Yun marauding down the left, and it finally told on 37 minutes. Christmas may yet be a month away, but this equaliser was gift-wrapped. Steven Caulker, somehow, was in Leicester’s penalty box and his poked cross was bundled into his own net by Morgan, who didn’t adjust his feet to make the anticipated clearance. His team-mates looked on non-plussed. Straight from the re-start, Leicester caught their opponents napping and Vardy’s powerful strike hit Green on the chest. Then, on the stroke of half-time, the second goal QPR’s dominance of possession probably deserved. All their own work this time as Barton swung in an inviting cross from the right, Austin launched into a header that Schmeichel beat out. But there was Fer, following up, to smash home the rebound, his first goal since joining from Norwich. Green dives to his right to try to get a hand on Cambiasso's shot - but the Argentine's strike hit the back of the net . Leicester captain Wes Morgan levelled the scoring by scoring an own goal past team-mate Kasper Schmeichel . Leicester, determined not to become the victims of QPR’s third league win of the season, started the second half brightly. Mahrez forced Green into a block before his right-wing delivery was flicked onto the crossbar by Vardy. A third goal would have been handy for QPR and Austin looked the most likely to provide it. First, he saw a first-time shot deflected into the side-netting of Marcin Wasilewski and then, after a very neat exchange with Vargas, his volley was well saved by Schmeichel. The game swung in the balance and Cambiasso’s quick free-kick caught the QPR defence asleep. Vardy raced onto it but could only find the side-netting. It didn’t provide the wake-up call the hosts needs and, on 67 minutes, Leicester were level. Schlupp was fouled on the edge of the box but referee Roger East played an advantage. From a subsequent cross, Cambiasso headed down for Marc Albrighton to blast one. His effort was blocked but it fell invitingly for Schlupp, back on his feet, to find the net with a crisp left-footed finish. QPR responded superbly. Schmeichel saved brilliantly from Fer’s header but the resulting corner caused panic in the Leicester defence. Onuoha’s close-range effort after a mad scramble was blocked on the line by David Nugent but there was Austin with a stooping header to send Loftus Road into raptures. Austin whipped off his shirt in celebration. I suspect he won’t care about the booking. Pearson said: ‘I feel for the players today because in terms of an attacking unit, we were very good at times. Our goals were the two hardest chances. We were very positive, created chances but still couldn’t win the game.’ Morgan slumps to his knees after dispatching the ball past Schmeichel in the 37th minute .

"Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith left more than £1million in his will to his former Blue Peter presenter wife Sarah Greene (pictured together) Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Smith left more than £1million to his Blue Peter presenter wife when he died, it has emerged. Smith, who died aged 59 in August from complications arising from major heart surgery, was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1980s. Probate records revealed yesterday that he left his entire estate after funeral and legal bills to Sarah Greene - his wife of 25 years. The amount left in his will totalled £1,190,284. His estate would not have included any assets or property jointly owned with his wife. Smith presented Radio 1's flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988 and was described as Princess Diana's favourite DJ. Known for his boyish good looks and affectionately dubbed 'Smitty', he was a regular on Top of the Pops. He also made frequent appearances on the BBC's Breakfast Time programme and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, hosted by Noel Edmonds. Other programmes he presented included That's Showbusiness and Julian Clarey's Trick Or Treat. His experience as a live broadcaster and his knowledge of popular music led to him hosting the BBC's Live Aid broadcast in 1985. He managed to remain cool and calm even when an emotional Bob Geldof swore on air as he tried raise more money for African famine relief. Smith, of Chiswick, west London, was a keen motorsports fan who built his own cars and competed in motor racing from the age of just 14. He and Greene married in 1989, a year after they were both injured when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Gloucestershire. Greene broke both of her legs and an arm in the crash, while Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. He founded his company Flying TV in 2004 to provide aerial filming services to broadcasters, but continued to make occasional TV appearances. His death came as a shock to friends and former colleagues, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Edmonds and Mike Read, who he reportedly had not told he was unwell. Mr Read was among the first to pay tribute to the ‘affable, businesslike’ former DJ in the wake of his death. The DJ and television personality said: ‘The news is just devastating. Sarah and Mike were a wonderful couple – it is truly horrible to hear. ‘I knew Mike as there were only five of us to have presented the Breakfast Show at that time. Smith's death in August came as a shock to friends and former colleagues, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Noel Edmonds and Mike Read, who he reportedly had not told he was unwell. Pictured: Smith and Greene . The couple married in 1989, a year after they were injured when they were involved in a helicopter crash in Gloucestershire. Smith left his entire estate to his wife, which totalled more than £1million, after funeral costs . ‘He became a mainstay of Radio 1, was highly successful on television too, and started up his own business, which he was very good at. 'I worked with Sarah for a number of years, including around the time of the crash, so I was very fond of them both. The helicopter crash was really bad but they just got on with it and married. ‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’ Other friends and colleagues paid tribute on social networking sites such as Twitter. Keith Chegwin described him as ‘a nice man and a great broadcaster’ who died ‘far too young’. Phillip Schofield, who presented the flagship children’s television show Going Live with Greene, said: ‘There are no words. My wonderful, bright, funny, thoughtful friend Mike Smith has passed. I’m so sorry, my darling Sarah.’ And radio presenter Simon Mayo wrote: ‘Shocked to hear of Mike Smith’s death. Condolences to Sarah and all his family.’","Mike Smith died in August, aged 59, following heart surgery complications .

"Forty photographers joined forces in London to create the biggest ever crowd-sourced timelapse in just one day. The diversity, atmosphere, pace and buzz of the city make London the perfect canvas for any timelapse, and its unique flavour is captured over 80 clips in the official LapseLondon film produced by Triggertrap. Under the expert guidance of professional timelapse photographer Chad Gordon Higgins and award-winning urban photographer Nicholas Goodden, the gang of eager photographers set out across the city to capture London from their own perspective. Forty photographers joined forces in London to create the biggest ever crowd-sourced timelapse in just one day . The photographers were keen to shoot varying locations in London which helped produce the spectacular timelapse . The photographers were under the expert guidance of professional timelapse photographer Chad Gordon Higgins . Starting from Triggertrap's headquarters in King's Cross, the photographers found themselves in all four corners of the capital. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Triggertrap Head of Photography Thomas Langley said: 'It was a very tiring day, but at the same time such a good day, it was exceptional. 'We all met at the office, and then the photographers all went to their chosen locations; what was brilliant is that we had a group who wanted to spread far and wide throughout London. 'It wasn't a case of everyone all wanting to do the London Eye or the other more famous sites; in fact we had only two at the London Eye and the results from each were very different.' Starting from Triggertrap's headquarters in King's Cross, the photographers found themselves in all four corners of the capital . The diversity, atmosphere, pace and buzz of the city make London the perfect canvas for any timelapse, and this is shown clearly here . The 80 clips were assembled from well over 35,000 individual photographs, representing a total of over 40 hours spent timelapsing . On thoughts for the next project, Langley added: 'Now we are thinking how we can go bigger and how we can do better, maybe we can do a timelapse of the world!' By the end of the day the team of photographers had created clips shot from a whole range of London's landmarks, from Tower Bridge to Camden Market, Oxford Circus to the Thames Barrier, and even gained access to the BBC Newsroom in full swing. The LapseLondon photographers managed to cover a huge variety of London views and experiences, highlighting the amazing and diverse city it is. The 80 clips were assembled from well over 35,000 individual photographs, representing a total of over 40 hours spent timelapsing across the capital - all in a single day. The final video is an ode to London, showing the beauty of one random day in December in London through the eyes of 40 photographers. The assembled photographers had a huge range of experience - from professional timelapse creators to amateur photographers attempting their first ever timelapse. The final video is an ode to London, showing the beauty of one random day in December in London through the eyes of 40 photographers . Some of the stills from the biggest ever timelapse shows off the beauty of London at dusk at various locations in the capital . As people went about their everyday lives, a team of photographers were on hand to capture scenes around London . Triggertrap also produced a behind-the-scenes documentary about the event, interviewing a number of the photographers involved to find out what they love about London and how they're using timelapse photography to capture the pulse of the capital. 'The crazy thing about being a photographer is that your art has a huge audience, but when you are creating, you're on your own, operating in a vacuum. I think bringing together a load of people who shoot timelapse is up there with one of the most awesome things I've ever done.' said Haje Jan Kamps, CEO of Triggertrap . Triggertrap's Helena Viera added: 'Bringing together a whole bunch of photographers from different skill levels and seeing how everyone helped each other to create such awesome clips must be one of the most rewarding things I've done all year.' The finished timelapse and behind the scenes documentary are available on the Triggertrap website, http://tri.gg/lapselondon, and their Vimeo channel, vimeo.com/triggertrap.","Unique flavour is captured over 80 clips in the official LapseLondon film produced by Triggertrap .

"Five Taliban militants were killed in a US drone strike on a hideout in northwestern Pakistan today as the military response to this week's school massacre continues to intensify. In a separate operation, officials say Pakistani security forces also killed seven 'terrorists' on the outskirts of Peshawar - where the atrocity unfolded on Tuesday morning. Since the appalling attack - in which 148 people, mostly children, were murdered - Pakistani air strikes and ground operations have killed around 200 militants in the northwest tribal region near the Afghan border. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Retribution: Pakistani military forces have intensified their efforts against the Taliban following Tuesday's slaughter in which 148 people were murdered . The US drone strike took place in the town of Datta Khel in North Waziristan, where Pakistani troops have been carrying out a major operation against local and foreign militants since June. Security officials say the men killed in the drone strike fought under local Pakistani Taliban warlord Hafiz Gul Bahadur. It is unclear whether the drone strike hit militants directly involved in the slaughter at Peshawar as US officials rarely if ever comment on the covert drone program. The weapon has eliminated several top militants - but has also resulted in civilian casualties, making it extremely unpopular among Pakistanis. Military response:  A Pakistani police officer stands next to an ambulance carrying bodies of Taliban militants killed by security forces in an operation on the outskirts of Peshawar today . Fallen colleague: Pakistani police carry the casket of another officer killed a separate gunfight in Peshawar today in which two militants also died . Bloody battle: Since Tuesday's appalling attack Pakistani security forces have killed 200 Taliban militants . The bodies of five Taliban fighters killed in Peshawar today were pictured piled into the back of an ambulance van - their lifeless feet smeared with blood. In another incident in Peshawar two militants were killed in a gunfight with police - and a security official and a police officer were also died in the shootout. Police officers were seen carrying their fallen colleague in a casket above their heads before standing to attention to pay their respects. Retribution: The violence at a school (pictured) in Pakistan's northwest earlier this week stunned the country and brought cries for retribution . Yesterday morning, troops killed 18 more militants during a 'cordon and search operation' in Khyber, the military said . Pakistan has described the bloody rampage in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Tuesday as its own 'mini 9/11', saying it was a game changer in its fight against terror. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif relinquished the six-year ban on the death penalty in terror-related cases two days after the school attack - with two convicted terrorists the first to be hanged yesterday. Today Human Rights groups condemned the decision - labelling it as 'a craven politicized reaction to the Peshawar killings'. The Human Rights Watch added: 'Pakistan’s government has chosen to indulge in vengeful blood-lust instead of finding and prosecuting those responsible for the horrific Peshawar attack.' A Pakistani army soldier stands guard outside the Army Public School in Peshawar. Pakistani forces have intensified their offensive against Islamist militants . Demanding justice: Supporters of the Pakistan People's Party take to the streets in protest after the horrific Taliban attack earlier this week . Yesterday photos were released showing the bodied of 18 militants covered by sheets - killed by Pakistan's security forces in the country's northwest tribal region of Khyber. Khyber Agency is one of two main areas in the where the military has been trying to root out militants in recent months. It borders Peshawar, where the school massacre happened, and militants have traditionally attacked the city before fleeing into the tribal region where police can't chase them. The other area being targeted by anti-terror forces is North Waziristan - where today's US drone killed five militants. In a direct video message Khalifa Omar Mansoor said: 'If our women and children died as martyrs your children will not escape' In response to the Prime Minister's hardline approach Taliban commander Khalifa Omar Mansoor has warned the Army: 'If our women and children died as martyrs your children will not escape.' In a direct video message, the mass murderer nicknamed 'slim' and described as 'the most hated – and dangerous' man in Pakistan, said: 'I want to tell the Pakistan government, and the directors, teachers and students of the army's affiliated institutions, that you are the ones strengthening this un-Islamic democratic system. 'It is these institutions that graduate future generals, brigadiers and majors, who then kill Taliban and innocent tribal people.'

"Arrested: Margo Bronstein, 56, has been arrested on suspicion of killing three people and injuring nine others after ploughing into a crowd of churchgoers . The attorney for a 56-year-old woman accused in the deaths of four people, including a 6-year-old boy, said it was an accident when she ran her car into nearly a dozen pedestrians outside a California church. He also described her as someone who 'does not live her life recklessly.' 'Two days ago, three days ago, people that knew her couldn't believe that she'd be in this situation,' said Jeffrey Gray, attorney for Margo Bronstein. Gray pleaded not guilty on Bronstein's behalf Friday to four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter and one count of driving under the influence of a drug causing injury. Bronstein was wheeled into court on a gurney. She was propped up with pillows and spoke only to her lawyer. A judge ordered her held on $500,000 bail, the amount requested by prosecutors. Gray told the judge the collision was an accident, and not intentional. Outside court, Gray urged people not to jump to conclusions, noting the result of toxicology tests were not yet available and the cause of the incident was still unclear. He said possibilities such as a malfunction of her specially equipped car, which has hand-controlled brakes, or an adverse reaction to her prescribed medication had not been ruled out. 'My concern is there tends to be a lot of, almost a mob mentality about this case,' Gray said. 'It's a tragedy. It's not fair to Miss Bronstein, it's not fair to the decedents' families to speculate.' He said she was brought to court on the gurney because she had been injured in the accident and because of disabilities she has had since birth. Scroll down for video .

"A huge graffiti mural saying 'NYPD KILLS' was daubed on the Manhattan Bridge in the wake of protests over the death of Eric Garner. The stark message, daubed on the New York City landmark, took up the cry of anti-police protesters, who routinely accuse officers of murder on their marches. Police are investigating the graffiti, which insiders at the embattled force have described as 'a slap in the face'. Strong: The message appeared on the lower south side of the Manhattan Bridge on Friday, but was removed . The message, which was on the south side of the bridge, has since been removed by government officials, according to the New York Post. Investigators reportedly found fingerprints at the scene and are investigating the identities of potential culprits. It coincided with a clash of pro- and anti-police demonstrators in who took to the city last night. Supporters of the NYPD appeared to mock Eric Garner by wearing t-shirts reading 'I CAN breathe' - an inversion of his dying words. Anti-police protesters adopted the phrase 'I can't breathe' as a rallying call in reference to the moment officer Daniel Pantaleo killed father-of-six Garner in a chokehold. But on Friday night, 100 people hit back at the demonstrations outside City Hall in the controversial customized clothing and confronted anti-cop protesters. Tagged: The graffiti was painted onto the Manhattan Bridge, pictured above - but did not last long . Controversial: More than 100 people sported these t-shirts to confront demonstrators on Friday night . Twist: The customized shirts twisted Eric Garner's last words, 'I can't breathe', to read 'I can breathe' Facing off against the 200 people crying for justice for Eric Garner, they shouted: 'don't resist arrest'. It comes after an Indiana police officer caused outraged offering t-shirts for sale with the legend 'Breathe Easy: Don't break the law' on the front. The t-shirts were produced by Corporal Jason Barthel of the City of Mishawaka Police in Indiana who owns and operates the South Bend Uniform Company. The t-shirts, which cost from $7.95 are seen as a play on the final words of Eric Garner who died after being restrained by the New York Police Department. Faced off: The police supporters shouted 'don't resist arrest' every time the others shouted their slogans . Anger: The anti-Eric Garner protests claimed they were promoting lawful behavior . Deep-rooted issues: The failure to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo revealed severe racial divisions in New York . 'Above the law': The crowds slammed police officers for exploiting their role . Garner, who was restrained in a choke-hold after he was spotted selling individual cigarettes in Staten Island told officers 'I can't breathe', before slipping into unconsciousness. Corporal Barthel said criticism of his t-shirts is misunderstood. He said on his company's Facebook page: 'For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan ""Breathe Easy"" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you! 'We are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender. We are all in this together. The police are here to protect and serve. 99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts. 'We are all one people and this is by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family, God rest his soul. Lets all band together as AMERICANS regardless of our feelings and know we can and will be better! Thank you for your support.' Police officer Jason Barthel from Indiana  caused controversy when he released his new t-shirts, pictured . Corporal Bartel used his Facebook page in a bid to explain that he did not mean any offence with his t-shirt . Eric Garner, pictured, died after he was placed in a choke-hold last month by a police officer in New York . Basketball star LeBron James, pictured, is one of the high-profile supporters of the I Can't Breathe campaign . Other basketball stars such as Kobe Bryant, centre, have also donned the t-shirt supporting civil rights . It is understood that more than 100 of the t-shirts have so far been sold online. The 'I can't breathe' slogan has been used widely across America since Mr Garner's death last month. A number of celebrities, including basketball star LeBron James have worn t-shirt with the slogan. South Bend District Council President Oliver Davis told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that people should be able to breathe easy no matter what they're doing. Police should not take the right to breathe into their own hands.' Commenting on the controversial t-shirt, Mr Davis said: 'It has a strong message to people to let them know that justice is not fair. People need the right to be able to breathe easy no matter where we are in life and the justice system should be the ones to deal with that, not just the police officers.' Adam Duckworth posted on the company's Facebook page criticising the t-shirt. He said: 'This company exploits death, tragedy and ignorance for profit and publicity under the guise of supporting local law enforcers. 'Contrary to the implications of their merchandise, DEATH DOES NOT = JUSTICE. If you bought the ""breathe easy"" shirt, you are basically agreeing that appropriate use of force when dealing with any and all petty criminals and even remotely ""suspicious"" people is to skirt the justice system entirely via immediate deployment of the death penalty.'","Message was painted on south side of bridge, outraging police officers .

"Never-before seen pictures of Fidel Castro have emerged showing a softer side to the 'People's Revolutionary' as he relaxes on fishing trips and embraces women wearing flower garlands. The Cuban leader is also seen standing alongside Marxist icon Che Guevara as they welcomed Indonesian dictator Suharto off a plane in the late 1950s in the rare photographs. They were bought for just $20 (£12) at a flea market in Havana more than 20 years ago from Castro's personal photographer, Alberto Korda, who is remembered for his iconic  image of 'Che'. Scroll down for video . Never-before seen pictures of Fidel Castro have emerged showing a softer side to the 'People's Revolutionary' as embraces beautiful women while wearing flower garlands . Castro is seen lying on the floor wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar during a fishing trip with Guevara shortly after his communist regime came to power . Advertising veteran Ron Telpner, 64, from Toronto kept the rare collection of negatives in his desk drawer until realising the pictures would be worth at least £30,000. 'I bought the negatives from a grey-haired man in flea market on my first trip to Cuba in 1993, but I had no idea what I was buying because the images were so small. 'He told me he used to be Castro's personal photographer, but I didn't believe him at first,' said Mr Telpner. 'He had a wonderful spirit and I think he was just trying to make some US dollars. They sat in my desk drawer for more than 20 years until one day I was reading the Mail and I saw that other very similar pictures from the same photographer were being sold for $50,000. 'I couldn't believe it, so I had the pictures put on a disc and I went to Sotheby's and a few other auction houses, one of whom said they would sell for $50,000 as well.' Castro (tallest man, centre) and Che Guevara (right, wearing beret) is seen welcoming Indonesian dictator Suharto (two left of Castro) after he landed in Cuba in the late 1950 . The Marxist-Socialist leading is seen here planning the last stages of the revolution in 1958 . The 30 black and white pictures were mostly taken of the Marxist-Socialist leader between 1957 and 1959 at the height of the Cuban revolution. He led Cuba for 48 years before falling gravely ill in July 2006 and handing over power to his brother Raúl, who formally became president in January 2008. Castro is seen on a fishing trip with Guevara shortly after his communist regime overthrew the military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and came to power. He is seen lying on the floor wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar as he fixes a fishing rod. The Cuban leader is also seen drinking a glass of coca cola at the opening of the Havana bottling factory in the late 1950s in one of the images.

He is seen standing next to Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, a politician who served as the President of Cuba from 1959 until 1976. A couple of places away, Guevara can also be seen wearing a beret as he welcomes the group from Indonesia off the plane. Mr Telpner, who runs advertising agency The Brainstorm Group, made a series of trips to Cuba between 1993 and 1998. He said the pictures showing how Castro was a 'romantic hero' and a real raconteur when he first came to power. Castro currently lives in a quiet suburb of western Havana called Jaimanitas, with police permanently blocking the street to his house, which is codenamed Punto Cero (or 'Point Zero') by Cuban intelligence. His private life is officially a state secret in Cuba and most ordinary Cubans wouldn't even know he has a second wife and five grown-up children. Despite claims by former staff that he once lived a flashy life of multiple mansions and yachts, his home now is a modest affair - a modern 1950s two-storey, four-bedroom house which he shares with his second wife, Dalia Soto del Valle and their five children. There has been a deafening silence from Castro since Barack Obama momentously announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this week. Wearing flower garlands around his neck, the leader met with several women at a party in the late 1950s .

"German and English graffiti artists have come together to create street art murals commemorating the 1914 Christmas Truce during the First World War. The three artists took inspiration from the famous event that took place 100 years ago – when troops from both sides emerged from the trenches and met in ‘no man’s land’ in Flanders Fields to exchange gifts and play football. The UK Christmas Truce artwork has been created in London this week, in Shoreditch, East London as part of the WWI commemoration project Flanders Fields: A place to remember. German and English graffiti artists have come together to create street art murals commemorating the 1914 Christmas Truce during the First World War in London (above) and Berlin . The campaign will be running a series of events between 2014 and 2018 to mark the centenary of the War. This December marks the 100th anniversary since the famous Christmas Truce of World War One. As Flanders Fields in Belgium was an important battleground in WWI, VISITFLANDERS, the official tourism agency for Flanders and Brussels, has commissioned two unique pieces of street art to be created in London and Berlin, for the public to remember a moment of peace that came out of such a brutal conflict. The London art event, which took place this week, saw two UK-based artists and one German-based artist paint a huge mural in their own inimitable styles. British artists Zadok and Ninth Seal and German artist Sokar Uno collaborated to produce the work. The Christmas Truce was a series of widespread, unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front in Flanders Fields around Christmas 1914. During the installation, the artists took turns adding their unique styles to each panel, which feature representations of events recorded during the Christmas Truce . The artists each worked on four separate panels at any one time, culminating in the finished artwork which took several days to complete . On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, many soldiers from both sides independently ventured into ‘no man's land, where they tentatively socialised to host joint burial ceremonies, several meetings and carol-singing. Troops from both sides were also friendly enough to play games of football with one another, in one of the truce's most enduring images. Painting in London began on Monday on the Shoreditch Art Wall on Great Eastern Street. The artists each worked on four separate panels at any one time, culminating in the finished artwork which took several days to complete. During the installation, the artists took turns adding their unique styles to each panel, which feature representations of events recorded during the Christmas Truce. The artworks were produced on the 60 sq meter Shoreditch Art Wall in East London and at the Potsdamer Platz, in the centre of Berlin . The Shoreditch Art Wall consists of a large 60 square metre brick wall on the side of a Victorian-era building, in the high traffic area of London's uber-fashionable art district, Shoreditch, where the artwork will be on public display until Boxing Day. A similar project is being created in Berlin, where a huge canvas artwork by other renowned graffiti artists was also put on display to the public at Potsdamer Platz, in the centre of Berlin on 16th December. This project is one of many WWI activities that are scheduled in the upcoming months, to commemorate the events that took place in Flanders Fields throughout WWI. Other events that visitors can commemorate in 2015 include the Centennial of the first gas attack on the 22nd April, and the 30,000th Last Post on 9th July. British artists Zadok and Ninth Seal and German artist Sokar Uno collaborated to produce the work . This project is one of many WWI activities that are scheduled in the upcoming months, to commemorate the events that took place in Flanders Fields throughout WWI . Andrew Daines, Director of VISITFLANDERS UK and Ireland commented: ‘World War One turned out to be one of the deadliest wars and changed the face of history forever. ‘The contribution and sacrifice made by the hundreds and thousands of men from across the UK and around the world, and the impact it had and continues to have on society is almost beyond comprehension. ‘We hope that through these artworks, visitors and locals in London and Berlin will take a moment to reflect, to remember and to learn from this monumental period in history.’ Family history site Findmypast recently discovered a never-before-heard interview recording with a veteran that took part in the Christmas Day Truce in 1914. The recording was conducted by Findmypast’s military historian, Paul Nixon. He interviewed Private Stan Brown, of the 1st Leicester, later 32526 1st South Staffordshire in 1981. Mr Brown died in 1987. The account of the truce is transcribed below: 'At Christmas 1914 we had a kind of armistice if you like, to say there'd be no firing on Christmas Day, but it didn’t happen just like that. 'On Christmas Eve, as far as we were concerned, we was still at war, but in the evening on sentry-go we heard singing from Jerry. 'He was only fifty yards away. We had the Stand-To because we didn't know what all the singing was about to start off with. 'On Jerry's wire there were bits of paper, bits of rag, and all sorts of things saying Happy Christmas, some in German, some in English because a lot of the Germans had worked in England. 'They held up a bottle of wine and I know our bloke shot at it. Well it all got quiet. 'I don't know if we had breakfast that morning, I suppose we did; we had a drink. Everything was peaceful and eventually one of the Germans held up a card with ""Merry Christmas"" written on it, and come on over the top. 'Everybody was dubious in our trench, saying kind of, should we or shouldn't we and all of this bloomin' caper, and then one or two more Germans come up. 'Then eventually we decided, well they haven't got any rifles on 'em and we went over. And our Buchanan-Dunlop who come to us as Battalion Commander, he kind of led the singing! 'We didn't all group in one place, we was spread along an area about a hundred yards and we mixed in with some others and they give us a bottle of wine and cigars and we thought to ourselves, well they must be bloomin' well-off in Jerry-land. All we got was a tin of Tickler's jam and we went back into the trench and brought out a couple or three tins of jam to give to these Jerries.'","The UK Christmas Truce artwork has been created in Shoreditch, London .

"George W. Bush is nothing if not a good sport. And in no better way was that illustrated when the former President donned a Santa suit for a hospital visit in Dallas. The 68-year-old was handing out toys at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas to patients who have to spend Christmas at the facility. The family that posted the picture of Bush to Facebook lost one of their twin daughters earlier this year to a heart disease called restrictive cardomyopathy. Is that you, Mr President? George W. Bush hands out toys at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas on Saturday . 'Guess who just came and gave Emily a Christmas present dressed in a Santa suit with Secret Service and all?!?!?.......... Pres. George Bush,' mom Natalie Smith posted to Facebook on December 16. Her daughter, Shayde, died in January. Her surviving daughter, Emily, has undergone a heart replacement, but is constantly in and out of hospital as her body rejects the organ. The family have been raising money for Emily's medical expenses on GoFundMe. There were reports on Twitter that Bush's secret service detail dressed as elves to accompany him. Bush, who was succeeded by Barrack Obama in 2009, has lifetime secret service protection, as do all former Presidents.

"A county executive who was caught following a teenage porn star on Twitter has blamed it on computer hackers. Steve Bellone, the executive of Suffolk County, New York, included 19-year-old Miriam Weeks, better known as Belle Knox, on the list of 267 social media accounts he kept up to date with. But when challenged about his taste in Twitter accounts this week, he immediately unfollowed the actress - who appears in explicit videos online and has hosted a porn-themed gameshow called The Sex Factor. Following: Steve Bellone (left), the county executive in Suffolk, New York, was caught following teen porn star Belle Knox (right), real name Miriam Weeks . A spokesman for Bellone, who now follows 266 accounts, said that they had told police about the alleged hacking, and changed their protocols, the New York Post reported. Knox, whose Twitter feed is devoted to plugging her explicit videos, rose to fame earlier this year when she was outed as a student at prestigious Duke University, North Carolina, by a classmate. In the wake of her exposure, she defended her decision to pay her school fees with money from the sex industry - and now uses her college as a selling point. She has recently appeared on the cover of Xtreme Magazine, and has also appeared in Hustler, Penthouse and Playboy. Explicit: Knox, who was dramatically outed as a Duke University student this year, posts nude pictures and clips from her work on Twitter, which would have been visible on Bellone's feed . Her Twitter account routinely posts images from her appearances - which have not been censored - which would in turn appear on the news feed of followers such as Bellone. Aside from Knox, Bellone, a married father of three, follows mainly political, media, sports and charity accounts. He is up for re-election in 2015. When challenged by the post over the apparent error, a spokesman said: 'County Executive Bellone’s Twitter account, which is operated by his staff, has been hacked and an obscene Twitter account was subsequently followed.' 'A formal complaint has been filed with Twitter and to the third-party software used to assist in managing the account.' Proud: Knox, who has used her notoriety as a selling point, has spoken at length about her sex work - and advocates the legalization of prostitution throughout the U.S. Although mainly content to balance her majors in sociology and women's studies with her adult filming, Knox has made some political points of her own - calling for prostitution to be legalized. In an opinion piece for Rolling Stone magazine last month, she called for a law chance, saying: 'The time has come for the world's oldest profession to be legalized in the so-called Land of the Free for public health, safety and opportunity.' She argued that most sex workers join the trade out of choice, and should be allowed to practice it legally - as they can in some parts of Nevada - so it can be more safe and lucrative.","Steve Bellone, a New York county executive followed 19-year-old Belle Knox .

"Two nine foot-tall polar bears raise their giant paws, bite and wrestle in the snow on a beautiful winter's day by Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, in brilliant new photographs by Joyce Ferder. The image is a common one at this time of year says Ferder, who worked in TV news before becoming a full-time landscape and wildlife photographer. 'There is nothing for the bears to do but wait for the ice (to form) so they play by sparring to be ready for when they will have to fight each other for the right to mate with a female next year,' Ferder says. 'Imagine Greco-Roman wrestling but with polar bears, it is exactly like that. Two polar bears fight in the snow by Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, as captured by wildlife photographer Joyce Ferder . The moisture flying from the nine foot-tall bears catches the sun on a perfect winter's day in Canada . While play fighting, the young polar bears look ferocious when they rise onto their back legs . The powerful carnivores push each other on the shore of the bay while they wait for the ice to form over the water . 'They would usually just be lying around and one would roll over and start pawing at the other. 'From there they would push and shove each other going fully on hind legs every so often. There would be a lot of biting and gnawing.' This scene was an early birthday gift for Joyce, who turned 56 the day after witnessing this hour-long play fight. 'They would sometimes hold each others head in the snow for a few seconds as if on a count and then start it all over again,' Ferder recalls. 'I was in awe of the power of the animals and the amazingly clear day with the most extraordinary light. Up until that point we had had some terrible weather - blizzards and very grey days. The sharp bottom teeth of the bear on the left are primed to show the one on the right who's boss . As if Greco-Roman wrestling like humans (aside from the biting) the bears take each other to the ground to show their strength . The bears spent an hour fighting, says the photographer, before walking off into the sun together . 'It was also preternaturally quiet as the bears made no sound when they fought each other. 'The only sound you would hear was the sound of snow going ""oomph"" when the bears hit each other and the respectful murmurs of the human beings feeling privileged to watch such a spectacle. 'Not only is the light incredible, I love the small details in the photos - the texture of their fur, the blood shot eyes and their teeth. 'If you look closely you can see spit from the left bear's mouth in the air.' When the powerful duo were done, Ferder says they walked off into the sun together. Churchill in Manitoba is known as the polar bear capital of the world where a host of companies run tours which allow people to see them in the wild.","Photographer Joyce Ferder took images near Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada .

"Just four races back into her skiing career, Lindsey Vonn is on the verge of World Cup history. After clinching a second straight win - and third consecutive podium - with a victory in Saturday's downhill, the 30-year-old American now has the chance to secure a 62nd career win in Sunday's super-G and move level with Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proll for all-time wins. 'I have to get there first. If it happens tomorrow, great,' said Vonn, a four-time World Cup champion. 'I feel like I have been talking about (the record) for a long time now and, if I keep talking about it, I feel like it's never going to happen.' I did it: Lindsey Vonn  takes 1st place during the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Downhill Saturday . Perfect run: Vonn has been out of action for one year after two knee surgeries .

Lindsey Vonn of the US celebrates after competing in the Women's Downhill race at the FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup in Val d'Isere France on December 20, 2014 . It would have been a distant dream one year ago, however, when she re-injured her troublesome right knee on the same Oreiller-Killy course in Val d'Isere and required surgery for the second time. The first knee operation came after she tore two ligaments following a spectacular fall at the world championships 10 months earlier. Aside from one small wobble in the middle of the course, Vonn's run on Saturday was clean and she finished .19 seconds clear of early pace-setter Elisabeth Goergl of Austria and Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, who tied for second. 'I trusted my body and my knee held up great,' Vonn said. 'No problem, no pain, so all is good.' Swiss skier Lara Gut placed 0.39 behind in fourth place, while overall leader Tina Maze of Slovenia finished half a second adrift in seventh. After nearly two years without a victory, Vonn won a downhill at Lake Louise, Canada, two weeks ago and finished second in super-G the next day.

Lindsey Vonn celebrates on the podium after winning the alpine ski women's World Cup downhill in Val d'Isere . 'It feels amazing. I was a bit nervous today as I made some mistakes in training. It's tough when you only have one training run,' Vonn said. 'I skied aggressively today. It was definitely tough as we had a lot more speed.' Vonn was 0.11 seconds ahead of Goergl on the first time split, up to 0.36 on the second, lost a little time and then sped up again at the bottom. As she crossed the line, Vonn leaned her head back, swung her right pole up in the air and then shook her head in relief, as if scarcely believing she'd won again. She then blew a kiss to the camera. 'In Lake Louise, I won so many times that some people automatically assume that I should win there,' Vonn said. 'I already knew I could win here today. It was for other people to understand that I'm back to where I used to be.' Vonn even had time to take a selfie with a beautifully groomed calf as she stood on the podium after her win . The blonde bombshell couldn't have been happier as she stroked the animal brought on to the podium . Vonn smiles for the cameras as she received a warm hug in the chilly Val d'Isere weather . Lindsey Vonn is one win from matching the all-time women's World Cup record after recording her 61st victory in Val d'Isere, France, on Saturday . Prior to her success at Lake Louise, Vonn's previous World Cup win was a giant slalom in January 2013 in Maribor, Slovenia, - and this was only her eighth race since then. After her injury at the worlds, Vonn then tried to get back in time for the Sochi Olympics - only to tear one of the reconstructed ligaments in a training crash. Then, four days before Christmas, she sprained her MCL in Val d'Isere and needed surgery again. Meanwhile, it was the first podium of the season for both Goergl and Rebensburg - who also secured her first career podium in downhill. 'I think I'm going to keep smiling until I go to bed,' the 25-year-old Rebensburg said. The 33-year-old Goergl had not been on the podium since finishing second in downhill at Lenzerheide, Switzerland, in March. Overall, Maze leads with 596 points; Austria's Anna Fenninger is second with 327, while Vonn moves up to third with 312.","Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn won her 61st World Cup downhill on Saturday .

"Prosecutors say a financial fraudster used backers' money to have his wife's body cryogenically frozen before fleeing New York for South America. That's among allegations in a federal indictment unveiled Friday against Whileon Chay. Manhattan federal prosecutors say the 38-year-old solicited more than $5 million from people for investment pools, misused and lost the money and bolstered his deceit with bogus account statements. They say he used some of the money to buy himself luxury cars, among other things. Cryogenics: Fugitive fraudster Whileon Chay, who scammed 19 victims out of the money in a Ponzi scheme, was upset at the death of his wife, and so had her frozen using money he'd embezzled . Over $150,000 of the money was used to have his 52-year-old wife frozen after her 2009 death. It is not known where her body is. Prosecutors say Chay fled to Lima, Peru, while under investigation in 2011. Neither he nor any lawyer responded to a related 2013 civil case. There was no immediate response Saturday to a message at a phone number possibly once associated with him. Because of the indictment, authorities are now able to go after Chay as a criminal fugitive. The United States has an extradition treaty with Peru. Chay's sister told The New York Post her brother just vanished and that she hasn't seen or heard from him in years. Chay told his clients that he was an expert in foreign exchange, gold and commodities markets. He promised them a huge 36 percent return and fabricated earnings reports. He managed to scam 19 investors between 2007 and 2011.","The cryogenic process cost $150,000 .

"Marco Reus may have had a bumpy time of it recently, but the Borussia Dortmund talisman could well and truly live life in the fast lane in the most random of circumstances. Earlier in the week, the 25-year-old was fined £427,000 for being found guilty of driving without a license by the German authorities.

"Hartlepool manager Ronnie Moore has announced he would like to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Former Sheffield United and Wales striker Evans had an offer to train with his former club retracted last month following strong local opposition to the proposal. But Moore, who took over as boss of the bottom club in the Football League this week, has confirmed he could look to bring in 25-year-old Evans. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ched Evans  statement confirming appeal . Ched Evans used to play for Sheffield United but is now searching for a new club . Ronnie Moore believes Evans could help Hartlepool United if he were to sign for the club . He said after Saturday's 1-1 home draw with Oxford: 'It's a possibility. 'If it could happen, I would want it to happen. He is a proven scorer; he's served his time and the boy wants to play football. 'If there is a chance he might come here, I don't see any reason why he shouldn't. 'He has made a mistake and maybe he hasn't apologised in the right way - and I know he has an appeal case pending - but if he gets on the park, he would go a long way to getting us out of trouble.' Hartlepool's Labour MP Iain Wright believes that signing Evans 'would send out the wrong message' Hartlepool's Labour MP Iain Wright was outraged at the prospect of Evans signing for the club. He said: 'I really hope we don't. I love my club, I love Hartlepool United. There's a reason why no other team in the Football League wants to sign him - he is a pariah. 'I was at the match today. There were lots of young lads there supporting Hartlepool United. I just think it sends out such a wrong message to young men in terms of it being OK for a rapist to play football. It's entirely wrong.' There were mixed views on the potential signing from fans on the club's Poolie Bunker forum. While some supporters of the struggling side took the view that a proven international goalscorer could fire them to safety, others feared the reaction to such a controversial move. PoolieinNottingham wrote: 'I really hope this is just a rumour. 'Thanks to Jeff Stelling (the Sky Sports presenter and Hartlepool fan) loads of people have a soft spot for Pools, whereas if this is true we'll get no end of bad will. 'If we've got money to spend on wages now there will be other players who can do the job instead of him.' Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling is one of Hartlepool's most famous supporters . But in the next message Monkeybutt replied: 'I would take him in a heartbeat, what's done is done, served his sentence, move on people!' Campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition has also had its say. Sarah Green, a spokeswoman for the coalition, said: 'Ched Evans is an unrepentant convicted rapist. 'Any club who sign him need to think hard about the message they are sending to their fans, to the local community and to all football supporters in allowing him to rejoin the beautiful game.'","Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans was convicted of rape in 2012 .

"New manager, same old problems. Steve Clarke’s first game as Reading manager ended in defeat as 10-man Watford escaped with a 1-0 win at the Madejski Stadium. Watford’s Gabrielle Angella was sent off for a second bookable offence in first half stoppage time, giving Clarke an ideal opportunity to start delivering on his promise of a Barclays Premier League promotion push this season. But this was a welcome to the Championship the new man at the helm will want to forget in a hurry, as Almen Abdi’s second-half strike proved the winner for visitors Watford. 10-men Watford battled out a 1-0 victory against Reading as night falls on the Madejski Stadium . Reading's new manager Steve Clarke salutes the home fans before the game . Reading's Simon Cox (right) competes for possession with Watford's Troy Deeney . Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Norwood, Williams, Blackman, Cox, Murray. Subs: Kelly, Cummings, Taylor, Tanner, Andersen, Cooper, Stacey. Watford: Gomes, Angella, Cathcart, Bassong, Anya, Guedioura, Tozser, Abdi, Pudil, Deeney, Vydra. Subs: Forestieri, Doyley, Paredes, Murray, Dyer, Ighalo, Bond. Scorer: Abdi 70' It had looked like Clarke would have referee Gavin Ward to thank come Saturday evening. The official booked Watford defender Angella half hour in for holding back striker Glenn Murray, before showing the Italian a second yellow before half time for deliberate handball. And, in truth, Reading should have taken advantage. Chances fell the way of Nick Blackman and Murray, among others, but all squandered whatever sniff they were given of the Watford goal. It took just 40 seconds for Reading to mount their first attack, though Murray’s side-footed volley served only as a warning when it went high over the crossbar. Seven minutes later Watford’s Angella gave away an inviting free-kick 22 yards out after a blatant nudge in Murray’s back. Oliver Norwood stepped up, but only found the stands. Still, it was a promising start from a side that had lost 6-1 against Birmingham City last week before the sacking of manager Nigel Adkins on Monday. Clarke cut an animated figure on the touchline, jotting notes in his pad throughout as Reading looked to establish a foothold in a scrappy affair. Reading's Garath McCleary (right) appeals for handball that subsequently saw Gabriele Angella sent off . Goalscorer Almen Abdi (right) chases down Reading's Danny Williams during an improbable victory . Neither side could truly take command in the first 45 minutes. Possession was wasted and chances came in dribs and drabs, particularly from distance or on the counter-attack. It was the latter that led referee Ward to produce Angella’s first yellow card when he dragged Murray back to prevent Reading a breakaway. ‘This is a library,’ sang the traveling Watford support of 2,749. They weren’t entirely wrong. The Madejski atmosphere which Clarke raved about in his pre-match programme notes was found wanting. That is, until the opening minute of first half stoppage time. Reading's Glenn Murray (left) holds off the challenge of Sebastien Bassong . Garath McCleary ran at 25-year-old Angella who, falling to ground, handled the ball on the edge of the box as the Reading winger looked to get past. The referee deemed it intentional and produced a second yellow to leave Watford a man shy for more than 45 minutes. After the break, the best chance of the match fell to Murray. The striker had only Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to beat from inside the box to the left, but his shot agonisingly went beyond the far post. It was all Reading. Watford scrambled to get out of their own half. But again, lines were fluffed. McCleary beat Watford’s Daniel Pudil before finding Blackman alone at the back post, only for the Reading forward to lose his footing and slice what seemed a sure-thing. Reading's Glenn Murray (centre) is challenged by Watford's Sebastien Bassong (right) and Daniel Pudil . They were made to pay. A cut back from the left by Ikechi Anya found the approaching Abdi who, with a low drive and in space, found the net beyond goalkeeper Federici. It was against the play, but Watford were ruthless in taking their chance with 10 men. Cue a Reading onslaught. They threw men forward, but never made Gomes break a sweat. The trouble is, Clarke may have arrived at the Madejski, but he is stuck with a squad shy of confidence. Boos rang around upon the final whistle as Watford left 1-0 winners, and Clarke's promotion promise fell on deaf ears.","Watford defeated Reading 1-0 in their Championship clash at the Madejski .

"Ipswich Town proclaimed the message loud and clear: they are sick and tired of life in the Championship. They believe they are good enough for the Premier League and they intend to return there as quickly as possible. Here they showed why and how. This was a very polished performance against one of their promotion rivals. Middlesbrough are usually so assured on the road, here they looked lost. Daryl Murphy (centre) wheels away after opening the scoring in Ipswich's defeat of Middlesbrough .

Booked: Vossen, Omeruo, Friend . Referee: James Linington (Isle of Wight) Attendance: 21,187 (1,111 away) In the end, two goals were ample. If Mick McCarthy’s team do make their return to the top flight, Daryl Murphy’s contribution will have been priceless. He rifled home midway through the first-half and Jay Tabb made it two on the stroke of half-time. They could easily have scored more but the point had been made. After 12 years away from the top division, Ipswich feel another crack at it is long overdue. The win wasn’t sufficient to take them top for Christmas - Bournemouth’s seaside stroll at Blackpool put paid to that - but second place, a mere point behind, will do very nicely. This constantly fluctuating Championship promotion race had taken another twist at lunchtime, with Steven Whittaker’s last-gasp goal for Norwich City at Derby doing their East Anglian rivals a small favour. It meant both of these teams had the chance to go top, though leaders Bournemouth were unlikely to surrender first place by faltering at strugglers Blackpool. That proved correct, the Cherries cruised to victory. Jay Tabb (left) celebrates after the Ipswich midfielder put the home side 2-0 ahead just before the break . Whatever the complex permutations, something had to give here. Ipswich had won seven of their 10 home league matches this season, while Boro had won six of their last nine on the road. While Aitor Karanka’s side had lost just one of their last 16, McCarthy’s had been defeated in just one of 17. With so much at stake, it was perhaps understandably a cagey opening with the only real chance of the opening 20 minutes arriving when Paul Anderson fired over after a deft touch brought him infield from the left. The hosts had been the better team on the balance of play and their 24th-minute lead was just about deserved. They profited down the left side when Teddy Bishop threaded a pass to Tabb, who advanced to the byline. His cut-back fell perfectly for David McGoldrick, only for his strike to be blocked by the legs of Dimitrios Konstantopoulos. The ball ricocheted nicely for Murphy to drill home his 14th goal of the campaign. Boro had to play on the counter-attack but Adam Reach and Grant Leadbitter looked effective at times. A searching ball over the top by Kenneth Omeruo was just beyond the outstretched leg of Albert Adomah. Omeruo, who had earlier been cautioned for a foul on McGoldrick, appeared to bring the Ipswich striker down again after being turned in the box. Referee James Linington disagreed and booked McGoldrick for diving. Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy shouts some orders from the sidelines during his side's 2-0 victory . Boro’s best chance of the opening half arrived four minutes before the break. Reach found himself in plenty of space to cross from the left and Adomah flicked a header wide of the far post. It was an opportunity they would regret not taking. In the second minute of added time, following a fine exchange of passes down the right involving McGoldrick, Luke Chambers and Bishop, the latter swung in a cross and Tabb - all 5ft 7in of him - somehow got between two burly defenders to head home. Karanka introduced Lee Tomlin at the break to try and spur his team into life but Ipswich had the first chance of the second-half when Chambers headed straight at Konstantopoulos from Anderson’s free-kick. Omeruo was fortunate not to see red when he scissored down the advancing Anderson wide right and Karanka wisely replaced the defender moments later. Home keeper Bartosz Bialkowski had not put a foot wrong but he was stranded when Reach tried to lob him from 30 yards out. Christophe Berra recognised the danger and read the trajectory to head off the line. Ipswich were starting to showboat by the midway point and they really should have made it three - from Tabb’s corner, a Murphy header was blocked on the line by Leadbitter and Tommy Smith then struck the post with the follow-up. It didn’t matter, Middlesbrough had produced precious little. The points had long been secure after this statement of a performance.","Ipswich defeated Middlesbrough 2-0 in their Sky Bet Championship clash .

"The Duchess of Cambridge was as elegant as ever today in a claret LK Bennett coat while meeting military supporters, servicemen and women, as part of London Poppy Day. However, the glossy mane that inspired a million Chelsea blow-dries looked rather different: silver roots were clearly visible along the parting of her normally chestnut hair. She's also gone for a less bouncy 'do than usual, parted in the middle, rather than at the side. In fact, the flat, middle-parted style she's chosen highlights the silvery strands coming through at her hairline. Hairdresser Daniel Galvin Jr comments: 'If you are going grey, it is important to part your hair where the grey does not show.' Rebelling: However, Professor Beard said the Duchess occasionally rebels against her public image - as can be seen in this photograph taken last year, which shows streaks of grey in Kate's usually immaculate tresses. However, it appears Kate doesn't care who spots the silvers. And why should she? She's probably got more important things on her mind. Many new mothers, like Kate, find that their hair changes after they give birth. Greying hair is not normally directly associated with pregnancy, however, any form of stress can encourage it and can be a side effect of being pregnant or giving birth. 'If, when pregnant, you use an anaesthetic grey hairs may develop. It’s a huge shock to the system sometimes sends the hair bulb to sleep causing the hair to loose its natural pigmentation,' explains Galvin Jr. 'In my experience many pregnant women whose hair turns grey will start seeing their natural pigmentation come through within a few months.' Sources say that the Duchess had, to her horror, started finding the odd . grey hair (‘stress highlights’, her friends joke) before her pregnancy . However, it seems more likely that . Kate's has been getting lighter for the last few years - common among . those with dark hair - and has simply decided not to cover it up. Indeed, impeccably placed sources have whispered that the Duchess had, to her then horror, started finding the odd . stray grey (‘stress highlights’, her friends joke) before her pregnancy. To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during . regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair And Metrospa in . Chelsea. Evidently, Kate . has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers, even royal ones, can . spare four hours at the salon when they've got a four-month-old to look . after. 'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour . giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says Galvin Jr. 'I always . recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend . the grey hair and tone it down slightly.' However, Kate may want to . avoid any unnecessary chemicals: it could be that she's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant . or breastfeeding. Many women stop colouring their hair . during pregnancy, with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of . their baby to begin again. This is for fear of the . chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through . breast-feeding. This time last year, pictured above, Kate's hair was noticeably darker, and parted at the side . However, the NHS says new mothers needn't avoid the salon: . 'The chemicals in permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes are not highly . toxic. Most research, although limited, shows that it’s safe to colour . your hair while pregnant. 'Some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm. However, these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair.' Celebrity hair stylist Errol Douglas said: 'I recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they're expecting. They're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay.' Kate looked radiant in a calf-length red coat from LK Bennett as she met former and serving soldiers at Kensington Palace today . The Duchess of Cambridge prepares to meet staff and volunteers from the Royal British Legion's London Poppy Day Appeal . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled from Kensington palace to High Street Kensington this morning . Kate wore an outfit which matched the . colours of the Remembrance Day poppies: her claret coat is from LK . Bennett's autumn/winter 2011 collection . Often, women find their hair looks . thicker and shinier during pregnancy but hormonal changes kick in after . having a baby, as dermatologist Justine Hextall explains.

"Paul Lambert expressed his dismay at referee Lee Mason after the official sent Aston Villa’s Gabriel Agbonlahor off for what looked like a legitimate 50-50 challenge. Agbonlahor and former Villa winger Ashley Young clashed in the 65th minute in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United, with both players sliding in aggressively — though neither had their foot up or their studs showing. But Mason immediately dismissed the Villa player — even though Lambert claimed that Young admitted that he had committed the foul. VIDEO Scroll down to see Paul Lambert on Ashley Young's admission .

The Aston Villa forward walks from the pitch after being sent off with the game at 1-1 . ‘If that’s a red card we may as well just pack up as it won’t be a game of football,’ said Lambert. ‘I spoke to Brad Guzan after the game and he said that Ashley Young admitted that he fouled Gabby — so work that one out. Lambert said Villa would attempt an appeal against the decision, which will result in a three-game ban if upheld. ‘There’s a right good chance of appealing that — especially when a player’s admitted that he fouled Gabby,’ said Lambert. ‘He admitted it to Brad — whether that helps or not. But that ain’t a red card. ‘I’m not worried about whether Ashley Young made a meal out of it or not. 'It’s a tackle in which two lads have gone in for the ball and in my view is never a red card. Gabriel’s really down but I said to him there’s no way that’s a red card and I’ll stick up for him all day long on that.

Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was left fuming at a disallowed goal he believed would have given his side a shock chance to force a draw at champions Manchester City. James McArthur's header from Yannick Bolasie's cross midway through the second half when Palace were trailing 2-0 was ruled out for offside, presumably because referee Phil Dowd and his asssistants hadn't spotted Fernandinho by the touchline yards away from the action playing him onside. Warnock, whose side need every point in an anticipated relegation battle, said: 'As you all know, we scored a cracking goal which would have put the whole stadium in a bit of doubt with 20 minutes to go.

"Even if Erik Lamela is unlikely to follow Roberto Soldado into the White Hart Lane confessional, he too has endured some difficult periods since arriving here in 2013. He might not feel quite so ‘ashamed’ as his Spanish team-mate, who has been candid enough to admit that he cringes with embarrassment when fans sing his name, but the burden of a hefty price tag appears to have rested heavy on Lamela’s shoulders too. Indeed, Lamela has had to cope with the additional pressure of being seen as a replacement for Gareth Bale; a wide player with the ability to score the kind of goals Bale used to provide.

But Ashley Barnes (centre) pulled Burnley level with a brilliant strike from range in the 27th minute . Barnes (centre) curled a brilliant shot beyond the reach of Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (right) to get Burnley back in the game . Those goals have not arrived with the frequency his employers might have expected when they deposited £30million into Roma’s bank account. But the 22-year-old is at least demonstrating Bale’s talent for the spectacular, as he proved again here yesterday with a quite brilliant 35th-minute winner. This one was straight from the Bale repertoire; a 25-yard curling left-foot shot that was hit on the move and with more than enough pace to elude Tom Heaton. For the scorer of that remarkable Rabona, it was also most welcome — and not just because it was his first Premier League goal. No, it was the fact that he was also largely responsible for Ashley Barnes’ similarly impressive equaliser after losing possession cheaply inside Tottenham’s half. A first goal in 26 Premier League attempts will, nevertheless, come with a degree of relief, even if the young Argentine should take some comfort in the fact that Bale had to wait 24 games in England’s top flight before experiencing victory. Mauricio Pochettino certainly felt the goal would do his countryman the power of good.

Harry Kane continued his fine form for Tottenham this season by firing them into the lead in the 21st minute - CLICK HERE for more stats with our brilliant Match Zone . ‘Last season was very difficult for him, so that was important for him as a player,’ said the Tottenham manager. ‘It will help him to build his confidence. He is a big talent but, when you are young, sometimes you need time to adapt to a new club and a new culture.’ As Pochettino acknowledged, Lamela was part of a potent forward line that performed well against a Burnley side now playing with more composure after collecting 11 points from their previous six games. With Nacer Chadli on the left flank and Christian Eriksen deployed behind Harry Kane, Tottenham secured their third win in six days in some style. Kane continues to grow in stature, underlining his claim to be Tottenham’s principal forward, not just because he scored the opening 21st-minute goal but because he also displayed excellent vision, control and a superb range of passing. His 14th goal of the season irritated Sean Dyche, who complained for two reasons. Firstly, because Eriksen — who made a point of not touching the ball and instead let it run through for the now advancing Nacer Chadli — was actually offside when Kane took a quick free-kick and, secondly, because he felt a free-kick should not have been awarded in the first place.

Lamela turned in an impressive performance from Tottenham, who continued their upturn in form in the Premier League . Ross Wallace (right) forced a tremendous save from Lloris in the final moments of the game with a free-kick . ‘I actually can’t be bothered to get into the whole debate about whether Eriksen was interfering with play,’ said Dyche. ‘I’m more annoyed about the handball. It flicked off Kane and Keano [Michael Keane] could do nothing about it.’ The truth is, Burnley’s defenders should have played to the whistle. As it was, Kane covered the ground to meet Chadli’s cross inside the six-yard box and head home unopposed. To Burnley’s credit they responded swiftly, their equaliser arriving within six minutes after Lamela lost the ball to David Jones. A neat pass forward from George Boyd followed before Barnes, so impressive in recent weeks in combination with Danny Ings, curled a stunning shot beyond the reach of Hugo Lloris. No sooner had Burnley levelled than Tottenham might have scored again. Kane was presented with another close-range opportunity, this time thanks to Lamela, but contrived to miscue, before Eriksen — understandably surprised the ball had even reached him — blasted over the bar. No doubt disappointed to see his efforts go to waste, Lamela decided to have a go himself after that — and with breathtaking results. The loss of Ryan Mason to what Pochettino said he hoped was not too serious an ankle injury did little to disrupt Tottenham, the home side boasting 69 per cent of the possession and 13 shots to Burnley’s three by half-time. That said, Lloris was forced to excel on more than one occasion after the break to protect Tottenham’s lead, in particular in the dying minutes, when he pushed a powerful free-kick from Ross Wallace to safety. It was a save that ensured Spurs remain very much in the hunt for the Champions League place they so crave.

"Louis van Gaal accused his team of lacking the killer instinct to win the title after United dropped their first points in almost two months in their 1-1 draw against ten-man Aston Villa. Radamel Falcao started his first game for United since early October and scored as United came from behind to earn a point – but couldn’t go on to seal the win, despite the 65th minute sending off of Gabriel Agbonlahor. And Van Gaal, whose side has previously won six consecutive matches, said dropping points in game such as these could be the difference between mounting a serious title challenge or not. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal on the title race . Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United aren't capable of winning the Premier League title this season . Radamel Falcao scored United's against Aston Villa during their draw on Saturday . Falcao celebrated the goal that he netted on his first start for the club since October . ‘I saw the first half of the Manchester City match and they could have been behind in the first five or ten minutes and they struggled until half time but at the end it is 3-0,’ said van Gaal. ‘That’s the difference.’ Asked if his side were capable of making a challenge for the Premier League title, van Gaal said: ‘No, because you have seen that you have to win these matches and we didn’t win. But there is still a long time to go. Chelsea has to at Stoke City, it’s not so easy. ‘We dropped two points. We were the better team and that’s frustrating when you don’t win these games.

Radamel Falaco returned to the starting eleven for the first time since early October; he partnered Robin van Persie. Angel Di Maria would come off the bench later. In fact United could field such an array of attacking players they could even afford to put Wayne Rooney in midfield. But still they could not overwhelm Villa, nor, in that lame first-half, could they register a significant shot on goal. Van Gaal at least does not hide behind blandness. ‘When you want to be a part of the title race then you have to win these games,’ he said. ‘We dropped two points. We were the better team and that’s frustrating when you don’t win these games. We were not so aggressive in the first half as usual. We kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards . ‘We were not creative enough in the second half; we didn’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression, so that was the plus. OK we have a draw but that’s why I’m a little bit frustrated because we could have won this game, we didn’t do it and we are responsible.’ Villa were so well set up by Paul Lambert, so clear in their intent and decisive in their tactics, that there was never a question of being swept aside. Even when they controversially lost Gabriel Agbonlahor to a red card on 65 minutes, there was no capitulation. Throughout the team there were excellent performances. Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph shone, as did Agbonlahor until his early departure. Ron Vlaar was the mainstay of van Gaal’s back three at the World Cup in the summer; he put the experience to good use on Saturday, frustrating his former national team boss at the heart of Villa’s own three-man defence.

Benteke (second left) is mobbed by his Villa team-mates after giving them the lead against United . Paul Lambert had chosen to ape van Gaal’s formation to counter United and Vlaar stood out, cajoling, organising and intercepting as United were kept at bay in those opening exchanges. Van Gaal’s team kept the ball nicely in periods; they rarely did anything with it. ‘I thought we were excellent considering everything that’s been against us this week,’ said Lambert. ‘We had seven lads out due to injury and suspension. Our bench was like a kindergarten but the performance was absolutely terrific.’ Indeed Lambert’s players executed instructions perfectly, swamping United’s attacks leaving Agbonlahor as the man with the speed to transform their defensive moments into swift counter attacks. That said, for Villa’s opener on 18 minutes though United had plenty of time to defend; they just failed to do so. Delph floated in a delightful free kick and Christian Benteke took it down superbly, though Jonny Evans was weak challenging and closing down. It would be churlish to dwell on the negatives; having found his half yard of space benteke curled the ball around Evans, finding a gap at the far post in which to squeeze the ball, leaving David de Gea helpless. ‘An absolute world class goal,’ said Lambert.

Half-time saw Darren Fletcher sacrificed for Tyler Blackett so Michael Carrick could push on in midfield; United desperately needed some passing guile in that area. Yet it was Villa who made the more immediate impression, De Gea required to be at his superb best to tip over a firm Benteke header from a corner on 48 minutes. United did ultimately demonstrate significantly more intent in the second half. Guzan had to push away a close-range Robin van Persie shot on 51 minutes and then, on 54 minutes, came Falcao’s moment. Young was now making a habit of getting past Lowton and did so again sending in an excellent cross which Falcao, leaning backwards, met firmly and decisively to equalise. Scored by a Colombian, it was the most English of goals and Falcao greeted his second goal for the club rapturously, charging towards the United fans and sparking a mini pitch invasion. ‘It was a beautiful goal and I liked him today and I’m very happy for him,’ said van Gaal, while offering no clues as to whether he would keep his place. Villa though were not immediately cowed. Indeed, their biggest setback came on 65 minutes when Young and Agbonlahor clashed for the ball. Young won it while Agbonlahor was late and came through the man but not with his foot raised. Both players had attacked the ball aggressively but only referee Lee Mason saw it as a red card. ‘If that s a red card we may as well just pack up as it won’t be a game of football’ said Lambert. ‘ . Yet Villa did not fold and United are still not what they were. Villa changed their shape to accommodate and they kept United at bay. Indeed, on 87 minutes, a dipping, swerving shot from substitute Leonardo Bacuna might have won them the game. And in the dying seconds, Charles N’Zogbia was inches away from turning in a cross. It was not to be. But a point with ten men felt almost as good. Young (left) was booed by many of the Villa supporters who haven't forgiven him since he left for United in 2011 .

"Nick Clegg and Lib Dem  Cabinet ministers are today accused of plotting to persuade business leaders to undermine David Cameron’s historic stand against a new EU treaty. In an email leaked to the Mail, the heads of blue chip firms are asked to sign up to a letter demanding that the Government ‘re-engages’ with Brussels. It is being circulated by leading City lobbyist Roland Rudd following a meeting with Mr Clegg, Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne. It says it is ‘imperative’ that Britain is not left on the ‘outside’ when important  decisions are taken on the future of Europe. The plotters (clockwise from top left): Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne were all involved in a meeting earlier this week with a city lobbyist who later sent an email to business leaders telling them to back the Liberal Democrats' position on Europe . The revelation prompted cries of treachery from Tory MPs and raised fears that the issue of Europe could fracture the Coalition – which is under the greatest strain since it was formed. Mr Clegg had initially backed the Prime  Minister’s use of the veto, but flip-flopped after a furious reaction from his own party. The attempt by Mr Rudd, a close friend of former EU commissioner Lord Mandelson, to influence Government policy will raise further concerns about the power wielded by lobbyists. Revelations about the influence of Liam Fox’s unofficial adviser Adam Werritty prompted the Defence Secretary’s resignation. Lobbyists at PR firm Bell Pottinger, meanwhile, were secretly taped boasting of their access to the Cabinet. Summit: Roland Rudd chaired the meeting with the ministers earlier this week before later sending the email to business leaders . Last night there were fresh signs that the EU agreement to create a new ‘fiscal union’, which Mr Cameron refused to endorse at a crunch summit last week, is already crumbling. Hungary and the Czech Republic suggested they would not sign up unless plans to harmonise tax rates across the Continent are dropped. France, meanwhile, stepped up its attacks on Britain as the head of the French central bank insisted the UK should be stripped of its gold-plated credit rating before his own country. Mr Clegg, who refused to attend Mr Cameron’s Commons statement on the summit, has told Cabinet colleagues the Government must now ‘re-engage with our European partners’. Earlier this week, he attended a meeting chaired by Mr Rudd, chairman of pro-EU group Business for New Europe, and also attended by Business Secretary Mr Cable, Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander and Energy Secretary Mr Huhne. In the leaked email, sent yesterday, Mr Rudd, founder of PR firm Finsbury, touts for signatures for a letter from business leaders backing the Deputy Prime Minister’s position. ‘Having had an extremely productive meeting with Nick Clegg and three of his Cabinet colleagues Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne  yesterday, we are convinced now more than ever that it is necessary for business leaders to maintain public pressure on the Government to follow through on its promise to be fully engaged in the European Union following last week’s veto,’ it says. ‘We have been in touch with No 10, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, and they assure us that they would welcome this call. ‘We have drafted the following letter . which we intend to run in the Telegraph next week. It seeks to make it . crystal clear that we, as British business leaders, believe that it is . vital that the UK engages, focuses on the single market and supports the . EU’s institutions in helping the euro. ‘You will see that the letter is totally constructive and non-party political, as it must be in order to be most effective. It would be enormously helpful if you were able to add your name to it.’ The draft text of the letter says that the EU’s single market is of ‘great importance’ to the UK and accounts for more than half of the country’s trade. ‘But we must deepen and widen it, and push for reform in services, the digital arena and energy,’ it goes on. Undermined? The meeting involving Mr Clegg and his colleagues came following David Cameron's decision to veto a new EU agreement . ‘To do this we need to remain at the core of Europe, fighting for UK interests with our partners who share our desire for an open and liberal Europe. Whilst recognising that it is not desirable for the UK to join the euro, it is overwhelmingly in our interests that the currency survives, and we need to help where we can.' The Prime Minister said in the House of Commons that the UK is “supportive of the role of the [European] institutions.” That is an important starting point as we seek to find a formula that will place us firmly amongst the 27 members of the European Union as we ensure that we continue to develop the single market. ‘It is imperative that we are not outside when important decisions are taken, and as opportunities arise over the coming months for Britain to re-engage in the decision making process in Europe, we must seize them.’ Lib Dem sources said it was no secret that Mr Clegg had been talking to business people about the issue of Europe and said the entire Coalition had agreed that Britain should ‘re-engage’ with the EU following last week’s veto. Asked about Mr Rudd’s claim that he had been in touch with Downing Street, the Treasury and the Foreign Office to discuss the initiative, a Government spokesman said he was unaware of it. Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who resigned as a Parliamentary aide earlier this year after backing an EU referendum, insisted Mr Clegg should ‘disown’ Mr Rudd’s initiative. ‘The public are not in the mood for Nick Clegg to be plotting with Eurofanatics,’ he said. ‘Mr Rudd’s opinions are somewhat undermined by the fact that he has been consistently wrong on the EU for years, particularly on the merits or otherwise of the single currency.’ A recent ComRes poll for the Open Europe think tank found that 69 per cent of managers at UK finance firms support a British veto on EU financial rules even if it reduces access to the single market.The survey of 500 bosses found that 56 per cent think that, on balance, the costs of EU financial regulation currently outweigh the benefits of the single market to the City, while 31 per cent disagree. Many of Britain’s top businessmen applaud David Cameron’s boldness at last week’s euro summit.BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver, who heads one of the UK’s biggest exporters, said that David Cameron’s refusal to sign up to a new European fiscal accord was: ‘a brave thing to do and the right thing to do’. Simon Wolfson, Tory peer and chairman of high street retailer, Next, said: ‘The Prime Minister was absolutely right. There is no point in having a veto if you’re never prepared to use it. The reassurances the Prime Minister wanted were to protect one of Britain’s most valuable industries and were entirely reasonable.’ Last night a spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘I don’t see how liaising with business and asking them to say what they want to see in terms of Britain’s relationship with Europe is doing anything other than taking forward the Government’s attempt to re-engage constructively with our EU partners. Mr Rudd denied that the letter was ‘a Lib Dem thing’ and said his meeting with the four most senior members of the party was in his diary for months. He said: ‘We had a breakfast which was a longstanding arrangement. We’ve had people from all political parties to our meetings. We happened to have a meeting that I grant you turned out to be interesting timing.’ Mr Rudd also denied that the letter was pushing a Lib Dem agenda. He added: ‘The letter says clearly that this is about support for the single market, which is absolutely key to most businesses because half our trade is with the European union. It quotes the Prime Minister in the House of Commons about the possibility of using the EU institutions.

"Southampton managed to avoid their worst run in 57 years with a resounding victory against Everton. An own goal from Romelu Lukaku in the first half set Saints on their way and strikes from Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida then secured victory and halted their dramatic slide. Had they been beaten by the Merseyside club then they would have crashed to their sixth consecutive defeat, matching an unwanted run set in 1957. It was certainly a motivating factor for Ronald Koeman’s men. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Southampton 3-0 Everton .

The best medicine is to come back to playing like we did in the first part of the season.’ There was a sense of karma to the opener. Referee Jonathan Moss made several iffy calls in the first half and home fans were getting on his back, but the worst decision of the lot ended in a Southampton goal. In the 37th minute Steven Naismith delivered a terrible backpass that Shane Long intercepted, only to be clearly taken down by Everton skipper Phil Jagielka. The referee gave a corner when, in fact, the defender got none of the ball and all of the man. From the resulting set-piece, however, James Ward-Prowse sent an expertly curled ball into the six-yard box and Lukaku headed into his own net. Everton manager Roberto Martinez disagreed with the decision. ‘I felt it wasn’t a corner,’ he insisted. ‘It was never a corner. There was a debate it was a penalty, but Jagielka never saw Long and was looking at the ball. Long made the most of the contact . ‘For me it’s not a penalty or a corner. I don’t think the ref is to blame though, we are to blame for the defeat. ‘We were a little bit soft, done too easily with balls into the box. It’s disappointing the way we defended our box.’ Southampton striker Shane Long (right) vies for the ball with Everton central defender Sylvain Distin in the early stages .

Southampton striker Pelle (right) celebrates his goal with his team-mate Nathaniel Clyne during the second half . Southampton defender Yoshida salutes the St Mary's faithful after scoring their third of the game in a comfortable win . Everton have developed a nasty habit of scoring own goals at St Mary’s. Lukaku’s mishap was their third in a row, after Antolin Alcaraz and Seamus Coleman scored in their own net in Southampton’s 2-0 win in this fixture in April. It was the sort of luck a team in Southampton’s dire form needed.And yet it always looked as though Southampton would need to score at least one more to secure victory. And that moment came in the 65th minute when Pelle finished from close range. Nathaniel Clyne, in yet another brilliant performance down the right, picked out Long with a cross who headed the ball down for Pelle to poke it in. They would have gone even further ahead three minutes later had Tim Howard not pulled off an outstanding stop to deny Jose Fonte. Ward-Prowse sent in another enticing delivery from a free-kick and Fonte headed towards the right of goal, only for the Everton goalkeeper to keep it out at full stretch. But the game was put beyond doubt in the 82nd minute when Yoshida leapt to meet Steven Davis’ cross with the outside of his boot and sent the ball in via his shoulder. The manner of the last goal summed up Everton’s afternoon. Harrison Reed, 19, was handed his first Barclays Premier League start and was a terrier in front of Southampton’s back four, shouldering huge responsibility for a teenager. ‘The key to win today was to win the battles in midfield and Reed was outstanding,’ Koeman added. ‘He showed a lot of energy and you need that to play and get the best out of yourself.’","Romelu Lukaku scores first own goal to set Southampton on their way to victory against Everton .

"Alastair Cook was said to be devastated on Saturday over his sacking as one-day captain just two months before the World Cup but England insist he simply is not worth his place in the one-day team any longer. England wielded the axe in ruthless fashion on the man they have put such faith in at the end of a dismal seven-match tour of Sri Lanka where his highest score was just 34. Now they have turned to Eoin Morgan, himself in worse form than Cook during 2014, to somehow spearhead a challenge for a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand that England will start as rank outsiders. VIDEO Scroll down to see national selector James Whitaker explain Cook's omission . Alastair Cook after the defeat by Sri Lanka, his final match as England one-day captain . Cook's form was horrendous - he hadn't scored an ODI century since June 2012 . Eoin Morgan has replaced Cook as England's 50-over skipper despite his own poor form . Cook took the decision badly when Paul Downton, the managing director, and national selector James Whitaker visited his Buckinghamshire home late Friday afternoon to deliver the news. The man who was charged with leading England’s new era in the bitter fall-out of their Ashes shambles was unceremoniously dumped even though there were repeated public reassurances that he would take them to the World Cup. The scale of his feeling was revealed in the ECB’s confirmation of the news on Saturday that broke on Friday when Cook said: ‘I am gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment. That said I wish Peter Moores, Eoin Morgan and the lads all the best for the World Cup. I would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me as one-day captain.’ There was no attempt to mask the extent of the blow to Cook at Lord’s on Saturday from the men who have backed him but now sacked him. ‘Of course he’s upset,’ said Downton, who only on Monday had said he would be ‘very surprised’ if England had a new captain for the World Cup. ‘Gutted was the word he used. He had a dream to lead England at the World Cup and it’s been taken away from him a month from its fulfilment. Alastair Cook admitted he was 'gutted' to be left out of the World Cup squad . Eoin Morgan described his appointment as a 'huge honour' but has plenty of work to do . Snatching Cook's captaincy away was not a brave decision... the selectors should be red-faced . ‘He still believes he’s the right man for the job but the selectors had to make a decision in the best interests of English cricket. He’s very raw and of course it’s a blow to have the captaincy taken away from you. ‘He’s hugely, hugely disappointed but hopefully in time he will reflect that he wasn’t scoring runs and he was putting himself under an awful lot of pressure. We want him to free up his mind and focus on Test cricket which is what he does best anyway. I hope he’ll come round to thinking this is the best thing for him and English cricket and will get back to scoring centuries in Test matches.’ Downton, who has endured a turbulent first year in office at the head of England cricket, sat in on Friday’s long selection meeting but was adamant that a decision which was shocking in its timing was made only by the selectors. ‘We had to have a full discussion and weigh up current and historical form,’ said Whitaker, who made the decision on Friday with fellow selectors Mick Newell and Angus Fraser as well as coach Peter Moores. ‘Everything went into the discussion and we gave it our full attention for a number of hours. It was a long meeting but it was felt unanimously that we had to change because Alastair was no longer in the sort of form he is capable of. He wasn’t in our best 15.’ Cook looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final ODI of the series against Sri Lanka . Whitaker insisted that the selectors were happy with the presence of the man who is in effect their boss at their meeting. ‘we’re perfectly comfortable with it. I feel we’ve got a group of integral people on the selection panel who will give honest opinions regardless of whether Paul’s there or not. We speak our minds in front of him just the same as if he wasn’t there. We appreciate his input when we ask him for it.’ The statistics might suggest that Cook is no longer worth his place in the side but such has been the level of support for Cook that the timing of his one-day demise must be an acute embarrassment. Not so, says Downton. ‘Embarrassment doesn’t come into this,’ he insisted. ‘This is not about personalities. It is always about what’s best for English cricket. ‘It was very clear to my mind and others that Alastair during the Test summer was absolutely the captain to back. It’s always been more debatable in one-day cricket. It’s not about embarrassment. It’s about looking at the facts and doing what’s right, or what we hope is right. I’m not embarrassed.’ Cook plays and misses at one in Colombo during another stuttering innings . Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook . But less than a week ago you were backing Cook to the hilt? ‘My job in this role is to support our team and our captain,’ said Downton. ‘We had one game left to play when I said that and we couldn’t predict the outcome so for me to be questioning Alastair going into the last game would have been wrong. ‘But plans have to change if they’re not working and while it wasn’t my decision I completely endorse what the selectors have done because I think it gives us the best chance going into the World Cup.’ Morgan is a good friend of Kevin Pietersen and the England outcast was quick to tweet on Friday that he hoped he could play under him. But clearly there is no chance of that happening. ‘No, no, no,’ said whitaker when asked whether this move opens the door to Pietersen. ‘The ECB management made this decision in January and it is the same decision now. There is no way that Kevin Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’ Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake (right) celebrates with  Angelo Mathews after taking the wicket of Cook . And Downton added: ‘We parted company with Kevin in January because throughout the ECB management, from the dressing room up to the board, it was felt that it was the right decision to go in a slightly different direction. ‘If anything more bridges have been burnt by Kevin’s book. There is no interest from our point of view in going backwards. We’ve got an exciting group of young players and Eoin’s excited to be working with those guys. He wants to fulfil that team’s potential.’ The odds, though, have to be against Morgan breaking England’s long World Cup duck with a squad, revealed in its entirety by Saturday's Daily Mail, that includes the recalled Gary Ballance but not Ben Stokes, who was left out after his own miserable run of form. Sportsmail understands Joe Root was considered before England plumped for Morgan and Whitaker added: ‘Morgan has had captaincy experience and when he has captained England it’s generally brought the best out of him. ‘It’s our feeling that the characteristic of his leadership style coupled with his determination will help galvanise the one-day team and set a course for us through the World Cup. We help he sets a course in one-day cricket that will be very positive. He’s got a lot of qualities. His form was talked about and reviewed, as everybody’s is, but we felt he could be stimulated by this. We feel he’s the right man to take us forward.’ England supporters can only cross their fingers and hope that he is right.

The ball is still pumped urgently from front to back, fresh air is routinely preferred to green grass, and Andy Carroll’s head is the target for the booming bulk of their attacking intentions. But the side is big, muscular, well-drilled and efficient. And it is currently fourth. For the moment, at least, the fans will settle for such unusual eminence. Last night’s celebrations were suitably clamorous. ‘Bubbles’ rang out like an anthem of triumph, backs were slapped and the air was punched in exaltation. It was one more scalp of a spectacular winter. Fine goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing maintained a run which has seen just one West Ham defeat in 11 games. Sam Allardyce struck an untypically exultant note. ‘We’ve got to enjoy the moment for as long as it last,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, it will last for a good while yet.’ Then caution took over: ‘The end of January will tell us what we could possibly achieve. It’s about consistency of winning. You can’t afford to slip. But at the moment, we’re enjoying it’. And properly so.

Hamer is left grasping at thin air as Stewart Downing doubles West Ham's advantage shortly after the break . Downing salutes the Upton Park faithful after his 55th minute strike put West Ham firmly in control . Leicester had played the prettier, more precise football, but their finishing was inadequate and their physical challenge fell far short of that required of sides which come up against such a massed physical presence. Their position grows more precarious each week and, short of spectacular investment in the transfer window, survival is looking increasingly like a distant dream. In fairness, they had appeared comfortable in the opening stages, moving the ball easily and intelligently, making the half - chances, generally looking the more confident side, despite their perilous position. West Ham could offer Alex Song to counter in kind, with his own thoughtful, considered approach. Song, alongside the impressive Downing, gives them a dimension beyond the purely physical, and yesterday both men contributed richly. It was Downing who choreographed Carroll’s first chance in the 22nd minute, when he cut back a cross from the goal – line. Carroll, perhaps startled by a ball approaching less than eight feet off the ground, lifted the offering high into the stand. But his chance of redemption was presented almost immediately. Leicester were attacking with some intent when the ball was hacked out of West Ham’s area. Paul Konchesky, once a West Ham player, attempted a ludicrous back pass from half way, wide out on the touchline. Ineptly hit, the ball coasted into the path of Carroll, who strode on unopposed and casually chipped the advancing Ben Hamer.

Carroll (right) is in the thick of the action again as he competes for possession with Marcin Wasilewski . It was the kind of finish which breaks fragile hearts, and we could see Leicester’s shoulders sagging at such a self – imposed handicap. Things did not improve for Nigel Pearson’s side. In 32 minutes, Andy King was booked for a reckless tackle, and two minutes later Riyad Mahrez discovered Leicester’s best chance, snapping a fierce drive at the top corner, and seeing it instinctively parried by Adrian in the West Ham goal. Before half time, Jamie Vardy was harshly booked for flinging a tackle at Song. Without ever looking truly convincing, West Ham found themselves in command at the interval, while Leicester, for all the shrewd subtleties of Esteban Cambiasso, had supplied a good many reasons for their present predicament. But the tone was raised by a tremendous goal in 56 minutes. The prologue was familiar, with yet another ball pumped high to the edge of the Leicester area and Diafra Sako winning the header. It fell to Downing, 20 yards out, and he glanced up, arranged his feet and curved a measured drive beyond Hamer. It was, by some distance, the most elegantly effective manoeuvre of the match.

You need your big players to perform and what’s disappointing is too many players are not performing anywhere near the level they need to be.’ Bruce also bemoaned the fact that key players have been missing. On Saturday they included the injured Michael Dawson and Mohamed Diame, while Tom Huddlestone was suspended. Swansea manager Garry Monk praised his team’s ‘committment and effort’ and said: ‘We deserved to win.’ He made seven changes to the team which lost at home to Tottenham last week and knew he risked criticism if such wholesale alterations backfired, especially as he dropped Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony to the bench. ‘I trust the squad and that’s what it’s there for,’ he said, adding that the crowded fixture list and Bony’s upcoming absence at the Africa Cup of Nations was on his mind. Hence an opportunity for Bafi Gomis. Monk will also be missing Ki in January as he captains South Korea at the Asian Cup. Monk lauded his ‘fantastic’ contribution and said ‘He is a big player for us.’ He also added, with a smile, that Ki and Shelvey were both claiming the goal.

"Manchester City cruised to a 3-0 over Crystal Palace as Manuel Pellegrini's side maintained the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea. David Silva's double and Yaya Toure's powerful strike ensured the home side secured all three points from their clash with the Eagles. Sportsmail's Adam Crafton rated the players' performances at Etihad Stadium. Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Joe Hart  6 . Little to do and it's now five clean sheets in six games for the England goalkeeper. Pablo Zabaleta 6.5 . Had some tricky moments dealing with Bolasie but overlapping runs and that infectious attitude made a difference in attack for City. Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta reacts after he missed an early chance at the Etihad . Martin Demichelis 6 . Holding the defence together in the absence of captain Vincent Kompany. Classy on the ball and calm in the tackle. Eliaquim Mangala 6 . The Frenchman is improving after a difficult start and is beginning to resemble a £32m defender. Aleksandar Kolarov 6.5 . Not the best defender but a superior attacking outlet to Clichy going forward. Whipped cross created Silva's second goal. Yaya Toure (right) competes for possession in the air with Crystal Palace's James McArthur . Yaya Toure 7 . Blazed over on two occasions when presented with good opportunities but a controlling presence as City coasted through the second period. Glorious third after a classic burst from the midfield. Fernandinho 6 . Usual dynamic presence in midfield and looks back to his best. Jesus Navas 5 . Frustrating to watch. Lightning quick, finds himself in good positions but often lacks an end product. James Milner (right) takes on Palace's Joe Ledley as City begin to assert their authority in the contest . David Silva 8 . Stood up to be counted in the absence of City's usual marksmen. A wonderful footballer and after hitting his third and fourth goals of the season, he should be aiming for 10 from this campaign. Samir Nasri 7.5 . In the best form of his Manchester City career and his understanding with Silva seems telepathic at times. Some lovely turns and intricate passing around the penalty area. James Milner 7 . Ran himself into the ground, as you'd expect, and did a good job in the circumstances. He will, however, be looking forward to returning to midfield duty soon.

Played the final ten minutes with the result secured. Will have a big role to play over the Christmas period. Sinclair (Nasri, 88) 5.5 . Rare outing late on. Crystal Palace (4-3-3) Julian Speroni 5.5 . Helpless for the three City goals but otherwise barely tested. Martin Kelly 5 . Struggled to handle Kolarov's overlaps but might have wished for greater help from those in front of him. Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni had a busy day guarding the visitors' goal . Brede Hangeland 5.5 . Had the beating of Milner in the air but encountered greater problems when Toure, Silva and Nasri moved ball sharply around the penalty area. Scott Dann 6 . Unfortunate deflection led to Silva's first goal but otherwise a combative performance at centre-half. Joel Ward 5 . Won't be the first - or last - but Ward found it tough going against the relentless Zabaleta. More comfortable dealing with Navas.

Reads the game well and anchored the midfield with authority, providing a platform for Palace to counter. James McArthur 5.5 . Positionally good, ran hard but seemed to lose belief after City went 2-0 up. Joe Ledley 5 . Overwhelmed by the power and pace of Fernandinho and Toure. A difficult day for the midfielder. McArthur shoots at goal but is thwarted by Joe Hart and was also unlucky to have a goal ruled out . Jason Puncheon 5.5 . Didn't do enough to influence the game in an attacking sense and could have done more to stop Kolarov's forays forward. Fraizer Campbell 5 .

"For all of James Milner’s qualities — smart movement, a neat first touch and the stamina of a long-distance runner — he is without a Premier League goal in a year. Milner has featured in 30 top-flight fixtures since he last found the net in a 4-2 win at Fulham 365 days ago. It is, therefore, testament to the esteem that he is held in by Manuel Pellegrini that he was trusted to lead the line amid a spate of injuries that have decimated Manchester City’s strike force, with Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all out of contention. James Milner struggled up front by himself for Manchester City against Crystal Palace on Saturday . Milner (right) outjumps Brede Hangeland as he wins a header during the match on Saturday . Sergio Aguero is out injured for City right now and they are having to find goals from elsewhere . City, for their part, do not view it as the crisis that others might. Jovetic will be fit sooner rather than later, and the club have no intention of recalling their most promising young forwards Marcos Lopes and Devante Cole from Lille or Barnsley respectively. It must also be taken in the context of a resurgent run that has seen City win eight wins in a row and draw level with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. City see little benefit in disrupting the fine progress that two of their most talented young forwards are making elsewhere for the sake of the short-term and Pellegrini is relaxed about the prospect of fielding Milner at the tip of his team. ‘I picked Milner there because he is a player who works really hard, creates a lot of movement and spaces,’ Pellegini explained after the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace.

The England international (right) holds off the challenge of Palace's Scott Dann . In James Milner, Pellegrini knew he had the perfect sacrificial lamb. A quick brainstorm reveals that Milner has now played up to seven positions in a Manchester City shirt - in both full-back positions, across the midfield, behind the frontman and now as an old-fashioned No 9. It would be an exaggeration to say that the Milner plan was bulletproof and in truth, it is an experiment that did not entirely convince in a first-half in which a direct Palace side provoked anxiety among the Etihad crowd.

"Radamel Falcao clinched a 1-1 draw for Manchester United as 10-man Aston Villa ended their winning run. The Colombian scored just his second United goal, cancelling out Christian Benteke's beautiful opener for the hosts. Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell rated the players' performances at Villa Park. Aston Villa (3-5-2) Guzan 7 . Alert to tip wide Young cross that would have flown into far corner and good save from Van Persie . Okore 7 . Another composed display from the 22-year-old, who was asked to collect the ball from his goalkeeper to spark attacks . Vlaar 7 . Imperious at heart of Villa’s defence for the most part, physically dominating his Dutch colleague Van Persie . Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao equalised with a thumping header against Aston Villa . Clark 7 . Growing in importance to this team each week, strong, sensible and calm . Lowton 6 . Unbalanced by Young’s movement for Falcao goal and unable to make amends to stop cross, but decent overall . Weimann 6 . Deployed deeper than usual, in midfield, and added energy, particularly in the first half . Sanchez 6 . Effective at breaking up United’s play and provided a steadying influence when Villa rocked slightly . Michael Carrick started the game in defence but was moved back into midfield at half-time . Delph 7 . Crunching tackle on Van Persie to announce his intentions and was an effervescent presence . Cissokho 6 . Provided an outlet on the left but too often cut back rather than cross first time . Benteke 7.5 . Took his goal superbly, with a shuffle to find space and clinical shot. Almost got a second with a powerful header . Agbonlahor 6.5 . Gave Villa pace to trouble United before becoming victim of incredibly harsh red card for his strong tackle on Young . Subs . N’Zogbia (for Weimann 80) 6, Bacuna 6 (for Cissokho 80) Both contributed late on and Bacuna almost won it with stunning shot that whistled over. United showed theit attacking instincts by playing Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao . Manchester United 3-5-2 . De Gea 7 . No chance with Benteke’s goal and produced his customary excellent save from the Belgian’s second-half header . Jones 6.5 . Competed physically with Benteke in the air but dallied on ball in second half to concede an opening . Carrick 7 . Classy in central defence, moved to midfield at half-time to provide a platform for United attacks . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke scored a wonderful goal and was a constant threat . Evans 6 . Allowed Benteke too much room for his goal but recovered and marshaled defence from the central position in second half . Valencia 6 . Willing as ever but unable to repeat his high tempo from the Liverpool game . Mata 5.5 . One of his outings where it was difficult to see how he contributed, aside for a few shots from range . Fletcher 5 . Struggled to impose himself to any great degree and was understandably replaced at half-time . Rooney 7 . United’s best player, pulling strings from midfield with floated passes to the wings and sharp balls into the strikers . Gabby Agbonlahor was controversially sent off after a 50-50 challenge with Ashley Young . Young 6.5 . Villain-in-chief as far as Villa fans were concerned, staying down after Agbonlahor’s tackle, but perfect cross for Falcao goal . Falcao 6.5 . Hardly touched the ball for long periods but provided a finishing touch with his forehead when required . Van Persie 6 . A couple of efforts and adept link-up play but should have done better when fed by Rooney inside the area . Angel di Maria returned for Manchester United after missing three games because of a hamstring injury . Subs . Blackett 6.5 (for Fletcher 46), Di Maria 6 (for Van Persie 62), Wilson 5 (for Valencia 74) Blackett’s arrival freed United in an attacking sense, Di Maria added a threat, Wilson some legs .

"Gareth Bale completed an extraordinary hat-trick of cup final goals to help earn Real Madrid the crown of World Club Champions ending an incredible year of success for the Welsh international and his team-mates. He also scored in the European Cup and the Spanish Cup finals in 2014. Bale ran onto an Isco pass six minutes into the second half and fired low under the diving body of San Lorenzo keeper Sebastian Torrico to double Real Madrid’s lead. Sergio Ramos had crashed a header home in the first half from a Toni Kroos corner to put Madrid in front. It was the same combination that got them to the Club World Cup in the first place. In Lisbon last May Ramos’ injury time header equalised the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid and Bale scored in extra-time to finally put Carlo Ancelotti’s side ahead.

Here they were in Marrakech rounding off what many have called Real Madrid’s best ever year – for the first time in their 112-year history they have won four trophies in a calendar year. Iker Casillas, playing his 700th competitive game for the club, lifted the trophy. He has now won every major honour in club and international football. Goal-hero Ramos was voted man of the match but there were many candidates with his central defensive partner Pepe also outstanding and Toni Kroos superb in midfield. It was his corner that Ramos headed in on 37 minutes. San Lorenzo had taken the physical approach early on with Mario Yepes booked for flattening Bale. The former Tottenham man was also wrestled to the ground from the previous corner. San Lorenzo finished up with just four bookings from lenient referee Walter Lopez but their strong-arm tactics were not enough to prevent Madrid picking up their 22nd straight victory. Karim Benzema’s shirt was ripped at the collar and almost pulled from his torso during the second half as he went for a Bale cross. For once both the French striker and Ronaldo failed to find the net but Bale’s second half strike made sure there was no way back for San Lorenzo. Carlo Ancelotti has now won more trophies in 16 months than Jose Mourinho in three years. English coach Paul Clement was, as ever, by his side, and there were a few special words for the Londoner from club president Florentino Perez as he congratulated each Real Madrid player and coaching-staff member as they received their medals. Ronaldo appeared to snub Michel Platini as he walked down the line of dignitaries. The Frenchman’s recent comments that he believes a German player should win the Ballon d’Or have evidently not gone down well with Real Madrid’s record-breaking forward. It remains to be seen if Ronaldo is voted best individual player of 2014 at January’s Ballon d’Or gala but what is no longer in any doubt is that Real Madrid are team of the year. 'It’s incredible, unforgettable' beamed jubilant coach Carlo Ancelotti on the final whistle. 'We are delighted to end the year this way but we have to keep going because we know the season does not end here. We want 2015 to be like 2014.'
