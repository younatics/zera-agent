But despite his 'conceptual' style and the fact, more importantly, that he is a capuchin monkey, there still appears to be a market for the work of animal artist 'Pockets Warhol'. The white-capped capuchin uses his tail, hands, feet, and of course, a brush, to daub canvases with his own unique artistic stylings at Story Book Farm, a primate sanctuary in Canada. Artistic flair: Pockets Warhol is offered the tools of his trade by a keeper at the primate sanctuary, where his artistic offerings apparently fetch up to £250 . Lifelong hobby: Pockets Warhol's love affair with painting began when his keeper gave him children's paint to keep him occupied . Amazingly, Pockets Warhol has become a money-spinning machine for bosses at the home for primates, with his paintings selling for as much as £250 each. The teenage monkey was introduced to painting a year ago when one of Story Book's volunteers, Charmaine Quinn gave him non-toxic children's paint to experiment with in order to keep him occupied. Conceptual: An example of one of Pockets Warhol's interesting creations, which he paints with his tail, feet and hands . Aping art: Pockets Warhol is said to be a temperamental artist, as he sometimes ends up eating the paint . Monkey masterpiece: Sherri Delaney, founder of Story Book Farm primate sanctuary in Canada, poses with one of Pockets Warhol's works . She said: 'Pockets has always been very playful so he really took to painting, however, he does have an artistic temperament and can lack concentration, sometimes preferring to eat the paint.' Bosses at the zoo claim Pockets Warhol's work has been sold to buyers in Europe and Israel for 'hundreds of dollars'. All the money Pockets earns from the sales of his paintings will help fund a new barn for the sanctuary. The talented monkey is having an art show where 40 of his paintings will be displayed in Sadie's Diner and Juice Bar on Adelaide Street for the next two months.","Painting primate is the star of animal sanctuary .

Considered: Four-star general David Petraeus almost resigned as Afghanistan war commander over Obama's decision to draw down surge forces, a new book claims . Four-star general-turned-CIA director David Petraeus almost resigned as Afghanistan war commander over President Barack Obama's decision to quickly draw down surge forces, according to a new insider's look at Petraeus' 37-year Army career. But Petraeus decided that resigning would be a 'selfish, grandstanding move with huge political ramifications' and that it was instead 'time to salute and carry on'. The revelation comes in Paula Broadwell's book All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, which traces his career from West Point to his command of two wars deemed unwinnable: Iraq and Afghanistan. Co-authored with The Washington Post's Vernon Loeb, it is part history lesson through Petraeus' eyes, part hagiography and part defence of the counterinsurgency strategy he applied in both wars. Critics of counterinsurgency argue the strategy has not yet proved a success, with violence spiking in Iraq after the departure of U.S. troops, and Afghan local forces deemed ill-prepared to take over by the 2014 deadline. The book unapologetically casts Petraeus in the hero's role, as in this description of the Afghanistan campaign: 'There was a new strategic force released on Kabul: Petraeus' will.' Broadwell acknowledges that Petraeus rubbed people up the wrong way. She said: 'His critics fault him for ambition and self-promotion. But his energy, optimism and will to win stand out more for me.' The book is also peppered with Petraeus quotes that sound like olive branches meant to soothe Obama aides who feared he would challenge their boss for the White House. Broadwell wrote of Petraeus' Senate testimony on the Afghan war: 'Petraeus tried to make clear that he and Obama were in synch'. The book describes Petraeus' frustration at still being labelled an outsider from the Obama administration, even as he retired from the military at Obama's request before taking the job last summer as the CIA's 20th director. Unease: General David Petraeus (right) is said to have been frustrated at being labeled an outsider from President Barack Obama's (left) administration, . It depicts Petraeus' rise at an unrelenting, near-superhuman pace. He started his career as a fiercely competitive West Point cadet known as 'Peaches', where he famously wooed the school superintendent's daughter, Holly Knowlton. He went on to command the 101st Airborne Division as part of the invasion of Iraq, then masterminded the rewrite of the Army and Marine Corps' counterinsurgency training manual before returning to command the surge in Baghdad. He was then appointed to head Central Command, overseeing the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as military affairs across much of the Gulf and the Middle East. Pivotal: Petraeus was an influential figure in U.S. strategy during his time as a General of a Task Force in Afghanistan . He accepted a cut in authority and pay to lead the Afghanistan war campaign when Gen Stanley McChrystal was forced to resign. A Rolling Stone article caricatured him and his aides as testosterone-addled frat boys as they insulted Obama and other officials. Broadwell described how Petraeus' first act was to lift McChrystal's restrictions on the use of force - especially on airstrikes - if civilians were nearby. He told his staff: 'There is no question about our commitment to reducing civilian loss of life.' But he added there was a 'clear moral imperative to make sure we are fully supporting our troops in combat.' Broadwell added that the problem, according to Petraeus, was less McChrystal's order than how it was even more strictly re-interpreted by lower commanders. Fault: Petraeus said Gen Stanley McChrystal (pictured) overpromised and underdelivered in certain aspects of the Afghan conflict . In the account, Petraeus also faults McChrystal for overpromising and underdelivering in places like Taliban-riddled Marjah in the south, producing months of embarrassing headlines that hurt the war effort back in Washington. But the book also includes Petraeus' own Rolling Stone-esque moment, when he was quoted badmouthing the White House in Bob Woodward's latest book Obama's Wars. A frustrated Petraeus is described as telling his inner circle, on a flight after a glass of wine, that 'the administration was (expletive) with the wrong guy'. Broadwell wrote: 'Petraeus later expressed his displeasure to all of them for betraying his confidence. But he knew he was ultimately responsible for making the intemperate remark.' He also concedes the Afghan war is not yet won. Broadwell wrote: 'He had wanted to hand (Marine Corps Gen. John) Allen ... a war that had taken a decisive turn. He knew that, despite the hard-fought progress, that wasn't yet the case.' Yet that admission also presents a get-out clause when combined with the book's account that he considered resigning over the rapid drawdown of troops, neatly removing Petraeus from responsibility if the war goes wrong. And the account does nothing to puncture the mythology his troops built up around him, something an early mentor, retired Gen Jack Galvin, told Petraeus to embrace. Galvin said in an interview with Broadwell: 'They want you to be bigger than you are, so they magnify you. Live up to it all with the highest standards of integrity. You become part of a legend.'","Petraeus didn't agree with Obama's decision to quickly reduce troop numbers .

At first glance, this picturesque Welsh manor house appears to have little in common with the grand mansion featured in Downton Abbey. But according to historian Rev Geraint Hughes, Penybont Hall in Powys is the building that inspired writer Julian Fellowes to create his hit television show. For Mr Hughes has revealed that the house once employed Oscar winner's family as servants. At that time it was far larger boosting a further 60 rooms. It was only downsized to its present size after the owner demolished an entire wing to save money. As it stands today: The manor house is half of its original size after an entire wing was demolished to save money and make it a more manageable size . As grand as Downton: Penybont Hall as it stood in 1885 after it had been extended adding a further 60 rooms . Highclere Castle which is used as the backdrop for the TV series. Historian Rev Geraint Hughes said: 'It is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the Hall and what is shown on Downton Abbey.' The manor house once employed the family of Downton Abbey series writer Julian Fellowes (right) as household servants . But back in the 1800s when Lord . Fellowes' relatives worked on the mid-Wales estate Penybont Hall was the . hub of the wealthy and well-heeled. Rev Hughes has revealed that in 1875 Lord Fellowes great-grandfather, Pat Mackintosh, worked for landowner John Percy Severn. Downton's Earl of Grantham is . believed to be based on Mr Severn who was a wealthy director of two . railway companies as well as the owner of Penybont Hall. It was during this period that the . buildling was given a massive makeover and the building was extended . with a further 60 rooms being added. Rev Hughes said: 'The son of John Severn, Percy had very grand ideas and he wanted to extend the buildings. 'He had great plans for expanding it and they built on it far more than they ever needed. 'Percy made considerable changes to the house soon after his father's death in 1885.' Setting the scene: In the hit TV series, Downton Abbey provides a grand backdrop for the drama centered around the Grantham family . Sophie McShera who plays housemaid Daisy Robinson in the series. Historian Jennifer Newby said the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers. But some 30 years later after the . house had been sold to a former Army general the extensions were . reversed to become a 32-room building. Rev Hughes isn't sure when this took place but placed it between 1907 and 1926. 'The servants in the programme are . far too clean. The reality would have been a lot more grubby, I don't . think people realise the servants stank' He said: 'The general's wife was widowed and it was too much for her to take on. 'It is a lovely building and much of what you see in Downton Abbey reflected life at Penybont Hall. 'The Severns were wealthy landowners and were very much at the heart of the local community. 'It is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the Hall and what is shown on Downton Abbey.' However, despite the plaudits the . series has received some experts are critical that the series is not as . true to the past as it could be. Historian Jennifer Newby said the image of life at Downton Abbey is completely wrong and 'infuriating to watch'. She claims the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers. 'I find it infuriating to watch, it sets my teeth on edge,' she said. 'The relationship they have with their employers is totally wrong.' Viewers who watched the Christmas Day . special saw members of the aristocratic Crawley family support valet . John Bates and his wife, housemaid Anna, during his trial and eventual . conviction for his first wife's murder. The Crawleys also hosted a dance . for the servants. The two-hour episode ended with Matthew Crawley finally going down on one knee and proposing to Lady Mary. Ms Newby, the editor of Family . History magazine and author of a new book called Women's Lives, has read . hundreds of letters and diaries kept by people who worked in service . and the families they worked for. 'There was one butler who said that . even if in a moment of weakness an employer could ask for advice they . wouldn't give it because it could be held against them,' she said. 'The servants in the programme are . far too clean. The reality would have been a lot more grubby, I don't . think people realise the servants stank. Gun enthusiast and former editor of . the Shooting Times, Tony Jackson, also picked out inaccuracies with . clothes during the Christmas special. Mr Jackson, 74, said the show was 'full of errors', especially the scene involving the game shoot. 'The scene is supposed to depict a shooting party in 1919-20, but they are dressed as though they are in the 1890s,' he said. 'It is full of errors. Why on earth didn't they do their research properly and get it right.' Mr Jackson, who has published several . books on shooting, added: 'The guns are wearing leather gaiters - an . item of clothing that would not have been work during the Twenties. 'All would have worn stockings, plus . fours and possibility light-coloured spats. The only people who would . have worn gaiters would have been the hired help.'",'It is a lovely building and much of what you see in Downton Abbey reflected life at Penybont Hall'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:22 PM on 28th December 2011 . The trial of Hosni Mubarak resumed today after a three month break with the ousted Egyptian leader returning to the metal defendants' cage in a Cairo courtroom. Egyptian state television showed the 83-year-old covered by a green blanket and lying on a hospital gurney when he was brought from a helicopter and taken to an ambulance for the short ride to the courthouse. He remained on the gurney throughout the hearing and spoke only once to say 'present' when Judge Ahmed Rifaat called out his name at the start of the session. Appearance: Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was wheeled into court today, like he was in this picture in September, to continue with his trial which had been delayed for three months . Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising in January and February that forced him out of office. He could face the death penalty if convicted. He has been under arrest since April, but he has never gone to prison and instead has been confined to hospitals. His lawyers and doctors say he is suffering from heart problems. Mubarak and his two sons, who are in prison, also face corruption charges in the same case. Today's session lasted for only a few hours, and the next session is set for January 2. An 18-day uprising forced Mubarak to step down on February 11 after 29 years in power. Protests and unrest have continued throughout the year, with pro-democracy activists keeping up pressure for reforms from the military, which took over from Mubarak. Unrest: Protests have continued since Mubarak was ousted from power in February, with pro-democracy activists keeping up pressure for reforms from the military which took over . Clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people since Mubarak's was ousted. Judge Rifaat approved new requests from defence lawyers to expand the case to include other incidents of violence and deaths of protesters since Mubarak's ousting. Mubarak's lawyers argued the killing of protesters continued even after he stepped down and asked for this to be considered evidence that he was not responsible for the killings. The requests appeared to be part of a strategy to try to show that protesters were not killed by security forces, but  by assailants working for a foreign nation or criminals impersonating police officers. One request the judge granted was for the Interior Ministry to provide the court with a list of firearm and ammunition stores looted during the early days of the anti-Mubarak uprising, as well as the type of weapons taken. He said he would also demand a list of stores that sell military and police uniforms and were looted during the same period. Riots: Clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people since Mubarak was ousted . Rifaat also agreed to ask authorities for the police reports on vehicles stolen from the force during the uprising and details about foreigners arrested in Egypt during the same period for involvement in unlawful acts. Relations between the mostly youthful activists and the nation's military rulers have steadily worsened over the past few months, hitting a new low this month when soldiers brutally beat and stomped on protesters, including women, in clashes that left at least 18 people dead. Mubarak's trial began in August, and many in the country were riveted by the sight of the longtime authoritarian ruler lying on a hospital bed inside the defendant's cage, flanked by his two sons, who formerly wielded tremendous power. During early sessions, the trial was bogged down by frequent commotion and arguments in the courtroom between lawyers representing both sides. Eventually, the judge banned the media as he summoned high-ranking officials to testify. The prosecution's case depends heavily on accounts of members of the former president's inner circle including ex-spy chief Omar Suleiman, who was appointed vice president by Mubarak during the uprising . In September, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, the head of Egypt's ruling military council and Mubarak's defence minister for some 20 years, testified under a total media blackout. Journalists were barred from the court and forbidden to report any leaked details of his testimony. Many believe Tantawi can address the key question of whether Mubarak ordered the use of lethal force against protesters, or at least knew about it and did nottry to stop it. Reporters were allowed in the courtroom today, but live TV coverage was banned. Also on trial with Mubarak and facing the same charges are his former Interior Minister, Habib el-Adly, and six senior former security officials. Mubarak and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, also face corruption charges. The prosecution's case depends heavily on accounts of members of the former president's inner circle including ex-spy chief Omar Suleiman, who was appointed vice president by Mubarak during the uprising.","Mubarak charged with complicity of killing 800 .

Christa Dias, a former teacher at Holy Family and St. Lawrence Catholic schools in Cincinnati, Ohio, claims she was fired for becoming pregnant using artificial insemination. Ms Dias was fired in October 2010 when, at five and a half months pregnant, she approached her employer about maternity leave options. Bound by contract: Christa Dias, 32, was fired because she got pregnant via artificial insemination . The schools initially fired Ms Dias, 32, for being single and pregnant, Cincinnati.com reports. When the schools discovered that violated several federal and state anti-discrimination laws, they said she was fired because she became pregnant using artificial insemination. That, the school said, was in direct violation of her contract. ‘She has a right to her opinion, but she doesn’t have a right to violate her (employment) contract,’ Archdiocese of Cincinnati spokesman Dan Andriacco told the website. The contract Ms Dias signed called for employees to adhere to Catholic social teachings, including the avowal that having a child without a husband and out of wedlock is a ‘grave immoral’ act. Ms Dias is still unemployed and now has a ten-month-old daughter for which to care. Her case against the schools is on hold in the U.S. District Course in Cincinnati as the Supreme Court rules on a similar case. 'I'm disappointed more than anything that I couldn't continue my career because I wanted a child.' -Christa Dias . Ms Dias, formerly of Michigan, began teaching in the Cincinnati schools in 2007 after graduating from Notre Dame College in South Euclid, Ohio, on a volleyball scholarship. She began teaching at Holy Family in 2008 and at St Lawrence a year later. She served as the technology coordinator at each school and earned a collective salary of around $36,000. The Enquirer says that while she is not Catholic, she is a practising Christian. ‘I’m disappointed more than anything that I couldn’t continue my career because I wanted a child,’ the former teacher told Cincinnati.com. According to her attorney, both schools have admitted ‘they had no other reason to terminate Ms Dias’ employment’ aside from her controversial pregnancy. Place of education: Ms Dias taught at St. Lawrence schools in East Price Hill, Ohio until she was fired in October 2010 . Ms Dias said she is suing because, according to her, the school holds a double-standard. Men who participate in artificial insemination don’t have the tell-tale signs of pregnancy, she said, but the fact that it isn’t enforced is much of the problem. The schools attorneys said the case is all about Ms Dias violating her contract. They said any argument besides that would ‘unavoidably put (Catholic) doctrine itself on trial.’ '(My daughter is) an amazing gift from God. She's amazing and wonderful. I would do it all over again for her.' -Christa Dias . However, per the U.S. Constitution, Americans have the right to practise their religion of choice. Reverend James Kiffermeyer, who was himself suspended in 2002 after being accused of sexual misconduct, fired Ms Dias. The Archdiocese made a financial settlement with one accuser, while the Vatican reviewed the cases and didn’t discipline Mr Kiffermeyer. Both men were over 18 at the time. He was reinstated in 2006 and became pastor at Holy Family church. Legal dealings aside, Ms Dias said she is happy to have a young life to care for and still believes she made the right decision. ‘She’s an amazing gift from God,’ she said of her daughter. ‘She’s amazing and wonderful. I would do it all over again for her.’","Christa Dias, 32, fired after asking for maternity leave while five months pregnant .

The Stuxnet virus that last year damaged Iran¿s nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform whose roots trace back to 2007, according to new research from Russian computer security firm Kaspersky Lab . Online security experts Kaspersky Labs say that three hi-tech cyber weapons of the sort that damaged Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant may have been crafted in the same laboratory - and not yet released. The viruses have never been seen 'in the wild' - and it's unclear whether they, like Stuxnet, would be built to cause failures at nuclear plants, or engineered for another purpose. Security experts have detected the malicious software by 'keys' in Stuxnet itself, which appear to be looking for other 'family members' to communicate with. Duqu - a 'trojan horse' program related to Stuxnet which was detected in industrial systems earlier this year, also searches for Stuxnet and Duqu-infected machines. Duqu is designed to steal information which could be used in cyber attacks on industrial control systems. It's a 'scout' program that could be used in preparation for a crippling cyber attack. Both appear to be searching for three other 'relatives' that have never yet been found. The Stuxnet virus that last year damaged Iran’s nuclear program was likely one of at least five cyber weapons developed on a single platform whose roots trace back to 2007, according to new research from Russian computer security firm Kaspersky Lab. Iran described Stuxnet - designed to cripple control systems in the nuclear plant - as 'lethal'. Security experts widely believe that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, though the two nations have officially declined to comment on the matter. A Pentagon spokesman on Wednesday declined comment on Kaspersky’s research, which did not address who was behind Stuxnet. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, center, visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility some 200 miles (322 kilometers) south of the capital, Tehran, Iran . Stuxnet has already been linked to another virus, the Duqu data-stealing trojan, but Kaspersky’s research suggests the cyber weapons program that targeted Iran may be far more sophisticated than previously known. Kaspersky’s director of global research & analysis, Costin Raiu, said that his team has gathered evidence that shows the same platform that was used to build Stuxnet and Duqu was also used to create at least three other pieces of malware. Raiu said the platform is comprised of a group of compatible software modules designed to fit together, each with different functions. 'It’s like a Lego set. You can assemble the components into anything: a robot or a house or a tank,' he said. More and more industrial equipment is connected to the internet - rendering it vulnerable to attacks by hackersKaspersky named the platform 'Tilded' after computer symbols appearing in file names. Researchers with Kaspersky have not found any new types of malware built on the Tilded platform, Raiu said, but they are fairly certain that they exist because shared components of Stuxnet and Duqu appear to be searching for their kin. When a machine becomes infected with Duqu or Stuxnet, the programs search for two unique registry keys on the PC linked to Duqu and Stuxnet that are then used to load the main piece of malware onto the computer, he said. The nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, which was the target of the Stuxnet worm. The Duqu worm is similar but is designed to steal information rather than cause physical damage . Kaspersky recently discovered new shared components that search for at least three other unique registry keys, which suggests that the developers of Stuxnet and Duqu also built at least three other pieces of malware using the same platform, he added. Yet it would be relatively easy for the developers of those highly sophisticated viruses to create other weapons that can evade detection by those anti-virus programs by the modules in the Tilded platform, he said. Kaspersky believes that Tilded traces back to at least 2007 because specific code installed by Duqu was compiled from a device running a Windows operating system on Aug. 31, 2007. The 'Stuxnet' worm - a sophisticated cyber attack on the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran opened a new era of cyber-warfare. Duqu, detected in Europe, may well be from the 'same authors' says security firm Symantec . The Stuxnet attack on Iran's Bushehr . nuclear plant - a computer 'worm' specifically written to attack . industrial control systems - was proof that the software in many . industrial plants was vulnerable to attack. Since . then, there has been increased interest in the idea - both from . researchers, and from potential attackers. Relatively . unsophisticated 'computers' used to control industrial devices are . 'open' to the internet - leaving plants such as Busehr vulnerable to . attack. In theory, many plants - including utilities such as water and gas - are open to such attacks. Earlier . this month, suspicions were raised about a remote attack on a water . plant in America - but it proved to be an engineer accessing his work . remotely. But governments, . including Britain's, are trying desperately to shield vulnerable . utilities before someone deploys the next cyber weapon.","Cyber weapons designed to attack industrial plants .

He slipped the letters into trolleys and baskets, wishing  customers a merry Christmas before moving swiftly on. But the envelopes weren’t filled with vouchers or adverts – they each contained a £50 note. Generous gesture: A mystery man stunned shoppers in a Devonshire supermarket when handed out wads of £50 notes with this note attached . One lucky shopper at the Tesco store in . Sampford Peverell, Devon, said yesterday that the envelopes also held a . letter, with the following message: ‘Happy Christmas. I have recently . been fortunate enough to have come into quite a lot of money – more than . I need for myself and my family. So I thought that I would share some . of it with other people – the £50 enclosed is for you. ‘I hope this enables you to have a little extra cheer this Christmas. You do not have to do anything other than spend the money – and it is . real, there is no trick, no hidden cameras or catch. Just have a happy . Christmas.’ The recipient, a retired teacher, said that after leaving the store he . took the cash to the bank, where staff confirmed it was a genuine . banknote. ‘The man just smiled, wished us a merry Christmas and was on his way,’ he said. ‘I am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it’s such an incredible . gesture.’ He admitted that he and his wife nearly threw the blank . envelope away. ‘I’m glad we didn’t,’ he added. Luke Davies, the supermarket’s manager, said the grey-haired mystery . benefactor had made quite an impression. ‘Several customers have . mentioned him,’ he said. ‘I don’t know why he would do it, but if it’s what it appears to be it’s a very generous thing to do.’ The grey-haired benefactor, whose identity is unknown, handed out the cash in Tesco in Tiverton shortly before Christmas . Logo: Never has Tesco's 'Every little helps' mantra proved so appropriate . One elderly couple, who even took the . note to a bank to get it authenticated, couldn't believe the man's generosity. The husband, who is in his eighties, said: 'He just smiled, wished us a merry Christmas and was on his way. 'I am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it’s such an incredible gesture. 'The envelope was blank and we nearly threw it away, but I am glad we didn’t. It was such a fantastic gesture. 'You don’t really expect supermarket shopping in the run-up to Christmas to be such a wonderful experience.' His wife, who is in her seventies, added: 'We are hugely grateful to this man for such a lovely gift. 'It’s not just about the money, it . just made us feel that there are people out there who are genuinely good . and selfless, and realise there is more to life than money. 'We couldn’t think of any other way of contacting him other than to do it through the press.' Do you know who the mystery benefactor is?

Illinois-based Mead Johnson says another batch of tests done on its Enfamil Premium Newborn infant formula found no trace of the bacteria tied to the death of a Missouri baby. Preliminary hospital tests indicated 10-day-old Avery Cornett died December 18 of a rare infection caused by bacteria known as Cronobacter sakazakii. The source of the bacteria hasn't been determined, but it can be found in powdered formula. Avery had consumed Enfamil Newborn formula. Little victim: Ten-day-old Avery Cornett from Missouri, here with his big sister Audrey, from a rare infection after consuming the milk Enfamil . Avery from Lebanon, Missouri, had appeared to suffer from an upset stomach before he died. The Lebanon Daily Record reported that . Avery was taken to St. John's Hospital-Lebanon late last week after . appearing lethargic and displaying what his family said were signs of a . stomach ache. He was later moved to St. John's . Hospital-Springfield, and preliminary tests showed that he had . contracted a rare bacterial infection, Cronobacter sakazakii, the . newspaper reported. He died Sunday after being removed from life support. National retailers including Walgreen,Kroger and Safeway pulled the powdered infant formula from their shelves. Wal-Mart pulled the batch of . powdered baby milk from more than 3,000 of its stores across the U.S,  even . though the manufacturer claims the batch tested negative for the . bacterium before being distributed. But after investigation,The Food and Drug Administration, the . Centers for Disease Control and the Missouri Department of Health found no trace of the bacteria. Cautionary action: Wal-Mart decided to withdraw the product pending an investigation into Avery's death. Here is the Missouri store where Avery's formula was purchased . Public health investigators will also . look at environmental factors, such as the water used in preparing the . powdered formula, and at anything else the baby might have ingested. A spokesman for Mead Johnson Nutrition, . which produces the formula, said: 'One of the things every batch of . product is tested for is Cronobacter. We went back and checked on the . batch in question, and it had tested negative for Cronobacter.' The government did not ordered a recall of the 12.5-ounce cans of Enfamil Newborn powder with the lot number ZP1K7G. Worrying symptoms: Avery was taken to the hospital when he appeared lethargic and appeared to have an upset stomach . Defence: A spokesman for the company that makes the formula said all products are tested for Cronobacter, and follow up tests on the batch fed to Avery tested negative . The Missouri Department of Health . advises parents to follow World Health Organization guidelines for . safely preparing powdered infant formula, Terlizzi said. 'This includes washing your hands . with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in . hot, soapy water and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a . time,' she said.","10 day old Avery Cornet died December 18 from an infection caused by bacteria found in powdered milk .

"By . Nick Enoch . Last updated at 8:41 PM on 28th December 2011 . A girl of 12 died after doctors failed to carry out blood tests . because they were too busy, an inquest was told. Emma Stones was admitted . to Tameside General Hospital in Greater Manchester with flu-like symptoms but contracted a bacterial . infection which led to septicaemia. She died from the blood poisoning 16 . hours after she was admitted to the hospital. Emma Stones, 12, was admitted to Tameside General Hospital in Greater Manchester with flu-like symptoms but contracted a bacterial infection which led to septicaemia . The inquest heard how there . was a catalogue of errors in the lead-up to her death. Coroner John . Pollard criticised the lack of urgency and co-ordination in her care, but he . said he could not be sure that earlier intervention would have saved her. The hearing was told how: . A series of policy changes . have been implemented at the hospital as a result of Emma's death. Mr . Pollard said the issues amounted to 'inertia' on the part of staff. Emma, a pupil at Cromwell High in Tameside, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at birth. She lived with her twin sister, Christina, and parents Mike Stones and Tracey Futcher (pictured) in Dukinfield, near Tameside . Emma, . a pupil at Cromwell High in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with . cerebral palsy at birth. Doctors said she was stable before her condition . deteriorated without warning. She lived with her twin sister, Christina, . and parents Mike Stones and Tracey Futcher on Chester Avenue in Dukinfield, . near Tameside. Emma, who suffered health problems throughout her life, . was taken to hospital on the advice of community nurses at around 3.45pm on . Sunday, February 6. The hearing was told how junior doctor Dr Kayleigh . Hughes wanted to take a sample of her blood and asked for help. But a . senior registrar was too busy to carry out the test due to his workload, the . inquest heard. Coroner John Pollard criticised the lack of urgency and co-ordination in Emma's care at Tameside Hospital, but he said he could not be sure that earlier intervention would have saved her . Mr Pollard also hit out at a breakdown of communication between . staff. Dr Hughes wasn't told that Emma's heart rate had risen rapidly, . the inquest heard. Septicaemia is a life-threatening condition where bacteria invade the bloodstream. It . is usually triggered by an infection in another part of the body, such . as pneumonia, meningitis, bladder infections or even a tooth abscess. The . bacteria escape from this initial infection and enter the blood, . causing a series of reactions that can lead to swelling of the blood . vessels and blood clots. There are about 300,000 cases a year and up to 15,000 deaths. If untreated, it develops into septic shock, where blood pressure drops and organs fail. There was nothing to indicate that Emma was seriously . ill, but her heart rate increased five hours after her admission. The . inquest . was also told that key information about what treatment Emma might have . needed was not included on a handover note when staff changed shifts. Emma's condition deteriorated and she had a heart attack at around 8.15am the . following Monday morning. Tests ruled she contracted an infection, group A streptococcus, which led to septicaemia, or blood poisoning. The infection, . described as serious and rapidly progressive, could have caused toxic shock . syndrome. Children's services matron Wendy Hulse said changes to nursing . policies had been made. The inquest heard that doctors' notes will now be . reviewed with regard to their content, not just their dating and signing. Detailed changes to staff shift handover arrangements are also being . made. Philip Dylak, director of nursing at Tameside Hospital NHS . Foundation Trust, said: 'While it would not be appropriate for the hospital to . comment on the details until the coroner has reached his verdict, we would wish . to express our deepest sympathies to the family of Emma Stones at this very . difficult time.' The inquest will resume on March 6, where Mr Pollard is . due to reveal his findings.","Emma Stones died from blood poisoning 16 hours after being admitted to hospital .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 7:48 PM on 27th December 2011 . This is the dramatic moment police drew a Taser as they battled to gain control of the frenzied crowd surrounding the scene of a fatal stabbing on London's Oxford Street yesterday. As hundreds of shoppers look on in horror at paramedics trying to revive the teenager outside a branch of Foot Looker, several distressed onlookers appeared to try to push past the line of police. And as emotions ran high, officers had to physically restrain a number of youths, including one teen who appeared desperate to push through towards the victim following the Boxing Day attack. Scroll down for video . Tension: The yellow Taser held by a police officer is clearly pointed . in the direction of a youth at the murder scene on Oxford Street in . central London . Seconds later the distinctive rattle of the Taser can be heard as the youth is restrained during police attempts to control the frenzied crowd . Losing battle for survival: With crowds behind crush barriers, paramedics treat the stabbed youth . With throngs of Boxing Day bargain hunters staring in shock, one officer is clearly seen drawing his Taser from its holster and pointing it in the direction of the youth. On the video soundtrack, what sounds like the distinctive rattle of the electronic gun can be heard over the shouts of shoppers and police, as the youth gesticulates wildly with officers. Tragic: The 18-year-old victim, Seydou Diarrassouba, poses in a grey hoodie in a social networking profile picture . The black youth who the Taser was aimed at did not appear to be physically harmed by the gun, and he was eventually forced back into the crowd. A Scotland Yard spokesman initially confirmed that an officer had discharged a Taser. But tonight the Metropolitan Police denied that the weapon was fired in anger. Responding to the YouTube footage, Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'One of the first units to come across the incident were officers from the Met's Diplomatic Protection Group who were driving past. 'On arrival they were confronted by certain elements of the crowd who were extremely agitated and officers had to protect the victim and those administering emergency first aid to him. 'Officers can be seen in the footage pushing the crowd back and one officer is shown to remove his Taser from its holster, although at no time was it ever deployed. 'Clearly in those initial early stages, officers would have been unaware of what had occurred and where the suspects might be and their priority would have been to prevent further injury or loss of life to those in the area.' After police shut off the first crime scene, Boxing Day bargain hunters and tourists were going up to the cordon to take pictures and ask officers what had happened. Shoppers could be seen going in and out of nearby shops, such as Debenhams and Zara, but a number of stores were forced to close. Other officers keeping order at the crime scene have to shove other youths back away from the victim, who lies lifeless on the floor as paramedics try in vain to save his life. Met Police officers can be heard several times on the footage yelling at the assembled crowd to 'Get back' and 'Move away' as the horror unfolds in front of central London's Bond Street tube station. It is thought the 18-year-old may have been stabbed in a row over a pair of trainers. Witnesses said the teenager was . amongst a group of black youths, thought to be rival gangs, fighting . over the trainers at the Foot Locker branch on Oxford Street. Hours . after the murder, police rushed to a second incident near Oxford Circus . Tube station – 700 yards from Foot Locker – where a young man had been . stabbed in the leg. At the scene were a bloodied pair of jeans and a . pair of Nike trainers. Investigation: Part of the road was cordoned off on one of the busiest shopping days of the year after the stabbing . Fatal stabbing: The scene outside Foot Locker on Oxford Street where the man was stabbed to death . Last . year, police fired Tasers over 1,500 times, an average force increase . of 130 per cent and 70 per cent up on the previous year. The . electronic weapons, which are only used by trained firearms officers, . send out a 50,000 volt shock from either two darts or by placing the . stun gun directly on the body. In . the year ending March 2011, some police forces used Tasers 800 per cent . more than in the previous year, according to the Channel 4 News . investigation. Earlier this year the Met Police said it was considering increasing the number of Tasers it issues to officers. Met . Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said the force was considering . having one of the controversial firearms in every police car, so they . can be deployed more quickly. Mr Hogan-Howe had commented last week that fewer people are being Tasered by police. But Amnesty International questioned his comments in light of the figures. Critics say the electronic stun gun can be fatal and changes the nature of policing. Police were investigating whether there was any link between the two stabbings. Detective . Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, who is leading the murder inquiry, said . yesterday: ‘This is probably the busiest place in the United Kingdom . right now on the busiest shopping day.’ The crimes brought a large area thronged by tens of thousands of shoppers to a standstill and closed many stores. Scotland Yard said Oxford Street has . today fully reopened to pedestrians, buses and other traffic, while a . small crime scene remains in place outside the Foot Locker store. Police . commanders had to bring in extra officers to hold back crowds of . bargain hunters incensed their spending spree had been interrupted. Yesterday’s murder happened at about 1.45pm – the height of the shopping frenzy. The . sprawling Foot Locker store, near Bond Street Tube station, was packed . with shoppers frantically sifting through piles of sales goods. Witnesses said a group of young men began arguing over a box of trainers before the victim was stabbed in the chest. It is believed the group may have been on Oxford Street on a shoplifting spree and were arguing over who stole what. One said the killer said ‘Wallah’, an Arabic slang term for ‘I swear to God’, before plunging the knife into his victim. The stabbed youth pushed his way through the crowd of shoppers, many of whom did not realise what had happened, before collapsing on the pavement outside.

After the balmy weather of Boxing Day, . which saw many people frolicking in the sea in the unseasonably mild . weather, strong winds ripped through the northern part of the country. Winds of up to 90mph in Blackpool, Newcastle and Scotland whipped up the sea, causing waves . to froth and crash against the promenades.

The west of the country has definitely seen the worst of the weather. 'Across the Central Belt the highest wind speeds have been around 70mph but we expect that the worst is now over.' The severe weather meant the funeral of a teenager allegedly murdered on the Isle of Lewis was postponed for two days. The service for Liam Aitchison was due to take place in Daliburgh, South Uist, but the arrival of his body from Inverness was delayed by the cancellation of ferry sailings to the island, the parish priest said.

Now the corporation has caused controversy by including a member of the fairer sex who is not even human among the 12 females on its ‘Faces of 2011’ list. Giant panda Sweetie, also known as Tian Tian, was listed on the BBC’s website as the female face of December, after she made headlines when she was moved to Edinburgh Zoo from China with a male panda to breed. Tian Tian, who arrived at Edinburgh Zoo with Yang Guang - or Sunshine - on December 4 has been named as one of the BBC's Faces of 2011 . She joined 11 other notable names including shot U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Pauline Pearce – dubbed the heroine of Hackney after she was filmed standing up to rioters in north London – and Libyan Iman al-Obeidi, who burst into a press conference to reveal she had been gang-raped by Colonel Gaddafi’s officials. Also featured was chart-topping singer Adele.] . But the BBC has defended its decision to name Sweetie among the 12 women in its Faces of 2011 as 'a light-hearted addition' to the list. The furore comes after, the BBC came under fire last month after its shortlist for the Sports Personality of the Year award did not include any women. MPs accused the BBC of 'ignoring women's achievements' in 2011 by choosing an all-male shortlist. A group of female MPs wrote to director general Mark Thompson, saying: 'This bias has led to a number of outstanding sporting achievements by women being entirely disregarded.' Worthy: Pauline Pearce (left) told looters they made her feel 'ashamed to be a Hackney person', while Gabrielle . Iman Al-Obeidi came to the world's attention after she told a press conference she was sexually assaulted by up to 15 men while held custodyby colonel Gaddafi's men . January: Gabrielle Giffords The US congresswoman was shot in the head when a gunman went on the rampage during an event in tucson Arizona. Six died in the attack.February: Adele She became the first living artist to achieve two top-five hits simultaneously in both the album and singles charts since The Beatles.March: Iman al-Obeidi The 29-year-old Libyan burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli to tell the assembled foreign media that she had been beaten and gang-raped by 15 members of Gaddafi's forces during a two-day ordeal.April: Sarah Burton The Macclesfield-born creative director of the Alexander McQueen fashion house created Kate Middelton's wedding dress.May: Nafissatou Diallo The 32-year-old immigrant from Guinea, who worked as a hotel maid, accused the head of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, of sexually assaulting her and trying to rape her at New York's Sofitel Hotel. June: Jelena Lecic London-based Croatia who was the face of a blog purportedly written by a gay woman in Syria - but it was a hoax.July: Princess Charlene Former Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock married Prince Albert of Monaco - apparently after having had to be persuaded not to call off the weddingAugust: Pauline Pearce The 'Heroine of Hackney' who told looters they made her feel ""ashamed to be a Hackney person"". September: Rebecca Leighton The nurse was accused of - and cleared of - murdering three patients with a contaminated saline drip. She spent six weeks in prison before being released without charge.October: Duchess of Alba One of Spain's richest and flamboyant women, the Duchess of Alba, married again at the age of 85 to Alfonso Diez Carabantes, who is 24 years her juniorNovember: Corporal Kelsey de Santis The US Marine from Virginia, made a YouTube appeal to actor and singer Justin Timberlake to take her to the Marine Corps Ball in Richmond, Virginia. He said yes.December: Sweetie One of two pandas on loan to Edinburgh zoo for ten years at a cost of £600,000 per year. Zoo bosses are hoping that they will reproduce. In response to the inclusion of Sweetie . on the list, Labour MP Stella Creasy said: 'Whilst we all love a good . panda story, in a year when Christine Lagarde became head of the IMF, or . Helle Thorning-Schmidt became prime minister of Denmark or even the sad . death of Amy Winehouse, its frustrating the BBC couldn't think of 12 . human female faces who have made the news this year. 'These lists aren't meant to be serious . but coming so soon after the lack of women from their Sports Personality . of the Year award it does seem as if the BBC hasn't noticed the wide . and varied contribution women make to public life.' A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Including Sweetie (Tian Tian) as one of the annual headline makers was a light-hearted addition to the list, and this isn't the first time it has featured a non-human. In 2009, Benson the Carp, a much-caught giant fish, was August's entry on the male list and last year Peppa the Pig was on the female list for April.' The bears were brought to Scotland from China in the hope that they will produce cubs. Sweetie's inclusion has caused a stir on Twitter, with many users suggesting alternative names for '£realwomenoftheyear'. One user of the site, who tweets under the name campaigner, wrote: 'I'm rather torn over £pandagate. These things are never just black or white.' The article was written up by freelance reporter Bob Chaundy, who told the Guardian the list was put together by BBC editors. Responding to the debate, which sent the Twitter hashtag #pandagate trending, Chaundy tweeted: 'I didn't choose the BBC women faces of the year subjects, just wrote them. Two black eyes from wife though. Pandamonium!' Twitter users also complained at the selection of women came to prominence simply because of high-profile weddings, such as Charlene Wittstock who married Prince Albert of Monaco, and the Spanish billionaire the Duchess of Alba. And the worth of a place on the list of a US marine who used YouTube to ask Justin Timberlake to take her to the Marine corps Ball, as Corporal Kelsey de Santis did, has also been called into question. Unsurprisingly the Face of April was connected with the Royal wedding, but while the UK version of the BBC's list had Sarah Burton, the woman who designed The Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress, as the entry for that month, worldwide audiences were offered the more recognisable figure of Pippa Middleton, whose worthiness of a place on the list many may also doubt.",Furore comes after Corporation did not include a single woman on shortlist for Sports Personality of the Year .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:20 PM on 29th December 2011 . The U.S. has insisted that it will not allow Iran to choke off one of the world's busiest shipping routes in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country over its secretive nuclear programme. Last night an American military official said that 'any disruption will not be tolerated' in the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by 40 per cent of the world's oil tankers, and where Iran is currently holding a 10-day war games training exercise. And a Pentagon spokesman warned that Iran would destroy its own 'economic lifeline' if it disrupted the international oil trade. Tensions rose after Iran’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the Gulf to oil tankers would be ‘easier than drinking a glass of water.’ And they have continued to escalate today, with Iran revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a U.S. aircraft carrier near the area it is carrying out the drill. Warning: Tensions are rising as Iran said it recorded video surveillance of a U.S. aircraft carrier near the area it is carrying out the drill . Drill: Iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in international waters beyond the Strait of Hormuz - the passageway for one-sixth of the world's oil supply . Training: The military drill has sparked a row between Iran and the U.S. Gestures: Iran's army navy commander Habibollah Sayyari spoke to reporters during the Velayat-90 war game on the Sea of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz . The report did not provide details and . it was unclear what information the Iranian military could gleam from . such footage. But the announcement was seen as an indication Iran is . seeking to cast its navy as having a powerful role in the region's . waters. The threats have triggered an angry response . from the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. ‘Anyone who threatens to disrupt . freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the . community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated,’ said a . spokesman for the Bahrain-based fleet. ‘The free flow of goods and services . through the Strait of Hormuz is vital to regional and global . prosperity,’ he added. Britain dismissed the Iranian boasts as an attempt to draw attention from its nuclear ambitions. Tensions: A military helicopter flies over a submarine during the Velayat-90 war games by the Iranian navy in the Strait of Hormuz today . Military personnel place an Iranian flag on a submarine in the Strat of Hormuz, as tensions escalate over the country's apparent design of nuclear weapons . Lookout: A submarine performs naval maneuvers on the Sea of Oman during naval exercises in international waters . If Iran were successfully to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically. Around a third of all oil shipped in tankers passes through the strait, and if this supply were disrupted it would out immense pressure on the rest of the world's supplies. Following a mistaken report that the strait had already been closed, the oil price jumped by $2, to over $100 a barrel. Although it then fell back, the price is set to rise even if the Strait of Hormuz remains open, as sanctions on Iran and Syria restrict the global supply. A senior Saudi official has insisted that Gulf nations will be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions, but this would be of little use if Iran succeeded in cutting off the strait. The ongoing uncertainty is set to make 2012 another volatile year for the oil markets, following the disruption to supplies caused by the Arab Spring throughout 2011. Playing down the threat, a Foreign . Office spokesman said: ‘Iranian politicians regularly use this type of . rhetoric to distract attention from the real issue, which is the nature . of their nuclear programme.’ Tehran warned a week ago it would shut down the strategically vital shipping lane if the West took tougher action against Iran. Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said Iran wouldn’t allow ‘a drop of oil’ to pass through the strait if sanctions were widened. The row ratcheted up another notch after Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, head of the Iranian navy, declared that ‘closing the Strait of Hormuz for Iran’ s armed forces is really easy – or as Iranians say it will be easier than drinking a glass of water.’ The comments drew a quick response from the U.S, with Pentagon press secretary George Little saying: 'This . is not just an important issue for security and stability in the . region, but is an economic lifeline for countries in the Gulf, to . include Iran.' Iranian media have described how Iran could move to close the strait, saying the country would use a combination of warships, submarines, speed boats, anti-ship cruise missiles, torpedoes, surface-to-sea missiles and drones to stop ships from sailing through the narrow waterway. Iran's navy claims it has sonar-evading submarines designed for shallow waters of the Persian Gulf, enabling it to hit passing enemy vessels. A closure of the strait could temporarily cut off some oil supplies and force shippers to take longer, more expensive routes that would drive oil prices higher. It also potentially opens the door for a military confrontation that would further rattle global oil markets. But . Mark Toner, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, responded: . 'It's another attempt to distract attention away from the real issue, . which is their continued non-compliance with their international nuclear . obligations.' Western tensions . with Iran have increased since a U.N report claimed last month that . Tehran appears to have worked on designing an atomic bomb.

The threats to close the Strait of Hormuz coincided with a 10-day Iranian naval exercise in the Strait and . nearby waters, a show of military force that began on Saturday.

Either way, they have helped  Harry . over- take Oliver as the most popular name for baby boys in Britain, . propelling it to first from third. Oliver lost the top spot only a year after it took the crown from Jack, which had held first place for 16 years. Danielle Lloyd and fiancé Jamie called their second little boy, right, Harry. Their first son, now two, is named Archie - number 19 on the list . In the girls’ list, Olivia again stayed top, while Lily swapped with Sophie to climb to second place. Tommy was the biggest climber among . the boys’ names, leaping from 131st last year to 66th this time round, . an improvement of 65 places, while Riley rose from 25th to enter the top . ten, in ninth place. Jackson also made a huge jump, . rising from 128th last year to 75th in  2011, as did Jenson, which went . from 99th to 69th, presumably inspired by the  success of British . Formula One ace  Jenson Button. Among the girls’ names, Eliza made . the biggest jump, going from 141st to 84th. Willow was also popular last . year, climbing 31 places from 108th to 77th.

"By . Sarah Gordon . Last updated at 11:55 AM on 20th December 2011 . Holidaymakers will no longer be charged for purchasing foreign currency with a debit card in the UK after banks were pressured into changing complex levies which earnt them more than £1 billion last year. The Office of Fair Trading led an investigation into the banks' confusing charges and the poor information they provide for travellers after Consumer Focus raised a 'super complaint' about the practices. It is estimated that around 40 per cent of foreign currency purchases in the UK are made using cards rather than cash, with banks charging 1.5 to 2 per cent of the amount exchanged just for the transaction. Scrapped: Banks have agreed to stop charging holidaymakers for buying foreign currency with debit cards . Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and the Co-operative Bank have all agreed to remove the charges for buying currency with debit cards after discussions with the OFT. Consumer Focus said it costs . banks and credit card providers an average of 9p and 37p respectively to . process debit and credit card payments. But . the charges currently levied mean a holidaymaker trying to . convert £500 into euros could be charged up to £30 to do it. Banks have also agreed to review certain marketing practices, including the use of '0 per cent commission' deals, which the watchdog argued is misleading as the transactions are not fee-free. From the end of 2012, consumers will be able to . use their debit cards to buy foreign exchange from banks, bureaux de . change, the Post Office and travel agents without any hidden charges . simply for paying on a card. Nationwide, HSBC and Halifax Bank of Scotland already allow holidaymakers to purchase foreign currency without an extra charge for using a debit card. Mike O'Connor, Consumer Focus chief . executive, said: 'It is particularly welcome that the OFT has worked . with the big banks to stop withdrawal fees being charged when people buy . currency on their card in the UK. It is only right that this unfair . cost, which effectively charges customers for the privilege of taking . money out of their own account, is stopped.' However, despite this positive step, transactions for debit card purchases abroad are . unaffected, as are fees for using a credit card to purchase foreign . currency. Banks were also rapped on the knuckles for the complex charges holidaymakers incur when using their cards abroad and have agreed to give 'clearer, more accessible' information about them. Marketing ploys: Banks will look into campaigns which are based around 0 per cent commission deals . Lloyds, HSBC, Co-operative Bank, . Capital One, RBS and NatWest and American Express have said they would . show the charges that travellers incur by using their cards abroad - . including the typical 'loading fee' of 3 per cent - more clearly on . monthly and annual statements. Consumer Focus found that some 70 per cent of . holidaymakers take foreign cash with them on their trip with one in five . using credit or debit cards abroad. It is estimated that British . travellers altogether take around £10 billion in cash when they go . overseas. Kevin Mountford, head of banking at moneysupermarket.com welcomed the changes, saying it would encourage more competition between banks, which in turn benefits the consumer. 'I welcome anything that brings more transparency to the market and lets people become more informed about their spending,' Mr Mountford told TravelMail. 'The important thing is that consumers will be able to differentiate between charges, helping to create competition as people become aware of different deals. This in turn should reduce costs for the consumer.' John Fingleton, chief executive of the OFT, said: 'Companies should be earning profits by competing to provide the best value products and services, not through charges that are hard for customers to identify or interpret.' Will buying travel money be cheaper? Currently, buying £500 worth of euros over the counter with your debit card would mean an additional fee of between £10 and £30. Five banks – Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander – currently impose a charge of 1.5 and 2 per cent on customers using their debit cards to withdraw foreign currency before leaving the UK. They have all agreed to scrap these charges by the end of 2012 under the new rules. It will mean that travellers can use their debt cards to buy foreign currency from banks, bureau de change, the Post Office and travel agents without being charged to use their debit card. There will be still be a charge for credit cards. The UK Cards Association and British Bankers Association has agreed that banks and lenders will give clearer, more accessible information about using cards abroad on websites, statements and through call centres. What about when you’re abroad? Currently banks and credit card companies hide the cost of using your card abroad within the items travellers have bought. They will now have to show the charge, typically called a ‘loading fee’ usually of around 3 per cent, separately on bank statements. Lloyds/HBOS, HSBC, Co-operative Bank, Capital One, RBS/Natwest and American Express have agreed to display the actual charges incurred by customers for using cards abroad far more clearly on their monthly and annual statements. This will mean that customers can more easily work out how much they’re paying for foreign currency and give them the ability to shop around to get better deals. What about pre-paid cards? Pre-paid cards, which are loaded with currency before you go on holiday, often advertise 0 per cent commission offers but sting customers by pushing up exchange rates so they are not fee free – the OFT is forcing firms to review this strategy to reveal the exact costs. Will the changes lead to less generous exchange rates? As firms are forced to cut back on money making fees when proving currency there are some fears this may mean less generous exchange rates for customers. A spokesman from Consumer Focus said that it would hope that competition between banks and other players such as the Post Office and bureaux de change would keep rates competitive. However, it is up to individual firms to decide at what rate they set the exchange at. If banks and others wish to offset the revenue lost from a ban on debit card fees with higher exchange rates, the rules mean customers will at least be able to identify and compare the advertised exchange rate of different providers.","Banks can no longer charge travellers for buying foreign currency with debit cards .

"Odds were offered on favourite in Leopardstown race . Bookmakers faced a potential loss of £600m . By . David Gerges . Last updated at 12:07 AM on 29th December 2011 . Bookmakers Betfair are facing a backlash from customers after they reversed a payout that was set to cost them millions. Odds of 28-1 had been offered by the gambling firm on the outright favourite in the 2pm woodiesdiy.com Christmas Hurdle. That led to a flurry of betting in which a total of £1,642,094 was matched on Voler La Vedette. In-play mistake: Andrew Lynch steers runaway favourite Voler La Vedette to victory at Leopardstown . And when the horse strolled to a comfortable victory, thousands of customers expecting a grand scale payout were told that all betting had been declared void following a technical error. A statement from Betfair customer services read: 'Customers betting in-play on this race will have seen that Voler La Vedette was available to back at 29 when the in-running market was suspended, and that a considerable sum was matched on the clear winner at that price. 'An investigation has revealed that this was due to an obvious technical failure which allowed a customer to exceed their exposure limit. 'In accordance with our terms and conditions, all in running bets on this race, both win and place, will be made void. 'We fully appreciate the dissatisfaction this will cause many customers, and apologise for a very poor customer and betting experience.' Double joy: Jockey Andrew Lynch had also triumphed in the Future Champions Novice Hurdle after ridding to victory on horse Cash and Go . A Betfair graph showed over £21million was offered to back Colm Murphy's mare at those odds, even though she was always in contention and looked the obvious winner even before the final flight. This meant one layer could potentially have lost £600million in only a few minutes if all of the money had been matched. Betfair suspended the market in order to investigate, with many of the exchange's members in a state of shock on the website's forum.","Odds were offered on favourite in Leopardstown race .

Almost half of Britain’s new breed of ‘local’ Post Offices are frustrating customers by refusing to accept parcels that weigh more than 6kg. Their controversial ban breaks the Government’s gold-plated rules – known as the ‘universal service obligation’ – which say Post Offices must deliver parcels of 20kg to 30kg. It means many customers are forced to travel for miles to find a larger branch – a particular problem for the elderly, or small businessmen who sell goods on eBay and rely on their local service. The local Post Offices are mostly based in newsagents such as the one pictured . The new ‘Post Office Local’ branches are mostly based in newsagents and corner shops. They offer the most common services, such as posting a letter, paying a bill or picking up a pension, and boast longer opening hours. Around 2,000 of the country’s crumbling network of 11,500 Post Offices are being turned into ‘Locals’ over the next four years. But a snapshot shopping exercise by Consumer Focus found one in two operators refused to accept large packages. The report, given exclusively to the Daily Mail, revealed many customers were given poor excuses, including ‘the weighing scales in the branch not being large enough’. The report added: ‘Others said they could only accept the parcel if “it was able to fit into the postman’s sack”.’ One customer was told ‘no, take it off’ when they placed a parcel on the scale – because they could have damaged it. Short-term: When 'Locals' were introduced, bosses imposed a weight limit of 6kg on packages, but that was only temporary .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 7:17 PM on 27th December 2011 . A crowd of up to 70,000 people took to the streets in Syria yesterday in an unprecedented show of defiance against President Bashar Assad’s embattled regime. Emboldened by an Arab peace-monitoring group’s first tour of the flashpoint city of Homs, protesters broke cover in a bid to win more international support for the popular revolt. The Arab League observers want to determine if Assad is keeping his promise to implement a peace plan to end his violent nine-month crackdown that has claimed as many as 5,000 victims. Offensive: A Syrian tank drives through a deserted street in the city of Homs. Yesterday the army reportedly killed at least 42 people in the city that . has become a focal point of the uprising against President Bashar . al-Assad . Withdraw: According to those opposed to President Assad's regime the army withdrew tanks tanks from the city to coincide with the arrival of a team of Arab League observers . Their arrival in Homs yesterday marked a break in hostilities and an opportunity for a public protest. Tens of thousands tried to enter the tightly-secured Clock Square but were beaten back by security forces firing tear gas and live bullets, according to human rights groups. Anti-government activists fear Assad is trying to fool the observers by preventing them from visiting the worst hit areas and temporarily withdrawing troops from parts of the city. Protesters claimed that a dozen tanks were seen leaving one hotspot hours before the monitors turned up, while others were being hidden in government buildings to create a false impression of relative normality while the city tour was going on. At the end of the first day of the month-long series of Arab League visits, two very different views emerged as to the success of the mission. Sudan’s General Mustafa Dabi, the head of the observers, insisted last night: ‘Today was very good and all sides were very responsive.’ But video footage showed Homs residents pleading unsuccessfully with monitors to venture further into the Baba Amr quarter, where clashes have been especially fierce. Gunshots crackled nearby as two monitors and two men wearing orange vests stood amid a crowd of residents, one begging the team to ‘come and see – they are slaughtering us, I swear.’ Anger: Syrian protesters rally against President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the city of Homs on Friday . Victim: Anti-government protesters carry a coffin during the funeral of a demonstrator killed in earlier clashes in the town of Deir Balaba near . Homs . Protests: Demonstrators wave Syrian and Kurdish flags during a protest against President Assad in the town of Amuda . Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad claims 1,000 prisoners have been freed since the Arab peace plan was agreed . Residents in the video were seen shouting: ‘We want universal protection’ and ‘Where is the world?’ Abdul Omar, a spokesman for the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, accused the government of playing cat-and-mouse with demonstrators by pulling tanks out of the city. There were also reports that security forces changed clothes to make them appear like civilians. According to the human rights group, seven people were shot dead yesterday (TUE). Opposition group the LCC put the figure at 30, including six in Homs. There were signs of intimidation towards the observers, too. According to the New York Times, a group from the Sudan, Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania were held back by gunfire coming from a government checkpoint as they tried to visit a mosque where several bodies of victims were being stored. ‘The observers failed today,’ said Ali, an opposition activist who complained the 60 visitors didn’t see the field hospitals or the ‘hot spots.’ After signing on to the Arab League plan early last week, Assad’s regime had only intensified the violence, rather than easing up, and it was condemned internationally for flouting the agreement. Government troops killed hundreds in the past week. On Monday, security forces killed at least 42 people, most of them in Homs. Teams of observers are also supposed to travel to several other cities, but critics have questioned how effective the mission will be in coming up with an independent judgment in what is increasingly looking like a civil war.

"By . Roger Baird . Last updated at 12:56 AM on 29th December 2011 . Britain's last remaining train factory has been thrown a lifeline after winning a £188million contract to build 130 carriages. It is hoped the deal struck by Bombardier with rail operator Southern will save some of the 1,400 engineering and ancilliary jobs that are under threat. Bombardier, which is based in Derby, has been in trouble since June when it lost out to a German rival for a £1.4billion contract to make trains to run on the Thameslink line. The 172-year-old former British Rail factory employs 3,000. A train being built inside the Bombardier factory in Derby . The Department of Transport was heavily criticised for preferring Siemens over Bombardier and the row prompted the Government to look at the issue of rail procurement. The new contract with Southern – to build carriages for the rail operator to run commuter trains between Victoria and stations in Surrey, Kent and Sussex – will be part-funded by the Government with an £80million subsidy. Funding for the deal came from money made available following last month’s Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne. A . source close to the company said: ‘Every contract we win is a . significant step to us retaining our commitment to continue to make . trains in the UK.’ The new contract with Southern will be part-funded by the Government with an £80m subsidy . Bombardier said it will begin production in the second half of next year, with the carriages expected to start coming into service from December 2013. Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘This deal lands Bombardier with a crucial order and I look forward to Bombardier workers in Derby being among the winners.’ But Bombardier has made clear it needs to win two additional contracts, each worth as much as £1billion, in order to safeguard the jobs that are at risk in Derby. ÷Clothing firm D2 Jeans has collapsed into administration with the loss of 200 jobs and closure of 19 stores.

But the BBC took things to a whole new level by re-using many of its biggest Christmas shows days – and in some cases, hours – after they first aired. Viewers were shocked to see shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Gruffalo’s Child, which aired on Christmas Day, reappear on BBC1 on Boxing Day. Repeat: The Gruffalo's Child, pictured, was aired on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day . The festive episode of Doctor Who was not far behind as viewers were hit with it for a second time, just two days after it premiered on December 25. The Christmas Eve episode of Winter Wipeout was on again on Boxing Day and another hotly anticipated Christmas Day show, Absolutely Fabulous, will be screened tonight. Even one of the biggest films was being given a second outing – The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe, which aired on BBC1 on Christmas Eve, is on BBC3 tomorrow night. Was this the worst Christmas ever on the BBC? ITV gave shows such as Michael Buble: Home For Christmas and The Jonathan Ross Show more than one showing, and the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey will be screened again on New Year’s Day. But viewers singled out the BBC for recycling so much of their new output over the festive period. As well as its big  Christmas Day shows, the corporation also aired cookery shows The Hairy Bikers’ Christmas Party, Rick Stein’s Spanish Christmas and Lorraine’s Last Minute Christmas only 15 hours after their first slot. Viewers have also complained that this year’s festive line-up was one of the worst in recent memory. Shows such as the return of Absolutely Fabulous  did not live up to many people’s expectations and the new Sir David Jason comedy was another disappointment. As well, the Downton Abbey special on Christmas Day did not get the huge ratings many were expecting. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message board: ‘What’s with all the repeats? On Boxing Day you repeated Strictly from Christmas Day, Winter Wipeout from Christmas Eve, not to  mention the numerous repeats of the Morecambe and Wise Specials. ‘There is no need to repeat programmes now as  most people have access to a digital recorder… can’t you spend the licence fee on some new programmes instead.’ A BBC spokesman  said: ‘We never repeat prime-time shows in the same slot. ‘This Christmas has seen brand new shows in  drama, factual, entertainment and religion. ‘Over 91 per cent of programming on peak-time on BBC1 is brand new and has never been shown before.’","Strictly Come Dancing and The Gruffalo’s Child aired on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:08 AM on 30th December 2011 . Family friends say a Texas father accused of killing six relatives in a Christmas Day murder-suicide was struggling financially and hated the fact that his estranged wife was doing well. Police say 56-year-old Aziz Yazdanpanahwas dressed as Santa when he fatally shot his estranged wife, their two teenage children and three other relatives Sunday inside an apartment in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Grapevine. After a private burial for the six victims Thursday, family friend Azar Shahbazi said she believed Yazdanpanah was upset because his wife 'was doing good on her own.' Scroll down for video . Wife: Nasrin Rahmaty, centre, and her family was murdered by her estranged husband because he was jealous she was doing well on her own, a family friend said . 'All fatherly': Aziz Yazdanpanah murdered his niece Sara Fatemeh Zarei and six other family members, minutes after she sent texts to a friend about him dressed as Santa Claus at their Texas home . The wife's brother, Ali Rahmaty, says he'd been financially supporting the family. He says Yazdanpanah had been unemployed for more than a decade, but says he never thought Yazdanpanah would become violent. They were at an apartment in Grapevine, where his wife and children had been staying. Yazdanpanah's niece, 22-year-old Sara Fatemeh Zarei, sent a text to a friend just before 11am saying they had arrived at the apartment and that Yazdanpanah was there. 'Soo we're here. We just got here and my uncle is here too. Dressed as Santa. Awesome,' she said in one text. At 11:15 am she texted: 'Now he wants to be all fatherly and win father of the year.' Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling said police believe that after Yazdanpanah shot his six family members, he called 911 at 11:34 am and then shot himself. Police arrived about three minutes later and found everyone dead. It appeared they had been opening presents around their Christmas tree just before the attack. A recording of the 911 call released yesterday revealed someone saying: 'Help, help' and then 'I am . shooting people.' Police said those words, muffled by the caller's . labored breathing, couldn't be heard by the dispatcher on Christmas Day but were . audible when investigators used a different software system. They believe the call was made by Yazdanpanah. Distress: Relatives comfort one another during a candlelight vigil for victims of a shooting at Parr Park in Grapevine, Texas last night . In our prayers: Neighbours and family members gathered for a candlelit vigil and laid flowers Thursday night after the Christmas Day shooting which left seven dead . Authorities believe that in addition to killing his wife of 24 years, 55-year-old Fatemah Rahmati, their 19-year-old daughter Nona and 14-year-old son Ali, Yazdanpanah also killed his wife's sister, 58-year-old Zohreh Rahmaty, her husband, 59-year-old Mohamad Hossein Zarei and their daughter, Sara. Eberling said one of the two weapons, a 9 mm, was purchased in 1996 and registered to Yazdanpanah. The other weapon was a .40 caliber. The medical examiner's office said Yazdanpanah's son, daughter, niece and sister-in-law were shot multiple times in the head. His wife was shot once in the head and his brother-in-law was shot multiple times in the head, chest and stomach. High hopes: The couple's daughter Nona had dreamed of going to law school . Police believe that before Yazdanpanah killed himself, he tried to stage the scene by placing one of the two guns used in the hand of his deceased brother-in-law, Mohamad Zarei, Eberling said. 'I think he was probably overwhelmed when it was all said and done and decided to take his life instead,' said Eberling, who added that Mohamad Zarei had been shot with both weapons. Eberling said Yazdanpanah was the only one to fire the two weapons found at the scene. A gun was also found in his hand. Eberling has said that detectives believe Yazdanpanah's marital and financial troubles led him to kill his family, but added that his exact thought process that morning may never be known. 'We really don't have a clear idea of why he did this,' Eberling said. 'Sometimes there's not a really good explanation for irrational behavior.' Federal court records show Yazdanpanah was placed on three years' probation in 1996 after pleading guilty to one count of subscribing to a false income tax return. He was fined $1,000 and required to pay $30,119 in restitution. Three years later, Yazdanpanah and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy. That case was discharged in a matter of months. Mashy Modjdehi, a friend of Yazdanpanah's wife who owns a beauty salon in nearby Plano, said the family's financial troubles intensified about four years ago when Yazdanpanah stopped working in the mortgage business. Modjdehi said Yazdanpanah had long forbidden Rahmati, who holds a state cosmetology license, to work. But once he became unemployed, his wife held down jobs at two spas, the friend said. Son: Ali Yazdanpanah, 15, pictured here with his family, was also shot by his dad . Rahmati, known to family and friends as Nasrin, had filed for bankruptcy in August 2010, and told her attorney she hoped the proceedings would stave off foreclosure of the home. She separated from Yazdanpanah in the midst of the bankruptcy and the proceedings were later dismissed because she failed to make the plan payments, said the attorney, George Barnes. Barnes said Yazdanpanah listed his occupation as 'self-employed'. Rahmati moved out of the couple's home in Colleyville in April with the couple's two children and into the apartment complex two miles away, Modjdehi said. Yazdanpanah, often referred to as 'Bob,' remained in the Colleyville home, currently valued on the tax rolls at $336,200, and was often seen working in his yard. Neighbors said there were few signs of discord. Gunned down: The Zarei family - Hossein Zarei, Zohreh Rahmaty and Sahra Zarei were also shot by Aziz on Christmas morning . The couple's daughter graduated from Colleyville Heritage High School this year and was attending a local community college. A friend said she hoped to go to school in California and become a lawyer. The friend, Yiselle Alvarenga, said Nona had hinted in August that things were becoming increasingly difficult in her life but didn't go into details. Alvarenga said she knew that Nona's father was 'really strict' but that 'her mom was more understanding.' Just hours before the families were . killed, the Yazdanpanah and Zarei families had thrown a large Christmas . Eve party at their ranch. Dozens of friends and relatives celebrated . late into the night, according to WFAA8.com. Crime scene: Police officers stand outside an apartment where seven people were shot and killed on Christmas day in Grapvine, Texas . Comfort: The close friends and family of the Yazdanpanahs and Zahreihs mourned their passing yesterday as the shock news of their murder reached them .

Mona Hosseiny, 27, who grew up with . the children, told WFAA8: 'They were as close as siblings. They . basically called each other sister, brother.

A man stabbed to death during a mass brawl at a private party on Christmas Day was a drug dealer celebrating his release from jail, it emerged today. John Lee Barrett, 31, had just completed a six-year prison sentence for helping run a cocaine packaging factory in Manchester. But as he toasted his release, he was fatally stabbed after up to 20 people gatecrashed a private function at Sinclairs Bar in Rochdale. Barrett was found dying nearby at 2.40am on Christmas morning shortly after a string of fights broke out inside the venue. He was taken to hospital with stab wounds but died on Tuesday. Police believe he had been hit over the head with either a glass or bottle before he was stabbed. By . the time police arrived at the venue, bouncers had already ejected a . number of people from inside the club who ran away before officers could . speak to them. Detectives are now appealing to anyone with information to come forward. Chief Superintendent John O’Hare . said: 'It is incredibly sad that someone has been killed during a night . out and our thoughts are with John’s family and friends. 'We are continuing to appeal to those . in or around the club to come forward, and are especially keen to speak . to those who had been ejected by door staff before police arrived. 'Clearly, they have vital information that will assist our investigation and are key witnesses. 'Regardless of what you saw and . whether or not you think it is relevant, it is extremely important you . contact us so we can build as full a picture as possible to establish . exactly what happened. Barrett, from Harpurhey, Manchester, . was jailed in 2008 after police observed him arriving at a flat in . nearby Cheetham Hill in his Mercedes with two other men, then carrying . items used for drug-making into the property. Barrett was fatally stabbed after up to 20 people gatecrashed a private function at Sinclairs Bar in Rochdale . The . officers raided the flat to discover a drugs press capable of moulding . 1kg blocks of cocaine, scales and a food blender bearing traces of the . drug. A further search of . the flat uncovered a self-loading pistol wrapped inside a plastic . carrier bag, which had been stashed in a utility cupboard. Barrett, . the owner of the flat Kevin Faulkner - who was described by police as a . 'dangerous' man - and a third gangster were arrested. At Barrett’s then-home in Bolton officers recovered 51 grams of heroin with a street value of over £5,000. Barrett . was later convicted of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and . possession with intent to supply class A drugs in March 2008 and . breaching the the terms of his licence from a previous jail term. But he was recently freed after serving half his jail term. Faulkner is still serving eight-and-a-half years behind bars for drugs and firearms offences.","John Lee Barrett, 31, was attacked during brawl at bar in Rochdale .

"By . Ben Todd . Last updated at 11:16 AM on 29th December 2011 . With her mane of long blonde hair, winsome smile and passing resemblance to Jennifer Aniston, she may not exactly be a dead ringer for her famous grandfather. But as she looks forward to sharing the stage with Sir Bruce Forsyth at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his 70 years in showbiz, it is clear Sophie Purdie has inherited the entertainer’s famous drive and singing talent. And the 20-year-old beauty lifted the lid on the secrets of Sir Brucie’s longevity after joining ‘granddad’ for a duet on his latest album. Generation game: Sophie Purdie, pictured, inspired Sir Bruce who has asked her to sing with him on his forthcoming album . Miss Purdie told the Mail that Sir . Bruce - who began his showbusiness career in 1942 aged 14 - remains a . perfectionist at the age of 83. She revealed: 'I think he must have some OCD [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder] or something about wanting to get things right. 'He’s always worrying about stuff and wanting to get it right – and I think I get that from him as well. 'I think that goes in his favour. I like to be slightly organised – but I’m not as bad as him. 'I don’t think he is [OCD] at home. That’s his relaxation period. He’s very like that at work – but not when . he’s at home. There, he likes to be relaxed.' Younger days: Sophie with her grandfather Sir Bruce . Married three times, Strictly Come . Dancing host Sir Bruce has six children, nine grandchildren and an . ever-expanding brood of great-grandchildren. Miss Purdie’s mother, Julie Forsyth, . is no stranger to showbusiness herself. She was in the 1970s pop group . Guys ‘N’ Dolls who appeared regularly on Top of the Pops. Julie is one of three daughters Sir Bruce had with his first wife Penny Calvet, who is also a singer. Sophie's mother Julie, pictured was a pop singer in the 1970s . After Penny, Sir Bruce married his . Generation Game hostess Anthea Redfearn. Twenty-eight years ago, he then . wed former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, whom Miss Purdie calls 'an . absolute saint….amazing,’ adding: ‘she’s kept us altogether really.' Despite the wealth of talent in the family, Sir Bruce was stunned to discover his granddaughter’s voice. Miss Purdie said: ‘It must have been a . couple of years ago that I was getting demos together and my voice was . starting to mature a bit. ‘Then we were round his house and we . put it on and he couldn’t believe how mature I had got. He just . remembered me as a little kid singing. And he thought: ""Oh, blimey. She . can sing"".' Nevertheless, Miss Purdie never . imagined Sir Bruce would ask her to duet on his new album, These Are My . Favourites. The pair sing together on the Charlie Chaplin favourite, . Smile. She admitted: 'I was walking down the . road and he phoned me and asked me out of the blue. And I said: ""Oh my . God, of course I will."" I couldn’t believe it. 'I was very honoured. I never thought it would happen. I never expected it at all. 'And I got a really good, really positive reaction. And that has given me a boost of confidence. He was lost for words…' Now she’s looking forward to showcasing their duet for an audience at the Royal Albert Hall in May. Miss Purdie also told how despite the . passing of the years, Sir Bruce continues to lead the way for the family . when it comes to exercise. Asked whether he continues to follow . his renowned Tibetan exercise, she said: 'He does. He really does. He . gets up so early. Whenever we stay around, we always get up later than . him. 'He gets up at 6am every day and . starts his exercises. Then he has some porridge in the morning. He’s . already done so much stuff by the time we wake up.' Miss Purdie grew up between Holland – . where her mother Julie and father Dominic Grant often worked – and . England. She is, though, now settled in Ramsgate, Kent, and has been . dating artist Matthew Penn for 18 months. Miss Purdie started singing publicly when she was 16 when her father had a 'sore throat' and could not take to the stage. 'My parents have been singers in Holland so I did tour with them and that’s how I’ve sort of got into it really. 'My dad had a bad sore throat and they . needed to fill some time in. So I was backstage helping.and mum said: . ‘Quickly, help me. Get on.' 'So I rushed on stage and I suddenly . realised I had the [showbusiness] bug. So, now I’m sucked in that’s . really it for me. I really love it.' Many have commented on Miss Purdie’s . resemblance to Jennifer Aniston, but she said: ‘People keep saying this . [Aniston] but I don’t see it. I guess it’s just the hair. But my . favourite programme is Friends.’ Talking of her evergreen grandfather, she continued: ‘I completely forget that he’s 83 really. I just completely forget. 'To be honest I don’t see him as a famous celebrity because he is just granddad. 'I know that might sound strange but all the family just think of him as granddad really. 'I never would have thought he did what he did because he just seemed so normal. 'He is a very warm, homely granddad. He has had a massive role in my life.'","Sir Bruce Forsyth, 83, has asked 20-year-old Sophie Purdie to sing with him .

"By . Rachel Quigley, Lucy Buckland and Jennifer Madison . Last updated at 5:26 AM on 30th December 2011 . Dead: Shele Danishefsky Covlin was found dead in her bath tub on New Year's Eve 2009 . The husband of a wealthy UBS executive accused of her murder has been blocked from gaining further access to the $1.6million life-insurance-policy payout she left for their children. Shele Danishefsky Covlin, 47, was found dead in the bathtub at her Manhattan apartment by her daughter with a large cut to her head on New Year's Eve 2009. Though her death was ruled an accidental falling at the time, her body was later exhumed and a medical examiner said in July 2010 she had been strangled. Today it emerged her husband Rod Covlin filed papers in Westchester County Surrogate’s Court in April asking to be named guardian of the cashed-in Aetna policy that his wife had left for their children Anna, 11, and Myles, five. Court papers state Covlin wrote: 'I am Anna’s father, I have her best interests at heart, and I am in the best . position to determine her current and future needs.' Today, Westchester County Surrogate’s . Court Judge Anthony Scarpino temporarily stripped him of the right to . control the account. The order will remain in place until . at least next Wednesday, when an emergency hearing is scheduled to . review the circumstances surrounding how he obtained access to the the . money. A source told The New York Post Covlin had been listed as the beneficiary of the insurance policy but Shele changed it to her children four weeks before she died. Covlin’s bid was successful and he filed a similar petition to control Myles’ half of the payout. Although both children stand to inherit the money when they are 18, the 39-year-old does have the power to invest and can apply for the court to withdraw cash. Court papers show Colvin left blank the answer to a question about whether the children's custody had ever been the subject of a court order. Accused: Rod Covlin, centre, pictured with his mother and attorney after he appeared in court last April over custody of their children . He also failed to divulge that an order of protection had been filed against him before and after his wife’s murder, allowing him only supervised visits with the pair. And the unemployed father wrote 'n/a' under a question asking for the name and address of the children's maternal grandfather and grandmother, who have been fighting to keep him from getting their daughter’s money in a separate court case. It emerged yesterday the Manhattan public administrator has filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit against Roderick Covlin, a former stock trader, according to the New York Post. Mrs Covlin's Orthodox Jewish family refused an autopsy at the time and she was buried immediately, following religious tradition. But when the district attorney's office looked into the case, they learned  she had scheduled a meeting with her lawyer to remove her ex-husband from her will. Scene: Her body was found in the bath tub of her apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan . According to the Post, a suit has been . filed in Manhattan Supreme Court by Public Administrator Ethel Griffin, . a little-known county official who handles estate complications. The . suit charges that Covlin 'intentionally, deliberately, willfully, . wantonly, maliciously, brutally and without provocation or just cause . did strangle, choke, strike, injure, assault, abuse, beat and murder' his wife. Mrs Covlin left an estate of at least $1million which her husband is to split 50-50 with their two children Anna and Myles. A judge appointed the public administrator as executor at the time and she is now seeking to stop Mr Covlin from taking half of his wife's assets. There is still an active criminal investigation in the case. Covlin lives in Westchester County with his children. Shele’s brother Philip Danishefsky is seeking custody of the kids. Fall: Shele Covlin was found in the bath tub of her apartment (not pictured) by her daughter with a gash to her head so her death was ruled as accidental . If he is indicted and found guilty of . killing his wife, he will lose his share of her estate, all of which . would go to the children. He has never been arrested or charged in her death. At the time of her death, the unemployed Covlin was living across the hall from his former wife and their daughter and son, all of whom had an order of protection against him. After the daughter found Shele in the bathroom, she went to get her dad and let him in the apartment. Sources told The Post that in the aftermath of Shele’s death, her purse and smart-phone went missing. Both contained her schedule for meetings with a lawyer to discuss removing Rod from her will.",Shele Danishefsky Covlin had apparently changed policy one month before her death .
"By . Graham Smith, Emily Andrews and Paul Bentley . Last updated at 4:20 PM on 29th December 2011 . The nationwide Christmas shopping spree has renewed fears of an alarming increase in personal debt as Britons get carried out with the euphoria of bargain hunting. Debt advice organisations are today bracing themselves for a huge upsurge in consumers admitting to money problems after drastically overspending their festive budget. Some £2.5billion passed through the tills yesterday on top of an estimated £1.8billion on Boxing Day. Retail analysts believe the combined final total will be the highest ever spend for December 26 and December 27. Bargain hunters flock to Swansea city centre today as the post-Christmas sales boom continues. Debt advice organisations are bracing themselves for an upsurge in consumers admitting to money problems . No end in sight: Some £2.5billion passed through tills yesterday on top of an estimated £1.8billion on Boxing Day . Financial analysts today warned that the Christmas buying experience can easily get out of hand as people spend huge sums of money. Over 60 per cent of people are struggling to pay for Christmas this year and over a quarter will end up with debts because of Christmas spending, according to uSwitch.com. On average the festive financial hangover will last almost 6 months as people strive to pay off their Christmas bills, but almost one in ten will still be clearing their debts next Christmas. In order to put presents under the tree and food on the table, more than half will dip into their savings while over a third of savvy consumers will use up hard-earned shopping vouchers or reward points. Of particular concern though is that over 40 per cent will have Christmas on credit this year, with 4 per cent taking out new credit especially to fund Christmas. A further 16 per cent will sell possessions in order to get the Christmas cash they need and 3 per cent will borrow from friends and family (although with personal finances under pressure, many friends will not be in a position to lend money even if they want to). Michael Ossei, personal finance expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'If you're struggling with your festive finances, and are thinking of turning to credit, I would urge you to use credit cards sensibly. 'Putting your spending on a card with 0 per cent on purchases could give you some breathing space. ' But the mass spending has been greeted with gloom by debt experts who fear that many people have gone back on their pledge not to use their credit cards to snap up sales bargains. There are growing concerns that large numbers of Britons will go into 2012 burdened by mountains of extra debts that they have no realistic chance of repaying. Not only are some risking being in debt next Christmas, they are still in debt from last Christmas. Cash-strapped shoppers will slash nearly £1billion from spending on non-essential goods such as electrical items, furniture and carpets next year. Retail sales are expected to grow by just 1.2 per cent to £295.3billion in 2012 - their third slowest year of growth in the past four decades - spelling more pain for the sector, according to a report by leading retail research firm Verdict. Sales of groceries will grow by 3.3 per cent as consumers eat more meals at home to save money, but spending on non-food items is set to shrink by about 0.5 per cent as the change in attitudes - from extravagant to austere - continues. That would mean retail non-food sales will have fallen by £9.5billion since the recession of 2008. Electricals, furniture, floor . coverings, DIY and gardening goods will be hardest hit, with sales down . by about £900million, and are unlikely to improve until mid-2013. Clothing . and footwear will grow by just 2.4 per cent, or £14 extra per person, . as a result of higher prices, but the rise in youth unemployment will . hit fashion retailers. The report, compiled in conjunction . with business analysis firm SAS, will add to fears that major retailers . are in danger of collapsing in coming weeks amid unprecedented levels of . price reductions. Among the most vulnerable are lingerie chain La Senza, Blacks Leisure and Millets. Stores . across the country saw scenes reminiscent of those before the economic . downturn as thousands of people flocked to the sales. From left to right: Sophie Maynara, Emma Halton and Finn Halton enjoy a spot of shopping in Birmingham . Crowded: Consumers all over the UK have flocked to shopping centres, such as Bullring in Birmingham . They were taking an average of at least £4.6million a minute, or £77,000 a second. Experts . said the predicted £10billion plus spend for the whole of this week . will be 2011's most lucrative for retailers, beating the pre-Christmas . rush. Consumers are expected to have spent at least £22.8billion by the . third week of January - £338million more than in the equivalent . post-Christmas period last year. Anita . Manan, an analyst at Experian, said: 'It's good to see so many people . visiting stores and the milder weather has helped. With retailers' quarterly rent due, the difficulty is that they are selling a lot of . stock at very low prices. 'What remains to be seen is if this quarter's takings are enough to see them through this difficult period to the next quarter.' The . peak weeks of Christmas trading are crucial to retailers as this period . accounts for nearly one-fifth of the UK retail industry's annual sales, . making stores fight harder than ever to tempt shoppers through their . doors. The beleaguered . retail sector has suffered from poor footfall figures during the course . of the year. High street takings were down by around £200million a week . in November versus October. Many retail managers have complained once-thriving shopping centres have come to resemble ghost towns. Shoppers crowd the Harrods doorway yesterday morning as the London store opened its Christmas sale . Bargain hunters: Shoppers at the Harrods winter sale search for big discounts . Christmas . sales were brought forward in many stores with discounts increasing on a . daily basis. Many stores are now offering 70 per cent or more off . items. Tom Nathan, manager . of London's Brent Cross shopping centre, said Boxing Day had been the . busiest ever – following on from a record breaking December 23 and . Christmas Eve. He said: 'We . have broken three records in three days in terms of numbers, with each . of the last three days being the biggest ever for the time of year.' Industry . insiders, however, say that despite the encouraging trading, some . big-name players may not make it through the next few weeks, with many . now due to pay their rent bills for the next quarter. La Senza, which has 146 stores and 18 concessions in the UK, has announced it plans to enter administration in coming days. And . Blacks Leisure, which owns 98 Blacks outlets and 208 Millets stores, . has fuelled speculation that it would go into administration in a move . that would allow rivals to cherry-pick its best assets. People rummage through handbags at Harrods yesterday as thousands descended on the Knightsbridge department store . Last . week chocolate-maker Thorntons said annual profits would miss . estimates, while music chain HMV said weak sales may cast 'significant . doubt' on its future.

John Lewis, Harrods and Ikea all joined the retail frenzy, launching in-store sales on top of those already started online. High . shopper numbers and busy traffic were reported at centres across . Britain, including Bluewater in Kent, the Trafford Centre in Manchester . and the MetroCentre in Gateshead. Professor . Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'I . don't think we're stretching it to say the 26th and 27th of December . combined have been the best ever, certainly if we include online sales. I'd have thought it could be a record two-day takings. 'People . have definitely been waiting for the sales. Many decided to play a . waiting game with retailers in anticipation of deep sales cuts.

Kim Jong II's son was today reportedly in control of one of North Korea's highest decision-making bodies as he prepared to take power. Nine days after the death of his father,  Kim Jong Un was named head of the key ruling Workers' Party Central Committee by the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun. Over the weekend he was hailed as the 'Supreme Leader' of the 1.2-million strong military and will be the third-generation Kim to rule the nation of 24 million. Leader in waiting: Kim Jong Il's heir Kim Jong Un visits Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang, to pay respects to his father . As the country continued official mourning until the funeral on Wednesday, two leading South Koreans have crossed the border to pay their respects to the dead dictator. Former South Korean First Lady Lee Hee-ho and Hyundai firm head Mrs Hyun Jung-Eun will spend two days in the country. South Korea has only allowed the two delegations to visit and pay condolences angering Pyongyang, which . has since warned of 'catastrophic consequences' for relations between the warring neighbours. But the two women have been given special . permission to pay their respects in person, because both families have . received personal condolences from the North in the past, according to . the BBC. Mourning: Kim Jong Un leads senior officers at Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang . Mrs Lee, 89, crossed the border with 56-year-old Mrs Hyu in a delegation of 18.They will visit Pyongyang's Kumsusan Memorial Palace where Kim's body is lying in state, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry. She said: 'I hope that our visit will help improve South-North relations.' Dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong II who died on December 17 . Kim Jong Il's youngest son is in his late 20s and was unveiled 15 months ago as his father's choice as successor. Even as North Koreans braved icy weather to visit 'mourning stations' set up around the country, the state media were providing details about Kim Jong Un's rise to power.

State television also showed  footage showing his uncle and key patron, Jang Song Thaek, wearing a military uniform with a general's insignia. He is normally dressed in a business suit and this is seen as the strongest indication he will play a crucial role in helping the young man hold a grip on power and inherit his father's trademark 'military-first' policy.

The weeping, cash-strapped relatives of a woman torched in the elevator of her apartment building said Thursday she was kind-hearted and that by helping a homeless man in an act of charity, paid the ultimate price. Deloris Gillespie's children told reporters that the 73-year-old had hired Jerome Isaac to do some chores in her Brooklyn apartment. And on December 17, 'he ended up killing her,' said Ms Gillespie's son, Everett Hayes, holding back tears. 'For someone to set someone on fire - that's ridiculous!' he said. 'I mean, what is this country coming to?' Mr Hayes joined Gillespie's daughter, cousin and brother at a news conference in the offices of New York City Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn, who has been assisting them in the days after Ms Gillespie's death. Grieving family: Everett Gillespie (right) embraces his sister Sheila Gillespie Hillsman during a news conference to discuss the murder of their mother . They sat side by side, with a smiling picture of Ms Gillespie taped on the wall behind them. A memorial service is scheduled for Friday at the First A.M.E. Zion Church in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood. The family says it doesn't have enough money to pay for the service or other costs related to the death. According to the New York Post, the family doesn’t have the official death certificate because the medical examiner can't officially identify Ms Gillespie, as she was so badly burned. Charred: The fifth floor of Ms Gillespie's apartment building was left badly burned, as was Jerome Issac, who is accused of murdering her . They may have to wait months for the DNA results, which mean funeral arrangements must be put on hold. The handyman, Jerome Isaac, is charged with first-degree murder and arson in Ms Gillespie's death. 'Deloris was always aware that she was her brother's keeper.' -Tracey Gillespie . Police say he cornered her in the elevator as it opened on the fifth floor of her apartment building in the Prospect Heights neighbourhood, then sprayed her with gasoline and set her ablaze as she screamed. Surveillance cameras captured Isaac wearing an exterminator's mask and gloves as he ignited her with a barbecue lighter. He surrendered to police a day later, reeking of gasoline. Isaac, 47, told police Ms Gillespie owed him money – around $2,000. She had told neighbours the handyman was stealing from her. Caught on camera: A still from surveillance video allegedly shows Isaac spraying Ms Gillespie before lighting a Molotov cocktail . A defence attorney said last week he had been in touch with his client and would evaluate all possible defences. Daughter Sheila Gillespie Hillsman said she helped the Manhattan medical examiner's office identify her mother's remains so a positive identification could be made and a death certificate issued. Ms Hillsman travelled from her home in Gary, Indiana, after getting the news and said the New York community responded with open arms to the family's grief. 'It's just been really hard, but I've really received a lot of love from New York, and I really appreciate it,' she told the Associated Press. 'I got a lot of hugs on the street.' Ms James said a Manhattan hedge fund manager who did not know Ms Gillespie had come forward offering to donate $10,000 to pay for the memorial service and other expenses. Charred: The elevator where Ms Gillespie died in a ball of flames . But there was no such deposit in the fund that the politician set up to help the family; only $800 is now available, donated by friends and neighbours. Ms James said she spoke again with the money manager Thursday, was assured he would cover the costs and considered the issue resolved. Mr Hayes, of Stuart, Florida, said he was out of money. 'We're at the bottom now,' he said. His mother, at the time of her death, was still working as a clerk at a post office in Brooklyn's East New York neighbourhood. A native of Bastrop, Louisiana, she had moved to New York as a young woman, settling in Brooklyn, where she attended a Baptist church while reaching out to anyone who was struggling in a neighbourhood that has rapidly been gentrifying, relatives said. 'Deloris was always aware that she was her brother's keeper,' said her cousin, Tracey Gillespie, also from Gary, Indiana.

"By . David Richards . Last updated at 11:53 AM on 28th December 2011 . Christians in northern Nigeria said today they feared that a spate of Christmas Day bombings by Islamist militants could lead to a religious war in Africa's most populous country. The attacks killed more than two dozen people. The warning was made by the northern branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), an umbrella organisation comprising various denominations including Catholics, Protestant and pentecostal churches. A car burns outside St Theresa Catholic Church at Suleja, Neigeria, after an explosion on Christmas Day. Five bombs exploded that day at churches in the country . A member of the clergy examines the devastation outside St Theresa Catholic Church with security forces. The Boko Haram Islamist sect, which aims to impose sharia Islamic law across Nigeria, claimed responsibility for the blasts, . The Boko Haram Islamist sect, which aims to impose sharia Islamic law across Nigeria, claimed responsibility for the blasts, the second Christmas in a row it has caused carnage at Christian churches. Saidu Dogo, secretary general for CAN in Nigeria's 19 northern provinces called on Muslim leaders to control their faithful, saying Christians will be forced to defend themselves against further attacks. 'We fear that the situation may degenerate to a religious war and Nigeria may not be able to survive one. Once again, ""enough is enough!"",' Dogo said. The attacks risk reviving tit-for-tat sectarian violence between the mostly Muslim north and the largely Christian south, which has claimed thousands of lives in the past decade. Dogo said the CAN was calling on all Christians to continue respecting the law but to defend themselves when needed. 'We shall henceforth in the midst of these provocations and wanton destruction of innocent lives and property be compelled to make our own efforts and arrangements to protect the lives of innocent Christians and peace-loving citizens of this country,' Dogo said. The most deadly attack killed at least 27 people in the St Theresa Catholic church in Madalla, a town on the edge of the capital Abuja, and devastated surrounding buildings and cars as faithful poured out of the church after Christmas mass. Security forces also blamed the sect for two explosions in the north targeting their facilities. Officials have confirmed 32 people died in the wave of attacks across Nigeria, though local media have put the number higher. But the church bombs are more worrying because they raise fears that Boko Haram is trying to ignite a sectarian civil war in the nearly 160million nation split evenly between Christians and Muslims, who for the most part co-exist in peace. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has come under pressure to do more fight the growing security threat which risks derailing economic gains in the OPEC member and Africa's top oil-producing nation. Nigeria's main opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari, a northerner and former military ruler who lost a presidential election in April to Jonathan, accused the government of incompetence on Monday, saying government was slow to respond and had shown indifference to the bombings. The CAN said in the statement that it was concerned that the perpetrators and their sponsors 'are well-known to government and no serious or decisive actions have been taken to stem their nefarious activities'.",'We fear that the situation may degenerate to a religious war and Nigeria may not be able to survive one'
"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 9:38 PM on 29th December 2011 . A soldier who had gone absent without leave has been charged with the murder of a 19-year-old woman who was stabbed after returning from a late-night walk. Scarlett Paxton was found dead with a stab wound to the neck outside her apartment in Juanita, Washington state after returning from a late-night walk with her boyfriend, Michael Lawson, with whom she lived. The vivacious brunette and her boyfriend had gone on a walk around their neighbourhood on November 30 before she became upset and decided to return to the property on her own. Killed: Brunette Scarlett Paxton was found stabbed to death outside her apartment in Kirkland, Washington state on November 30 . Lawson later found her body slumped against her apartment door with a deep stab wound to her neck and cuts on her hands, legs and chin. Police have since charged Private 1st Class Dakota Wolf, also 19, with first degree murder after bloody fingerprints matching his were found at a trash bin near the scene of the killing. In the weeks since her death Lawson has posted about his struggles on Facebook. On December 23 the heartbroken 19-year-old wrote, 'I miss Scarlett so bad that it's making me feel physically ill. It feels like I'm dying of loneliness or something.' Paxton was walking alone back to her flat after a fight with her boyfriend Michael Lawson, pictured here, who has been heartbroken since her death . Lawson wrote that the loss of Scarlett (pictured left with her sister Holly) has filled him with rage at Dakota and like he himself is dying of heartbreak . Weeks earlier, when Dakota was named a suspect, Lawson expressed his rage on the social networking site. 'I have never been so very filled with anger and hatred towards another human being in my life. It feels like my chest is going to explode,' he posted. 'I hope that Dakota Wolf is forced to feel the same pain, fear and loneliness that Scarlett was for the rest of his existence on this planet and beyond.' Earlier this week he wrote, 'Hey everyone, Merry Christmas. And to all who have been so supportive through this ordeal and the loss of Scarlett, Thank you so much. You have done more for me than you know. Paxton's mother has said she became upset and returned home alone after believing Lawson had suggested the walk to lose weight . Detectives are now investigating . whether the soldier, who had gone absent without leave from Joint Base . Lewis-McChord, knew the female victim. Authorities have said there is evidence that Paxton and Wolf had visited the same teen center in Kirkland, Washington state. Lt. Mike Murray of the Kirkland Police Department said: 'We have not been able to put a link to them as far as knowing each other in any way at this point.' 'Right now the best we can determine is it's still just a random assault.' Wolf has denied any involvement in Paxton's death, but admitted being in the same general area as her. Paxton's mother, Michelle Diggins, said her daughter had gone out for a late-night walk with her Lawson, also 19, shortly after 1:30 a.m. on Nov 30. Death scene: Emergency services tried in vain to save Scarlett after her boyfriend found her slumped outside her front door . Suspect: Dakota Wolf's bloody fingerprints were found in a trash bin near the scene of Scarlett's death . But she became upset and returned home alone after believing Lawson had suggested the stroll because she needed to lose weight. Mrs Diggins said: 'She wasn't heavy. And that's not the way he meant it at all; he really loves her. But... like most young women, Scarlett could be self-conscious.' Lawson later discovered his girlfriend's body and dialled 911, but emergency services were unable to save her. Murder suspect Wolf told detectives he had been smoking synthetic cannabis that night, and had for some time been suffering from 'paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety and memory issues,' along with problems with anger management, according to prosecution documents. Army Major Christopher Ophardt, a spokesman at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, said Wolf had been scheduled to go on a training mission to Ft. Irwin, California, but failed to report, before going absent without leave 'for good' on Nov 15.","Scarlett Paxton found with knife wound outside home .

"By . Liz Hull . Last updated at 1:40 AM on 30th December 2011 . At first glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking these photos are of two different women. In fact, both are Kim Robinshaw – . before and after she was hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted . with a gastric band in a desperate bid to lose weight. The primary school teacher has now dropped nearly five dress sizes after losing eight stones in just 14 months. Kim Robinson, 31, who existed 'liquid only' diet in a bid to control her weight, was delighted as she tucked into her first Christmas dinner in two years . And she revealed yesterday how the achievement meant she could enjoy her first solid Christmas dinner for two years on Sunday. Mrs Robinshaw, who tipped the scales at 21 stones when she began the treatment, said: ‘I think the results are incredible. ‘I’ve still got a bit more weight to . lose, but I just can’t get over it. It’s given me the willpower, it’s . changed my life completely.’ The 31-year-old said she had . struggled with her weight since having an over-active thyroid gland . removed as a teenager. She had to have a hysterectomy in 2006 and blames . hormone replacement therapy for causing her weight to creep up as she . began comfort eating, snacking on crisps and chocolate. At her heaviest, . she wore size 24 clothes. But when her husband, Alan, 46, told . her about a colleague’s amazing weight loss due to gastric band . hypnotism, she was intrigued. So she paid £275 for ten sessions with hypnotist Andrew Nelson in October last year. Transformation: Kim on holiday in Turkey last year (left) and today after shedding more than 7 stones (right) Last year Kim resorted to pureeing her entire Christmas lunch so she could join her family at the dinner table . He managed to convince her that she . had had surgery to have a gastric band fitted. He put her on an eating . plan similar to that of real patients, forcing her to begin with pureed . food before building up to solids. To her amazement, within days she . started shedding the pounds. ‘Basically you feel like your stomach is the size of your fist,’ said Mrs Robinshaw of Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire. ‘At the start you only have liquids, yoghurts for breakfast and soup for lunch and dinner – and I was full up. ‘If I had too much I would feel sick and that’s how you’re meant to feel if you actually had it done.’ It meant she was forced to eat a pureed Christmas dinner last year. That's better: Kim enjoyed preparing a proper Christmas dinner this year after finally losing the weight . ‘When my mum put the pureed dinner in front of me, I felt sick just looking at it. But she’d gone to all that effort so I had to try it,’ added Mrs Robinshaw, who now wears size 14-16 clothes. ‘Had I been able to afford a real band I may have thought about it, but I really didn’t want more surgery so this was another option. I was willing to try anything. ‘I’ve still got a bit more to lose, I’d like to be a comfortable size 14. But so far I’m delighted with the results.’ Mr Nelson said the treatment created the ‘same feelings experienced with surgery, but without the discomfort, inconvenience and cost’.","Pain-free therapy tricked woman into thinking she had undergone weight loss surgery .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 12:02 PM on 29th December 2011 . A man wearing an Afghan army uniform today killed two French NATO service members after turning his weapon against them. The members of the French Foreign Legion were killed in eastern Afghanistan. It is not yet known whether the attacker escaped. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he learned of the deaths 'with great sadness' and offered his condolences to their loved ones. Time limit: The attack highlights the pressure U.S. and NATO troops face as they rush to train Afghan security forces . The shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their coalition partners. Such attacks have raised fears of increased Taliban infiltration of the Afghan police and army as NATO speeds up the training of the security forces. The killing comes on the same day as a roadside bombing killed 10 police officers and wounded one other in southwestern Helmand province. A spokesman for the provincial governor, Daud Ahmadi, and police chief Haji Abdul Marjan said today's explosion destroyed a police pick-up truck as it drove through Zarghun Kalay village in Helmand's Nad Ali district. Both officials said the officers had left a training centre and were headed home when their vehicle struck the bomb. Marjan said they drove along the same road every day, with eight of those killed being new recruits. Attack: The shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their coalition partners . Nad Ali, which had been run by British troops, was one of the districts in Helmand that last month transitioned, under much fanfare, from NATO to Afghan security control. In 2010, a rogue Afghan soldier believed to be a 'trusted comrade' who regularly acted as a go-between to settle disagreements among British and Afghan forces betrayed British troops when he turned on them. Talib Hussein, 23, killed three members of the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles when he launched a brutal attack at Patrol Base Three, a dusty fortress near Bababi in central Helmand, with a machinegun and a rocket-propelled grenade under cover of darkness. He shot dead Major James Bowman's in his tent as he slept. He then killed Lt Neal Turkington and senior Nepalese Gurkha soldier Corporal Arjun Purja Pun by firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the shipping container used as the base's operations room. The handover was the second step in a transition that President Hamid Karzai hopes will leave Afghan forces in control of the entire country by the end of 2014, when the U.S.-led coalition's combat mission is scheduled to end. The shooting follows an incident last week when an Afghan soldier opened fire on coalition troops inside an outpost in western Herat province, wounding a number of alliance troops. The attacker was killed. NATO's training mission hopes have about 350,000 troops trained and ready by the end of 2014. Eastern Afghanistan has become the focus of coalition efforts against insurgents, who infiltrate into Afghanistan across the rugged frontier from safe havens in neighbouring Pakistan. The U.S. and its allies have asked Pakistan to crack down on the safe haves in that country's lawless tribal areas, but relations between the two militaries have reached rock bottom following a NATO cross-border attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last month. The two NATO deaths bring December's toll of foreign troops killed in Afghanistan to 25, for a total of 541 so far this year. This year has been the most deadly for French forces in Afghanistan since an international operation began there in 2001. The deaths bring to 78 the number of troops France has lost in the conflict.","Fears grow Taliban infiltration of Afghan police & army .

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 7:47 AM on 30th December 2011 . France and Germany are lagging behind Britain on aid spending to poor countries, a report says. Both countries have failed to hit EU targets and have barely increased their spending in recent months. Their reluctance to spend on the Third World contrasts with David Cameron’s determination to ensure that British taxpayers meet our full commitment to overseas spending. Reluctant: French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right have been criticised for their countries' lack of foreign aid spending . The Prime Minister has come under increasing criticism for raising aid spending by £1.4billion last year in the name of hitting international targets for help for poor countries. It brought Britain’s overall aid spending to around £9billion at a time of spending cuts in public services. Critics say much of this is wasted on bureaucracy or misappropriated by corrupt officials and governments abroad. There are also growing numbers of Tory backbenchers opposed to spending large sums of money in aid to comparatively wealthy countries. India, which is rich enough to afford nuclear weapons and a space programme, is to get £1.4billion from British taxpayers to ease poverty over the next five years. David Cameron is determined to ensure British taxpayers meet our full commitment to overseas spending . Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that Britain continues to send aid money to Brazil, even though the Latin American country has now raced ahead of Britain in the world economic league table. France and Germany’s lack of aid spending was disclosed in a report by the EU statistical arm Eurostat. It put the level of British foreign aid in 2010 at 0.56 per cent of national income, in line with European targets and on course for the United Nations ambition for wealthy nations to put 0.7 per cent of their spending into aid by 2015. But Germany put less than 0.4 per cent of its income into aid, barely increased on 2009 levels. France was at just under 0.5 per cent, again a figure only slightly increased in a year. The EU report was critical of the failure of some countries to push up their aid spending. ‘Contributions varied considerably between member states in 2010,’ it said. ‘It seems unlikely that the EU will achieve its 2015 target. At current growth rates, it would only happen around 2040.’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under domestic criticism for her reluctance to keep promises of big increases in aid spending. And French President Nicolas Sarkozy promised a 20 per cent increase in aid last year. But critics say France is trying to pad its figures with debt relief, remittances sent by immigrant workers in France, and spending on its overseas territories. The United States pays out around 0.2 per cent of its income in foreign aid.","Both countries have failed to hit EU targets and have barely increased their spending in recent months .

"By . Sharon Baker . Last updated at 2:00 AM on 24th December 2011 . A young girl who spent last Christmas battling for her life in hospital will enjoy her first festive dinner this year - despite losing her fingers and a foot to meningitis. Kaiya Jackson will use special cutlery that attaches to her wrists in order to eat her Christmas turkey and will also manage to unwrap her gifts from Father Christmas using just her stumps. The two-year-old was rushed by critical care ambulance to Birmingham Children's Hospital on December 16 last year and spent the next 10 days in an induced coma while her tiny body fought the blood-poisoning bug septicaemia. Recovery: Kaiya lost the fingers from both hands to meningitis (left). She has now learnt how to use a fork using special cutlery attached to her wrists . Her mother Ashley Ward, 24, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'When December 16 came round this year, my partner Dan and I shuddered to think that it was a year since Kaiya went to hospital. 'It doesn't feel like a year - it feels like yesterday. But to look at her and to see how far she has come in the last 12 months is incredible. 'I know she's my daughter and I'm bound to say this, but she's the bravest and most amazing little girl I know.' Full-time carer Ashley and her partner Dan Jackson, 24, who works in food production, first noticed Kaiya was poorly when she developed a fever while Ashley was six months pregnant with her little brother Jayden, now nine months. The local GP said she had a virus and sent Ashley away with directions to give her daughter children's Nurofen and to keep an eye on her. But Ashley's mother's intuition told her something was amiss and she and her partner took her to Dan's mother's house where they would be just a few minutes drive from the hospital. Kaiya appeared to rally but not long afterwards Ashley noticed two, small, purple marks on the backs of her legs. After removing her nappy she discovered Kaiya was covered in a blotchy purple rash and recognising instantly one of the tell-tale signs of meningitis, rushed her to the local hospital in Burton-on-Trent. Ashley (left) said she may have gone overboard on Christmas decorations this year as it is the first proper celebration that her daughter has enjoyed . Ashley said: 'It was like something out of a film. There was about 20 doctors there, pricking her with needles and hooking her up to drips, rushing around. It was just total panic. 'It felt like a nightmare, Kaiya was crying and I was crying too but I didn't want to look at her because I didn't want her to see that I was upset.' It was soon decided that Kaiya needed specialist treatment and she was rushed by critical care ambulance to Birmingham Children's Hospital and placed immediately in intensive care. Doctors told Ashley and Dan that the next 48 hours were crucial and that there was a chance she might not survive. Ashley said: 'From that point on all we could think about was getting her through the next 48 hours. It was horrendous seeing her hooked up to all these wires and tubes and her whole body apart from her belly was almost black with septicaemia. 'Her body had ballooned up from all the fluid inside her. All Dan and I could do was look on in horror.' Kaiya battled through the next few days and Ashley and Dan moved into the hospital accommodation so they could spend every waking minute with their daughter. As Christmas Day arrived, rather than opening her gifts under the tree Kaiya gave her parents a present they had been waiting for by taking her first breaths away from a ventilator. Kaiya had turned a corner but the septicaemia had taken a horrible toll on her body. Doctors explained how they would have to remove all her fingers including part of one hand and perform multiple skin grafts. She endured dozens of operations and earlier this month it was decided that it would be best for the growing toddler to have her damaged foot amputated as well in order to allow her to walk with a prosthetic. Dan said: 'I was so worried about how it would affect her. I wondered if she would be able to play with her toys or do all the things other children could do. 'But mostly we were just glad she was still here with us. We saw other children in the hospital with meningitis that had not been as lucky as Kaiya.' Ashley added: 'She was in hospital for three months and needed lots of physiotherapy afterwards just to do things like lifting her own head up as she was so weak. 'I was worried how she would cope with things like playing with her toys and sometimes I would stop myself from buying her things in the supermarket, thinking to myself, 'Will she even be able to play with this?' 'Now, I wonder what I worried about. There is not one toy in the house she can't play with. 'In the future we will look at getting her prosthetic hands but we will leave that decision to her as at the moment she can pick up the tiniest crumb on the floor and nothing seems to faze her. 'She crawls about and walks on her knees but hopefully that will change when she gets her new foot in January. 'I can't wait to take her and her brother to the park. She keeps asking me when she will be able to walk and have new shoes.'Kaiya has adapted well to the challenges she faces without her fingers and has even learned how to eat using a special fork and spoon that attach to her wrist. Ashley said: 'This Christmas will be like her first proper Christmas as she was only five months old for the first one, then spent last year in hospital and didn't get any presents until March. 'It makes it extra special knowing how close we came to not having her here and I think I might have gone a bit overboard with presents and decorations this year. 'As Kaiya gets older I hope she understands that losing her fingers was what saved her life. 'I want other parents to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis as if I had not recognised the signs she might not be here with us this Christmas at all.'","Parents reveal how they could only look on in horror as toddler fought life-threatening blood-poisoning bug .

'I like . chucking myself around the goal like a lunatic. I’ve had lots of bruises . but amazingly I’ve never had any serious football injuries in nearly 70 . years.' Mr Lee began kicking a ball in the playground when he was six and joined his school team four years later.

But since 1949 I have played in goal, I just really enjoy it.' Mr Lee formed Thorplands Club 81, a Sunday League team with his workmates, after he left the RAF in 1974. Since then he has established three additional adult teams, three youth teams and the RAF veterans’ team, which he founded to help older players exercise on a regular basis.

He said: 'I usually play at least 20 . minutes in a match but I like to play for longer if I can. I played a . whole game a couple of weeks ago and I was creaking a bit afterwards. 'I have an exercise bike to keep fit at home between matches, which I use for 20 minutes a day and I do crunches on a bench. 'I still feel like a six-year-old boy at heart when I play, although my body tells me differently.' Mr Lee, who has only ever had a knee injury and some bruises throughout his lengthy amateur football career, even has plans to start a second veteran’s team next year so he can play more matches. He said: 'I want to continue playing football for as long as I can.'

A newborn baby has miraculously beaten the odds to make it home for her first Christmas after becoming the smallest person to ever undergo a pioneering open heart surgery procedure. Daisie Downie needed the life-saving operation after she was born six weeks premature with a rare condition that prevented blood from going to her lungs directly from her heart. Weighing just 5lbs 2oz, she was far too small for surgeons to operate on so a team of medics began a battle to keep her alive. Survivor: Daisie Downie underwent a life-saving operation at Southampton General Hospital after she was born six weeks premature with a rare condition that prevented blood from going to her lungs directly from her heart . The longer Daisie had a chance to . grow, the better her chance of surviving corrective surgery normally . performed on a six- to nine-month-old. But at just three weeks old her condition became critical and doctors at Southampton General Hospital could delay no longer. She . became the smallest baby to have a revolutionary procedure to repair a . hole in her heart and a blocked valve during six hours on the operating . table. Daisie's mother Deliah Downie, 34, is overjoyed her miracle baby is doing so well she made it home in time for Christmas. She . said: 'Daisie is my own Christmas miracle. She was so tiny and so . critically ill there were times when I feared she would never make it. 'To have her home for a family Christmas and for her to be doing so well is the only present I could have wished for.' Mrs . Downie and her husband Kev, 38, from Whiteley, Hampshire, first learned . there was a problem with their baby's heart when they went for a . 20-week scan. Overjoyed: Daisie's mother Deliah Downie, 34, is looking forward to spending Christmas with her miracle baby . The . couple, who also have two sons - George, six, and Harrison, three - were . told the baby had a hole in her heart and a narrowing of the arteries. At 34 weeks, a consultant cardiologist found the artery was not just narrow, but completely blocked. But he estimated Daisie would be 10lbs by the time she was full-term and big enough for them to operate on. Two . days later however, Mrs Downie suddenly went into labour and Daisie . arrived six weeks premature on October 29 weighing only a little over . 5lbs. She went from intensive care to a cardiac ward where she was put on medication to keep her alive. Mrs Downie said: 'The plan was to keep her stable and give her time to grow as much as possible.' Medics decided that when she reached 6lbs 6oz, Daisie would have a shunt to open up her artery. Until she hit that weight, her body would be too tiny to accommodate the smallest tube available. This . tube would temporarily repair her heart and be left in place until she . was at least six months old and big enough to have further surgery to . completely repair her heart. But . at three weeks the medication keeping her alive stopped working so . doctors decided they had to operate immediately to save her life, . despite the fact she was still only 5lbs 3oz. After . six hours in surgery, surgeon Markku Kaarne told Mrs Downie he had . managed to fully repair her heart by fixing her valve and closing the . hole in a single operation. Mrs . Downie said: 'I couldn't believe they had done it. They had been . telling me she was far too small for this surgery but they managed it. 'Apart from a small scar on her chest, you can't tell she has been through such major work.' Dr Kevin Roman, consultant . cardiologist at Southampton General Hospital, said: 'Daisie had a . pulmonary valve which was blocked and had a large hole between the two . pumping chambers of the heart. There was no way for the blood to get to . the lungs. 'She is the smallest baby we have ever had for this type of repair in the heart. 'The vast majority of children who have this operation are six to nine months old and consequently much bigger. 'Even a baby twice her size would have been very sick in intensive care afterwards. 'In . a tiny premature baby, things were much more difficult. It was a great . team effort and we're all delighted she made it home in time for . Christmas.'","Daisie Downie was born six weeks premature with a rare condition .

"Last updated at 4:17 PM on 27th December 2011 . North Korea's next leader appeared to embrace a warming of relations with the country's cross-border foes by welcoming a party of South Korean delegates to his father's memorial. Kim Jong Un met a former South Korean first lady and a prominent business leader as he visited the body of Kim Jong Il for the fourth time since the his father's death. Clearly emotional, Kim wiped tears from his eyes while paying his respects at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pynongyang yesterday. Scroll down for videos . Warming relations: Lee Hee-ho (left), widow of former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung, shakes hands with new North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after she paid her respects to his father Kim Jong-il . Mourning: Kim Jong-un (front) walks with a row of top military officers past his father's body at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang . Emotional: Kim Jong Un wipes tears from his eyes as he honours his late father ahead of tomorrow's funeral . During . Kim's meeting with the private delegation of South Koreans, he thanked . them after they expressed condolences and sympathy over his father's . death. The lead delegates . were the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who . engineered a 'sunshine' engagement policy with the North and held a . landmark summit with Kim Jong Il in 2000, and Hyundai Group Chairwoman . Hyun Jeong-eun, whose late husband had ties to the North. North Korea . sent delegations to Seoul when the women's husbands died. They stood in a line on a red carpet . and bowed silently during their visit to the Kumsusan palace, where Kim . Jong Il's bier is surrounded by flowers and flanked by an honor guard, . footage from AP Television News in Pyongyang showed. Kim . Jong Un and the two women later exchanged handshakes and clasped their . hands when they had brief conversations. Their conversations were . inaudible. Rise to power: Kim Jong-un has become head of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party - a position that appears to make him the top official in the ruling party . Respect: Kim Jong Un bows his head in honour of his father . Through the . meeting, Kim appeared to be sending a message pushing South Korea to . pursue previously agreed upon cooperative projects that would give his . country much-needed hard currency, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at . Seoul-based University of North Korean Studies. Monday's meeting appeared to be Kim's first meeting with South Koreans since his father's death. It . was also the fourth time the North's media reported that Kim had . visited the memorial palace since his father's death, according to . Seoul's Unification Ministry. It seems clear now that Kim Jong Un, . who is in his late 20s, is now in position to extend the Kim family's . control over the country of 24million people to a third generation. Late . Monday, Pyongyang called Kim a 'sagacious leader' and 'dear' comrade as . he again paid respects to his father, whose body is lying in state at . Kumsusan Memorial Palace. State media have already dubbed him as a 'great successor' and 'outstanding leader.' Thoughtful gesture: South Korean delegates, led by Lee Hee-ho (front left) and Hyundai Group chairman Hyun Jeong-eun (front centre), pay their respects to Kim Jong Il . Lauded: Kim Jong Il's bier is surrounded by flowers and flanked by an honor guard at the palace . The official Korean Central News Agency also indicated that Kim will uphold his father's 'military-first' policy. 'As . dear comrade Kim Jong Un, who is a sagacious leader of our party, state . and military, is at the forefront of our revolutionary cause, the . history of our father and general's glorious military-first revolution . will continue,' it said. His grandfather Kim Il Sung, a revered . figure, founded North Korea in 1948 and was succeeded by Kim Jong Il, . who ruled for 17 years. Just as North Korea created a . cult of personality around the previous two Kims, the youngest Kim has . also been showered with intense praise and new titles in the state . media. The main Rodong Sinmun newspaper . described him Monday as head of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party - a post that appears to make him the top official in the ruling . party. Earlier, the . North referred to him as 'supreme leader' of the 1.2 million-strong . armed forces and said the military's top leaders had pledged their . loyalty to him. On Tuesday, the two lead South Korean . delegates met Kim Yong Nam, president of Presidium of North Korea's . parliament, who often represents the country and is considered a nominal . head of state, according to the APTN footage. The delegates were to . return to South Korea later today. Dynasty: Pictures of Kim Jong Un's grandfather Kim Il Sung and father Kim Jong Il at the unification observation post near the border village of the Panmunjom. Kim Jong Un is now in position to extend the family's control over the country . Kim Jong Un's new titles are slight variations of those held by his father, but appear to carry the same weight. It was unclear whether the nation's constitution had been changed to reflect the transfer of leadership as when Kim Jong Il took power after his father's death. Mourning continued, meanwhile, despite frigid winter weather, in the final days before Kim Jong Il's funeral, which is set to take place Wednesday, and a memorial Thursday. People continued lining up in central Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, where a massive portrait that usually features Kim Il Sung has been replaced by one of Kim Jong Il, to bow before his smiling image and to lay funeral flowers. Heated buses stood by to give mourners a respite from the cold, and hot tea and water were distributed from beverage kiosks. The funeral of Kim Jong Il will be watched closely for clues to who will gain power and who will fall out of favour under the next leader, his son Kim Jong Un. However the state ceremonies over Wednesday and Thursday are also likely to bear the hallmarks of Kim Jong Il's rule, including more of a military presence for the man who elevated the armed forces as part of his ""songun,"" or ""military first,"" policy. Kim, who has been lying in state since he died on December 17, celebrated major occasions with lavish, meticulously choreographed parades designed to show off the nation's military might, such as the October 2010 display when he introduced his son and anointed successor to the world. ""A display of weapons may also be a way to demonstrate that the military remains loyal to the succession process,"" said Ahn Chan-il of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in South Korea. ""There may even be a small-scale military parade involving aeroplanes."" Like his father was when former leader Kim Il Sung died in 1994, Kim Jong Un has been stoic in a dark blue Mao-style suit in mourning period appearances - but so far without the black armband that Kim Jong Il wore at the funeral to mark him as head mourner.","Thanks former South Korean first lady and prominent business leader for their condolences over Kim Jong Il's death .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:33 PM on 30th December 2011 . The trailer park babysitter who allegedly bludgeoned a nine-year-old girl to death before wrapping her body in bin bags, putting it in his freezer and dismembering it was today charged with murder. Michael Plumadore, 39, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of last Thursday before she was reported missing the next day. He had been looking after the girl and her two younger sisters because their mother was ill. He had cared for Aliahna's dying grandfather and her family saw him as a trusted friend and neighbour. Death: Michael Plumadore, left, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', right, who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of last Thursday before she was reported missing last Friday . Plumadore is jailed without bond and the charges will be read to him in prison. A court hearing on his three charges is scheduled for next Wednesday and he could face the death penalty if convicted. The murder jail sentence in Indiana is up to 65 years. He is also charged with abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene, which each carry maximum jail terms of three years. Plumadore told police he hit the girl in the head with a brick. He then allegedly put the girl's body inside bin bags and stuffed it inside a freezer in the trailer where he had lived with her grandfather. He told authorities he later used a hacksaw to dismember her body. Police arrested him on Monday, two days after more than 100 emergency workers searched where he and Aliahna's family lived. Police said Plumadore told them he had hidden Aliahna's head, feet and hands at the rundown trailer park and discarded her other remains at a business nearby. Horrifying: Michael Plumadore poses next to the chair he where says little Aliahna Lemmon was last sleeping. Authorities say he had already killed her and her body parts were in his freezer at the time of this photo . Authorities obtained a warrant to search the trailer on Monday and found the body parts then. He has previously been convicted of trespassing, assault and forgery in three different states. 'I can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to talk about. I had no reason to suspect anything' Dawayne Maroney, father . The girl’s tearful mother Tarah Souders was seen clenching a fist near her mouth at a candlelight vigil held for the little girl in Fort Wayne on Tuesday night. It also emerged this week that there was a warrant out for Plumadore's arrest 11 years before the murder. He was charged with battery of a first-responder in 2000 and was given felony probation. But he failed to report to his probation officer, fulfil his community service hours or complete an anger management course. Plumadore was reported an absconder in June 2000. Greg Shumaker, one of 15 convicted sex offenders who lives at the park, recalled Aliahna's family moving to the trailer park to help take care of 66-year-old James E 'Shorty' Lemmon. Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes . Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home next to Michael Plumadore's residence on Tuesday . He was also a convicted sex offender and died on December 3. Mr Shumaker said Aliahna's grandfather Mr Lemmon was 'getting old' and 'had trouble breathing.' Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting . Mr Shumaker said he introduced Plumadore . to Mr Lemmon shortly after Plumadore moved into the trailer park, and . Plumadore moved in with Mr Lemmon a few days later. Mr Shumaker said he knew Mr Lemmon because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together. Plumadore is not a registered sex offender in Indiana. But Mr Lemmon had assured Ms Souders that there was nothing to worry about, Mr Shumaker said. Paulette Hair, 45, a former manager at the trailer park who lives at a nearby trailer park, said she also knew Mr Lemmon was a sex offender. 'He stayed out of everybody's way,' she said. Mr Shumaker said Plumadore briefly moved away, but returned when Ms Souders, 28, asked him to care for her father. Aliahna's . father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore . through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him. 'I . can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to . talk about,' he said. 'I had no reason to suspect anything.' Mr Maroney said he hadn't recently talked with his daughter or her mother, because they frequently changed their phone number.","Michael Plumadore, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon'

The mother of a 20-month-old girl who went missing nearly two weeks in Maine is appealing to the toddler’s father to contact her. Trista Reynolds told NBC’s 'Today' show on Thursday that Justin DiPietro has refused to talk to her since their daughter, Ayla, went missing in Waterville. She said she has questions that only he can answer since he’s the last person to have seen her before she was reported missing on December 17. Scroll down for video . Conflicted: Trista Reynolds told NBC¿s 'Today' show on Thursday that Justin DiPietro has refused to talk to her since their daughter, Ayla, went missing in Waterville . Father: Justin DiPietro (left) told police he last saw Ayla (right) when he put her to bed the night of December 16. He said she was wearing green pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them . 'He says he's not in hiding, but why . won't he come out? Why won't he talk to me? Why is he staying away?' Ms . Reynolds said during an interview with Matt Lauer. 'What is he so afraid of to not come out or to talk to me?' Ms Reynolds appeared conflicted asked . whether she believes DiPietro was involved in Ayla's disappearance, and . questioned his parenting skills. 'Part of me feels yes and a part of me feels no,' she said. She continued: 'He would never let me . see her. I would call to talk to her and he would get mad about it. If I . did see her and I would notice something on her, like a bruise or . something, instead or reacting in a calm manner, he would lash out about . it or kind of go into defence.' Reynolds’ appeal came a day after . DiPietro issued a second statement, thanking investigators and insisting . that he did nothing to harm his daughter. 'Until now, I have not participated . in any interviews for I don't want to in any way hinder the . investigation. However, it is important that the public hear it from me . personally that I have no idea what happened to Ayla and that I am not . hiding,' the statement read. 'I have been in full cooperation with . everyone in this effort, including not adding additional media hype.'

'At this point in the . investigation... we are confident that Ayla did not walk out of the . house by herself,' Waterville police Chief Joseph Massey said at a news . conference earlier on Monday at which he announced the reward, gathered . with donations from residents and businesses in the Waterville area. It is biggest ever offered in Maine for a missing person, state Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said. Massey said then the developments in a . mystery that's been featured on national television programs have not . shifted the matter from a missing-person case to a criminal . investigation. Despite the passing of the Christmas holiday with no sign . of Ayla, police remain committed to finding her, the chief said. In tears: Ms Reynolds pleaded for information regarding to her daughter's whereabouts in an earlier television . 'The intensity of the investigation . is as high today as it was the first day,' he said. 'We continue to . employ every single resource we have.' Massey was joined at the news conference by Waterville attorney John Nale, who appealed for the safe return of Ayla.

'I ask and I plead with the person or . persons who have Ayla Reynolds that they please keep her safe and . return her safely to us,' Nale said. Hundreds of police officers, game . wardens and local residents have been searching for Ayla since she was . reported missing by her father, Justin DiPietro, on the morning of . December 17. Massey said a report about the case on the Fox network . television program 'America's Most Wanted' during the weekend generated . some leads, which are being checked by police. DiPietro told investigators he last . saw Ayla when he put her to bed the night before at his home in . Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state . capital, Augusta. He said she was wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them and had a cast on her broken left arm.

Address: Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey, at the podium, speaks to members of the media regarding the investigation into the disappearance of Ayla Reynolds at a conference in Waterville, Maine . Reynolds, who completed the rehab, . had filed court papers that she said she hoped would lead to the return . of her daughter. The filing came the day before Ayla was last seen. Appearing on the Today show last week, Reynolds said she blames DiPietro for their daughter's disappearance. 'I trusted him to keep her safe,' she said. 'And now she is missing and I don't . know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way . he was supposed to.' DiPietro has said he has 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.' 'I will not make accusations or . insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove . who's responsible for this,' he said.

"By . Thomas Durante and Beth Stebner . Last updated at 4:44 AM on 30th December 2011 . 'Nasty': NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne tweeted his apparent disgust at a woman's 'nasty' breastfeeding at a grocery store . After an online outcry, NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne apologised publically for his Twitter tirade about a woman’s ‘nasty' breastfeeding in the local supermarket. The 31-year-old bachelor’s comments sparked uproar in the Twitterverse, eliciting an apology from Kahne via his Facebook page late Wednesday night. He wrote: 'It was in no way my intention to offend any mother who chooses to breastfeed her child, or, for that matter, anyone who supports breast feeding children.' 'My comments were not directed at the mother’s right to breastfeed. They were just a reaction to the location of that choice, and the fashion in which it was executed on that occasion.' His NASCAR sponsor Great Clips also released a statement, which read: 'Our apologies for this. Please know that response was uncalled for & does not reflect our organisation.' Earlier this week, Kahne posted several tweets in rapid succession capturing his apparent disgust at a woman nursing her child in the produce section. He said he first thought he was imagining things, but once he realised the mother was indeed nursing, he began tweeting his horror. Warming: Graphic language below . No offense meant: Kasey Kahne posted an apology on Facebook Wednesday after his Twitter rampage . ‘Just walking through supermarket. See a mom breast feeding little kid,’ he tweeted. ‘Took second look because obviously I was seeing things I wasn’t!’ Upon second look, he described the woman’s breastfeeding in detail. ‘One boob put away one boob hanging!’ he tweeted, with the hashtag ‘#nasty ‘ following the post. He was apparently so repulsed that he then wrote: 'I don’t feel like shopping or eating anymore'. Later, a woman named Deana P. tweeted to him that she disagreed breastfeeding was 'nasty' and that he was 'kind of a douchebag'. Tirade timeline: Earlier, Kahne posted several tweets about how grossed out he was to see a woman breastfeeding in public . ‘I hope someday you have a kid and someone tells your wife that feeding your child looks nasty,' she wrote. 'Stay classy a**hole.' Kahne, who currently stars in an Allstate ad campaign that centres around his appeal among women, responded by calling her a 'dumb b***h'. He tweeted an apology to Deana P., saying his remarks were 'out of line'. He wrote: '@KnittingRad I wanted to apologize for saying what I said to you yesterday. It was out of line.' The woman, whose Twitter page indicates she's a mother of three from Minnesota, wrote an apology of her own, saying her comments to the racer were also 'knee-jerk and out of line'. On the track: Kasey Kahne, 31, is often referred to as one of NASCAR's most eligible bachelors . Kahne's very public qualms came amid . another breast-feeding controversy, which resulted in hundreds of . mothers in 35 states staging a nurse-in at their nearby Target stores . after a Texas mother was told last month that she could not breastfeed . in public. Michelle Hickman, a mother of four, . was trying to do some Christmas shopping last month when Target . employees asked her to relocate to a more private location, such as a . family fitting room. Humiliated by the incident, Mrs Hickman used Facebook to organize the massive 'nurse-in'. Defiance: Mothers in Kingston, New York, joined a nationwide campaign to gather in Target stores to breastfeed their children in solidarity . Kahne, who has 12 NASCAR wins to his credit, does a great deal of charity work through his Kasey Kahne foundation, which benefits chronically ill kids and their families. In 2007, however, he found himself on the wrong side of the law. In November of that year, Kahne was charged was . charged with assault for pushing an elderly security guard at the . Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida. The misdemeanour charges were later dropped after Kahne completed 50 hours of community service. He . was also slapped with a civil suit by the security guard, who claimed . he suffered a severe back injury as a result of the incident, but that . suit was settled in 2009.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created 2:00 PM on 7th December 2011 . Rev Wayne Stillwell said: 'Some people, who provide essential services, have to work on Christmas Day - but I don't feel that those employed by a fast-food restaurant should be in the same situation.' Church leaders have hit out at a branch of McDonald's which is to open on Christmas Day. A Muslim branch manager has been drafted in by the fast food outlet to cover for the usual boss who is taking the day off and staff have volunteered to work that day for seven hours. Parish Rvd Wayne Stillwell said the decision to open the branch showed 'the continuing decline of Christendom in this country' and his reaction was 'one of great sadness'. He added: 'I’m sad that we’ve got to this point in our society where something that means as much as Christmas seems to mean so little. 'It shows the continuing decline of Christendom in our country.' Rev Stillwell, of St Mary’s Church, Chaddesden, said: 'Some people, who provide essential services, have to work on Christmas Day - but I don’t feel that those employed by a fast-food restaurant should be in the same situation.' Shahban Rehmat who has volunteered to manage the outlet said he expected a steady trade throughout the day. He said no staff who did not want to work that day were being forced to. He said: 'It’s the first time the restaurant will open on December 25 and it’s for the convenience of our customers. 'There are people who work on Christmas Day and they would normally struggle to find somewhere to eat. 'I think the move will prove popular with non-Christians, and several customers have asked us whether we will be open. 'It’s difficult to say how many we are expecting but I think there will be a steady trade.' Michelle Berry, 43, from Littleover, Derby, was in the branch when she was asked if she would not be taking her children there that day. 'There’s no way I’d take my kids for a McDonalds on Christmas Day,' she said. 'I suppose it’s good news for people from different religions though.' However, the Dean of Derby, Dr John Davies, said he had 'no argument' with the move. He said: 'Mary, Joseph and the babe were lucky to find an innkeeper who helped them find a place to stay. He provided hospitality for them. 'Families and friends should come together at Christmas, and if they want to do that in McDonald’s then who is the Church to object?' A spokesman for McDonalds said many of the stores are franchises, adding: 'It is up to the individual store and their staff members which individuals work on Christmas Day. 'It is not policy for staff members of a particular religion to work on any specific day - although staff who do not celebrate Christmas may make the decision to work on December 25 themselves. 'We expect there to be about 60 stores in the UK that remain open this year, all in areas where there is a high demand for us to stay open, and where there are a large number of people who perhaps do not celebrate Christmas. 'There have always been a small number of our stores which choose to open on December 25.'",'I’m sad that we’ve got to this point in our society where something that means as much as Christmas seems to mean so little'

The mother of a month-old baby was . murdered and dumped in a canal on Christmas Day as her family waited for . her to come home and open her presents. Ruby Love’s body was spotted floating in the Grand Union Canal in Southall, West London, on Sunday morning. Police believe the 23-year-old was . thrown into the water just hours earlier, after being hit on the back of . the head and strangled. Ruby Love: The mother of three was described as 'the most lovely girl' Devastated: Ruby Love's mother, Precious, left, and sister Sarah with a photo of Ruby and baby son, Amir . Miss Love, who also had a . two-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, was last seen at 6pm on . Christmas Eve before going out for the evening. She had been expected to return home . on Christmas Day to open presents with her children and her mother and . sister, with whom she lived in Harrow, North London. Her boyfriend Manzar Juma, 27, of Northolt, Ealing, west London, appeared at Brent Magistrates court today charged with her murder. He was remanded in custody until his next appearance at the Old Bailey for a plea and case management and bail hearing on January 3. Miss Love’s distraught mother Precious said: ‘She was just the most lovely girl, the best daughter I could have asked for. ‘We . were having our Christmas dinner and opening our presents as we were . waiting for her. I waited and waited and I texted her through the night. Sealed off: Investigators were still at the scene where Miss Love was found . Sad tribute: Ruby Love's home decorated by friends in Harrow, London . ‘I waited until it . had got to 24 hours after [she left] and then I gave it one more hour, . and then there was a knock on the door. It was the police. ‘It’s such a loss – I do not know how we are going to cope.’ The . 45-year-old identified her daughter’s body on Boxing Day. She said she . appeared to have been hit on the back of  her head, and that the body . bore strang- ulation marks. An initial post-mortem examination was unable to establish a formal cause of death. Yesterday Miss Love’s sister Sarah, 22, fought back tears as she described her devotion to her children. ‘She . loved her kids but she was a mother to everyone,’ she said. ‘She always . protected me and I could not protect her. She was an angel. We have . just not stopped crying. I still cannot believe this.’ Murder inquiry: The body of Ruby Love was found in the Grand Union Canal (pictured) in Southall, west London on Christmas Day . Grim discovery: Officers were called to the scene by a member of the public who had spotted the young woman's body . As a tribute, her mother has painted a white cross on Miss Love’s front door under the words: ‘Ruby’s Angel House.’ The Hindu-Sikh family had converted to Christianity and changed their surname from Malik. Miss Love worked in their property business. Yesterday police divers were still searching the section of the canal where her body was found. The area forms part of the popular Hillingdon Trail walk. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Police have launched a murder investigation following the discovery of a body in the Grand Union Canal. ‘Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious on, or before Christmas Day.’ He added that officers ‘are aware of previous incidents which will form part of our investigation’. ■ An Indian student ‘executed’ on Boxing Day may have been the victim of a racially-motivated attack, police said yesterday. Anuj Bidve, 23, was shot in the side of the head as he walked with friends in Salford, Greater Manchester. Five people – including a boy of 16 and two aged 17 – have been arrested by police on suspicion of murder. Mr Bidve’s father Subhash, speaking from the family’s home in Pune, Maharashtra, said he learned of his son’s death via a message posted on Facebook. ■ A mother was stabbed to death after an apparent domestic dispute. A man believed to be the 36-year-old’s partner was yesterday fighting for his life in hospital after he was discovered unconscious at their flat. Neighbours said the victim’s schoolboy son raised the alarm after stumbling out of the family property in Wolverhampton ‘covered in blood’. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.","Manzar Juma accused of murdering Ruby Love .

Michele Bachmann might be struggling in the polls now but she could well beat all her fellow GOP presidential candidates in another competition. The Minnesota Representative, 55, packs a punch when she goes hunting and revealed her favourite gun is a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle. She is going pheasant hunting with Iowa Rep Steve King on Friday and claims she learned about gun safety before she was even a teenager. Scroll down for video . Sharp shooter: Michele Bachmann, 55, packs a punch when she goes out hunting and revealed her favourite gun is a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle . Different types: The AR-15, seen in its various forms, is the civilian version of the U.S. military's M16 automatic or semi-automatic rifle, used in the Vietnam War . 'Hey, I'm a pretty good shot,’ she told WHO-AM. ‘I learned how to hunt here in Iowa from my Dad - I went through gun safety when I was 12.’ ‘My favourite gun is an AR-15, because you can be so accurate with it. And I scored the best in my class - of any of the men too - in that class. ‘It's a rifle. I love that gun. I love it. It's a great gun.’ Mrs Bachmann refused however to be drawn by WHO-AM on the size of her magazine. The AR-15 is the civilian version of the U.S. military’s M16 automatic or semi-automatic rifle, which was used during the Vietnam War. The gun can be configured in many sizes to suit the individual with accessories including silencers, grenade launchers or telescopic sights.

"Bachmann said Senator Kent Sorenson had 'been offered large sum of money' By . Associated Press . Last updated at 11:16 AM on 29th December 2011 . Michele Bachmann's struggling presidential campaign saw her Iowa chairman defect yesterday to rival Ron Paul's side, an embarrassing blow that came as some called for her to leave the race to free up her supporters for other candidates. Hours after appearing with Bachmann at an event, State Senator Kent Sorenson gave his endorsement to the Texas congressman at a Des Moines rally. Mr Sorenson said he resigned from Bachmann's campaign to back Paul, whom he called the most conservative of the top-tier candidates. Behind the scenes: Republican candidate Michele Bachmann (C) with Iowa Senator Kent Sorenson in Indianola, Iowa in August. He switched his support to Ron Paul today . Bachmann said Sorenson made the jump after 'he was offered a large sum of money to go to work for the Paul campaign'. 'Kent said to me yesterday that ''everyone sells out in Iowa, why shouldn't I,'"" Bachmann said in a written statement. 'Then he told me he would stay with our campaign. The Ron Paul campaign has to answer for its actions.' Paul . campaign chairman Jesse Benton said the campaign was not paying Mr . Sorenson and that he was puzzled why Bachmann would make such a claim . against an elected official popular with Iowa conservatives. Betrayal: Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann meets with voter in Greenfield, Iowa today after hearing her chairman for the state had defected to rival Ron Paul . Mr Benton said: 'We've always known . Michele to be an honorable person. She should stop slandering an . honorable Iowa state senator.' He . added that Paul campaign officials had been begun speaking to Mr . Sorenson 'in earnest' in the last few days, and that he had informed the . campaign yesterday that he was ready to sign on. Sorenson . announced the switch during a Paul veterans' rally in Des Moines. He . didn't immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press to . address Bachmann's charges that the move was financially based. In . a statement, he said: 'The fact is, there is a clear top tier in the . race for the Republican nomination for president, both here in Iowa and . nationally. Ron Paul is easily the most conservative of this group. Switching teams: Iowa State Senator Kent Sorensen speaks at a rally for Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul after suddenly leaving Michele Bachmann's campaign with less than a week to the caucuses . 'The truth is, it was an . excruciatingly difficult decision for me to decide between supporting . Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul at the beginning of this campaign.' Susan . Geddes, a veteran operative in conservative GOP political circles who . managed Sorenson's 2008 and 2010 legislative races, said Sorenson had . told her several times, as recently as last month, that the Paul . campaign had offered him money to leave Bachmann's campaign. Geddes . said Sorenson had damaged his political future in Iowa by abandoning . Bachmann's campaign less than a week before the caucuses. Forging ahead: Ron Paul waves to the crowd as he drums up support in Des Moines, Iowa today . 'The truth is, it was an excruciatingly difficult decision for me to decide between supporting Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul at the beginning of this campaign.' Susan Geddes, a veteran operative in conservative GOP political circles who managed Sorenson's 2008 and 2010 legislative races, said Sorenson had told her several times, as recently as last month, that the Paul campaign had offered him money to leave Bachmann's campaign. Geddes said Sorenson had damaged his political future in Iowa by abandoning Bachmann's campaign less than a week before the caucuses. 'He just committed political suicide,' she said. Bachmann has been on a frantic 99-county push across Iowa in an effort to recover from the slide that followed her Iowa straw poll victory in August. Paul was a close second in that contest. 'He just committed political suicide.' Susan Geddes, GOP insider, on Sorenson's late switch of allegiance . Earlier in the day, two influential pastors said they wanted either her or former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum to drop out of the running to keep evangelical voters from splitting their support. Bachmann insisted she would see the Iowa caucus campaign through. Sorenson, who has strong ties to Iowa's tea party, was one of Bachmann's earliest public supporters and joined her for an afternoon stop at a Pizza Ranch restaurant in Indianola. Standing by her side, he declined to speak to the crowd there, citing numbness from dental work. All day, Bachmann bashed Paul as 'dangerous' for having a hands-off foreign policy. It was part of a double-barreled attack on the two Texans in the race. She went after Governor Rick Perry for '27 years as a political insider'. The aggressive tone underscored Bachmann's role as a chaser in the final week of campaigning. She has bet heavily on Iowa, where she was born. Bachmann came hardest at Perry, who this week began a television ad lumping Bachmann with other Washington figures seeking the GOP nomination in his attempt to come off as the outsider in the race. 'Just because he's held office outside of Washington, D.C., does not mean he is not a political insider. It's what you do in your office that matters,' she said outside a small-town cafe. 'There aren't very many politicians who have spent more time paying off political donors than Governor Rick Perry has.' Perry has served Texas as a legislator, agriculture commissioner, lieutenant governor and governor. Bachmann also said Perry has engaged in 'crony capitalism' by helping donors with Texas government contracts or giving them political appointments. And she called Perry a double-dipper for collecting his gubernatorial salary and state pension at the same time. Campaigning in Indianola on Wednesday, Perry scored what appeared to be a double hit of his own. Although he didn't name his targets, he took aim at lawmakers who sound off in Washington without much influence on policy - a rap sometimes attached to Bachmann and Paul. 'Some campaigns are about their voting record, on bills that never make it to the president's desk. I'm campaigning on ideas that I've signed into law,' Perry said. As for Paul, Bachmann criticised him as misguided about foreign threats to U.S. interests. 'Ron Paul would be a dangerous president,' Perry said. 'He would have us ignore all of the warning signs of another brutal dictator who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. I won't. He would wait until one of our cities is wiped off of the map until he reacted. I won't wait.' On Wednesday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told CNN that he would find it personally difficult to vote for Paul if the Texas congressman were to become the party's choice to go up against President Barack Obama next fall. Bachmann refused to go that far, dodging two direct questions about her willingness to back Paul later on. 'He won't win the nomination,' she said. At stop after stop, Bachmann cast herself as America's Iron Lady, the nickname assigned to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Bachmann sits on the House Intelligence Committee, which she said gives her a firm grip on world affairs. State Senator Brad Zaun, who had been Bachmann's Iowa co-chairman, was named full chairman after Sorenson's resignation.",Bachmann said Senator Kent Sorenson had 'been offered large sum of money'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:09 AM on 30th December 2011 . Alaskan scientists and air carriers are on alert as one of the state’s volcanoes belched a monstrous ash plume 15,000 feet in the air Thursday. Cleveland Volcano in Alaska's Aleutian Islands sent up an ash cloud that prompted scientists to increase the alert level for commercial aircraft traffic, as an eruption could happen soon. Once plumes reach 20,000 feet, the airline industry and the Federal Aviation Administration really start to worry. Spewing and sputtering: The remote volcano in Alaska's Aleutian islands spouted an ash cloud 15,000 feet into the sky, prompting an air-traffic alert . Cleveland Volcano's last major eruption . was in 2001. It has had bursts of activity nearly every year since then . and the ash cloud Thursday was not out of character. Scientists say that while the giant . plume isn’t unexpected, the volcano’s remote location on Alaska’s . Aleutian Islands makes it difficult to monitor. 'Unfortunately, Cleveland is one of those that is so remote, we have no on-ground monitoring or instrumentation there, so it's hard for us to pinpoint things any more accurately than we can do with satellite imagery,’ U.S. Geological Survey scientist-in-charge John Power said. The event Thursday drew strong interest from air carriers. 'Any time you put an ash cloud up into the atmosphere, the airlines, the air carriers, air freight companies - it's a major concern,' Mr Power said. Smoke in the sky: A true-color satellite image of Cleveland Volcano captures the ash cloud . The Alaska Volcano Observatory said satellite images at 4.02am Alaska time showed Cleveland Volcano had spewed ash 15,000 feet into the air in a cloud that moved east-southeast. Mr Power called it a small explosion. 'It's not expected to cause a disruption to big international air carriers,' he said. However, it was significant enough to raise the alert level from yellow, representing elevated unrest, to orange, representing an increased potential of eruption, or an eruption under way with minor ash emissions or no emissions. Cleveland Mountain is a 5,675-foot foot peak on uninhabited Chuginadak Island about 940 miles southwest of Anchorage. Drifter: A drifting ash cloud from Cleveland Volcano shows the ash cloud (yellow) drifting on the southwest tip of Umnak Island . The nearest village is Nikolski on another island about 50 miles east. Previous eruptions of Cleveland Volcano were not considered a threat to Nikolski and its 18 permanent residents. Scientists in July noted increased activity in the crater at the summit of the volcano. Satellite images showed lava building and forming a dome-shaped accumulation. The Federal Aviation Administration and the airline industry get concerned for trans-Pacific flights when an ash cloud has the potential to exceed the 20,000-foot threshold, as Cleveland Volcano has done in the past. Alaska's Redoubt Volcano blew on Dec. 15, 1989, and sent ash 150 miles away into the path of a KLM jet carrying 231 passengers. Its four engines flamed out and the jet dropped more than 2 miles, from 27,900 feet to 13,300 feet, before the crew was able to restart all engines and land the plane safely at Anchorage. The observatory is working with the University of Washington to monitor lightning above Cleveland Mountain, which could signal a major ash plume. The cause is linked to the interaction of ash and warm air. Chris Waythomas of the USGS said in September that lava domes form a lid on a volcano's 'plumbing,' including the chamber holding the magma. When they grow big enough, lava domes can become unstable and will sometimes collapse. When the magma chamber decompresses it can lead to an explosion as the conduit inside the volcano suddenly becomes unsealed and gasses escape. Radar images earlier this month showed the dome had cracked and subsided, Mr Power said. 'There's a whole lot of hot air and it rises through the atmosphere very quickly,' Mr Power said. 'All the ash particles rub together and develop electrical charges, and that discharges as lightning. The eruption Thursday was not large enough to create lightning. Seismic activity at nearby volcanoes could also signal an explosion at Cleveland Mountain, the observatory said. The observatory is a joint program between the USGS, the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute and the state Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. It was formed in response to the 1986 eruption of Mount Augustine.","Cleveland Volcano released 15,000 ft ash plume .

Nancy Pelosi's daughter has revealed her mother wants to leave Congress and is only in Washington because campaign donors want her there. Alexandra Pelosi, whose mother is the House Minority Leader and was the first woman to become Speaker, described her mother's predicament in a phone call. Speaking to the website Big Government from a friend’s home in New York, she said: 'She would retire right now, if the donors she has didn’t want her to stay so badly. 'They know she wants to leave, though. They think she's destined for the wilderness. She has very few days left. 'She's 71, she wants to have a life, she's done. It's obligation, that's all I'm saying.' It . comes despite the former Speaker's push to serve as Minority Leader . after the Democrats' historic losses in the 2010 midterm elections. Many Democrats - including President Barack Obama - are also . campaigning on the expectation that she will be restored as Speaker if . they can retake the House in 2012. Wants out: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi gestures during a news conference at Washington's Capitol Hill earlier this month . Replaced: Nancy Pelosi introduced the new House Speaker John Boehner to take over the podium after he was elected in January . Alexandra Pelosi, 41, is a television . producer and documentarian who won multiple Emmy awards for her work on . Journeys with George (2002), an HBO documentary on George W. Bush’s . 2000 presidential campaign. The film was widely hailed as fair in its depiction of a president not used to sympathetic media portrayals. If Pelosi's was to depart it would make room for her deputy and former rival, Rep Steny Hoyer, who currently serves as Minority Whip. Hoyer is widely seen as more moderate than Pelosi. Pelosi became the focal point for much Republican ire during the mid-term elections, as seen by these supporters holding signs at a McCain rally in Arizona . Seat of power: The U.S. Capitol in Washington where Nancy Pelosi served as House Speaker . Down but not out: Nancy Pelosi, centre, walks out of a room with her grandson Paul Vos (bottom), following a television interview on Capitol Hill in Washington in January . In her four-year term as Speaker, Nancy Pelosi has became a . divisive figure in Congress and she has been the subject of caustic . attacks by Republicans. Voters did not warm to her either - a poll found 64 per cent . of the public disliked her as speaker and 47 per cent strongly disliked . her whilst only 29 per cent had a favourable opinion. Always impeccably turned out, Pelosi became . an influential and powerful legislator and a charismatic speaker who was . praised by Barack Obama for helping get through some of his key . legislation. Married to a millionaire and a mother-of-five, she won admirers in party . ranks for her fund-raising abilities as well as her success in uniting . Democrats against Republican legislation. But her appearance and demeanour have also been mocked by opponents as akin to Disney's Cruella de Vil. They also portrayed her as the 'Wicked Witch' of high taxes in a . television commercial that saw her challenger melt her down to nothing . with a bucket of water. Pelosi has long been aware of the rough and tumble of politics and . recently said that if 'no one's talking about you, you have to wonder . what you were doing'. She has also said that personal criticism is the 'highest compliment'. She . opposed his election to the party leadership in 2006, choosing instead . to back the late Rep Jack Murtha, despite his ethical challenges. Pelosi is one of the most senior . members of the Democrat party and is currently working with Republicans . to find a long term solution to the US debt problems. Her . constituency is in California and before becoming Minority Leader this . January, she was the first woman to be Speaker of the House. She lives with her husband of 48 years and they have five children, along with the eight grandchildren. In November, the grandmother was forced to face down claims she took steps to make herself look more junior. Pelosi was accused of undergoing a face lift to shave a few years off her appearance. In March, the Italian-American was rushed to hospital in Rome for a mystery illness before being released after 'undergoing some tests'. Further details of what was called a 'minor ailment' are not yet known. In January, documents, uncovered by political corruption watchdog Judicial Watch, . revealed the US taxpayer was billed for $101,429 (£64,000) in Mrs . Pelosi's in-flight services over a period of two years when she was Speaker. She also faced intense pressure to resign from moderate Democrats who blamed her for the landslide loss in January's mid-term ballot. But she said she weighed family considerations with the need to help her party fend of Republican attempts to roll back health care and other key legislative measures made under her leadership.","Alexandra Pelosi says her mother would leave if the donors she has 'didn't want her so badly'

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 7:57 AM on 28th December 2011 . France's health secretary has appealed for calm in an attempt to quell growing fears over breast implants that have been sold to countries including Britain. Xavier Bertrand admitted conflicting information about the products made by the now bankrupt Poly Implant Prothese was having a devastating effect. Last week France said it would pay for women to have the industrial silicone-filled implants removed because they were liable to split open. Burst: Plastic surgeon Denis Boucq holding defective silicone gel breast implants, which were removed from a patient . Mr Bertrand said: ‘It’s true this is not of an urgent nature,’ but he added: ‘We recommend that the breast implants are removed to avoid a rupture.’ In Britain, the Government has said women with the implants should not be ‘unduly worried’ because there was no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. Some of the 40,000 British women who have the implants are planning legal action, and concern is mounting among the 30,000 in France who have them. A global search is continuing for Jean-Claude Mas, the 72-year-old former butcher who founded PIP. It has emerged that in 2000 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned him about 11 deviations from ‘good manufacturing practices’ at PIP’s plant in La Seyne-sur-Mer in the south of France. Interpol launches manhunt for breast implant 'butcher' Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was told in 2000 that its saline implants were 'adulterated' -  a decade before it came under scrutiny from European regulators for its silicone implants. More than 300,000 women who received the company's silicone implants, which were ordered off the market in 2010, have already been told they are at risk. And now thousands more women who received its saline implants are facing potential safety issues. But it is not yet known how many received the implant or whether indeed they are unsafe. In a warning letter to company founder Jean-Claude Mas it said there were 11 deviations from 'good manufacturing practices'. Dated June 22, 2000, it cited PIP's failure to investigate the deflation of its saline implants and a failure to report more than 120 complaints in France and elsewhere to the FDA. Threat: The 'low quality' PIP implants contained industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical-grade fillers . It also said the plant did not have . a process in place to make sure the saline implants it produced met . design specifications. The revelation has led to questions as to why the warning did not prompt a larger investigation by French authorities. PIP began selling its saline implants in the U.S. in September 1996 under a system that did not require the company to submit clinical trials to show an implant's safety and effectiveness. PIP - once the third-largest maker of breast implants in the world - stands accused of using industrial-grade silicone in some of its implants. There are fears that the implants, which were sold around the world, could cause health problems if they burst or leak. It has affected 40,000 British women and 300,000 worldwide. The French government has urged the 30,000 women in France with PIP implants to have them removed - and offered to pay for the surgery. Other countries, including Britain, have only gone as far as saying that women should visit their surgeons for checks. Concerns about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago, when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands. The French health watchdog ordered an inquiry, which subsequently reported ‘serious irregularities’ in the implants and they were pulled off the market. Manufacturers were accused of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years which believed to have been originally designed for mattresses. They have a higher than normal rupture rate - up to five per cent among French women - and have been linked to the death of a French woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. It has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. It was feared that leaked gel could trigger cancer but to date tests have remained inconclusive. About 300,000 PIP implants were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. This was as long as it was 'substantially equivalent' to devices already on the market. The French company could not sell its silicone-gel implants in the U.S. at the time because the FDA had prohibited the sale of all such implants from 1992 until 2006 for most women because of safety concerns. But, for many years, the FDA allowed manufacturers to sell saline implants without formal safety trials. This was because many were sold before the agency received the authority to regulate medical devices. The agency assumed they were safe unless proven otherwise. In 2000, due to concerns about possible complications such as infections and rupturing, the agency finally required all implant companies to submit a formal application, known as pre-market approval, to continue selling their products. PIP was one of three companies that submitted an application, which came under review of a panel of outside advisors to the FDA in March 2000. At the time, PIP said it had already sold 35,000 of its pre-filled saline implants in the U.S., and that it was the third-largest manufacturer of breast implants in the world. It said it only had reports of 521 complaints with its devices, a rate of 1.5 per cent. But the panel recommended that the FDA reject PIP's application. It recommended the implants from the other two companies, Inamed Inc, now part of Allergan Inc and Mentor, now a unit of Johnson & Johnson. Panellists said at the time they were not reassured by PIP's data, and that the company's clinical trials did not include enough patients that were followed for an adequate time to truly evaluate the device's risks. One panel member, Boyd Burkhardt, a plastic surgeon from Arizona, said the company's data was incomplete, and he found it difficult to understand why the company was 'as ill prepared as you appear to be' to meet regulatory standards. He told the firm: 'Like it or not, we have a regulatory threshold which is probably higher or at least different than it is elsewhere in the world, and I think in order to get your product approved, you're just going to have to bite your tongue and meet that threshold.' Asked to comment on the PIP controversy, Burkhardt, in a brief interview, said that he stands by the prior comments he made to the FDA. It was not immediately clear why after the rejection, the FDA then carried out an inspection of the PIP plant in May 2000. PIP said it stopped selling its saline implants, which usually contain a silicone outer shell filled with a sterile saltwater (saline) solution, in the United States that same month.","PIP's saline devices described as 'adulterated'

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 9:46 AM on 31st December 2011 . An HIV-positive man has potentially infected thousands of people - by having unprotected sex so he could spread the disease. David Dean Smith, 51, turned himself in to a Michigan police station last week - after claiming to have slept with 3,000 men and women over several years. A detective investigating the case said: 'He says he intentionally attempted to spread the disease to kill people. 'His latest fantasy is strangling a woman and having sex with her dead body.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: David Dean Smith turned himself in for having sex with 'thousands' of women while he knew he was HIV-positive . Big black book: Smith told one of his victims he had been with up to 3,000 people . It is unclear when Smith was diagnosed with HIV, but he claims to have known full well what he was doing when he had unprotected sex with many partners over the past few years. While he claims that there may be thousands of victims, so far he has only been arraigned and charged with two counts of AIDS-sexual penetration with an uninformed partner. Neither of the two victims that police are aware of have been identified, but one has spoken to reporters in an effort to help other women realize if they may be infected. She said that once she was tested, she immediately knew it was Smith who infected her. The two met through a Yahoo! Personals listing and, in speaking with MSNBC, she called him a 'sociopath' and 'a predator'. Strange: Smith's Facebook profile has several odd pictures of him, like this one with a bunny and an angel statuette . Smith works in telecommunications - previously at Ronco Communications and now at Blue Cross Blue Shield, a healthcare provider. Though the scope of his destructive path is still unknown, that woman said that she and Smith got together in 2008. She claims he texted her as he was headed to the police station, saying 'Turning myself into the law, my life is over. Take care. Always love you'. She was not fooled by the niceties, however. 'It's something he should have done years ago,' she told MSNBC. 'He shouldn't get a pat on the head for what he did.' In her previous conversations with Smith, he lead her to believe that he had a vast sexual past, claiming that he had had sex with up to 3,000 people, including men and women. 'He hits drifters. He hits people who are young. He hits young women, and from what I understand, he hits men, too.' Deadly strain: The HIV virus leads to AIDS, and can easily be transferred from person to person during unprotected sex if one partner is infected . According to his Facebook profile, Smith graduated from Harry Hill high school in Lansing, Michigan in 1978. He then went on to study at the online for-profit University of Pheonix. His frequent and positive posts about the successes of his band do not reflect the supposed inner turmoil that he was going through. He was court-appointed to a mental health facility because of recent suicide attempts, and their records allege that he is 'sexually aroused by causing pain to females. In Michigan, sexual penetration with HIV is considered a felony and he will be tried accordingly. WATCH VIDEO HERE .

A sinkhole that forced the evacuation of 25 residents from their homes has spread to an historic cemetery, threatening dozens of graves. Officials in Allentown, Pennsylvania, have been given the go-ahead by a judge to exhume remains buried during the Civil War. The hole, measuring  50ft long and 30ft wide, was thought to have collapsed when a water main burst and flooded under a road. Scroll down for video . Hole in the road: Workmen gather at the 50ft long sinkhole in Allentown which is believed to have opened up after a water main burst . About 60 graves in Union and West End Cemetery are threatened have been roped off after several headstones tilted. The cemetery holds about 20,000 graves, . including 714 Civil War veterans. Among them is a Medal of Honor winner, Ignatz Gresser. Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim said: 'If any sites are in jeopardy, than we are going to have to make that decision to excavate. 'It's a very sensitive issue. You are dealing with a cemetery. You are laid to rest and now it is being disturbed.' Everette Carr, president of the association which maintains the 157-year old . non-profit burial ground, revealed there were are no detailed historical records beyond those whose graves have headstones. Danger: Twenty-five residents had to be evacuated from their homes after water flooded a basement . Under threat: A red tape cordons off the graves which face being exhumed because of the sinkhole . Many of the dead were buried in wooden baskets as was the custom during that era. A dozen homes half a block from the hole on 10th Street were evacuated yesterday after firemen found a basement flooded. Five properties have been declared structurally unsafe. 'At this point, we don't know if the homes will have to be condemned or not,' said fire chief Robert C. Scheirer. 'Once we get the street secured, we will get into these homes and determine whether any have to be razed.' Emergency workers have cut off power supplies and are now filling in the hole in with concrete. Ann Blacker was forced to leave the home where she has lived for nearly three decades. She said: 'We're afraid we'll lose our home and everything in it. With sinkholes, you never know how far they will spread. There is just a lot of uncertainty now.' She plans to stay with her mother.

Four people were reportedly killed in the explosion which happened just after Friday prayers. Islamist sect Boko Haram - which killed 42 with a series of Christmas Day bombs outside churches - has been blamed. The city is known to be its stronghold. Blast: A 'major' blast has rocked an area around a mosque in the restive northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri . One resident said: 'There was a loud blast near the mosque just after the Friday prayers as people were trooping out of the mosque. 'Everybody scampered to safety, leading to a stampede.' Army spokesman Brigadier General Isa initially blamed Boko Haram for the attack, but it is not yet known if and why it would attack a mosque. Boko Haram is suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and is believed to want to impose Islamic Sharia law in Nigeria. Nigeria's 160 million people are roughly divided between Muslims and Christians, who mostly live side by side in peace. Boko Haram claimed three bomb attacks on churches on Christmas Sunday, including one that killed 27 worshippers in a Catholic church just outside the capital Abuja, and one in Jos without fatal victims. A car burns outside St Theresa Catholic Church at Suleja, Neigeria, after an explosion on Christmas Day. Five bombs exploded that day at churches in the country . The coordinated strikes by the northern-based Islamist group, whose name translates as Western Education Is Sinful in the Hausa language of the region, appeared aimed at prising open Nigeria's religious faultline in a direct challenge to the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner. 'Boko Haram is seeking to provoke retaliatory attacks on Muslims in predominantly Christian parts of the country,' said former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell. The attacks have led local Muslims to be wary of a possible Christian backlash. 'We are just beginning to live in peace, so we hope our Christian brothers can help us keep that peace,' said Mohammed Kabir, who like many Nigerian Muslims said he resented being associated with violent extremism.","Militant Islamist group Boko Haram blamed .

The family of a British pensioner who vanished on a hiking trip in Lanzarote over Christmas believe she may have fallen from a coastal path. Active Margaret Holt, 65, from the Wirral, was last seen on the Canary Island on December 23, as she left her hotel to go for a hike. Her worried family contacted the Spanish Civil Guard to raise the alarm after she failed to make contact with them over Christmas. It is believed Ms Holt, who is described as seasoned hiker who would often trek 20 miles a day, was holidaying alone when she went for a walk from her hotel in the Costa Teguise. Posters and searches along rugged coastal paths have failed to turn up any information on Ms Holt. Authorities say she was spotted later in the afternoon in the northerly Órzola region of the island but has not been seen since. Wendy Banks, Mrs Holt's daughter-in-law, wrote on a Facebook page appealing for information about her whereabouts: 'She is a very fit woman who thinks nothing of walking 20 miles per day. She loves coastal paths. 'We have her passport, cards from her room so know she only intended to go for a walk. 'Her mobile phone is with her but not working. We really believe she had a fall walking.' Desperate search: Volunteers have been scouring the coastline and putting up missing posters since Margaret Holt's disappearance on December 23 . On Lanzarote Information, an English website covering the island, a desperate appeal was made for any information on Ms Holt’s whereabouts after authorities said she may have hitched a lift with a local. The website states: ‘Margaret is a walker and thinks nothing of covering 20 miles in a day. ‘It is believed that she may have had a fall so we need people to look off the beaten path for her. She was carrying a mobile but that has been dead since she was discovered to be missing. She likes to walk along coastal paths.' Last seen: Margaret Holt was spotted leaving her hotel on the Costa Teguise resort in Lanzarote in hiking clothes . Locals from the island stepped up the search as information emerged Ms Holt was spotted just outside Órzola between 6 and 7pm but didn’t get the last bus from the region. She was last seen wearing a light pink vest, khaki shorts, walking sandals and a drawstring bag. A Spanish Civil Guard spokesperson said: 'We know that Margaret was seen at 16:50 in the area of the Jameos . del Agua and Cueva de los Verdes where she is believed to have walked . from the direction of Yi Maguez.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 12:46 PM on 30th December 2011 . An adopted woman spent her whole life thinking she was an only child unaware she had nine siblings living minutes from her home. Susan Walton had always longed for a brother or sister to play with after being adopted when she was six months old. Now, at the age of 64, Susan has discovered she is the oldest of ten children who live a few miles away from her house in Hull, East Yorkshire. Reunited at last: Susan Walton (centre) with six of her nine newly discovered siblings (clockwise from left) Jacqueline Postill, Janet Brown, Brenda Newman, Michael Sexton, Julie Marrow and John Sexton at her home in Hull . Remarkably, she never encountered her siblings - Janet Brown, Michael Sexton, Brenda Newman, Julie Marrow, John Sexton, Jacqueline Postill, Christopher Sexton, Ann Sexton and Stephen Sexton - despite sharing a postcode. Now reunited with her long-lost family, Susan has been amazed that their paths never crossed before. She said: 'I found out I was adopted when I was 13 and it was so unexpected, I had no idea I had brothers and sisters. 'I remember watching a programme about two sisters being reunited and I said it would be lovely if someone knocked on my door. 'It was a bit lonely being an only child and I would have liked someone to play with. Then one day I got the letter from the adoption society. 'It’s been a lovely shock meeting them all and it was lovely to know we all had the same mother and father.' Catalyst: Susan with a photograph of her mother Pauline Sexton and brother John Sexton. Her sisters started looking for Susan after her mother died in 2009 . Susan, from Hull, has six children with her husband, 65-year-old navy veteran Malcolm, and 12 grandchildren. But despite having a big family of her own, the retired supermarket worker always wondered if she had any siblings. Little did she know that three of her sisters, Janet, Jacqueline and Brenda, had started looking for Susan after their mother, Pauline Sexton, died in April 2009, aged 82. Their father Herbert Sexton had died from a heart attack 23 years ago, aged 64. After more than a year of searching, matching birth certificates and endless phone calls, the brothers and sisters have now met for the first time. Unearthing the past: Susan's sister Janet tried asking her mother (above) more questions about what happened to her oldest sibling, but the opportunity never arose . She said: 'When I got the letter from an adoption society in Leeds, they told me I was the oldest of ten. It’s wonderful and I couldn’t ask for a better family.' Janet, 62, was told she had another sister, her parents’ first-born child, before they were married, about 20 years ago. She said: 'For years and years, I tried to get my mum by herself to ask more questions. But the opportunity never arose. 'There always seemed to be someone there and I wasn’t able to find out more about it. 'I told a couple of the others and when mum died, we decided to look for her.' Janet said she could not be happier to have found Susan. She said: 'We were more concerned for her because there are so many of us and it’s a lot to digest. But it’s brilliant.' Brenda, 56, said Susan is very much like their mother. She said: 'She is more like our mother than any of us, she is our mother’s double in so many ways - the way she talks, everything. 'We get on really well and we hit it off the moment we met. She made us feel so welcome and so at ease. 'It took us just over a year to find her and we nearly fainted when we realised she was only down the road. 'It’s crazy how none of our paths have ever crossed. Susan thought she was an only child, so you can imagine the shock she got.' Brenda said she is looking forward to spending many more happy times together as a family. She said: 'It’s just a shame it didn’t happen years ago. But it means everything.'","Susan Walton was 13 years old when told she was adopted...

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:34 PM on 30th December 2011 . A prisoner of war camp were held is to undergo £500,000 worth of repairs after an emergency donation from English Heritage. Harperley in Durham, which was built to house captured Italian and German prisoners during World War II, needs urgent work after it was hit by last year's sharp winter. The sheds, many of them with corrugated rooftops and asbestos panelling, were supposed to be temporary buildings when they were put up in 1943. Owners: James and Lisa McLeod tried to sell the camp on eBay two years ago and have now received £500,000 from English heritage to carry out emergency repairs . However, it has scheduled monument status which means it is nationally important. It is the only camp in the country to have the classification. The 17-acre site, which has been run as a tourist attraction since 2004 by its private owners, is being given the funding by English Heritage with no requirement for it to be matched, the Guardian reported. The repair work is being carried out to a theatre and a canteen on the site which are in the poorest state of repair. The huts will be clad in timber to stop their condition deteriorating further. Temporary huts: When the site was built in 1943 the buildings, many of them made from pre-fabricated concrete, were only supposed to last a few years . Disrepair: This is the Oprisoner theatre, pictured in 2002, which will undergo emergency repairs. Its state of repair declined dramatically in last winter's big freeze . Although the buildings appear ramshackle, they give a remarkable insight into the lives of thousands of World War Two PoWs. The theatre and the canteen which are undergoing repairs were central to the social life at Harperley. Although the German and Italian prisoners were forced to work the land locally, many of them did not mind being there. Indeed, around 10 per cent of the population settled in the area after the war. The inmates were humanely treated, encouraged to make themselves at home and even produced their own newspaper. As well as the theatre there was football, education classes, gardening opportunities and a local community who were happy to accept them as their own. The camp is historically significant because it gives a unique insight into the very ordinary war lives of thousands. The theatre has a stage, orchestra pit and tiered flooring. The canteen, where the inmates would socialise, had a series of paintings of German scenes on the wall which have survived. In total, there are 49 buildings. Owners James and Lisa Mcleod put the camp up for sale on eBay two years ago - but no one was prepared to match their £900,000 asking price. They ran out of money while trying to turn the piece of wartime history into a visitor and education centre. Rob Young, historic environment adviser at English heritage, told the Guardian: 'Many people ask why not just record it and let it fall down, but it is the only place where you can see this aspect of our history, and it has a very powerful atmosphere. 'Although the materials were very crude, whatever they could get hold of, the workmanship is excellent, and the theatre was planned by somebody who really knew his job - it has a miniature proscenium arch, an orchestra pit, raked seating, even a prompt box, all fitted into the framework of the hit.' The . camp was built to house 'low risk' prisoners of war who were housed in . tents before Italian POWs erected prefabricated buildings. By September . 1944 most of prisoners had been dispersed to hostels and farms to make . way for around 900 German prisoners . Originally the camp housed Italian prisoners who slept in tents. But in the early 1940s huts were . erected by Italian PoWs who stayed there until September 1944 when . around 900 German prisoners were transported to the camp. Prisoners underwent de-Nazification classes and although being interned was traumatic for soldiers many were relieved to be out of the war. Just one person ever tried to escape. They were often allowed into town and formed such strong bonds with the local community . that around 10 per cent of prisoners stayed in Britain rather than return . home. The prison was a work camp and detainees were taken out daily to work on farms. Among the detainees was German PoW Bert Trautmann, who became a professional footballer for Manchester City after the war. The . goalkeeper is famous for playing the full 90 minutes in the 1956 FA Cup . final, despite breaking his neck 17 minutes from time. The sports field at Harperley is also believed to have been the venue for the first England v Germany . post-war football match when the PoW camp team took on Crook Town. After the war it was used for storage by the farmer who owned it before the Mcleods purchased it and formed a trust. Emergency repairs: Work will be carried out to the theatre and canteen. The owners ran out of money as they tried to turn it into a tourist attraction . Productions: Theatre was a centrepoint of life at the camp to keep up morale.

Two high-ranking British military officers were killed by a roadside bomb during a covert mission in Afghanistan just three days before Christmas. Captain Tom Jennings, of the Special Boat Service, and RAF Squadron Leader Anthony Downing died when a blast ripped through their vehicle. It is understood the men were part of a Special Forces squad attempting to gain intelligence on the Taliban and win over local Afghans. Squadron Leader Anthony Downing (left) and Royal Marine Captain Tom Jennings (right) were both died after their vehicle was caught in a blast in Afghanistan . Captain Jenning's body was repatriated today in a C17 plane that landed at RAF Brize Norton . It is the first time two officers have been killed by a booby-trap bomb while travelling together in the same vehicle in the warzone. Capt Jennings, 29, a commando in the Royal Marines before joining the SBS, died when the armoured vehicle struck an improvised explosive device south of the capital Kabul on December 22. He was the highest-ranking Marine to die in the ten-year conflict. Sqn Ldr Downing, 34, survived the initial blast and was airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. But he died from his injuries a day later with his family by his bedside. He was the most senior British airman to die in Afghanistan. It took the total of UK servicemen and women killed fighting the Taliban to 393. Their loss was all the more acute because it happened as military families prepared to mark Christmas and the New Year knowing their loved ones were facing mortal danger thousands of miles away. War zone: The roadside bomb went off just south of Kabul in Afghanistan . The team was on a top secret counter-insurgency mission when they were targeted. They had been in contact with Afghans on an ‘outreach patrol’. Sqn Ldr Downing acted as an interpreter because he was a trained Dari speaker.  This meant he could hold conversations with local people in a bid to persuade them to support the government. Precise details of the operation were being kept under wraps by the Ministry of Defence but elite Special Forces troops regularly escort MI6 officers and other intelligence officials for meetings with key sources or Taliban chiefs. Capt Jennings, who was based at SBS headquarters in Poole, Dorset, leaves behind a wife and two young sons. The MoD described the commando as ‘a true leader, selfless in his professional approach  serving those who were his responsibility’. He worked alongside local Afghan security forces with ‘empathy and a broad cultural understanding’. A statement released by the MoD said: ‘Dedicated and humble, he was an archetypal Royal Marine with a keen sense of humour even when faced with adversity.’ Capt Jennings is the second member of the feared SBS to be killed in action in Afghanistan. Corporal Seth Stephens, 42, was shot dead during a top secret mission in the Taliban stronghold of Haji Wakil in Helmand in July 2010. He received a posthumous Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery. 'Dedicated and humble, he was an archetypal Royal Marine with a keen sense of humour even when faced with adversity' Sqn Ldr Downing, from near Deal, Kent, was an engineering officer who deployed to Afghanistan because of his language skills. He was involved in the planning and conduct of outreach patrols, said the MoD. He was the last to oversee the safety of the RAF’s Nimrod MR2 spy planes before they were taken out of service last year. He was also a key member of the Mountain Rescue Team at RAF Kinloss in Scotland and had previously been a volunteer for the Samaritans. His childhood dream was to join the RAF. Sqn Ldr Downing leaves his parents Michael and Masheeda, a brother and girlfriend. His parents said: ‘We treasure the memories and the achievements of his fantastic life and without him our lives have been diminished.’ Sqn Ldr Downing was planning to take part in the gruelling Arch to Arc endurance event in 2013. Captain Jennings' body was today driven out of the air base in Oxfordshire past a flag that has been lowered to half mast . Squadron Leader Downing died of his wounds last Friday at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. His family were with him when he died . It involves running 87 miles from . London’s Marble Arch to Dover, swimming the English Channel, and then . cycling 181 miles from the French coast to Paris. Group Captain Robbie Noel, station . commander at RAF Kinloss when Sqn Ldr Downing served there from 2007 . until May 2010, said he was ‘immensely dedicated, talented and . passionate’. Sqn Ldr Downing’s determination to . help comrades was ‘characteristic of a hugely popular, and deeply . respected and loved friend and colleague,’ he said. Squadron Leader Paul Lipscomb, Officer . Commanding, Mountain Rescue Service at RAF Kinloss, said his friend . embodied ‘courage and commitment’. ‘I can draw some comfort in knowing that he died doing something that he enjoyed and chose to do,’ he said. nA gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform killed two French NATO soldiers when he fired his weapons at them yesterday.

Police were called to the party suite in the early hours of the morning following the incident in Sheffield. South Yorkshire Police said they launched a murder investigation following the death at the Stars and Mayfair Party Suites. Murder investigation: A man died following a disturbance at these party suites on the outskirts of Sheffield last night . A spokesman said: 'Officers understand a confrontation led to a man being assaulted, sustaining injuries from which he died. 'The investigation is in its very early stages with inquiries at the scene likely to continue throughout today.' The spokesman asked for witnesses, including people who attended the function, to come forward. He said the man's age and other details were not available at this time. The venue is a set of party suites which, according to its website, caters for functions for 50 to 700 guests, including weddings and birthday parties. The scene was cordoned off this morning, with police and forensic officers in white overalls going in and out of the building and a number of police vehicles parked outside. The venue is in a large building which was well-known in the city for many years as a casino and ice rink complex. It is on a main road, which is one of the busiest routes into Sheffield from the south, and is just a short walk from the city's main railway station. Passers-by said they were shocked by the death. One pensioner said: 'It's a terrible way to start a New Year, isn't it? 'People going out just to have a good time and then this happens.' Police officers on the scene after a girl, believed to be aged 15, was arrested over the murder in Luton today . Three other people died after being attacked at New Year's Eve Parties, police said today. A teenage girl was being held on suspicion of stabbing a middle-aged man to death at a house party. The 42-year-old victim, known only as Michael, was co-hosting the event with girlfriend Mandy O'Neill in LUTON, BEDFORDSHIRE. He suffered a heart attack after being knifed at the party and died within an hour. Detectives today arrested a girl believed to be aged around 15 on suspicion of carrying out the attack. Police were initially unable to question many of the guests at the party because they were drunk. Neighbours told how at 3am they had . 'loads of screaming' coming from the house party and then squads of . police and a paramedic crew arrived. One neighbour said a lot of teenagers and adults had attended the party. 'They were playing music throughout the night which wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary,' she said. 'Then the music suddenly stopped and there was a lot of shouting and fighting.

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 10:14 AM on 1st January 2012 . Kim Jong-Il's estranged playboy son has made a secret visit to North Korea using a false passport to pay respects to his father, it was revealed today. Kim Jong-Nam, 40, flew from the Chinese territory of Macau direct to Pyongyang, according to a report in Japan. With his 27-year-old half-brother, Kim Jong-Un - who is now supreme commander of everything in North Korea - he stood beside their father's body and paid their respects before the older man returned to Macau. Respects: Kim Jong-Nam, left, the playboy son of the former North Korean leader, made a secret visit to pay respects with Kim Jong-Un - the new Supreme leader . Mourning: Thousands of North Korean people pay their respects during the National Memorial Service at Kim Il Sung Square . Dead: Kim Jong-Il who died of a heart attack last month aged 69 . In order not to draw attention to himself or raise controversy about why he was not appointed to take his father's place, he did not even attend Kim Jong-Il's state funeral on December 28. It is not known whether any animosity arose between the half-brothers, who were at the centre of rumours in 2009 suggesting that people around Jong-Un had tried to assassinate his older brother in Macau. Sources in North Korea said the plan to assassinate Jong-Nam was foiled after Beijing heard about it and spirited Jong-Nam away from Macau to a safe place. According to the respected Japanese daily newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, Jong-Nam took immediate steps to fly to Pyongyang from Macau, where he usually lives, on December 17 after learning of his father's death that day. He used a passport under the false . identity of Kim Chol and avoided travelling via Beijing which would have . drawn attention to his visit. Grief: Mourners surround Kim Jong-Ils coffin during his funeral procession through the streets of Pyongyang, North Korea . Funeral: Kim Jong-Un, the dictator's successor (to the left of the hearse) walks beside the convoy carrying his father's body . North Korea vowed to stage an all-out drive for prosperity as it unites behind new leader Kim Jong-Un, ushering in 2012 with promises to resolve food shortages, bolster its military and defend Kim Jong Il's young son 'unto death'. The pledge in North Korea's annual New Year's message, released by the official Korean Central News Agency, comes as the country enters a new era. The message said: 'Glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory, a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding. 'The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should possess a firm conviction that they will become human bulwarks and human shields in defending Kim Jong Un unto death.' North Korea said it would boost its military, and boasted that it was 'at the epochal point of opening the gates of a thriving country', with parts of Pyongyang 'turned into socialist fairylands'. The message also acknowledged the country's food crisis, saying 'the food problem is a burning issue'. Pyongyang had been in talks with the United States on food aid, but they stopped because of Kim Jong Il's death. He did not attend the state funeral because he did not want to give rise to arguments about 'why the third (son) should become the successor,' a source told the paper. The paper said it had been told that Kim Jong-Nam 'pulled out of the succession race several years ago by himself, saying he had no interest in politics.' He has lived abroad for many years and has been seen in Macau, Singapore and Beijing, after apparently falling out of favour with his father for trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001. There was unhappiness in Pyongyang, too, about reports that he was spending most of his time playing roulette in the casinos of Macau. As his health failed, Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il decided it was his youngest son from another marriage who should continue the dynasty. Jong-Un has been named 'the great successor' and supreme commander of the military following his father's death at the age of 69 from a heart attack. Last week a South Korean news agency reported that Jong-Nam had been 'placed under Chinese protection' amid speculation that another assassination attempt might be made against him to stamp out continuing controversy surrounding him. Jong-Nam has dismissed talk of a death plot against him, saying they are 'a farce'.","Kim Jong-Nam, 40, avoided his father's funeral to avoid speculation about why he was not the new ruler .

"By . Craig Mackenzie . Last updated at 7:17 PM on 1st January 2012 . The Archbishop of Canterbury today defended rioters who took part in last summer's unrest claiming many young people felt 'let down' by Britain. He called on the public in a broadcast New Year message not to give up on the younger generation and show them support and love so they can 'flourish'. Dr Rowan Williams described the violence as 'angry' and 'lawless' but claimed the country had failed its youngsters by being 'suspicious and hostile' towards them and not providing good role models. Smiling: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams claimed Britain was 'suspicious' and hostile' Describing the disturbances which swept the country, he said: 'Quite a lot of the images we're likely to remember from the footage of the riots in the summer will be of young people out of control in the streets, walking off with looted property from shops, noisily confronting police and so on. Dr Williams: 'The events of the summer were certainly horrific' 'It all feeds into the national habit of being suspicious and hostile when we see groups of youngsters on street corners or outside shops and bus shelters. 'We walk a bit more quickly and hope we can pass without some sort of confrontation. 'The events of the summer were certainly horrific. They showed us a face of our society we don't like to think about - angry, destructive, lawless.' In his message screened on BBC1, he said those involved were a minority and most young people shared the 'general feeling of dismay at this behaviour'. Dr . Williams was filmed talking to young people  at Kids' Company in south . London that helps youngsters in poverty who are at risk of falling into . criminal behaviour. He . said: We have to ask what hind of society is it that let's down so many . of its young people.That doesn't provide good role models and drives . youngsters further into unhappiness. and anxiety by only showing them . suspicion and negativity. 'When . you see the gifts they can offer, the energy that can be released when . they feel safe and loved, you see what a tragedy we so often allow to . happen. Dr Williams' comments risk another clash with David Cameron who warned last month the Church should 'keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country.' Meanwhile, Pope Benedict praised young people as key to securing a future of hope despite what he called 'shadows on the horizon of today's world.' Papal blessing: Pope Benedict celebrates mass in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican today with a New year message . In the splendour of St. Peter's Basilica, with ambassadors to the Holy See from dozens of countries seated in the front rows, the Pontiff, wearing white vestments with gold-colored trimmings, celebrated Mass on a day the Vatican dedicates to world peace. He said: 'I would like to underline the fact that, in the face of the shadows that obscure the horizon of today's world, to assume responsibility for educating young people in knowledge of the truth, in fundamental values and virtues, is to look to the future with hope.' Young people, he said, must 'learn the importance and the art of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, dialogue and understanding. 'Young people by their nature are open to these attitudes, but the social reality in which they grow up can lead them to think and act in the opposite way, even to be intolerant and violent. Message: A balloon floats in the wind as the Pope gives his message praising young people during the Angelus prayer . But they will become 'builders of peace' if properly educated, he predicted. The 84-year-old looked tired during Mass, but his voice was strong, and he smiled and chatted briefly with families and young children who carried gifts to him during the ceremony. He seemed amused by one pacifier-sucking infant as the parents kneeled before the Pope. As he has for the past few months, Benedict used a wheeled platform, guided by ushers, to moved down the basilica's long aisle between entrance and main altar. After mass, in remarks in English from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square, jammed with tens of thousands of Romans, tourists and pilgrims, Benedict invited all to pray with him 'earnestly for peace throughout the world, for reconciliation and forgiveness in areas of conflict, and for a more just and equitable distribution of the world's resources.'","'They showed us a face of our society we don't like to think about - angry, destructive, lawless' says Dr Williams .

"By . Lynn Davidson and Damien Gayle . Last updated at 3:43 AM on 30th December 2011 . Ronald Noble, Interpol secretary general, has warned that weak passport security could help terrorists . The failure of many European countries to check passports against an international database of lost and stolen travel documents could ‘lead to another September 11’, according to the head of Interpol. Secretary General Ronald Noble, a former head of the US Secret Service, said the security gap could allow potential terrorists to enter Europe and cross multiple borders undetected. He said: ‘So many basic steps aren’t being taken, which could lead to another September 11, another July 7, another March 7 in Madrid. ‘The lesson that should have been learned...is that people carrying stolen travel documents, if they are not stopped, can enter your country and mastermind a horrible attack.’ He added that last year 500 million flights were not screened against the Interpol database. ‘Right now, there are less countries than fingers on my hand in the EU that are systematically screening the passports of people coming across their borders through Interpol’s database,’ he said. Mr Noble said the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to travel across much of the EU without a passport, meant a single weakness in border security could put the whole of the European mainland at risk. A European commission source told the Independent that the Schengen area had its own security database, so member states were not obliged to carry out checks with Interpol. But Interpol warns that the Schengen area's security system is not as comprehensive, since it excludes records from 131 other countries that contribute to Interpol's records. Stringent: The UK Border Agency make more Interpol checks than the rest of Europe combined . Britain is the only EU country to systematically check passports against those registered with Interpol as missing worldwide. Last year more than 11,000 people were caught trying to enter the UK using lost or stolen passports. Britain carried out 140 million checks last year against the database - more than the rest of Europe combined. France carried out the second highest number at 10million.","Last year 500million flights were not screened against the Interpol database .

Although hailed for his discovery of the Americas in the 15th century, Christopher Columbus’s reputation was tainted because he was blamed for introducing syphilis to Europe. However, several reports have since argued the case that the deadly disease was already widespread before Columbus landed back in Spain in 1493. Now researchers George Armelagos, from Emory University, Molly Zuckerman, from Mississippi State University and Columbia University’s Kristin Harper, claim that all the evidence putting Columbus and his crew in the clear is flawed. In the dock over syphilis: Explorer Christopher Columbus, who came from Genoa, in present-day Italy . Armelagos told LiveScience: ‘There's no really good evidence of a syphilis case before 1492 in Europe.’ Curable in the present day by antibiotics, syphilis used to be a debilitating and often fatal disease. Caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria it affected the heart, brain, eyes and bones and was the scourge of every major city. Ever since the first recorded case in Europe took place in 1495 - three years after Columbus's first voyage to the New World - doctors have argued over its origins. Historians who argue that Columbus couldn’t have been source point out that rudimentary 15th century medical know-how meant that doctors would not have been able to distinguish the disease among others that had similar symptoms, so it could have been around for a long time. There are also skeletons from Europe that pre-date Columbus’s epic voyage and that show signs of syphilitic lesions. It’s strong evidence and Armelagos admits to finding the idea of Columbus bringing the disease back laughable at first. A syphilitic skull with the tell-tale indentations on the forehead (file picture) But then he began a closer inspection of the 54 published reports putting Columbus in the clear. He found that the skeletal material wasn’t irrefutable proof, by any means. Writing in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, his team report: ‘We did not find a single case of Old World treponemal disease that has both a certain diagnosis and a secure pre-Columbian date. ‘We also demonstrate that many of the reports use non-specific indicators to diagnose treponemal disease, do not provide adequate information about the methods used to date specimens, and do not include high-quality photographs of the lesions of interest.’ In the cases where the skeletons definitely were afflicted with syphilis, the researchers noted that they came from coastal areas, which would make radio-carbon dating difficult. This is because it’s likely the victims ate seafood, which can contain carbon many thousands of years old from water wells. The team adds: ‘Solid evidence supporting an Old World origin for the disease remains absent.’","All 54 reports arguing he didn't are flawed, say experts .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 6:35 AM on 30th December 2011 . Tragic: Jena Dolstad,14, died after being injected with heroin . A 14-year-old Alaskan girl has died six days after she was allegedly injected with heroin by a 26-year-old. Jena Dolstad of Anchorage had been critical since she was taken to the hospital last Friday with a drug overdose. The teenager died shortly after noon today (Thursday), police spokeswoman Anita Shell said. On the tragic night which would lead to her death, Navy Veteran Sean Warner and two other men picked Jena up and took her back to Warner's home to hang out, according to police reports. Warner was sharing a gram of heroin with two men when the Jena said she was willing to try something 'new' but did not want to inject herself, the court papers report. Warner tried to inject Jena, but . failed, so he had her lie down on his bed and hold out an arm, then used . his belt as a tourniquet and shot 25 to 30 units of heroin, taking . several times to find a vein, the papers say. The two witnesses told authorities they . left the Jena on the bed and . found her the next morning, face down in her own vomit. 'They felt for her pulse, sat her up, . and grew concerned at her condition and upset at Warner's ambivalence,' the documents state. Accused: Navy veteran Sean Warner, 26, has been accused of injecting Jena Dolstad, 14, with heroin six days before she died on Thursday . Warner initially did not want to call . 911 because of fears authorities would find drugs, and instead gave the . teen Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opiate addicts, according to the court papers. He only called . 911 after Jena began to convulse a couple of hours after he gave . her the Suboxone, the papers say. Sean Warner is under arrest on charges of delivering a controlled substance to a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and evidence tampering. With the death, Warner now faces additional charges, including manslaughter, said assistant District Attorney Regan Williams. Scene: It is believed two others went with Warner to pick the girl up on Thursday night and take her back to Warner's home (pictured) to hang out . Arrested: Sean Warner has been arrested and is facing charges of manslaughter after Jena Dolstad tragically died . The case is still in the ""investigatory stages,"" he said. When emergency services attended his address to tend to Jena, Warner locked his bedroom door, and responding officers did not search it when he told them it was his roommate's room, the documents state. Tragedy: 14-year-old Alaskan girl, Jena Dolstad died six days after she was allegedly injected with heroin by 26-year-old Sean Warner at his home in Anchorage, Alaska . After police left, Warner and one of the witnesses put needles and other ""related evidence"" into a box then dumped it behind a trash bin at a nearby business, according to the papers, which police later recovered. Dolstad was found to have heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in her system when she was brought to the hospital, charging documents said. Medics told authorities she had sustained damage to her brain and heart. Authorities have said the heroin used is known on the street at ""China White,"" considered more potent than common tar heroin. Warner also is charged with theft, accused of stealing a $900 surveillance system from Costco on the same day he took the girl to his home, according to the documents. He is being held on $100,000 cash bail.","Jena Dolstad 'asked Navy veteran Sean Warner to inject her with drugs' because she didn't want to do it herself .

With the Iowa caucuses just hours away, surprise dark horse Rick Santorum is picking up momentum - and plenty of cash - but the third-place candidate is also looking for help from a higher power. The former Pennsylvania senator, who spent most of the fall and winter at the bottom of polls, surged last week and his campaign has 'raised more money in the last few days than the last few months’. Mr Santorum, who has jumped into third place in the polls, is urging GOP voters to ‘send a shock wave across this country’ by voting for him and said the U.S. is searching for an inspirational leader. Scroll down for video . Rising: Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who has spent the last few months bottom of the polls, surged last week and his campaign has 'raised more money in the last few days than the last few months' Popular: Republican presidential candidate and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum is surrounded by cameras at a campaign event at the Hotel Pattee in Perry, Iowa . The Republican presidential hopeful dismissed rival former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's business experience, knowing many voters are flicking between the two ahead of Tuesday's vote. But Mr Santorum is also taking a cue from the last Iowa winner Mike Huckabee - courting evangelical Christian voters that propelled him to victory in 2008 - in an effort to stop Mr Romney. Mr Santorum has already picked up support from Christian leaders Bob Vander Plaats and Chuck Hurley, two strong social conservatives who also supported Mr Huckabee in 2008. He warned voters against choosing a candidate only because they think that person can win and referred to 1980 when Ronald Reagan inspired Republicans and led the party to victory. Mr Santorum added that this is his model for challenging more conventional rivals. He also said that he has become the target of increased criticism because his poll numbers have dramatically risen. A senior adviser to Mr Santorum told CNN that his campaign has raised more money in the last week than online the past six months and fundraising is up to 400 per cent higher daily than ten days ago. Still top: GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was in Dubuque, Iowa . ‘We have raised more money in the last few days than we have in the last few months,’ Mr Santorum said, reported CNN. ‘Going from zero to 60 in the polls, if you will, will help those resources a lot.’ 'Lead this country. That's what I ask the people of Iowa. Lead, don't defer. Don't put forward somebody who isn't good enough to do what is necessary to change this country' Rick Santorum . Riding a late burst of support after spending months as an also-ran candidate, he is trying to convince undecided voters to back his come-from-nowhere movement and pull of an unlikely win. ‘Lead this country,’ Mr Santorum said. 'That's what I ask the people of Iowa. Lead, don't defer. Don't put forward somebody who isn't good enough to do what is necessary to change this country.’ He is desperately trying to unite evangelical supporters who have been split all year between him and rivals Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann and Texas Governor Rick Perry. Second in polls: Ron Paul is pictured left with his son Rand Paul in Davenport, Iowa, and right with his wife Carol . Local preacher Cary Gordon, who endorsed Mr Santorum recently and has urged Mrs Bachmann to give up her campaign, introduced him at an event on Sunday as a version of actor Jimmy Stewart. ‘We have raised more money in the last few days than we have in the last few months. Going from zero to 60 in the polls, if you will, will help those resources a lot' Rick Santorum . The preacher was referring to the 1939 film ‘Mr Smith Goes to Washington’ about a concerned citizen who became a politician, also starring Jean Arthur and James Stewart. ‘We found ourselves a Mr. Smith who has proven that he will do the right thing no matter what anybody says,’ Mr Gordon said. ‘It's called integrity and character and trusthworthiness.’ Mr Santorum, who has conducted a shoestring operation with few campaign funds, has campaigned in Iowa by appearing in town after town and shaking hands, speaking and taking questions. Falling down: Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is seen with his wife Callista at a campaign stop on Monday in Independence, Iowa . Jim Bob Duggar from TLC reality show ‘19 Kids and Counting’ travelled to Iowa with 12 of his children from their home in Arkansas to get behind Mr Santorum and his ‘conservative family values’. 'I think the gap between (President Obama’s) promises and his performance is the largest I’ve seen, well, since the Kardashian wedding and the promise of ""til death do we part""' Mitt Romney . Iowa's caucuses will provide momentum for at least three candidates and maybe four - sending them on to the next contests in New Hampshire on January 10 and South Carolina on January 21. Mr Romney and Texas Congressman Ron Paul lead the polls in Iowa, but Mr Santorum is in a battle for third place with Mr Perry and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr Gingrich was leading the polls last month but has now admitted he doesn’t expect to gain Iowa because of how much his rivals have spent on negative ads. ‘I don't think I'm going to win,’ he said. Public speaking: Texas Governor Rick Perry talks during a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa, on Monday . He added that Barack Obama should not even take his salary this year. ‘He shouldn’t pretend he’s President because he’s just a candidate - because he’s not doing the job of a President.' 'I think people are starting to figure out that this is the guy that’s going to beat Barack Obama' Ann Romney . The Des Moines Register published its influential pre-caucus poll on Saturday, which put Mr Romney first on 24 per cent, followed by Mr Paul on 22 per cent and Mr Santorum on 15 per cent. The survey was carried out between December 27 and 30 - but if only the last two days are counted then Mr Santorum moves into second place, showing the intense volatility in Iowa at the moment. Mr Gingrich is on 12 per cent, Mr Perry is on 11 per cent and Mrs Bachmann is on 7 per cent. Former Utah governor Jon huntsman seems all but out of the race - and he is currently on only 2 per cent. Struggling: Michele Bachmann waves from her bus after a campaign stop on Monday in West Des Moines, Iowa . A Gallup report showed the race is the ‘most volatile for the GOP since the advent of polling’ as the lead has changed seven times - and was even once held by former candidate Herman Cain. Mr Paul criticised Mr Santorum on Monday for being a ‘very liberal candidate’. And a new video advert from Mr Paul's supporters hilariously used a 'fake Mitt Romney' to 'endorse' Mr Paul. In other news Mr Romney compared . President Obama’s pre-election promises to reality star Kim Kardashian’s 72-day . marriage. Fox News said this was only the second joke he has made on the . campaign trail. ‘I think the gap between (President .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:05 PM on 1st January 2012 . Civil rights groups today voiced major concern over a defence bill allowing the military to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism. The $662billion bill was signed by Barack Obama on Saturday despite his ‘serious reservations’ and pledging he would not support that element. But human rights advocates said the bill is a ‘blight on his legacy’ and ‘dangerous because it has no temporal or geographic limitations’. Controversy: A $662billion defence bill was signed by Barack Obama on Saturday despite his 'serious reservations' over the detention of U.S. citizens . ‘Obama will go down in history as the President who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in U.S. law,’ a Human Rights Watch spokesman said. The American Civil Liberties Union is ‘incredibly disappointed’ but will see what the Supreme Court rules on the ‘scope of detention authority’. ‘The statute can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield,’ an ACLU spokesman added. Civil rights advocates are worried the bill will help the military detain and interrogate U.S. citizens and non-citizens, reported the Washington Post. President Obama claimed some lawmakers wanted to use the bill to restrict counter-terrorism officials’ ability to protect the country. He only signed the measure after Congress made changes that no longer challenged his terrorism-fighting ability, administration officials said. Detention: A detainee rests inside his cell in Camp Delta at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba (file picture) ‘My administration will not authorise the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,’ President Obama said. ‘Indeed, I believe that doing so would . break with our most important traditions and values as a nation,’ he . wrote in a signing statement. 'Obama will go down in history as the President who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in U.S. law' Human Rights Watch . The defence bill also applies penalties against Iran's central bank in an effort to hamper its ability to fund its nuclear programme. His signature caps months of wrangling over how to handle captured terrorist suspects without violating Americans' constitutional rights. The White House initially threatened to veto the legislation but dropped the warning after Congress made some last-minute changes.

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:14 AM on 31st December 2011 . A three-year-old boy has made a remarkable recovery after doctors feared he had been blinded by a Chinese lantern. Cael Jones couldn’t open his eyes for two weeks after molten wax from the fire lantern which had been released into the sky fell and landed on his face. His skin instantly turned black and . began to peel, blistering his eyes shut meaning doctors were unable to . tell whether his eyes had been damaged . Recovered: Emma Foulkes with her son Cael, who suffered terrible facial burns a year ago from a Chinese lantern burner . But luckily, Cael’s eyesight was found to be unaffected by the incident and a year on from the accident, the majority of the youngster's burns injuries have healed. Emma Foulkes, 24, of Wrexham, North Wales said: 'Given Cael’s injuiries of last year it’s a . miracle that he’s recovered so well over the past year. 'At first he thought the burn . injuries were like a mask and he wouldn’t go out of the house but he’s . been a real fighter and his progress has been amazing - although there . are still some visibly signs of scarring.' Injury: Cael couldn't see for two weeks and doctors feared he had lost his sight . Now Ms Foulkes mother is warning people not to use Chinese lanterns in this year’s New Year celebrations for fear another child maybe hurt. 'Right now I would back anything that can be done to help improve the situation as regards Chinese lanterns. 'They are too dangerous and something definitely needs to be done about them. We’ll be avoiding any firework parties at New Year. Seeing or hearing them does bring bring back a bit what happened and we don’t want to go through it again.' The accident happened on Bonfire Night last year during a family get together. Emma added: 'We’d usually have Chinese lanterns and kids loved watching them float into the sky, so when it came to bonfire night, in 2010, we got some and told the children they could make a secret wish as they set them free. 'Then it was time for the big ending, the lanterns, I think Cael’s was last to go. I helped him up onto his uncle’s shoulders and watched as my cousin helped Cael to gently push off his lantern, and laughed as he sat face towards the sky, mesmerised. 'The lantern got to about the height of the roof, when the burner bit fell and landed on Cael’s face. 'He couldn’t open his eyes and his skin turned black and began to peel away, everyone was screaming. 'We were at the hospital for over three hours, they tried to check if his eye sight was okay but his skin had scabbed over instantly, shutting his eyes. 'The doctors gave him morphine and I spoke to him constantly so he could hear my voice, but refused to leave him over night because I didn’t want him to be frightened. 'For the next nine days he lived in darkness, saying ‘fire on my face’ and would ask me if he could take the ‘mask’ off yet, he couldn’t understand why his eyes wouldn’t open.' The night it happened: This collect shows the lanterns being lit and released in a back garden, shortly before one injured Cael . The full-time mother added: 'He was really frustrated because he couldn’t do anything himself. He was a baby again, I had to bathe him, feed him and help him walk around. 'When his left eye first opened, I was so relieved he could see but it was another week before I found out about his right. 'We were so happy; we didn’t dare to talk about what could have happened.' North Wales Assembly Member Antoinette Sandbach has since submitted a legislative bid to restrict the use of Chinese lanterns. Ms Sandbach said: 'No one wants to be a killjoy, but releasing these lanterns puts other people, farm animals and property at risk. 'While the lanterns are airborne, they can be mistaken for marine distress flares and have the potential to damage aircraft. The burning fuel can set alight to residential and business premises, and farmland is also at risk in dry weather. 'They also pose an unacceptable threat.'","The burner bit fell and landed on Cael’s face. Everyone was screaming,' recalls mother .

The father of a missing toddler begged for her safe return today and told whoever has her that 'they have no right'. Justin DiPietro spoke on camera for the first time, saying that he would do anything in his power to help find his daughter, 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds. Mr DiPietro last saw . his daughter when he put her to bed at his home in Waterville, Maine on December 16. He reported her missing when he could not find her the . following morning. Scroll down for video . Plea: Justin DiPietro speaks for the first time about the disappearance of his 20-month-old daughter Ayla Reynolds in Maine and begs for her safe return . Mr DiPietro told the Today show: 'By coming here, it was in hopes of reaching out to the person that does have my daughter to let them know that what they’re doing isn’t right. 'You may think what you’re doing is right for Ayla, but it’s not. You have no right. You’re not her parent. She belongs home with her family. He added: 'I love my daughter. I would never do anything to harm my daughter. She’s the world to me.' Police now suspect that foul play is involved in and have declared the little girl's disappearance a crime. Missing: Ayla Reynolds was last seen by her father after he put her to bed in his house in Waterville, Maine, two weeks ago . In a written statement a few days before Christmas, Mr . DiPietro said he had 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.' He said his family and friends would do 'everything we can to assist in this investigation and get Ayla back home.' 'I would never do anything to harm my daughter. She’s the world to me.' Justin DiPietro, father of missing 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds . The girl's mother Trista Reynolds has previously criticised her former partner for not pleading publicly for his daughter's safe return. It has now been two weeks since Ayla disappeared from her bed in the house in Maine where she was staying with her father. Police announced that the search for 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds had become a 'criminal investigation'. Police say that both parents are co-operating fully with their work. According to Scott Bernstein, . founder of Child Recovery International, an organisation that helps find . missing children, the most likely time to find such young children is . in the first few hours after their disappearance. War of words: Trista Reynolds has criticised her former partner Justin DiPietro for not coming forward before to plead for his daughter's safe return . In Ayla's case, he said, there is 'one per cent hope - but I'll go for that one per cent hope'. Police said on New Year's Eve that they . suspected foul play in the disappearance, as Waterville police chief . Joseph Massey announced that the case 'has evolved from the search for a . missing child to a criminal investigation.' He . added that the investigation - which will be led by state police - was . based on evidence that has been gathered over the past two weeks.

Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents 20 miles north of the state . capital Augusta, have failed to turn up anything.

"By . Nick Enoch . Last updated at 6:37 PM on 2nd January 2012 . Wearing casual white attire, the two sons of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak leave court today after a new session of their trial in Cairo. Gamal, the one-time heir-apparent, and Alaa are accused of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year's uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year regime. Earlier, their father, who faces the same charges, was wheeled into the court on a stretcher wearing dark sunglasses and covered in a green blanket. On trial with Hosni Mubarak are his two sons - Gamal (back), his one-time heir apparent, and Alaa - seen here leaving the courthouse today . Hosni Mubarak - who is suffering from a heart condition, according to his doctors and lawyers - faces charges of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year's uprising that toppled his 29-year regime. He is seen here outside the courthouse today . The 83-year-old, who was brought by helicopter to the courthouse from a hospital where he is being held in custody, is suffering from a heart condition, according to his doctors and lawyers. The trial has resumed amid speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen tried for killing Egyptian protesters could be a prelude to the dismissal of charges against the ousted leader. It began on August 3 but has . since been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by . lawyers for the victims that the presiding judge, Ahmed Rifaat, be . removed. That request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on. Another Cairo court on Thursday . acquitted five policemen of charges of killing five protesters during . the uprising in the capital's district of el-Sayedah Zeinab last January . and February. An Egyptian woman chants slogans in front of the courtroom in Cairo where Mubarak's trial has resumed. The banners list the names of men killed during the uprising . The . court said three of the defendants were not at the site of the killings . while the other two fired against protesters in self-defence. The . ruling angered families of the victims. Activists demanded that the . killers be brought to justice and complained that similar cases are . languishing in courts in several Egyptian cities. Also on trial are the ousted leader's former security chief and six top police commanders. Gamal and Alaa, who also stand accused of corruption, were brought up in the Heliopolis district of Cairo. Gamal went on to become a banker in London until returning to Egypt in 1995. He climbed up the ranks to lead an influential government committee which instigated liberal economic reforms. Alaa did not assume such a public role, but was alleged to have used his father's status to become immensely rich through corrupt business enterprises. Pro-Mubarak supporters gather outside the Cairo courthouse . An Egyptian woman holds a banner with Arabic writing that reads, 'martyr Moaz al-Sayed Mohammed Kamal, the blood of any martyr is respected' in front of the courtroom . The acquittal of the police officers in el-Sayedah Zeinab and the relatively long time the Mubarak trial is taking before even starting to deal with the core of the charges against him have led many activists to brand the proceedings a farce, organised by the generals who took over power when the longtime leader was ousted. The generals are led by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, Mubarak's defence minister for the last 20 years he spent in office. The activists believe the generals remain beholden to the Mubarak regime, and only placed the former president and his two sons under arrest after mounting pressure by protesters. The Mubaraks were arrested in April, two months after the ousting of the regime. Activists believe this was long enough for the three to conceal evidence of their alleged involvement in either the killings or corruption.","Gamal and Alaa Mubarak accused, along with their father, of complicity in killing protestors .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 12:02 PM on 2nd January 2012 . Protected: North Koreans have been told to defend new leader Kim Jong Un to the death . North Koreans have been ordered to lay down their lives for their new supreme leader - and protect him as 'human shields'. State media also said Kim Jong Un had the 'legitimacy' to carry on the revolutionary battle initiated by his grandfather Kim Il Sung and developed by his iron-fisted father Kim Jong Il. And it revealed the new leader would be upholding the same policies of his father, who died two weeks ago, while working to solve the 'burning issue' of food shortages. It comes as South Korea's president urged North Korea to embrace a 'new era' by using its recent leadership hand-over as an opportunity to transform Korean ties. But Lee Myung-bak also warned that Seoul would respond sternly to any provocations. The North's three main state newspapers, in a policy-setting editorial traditionally published on New Year's Day, said: 'Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader of our Party and our people, is the banner of victory and glory of Songun (military-first) Korea and the eternal centre of its unity.' They said the inexperienced young Kim, in his late 20s, is 'precisely' identical to his father. And it added: 'The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should possess a firm conviction that they will become human bulwarks and human shields in defending Kim Jong Un unto death.' Notably, the editorial called North Korea's food problem 'a burning issue' for the ruling Workers' Party to solve and build 'a thriving country'. It added: 'Glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory, a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding, true to the instructions of the great General Kim Jong Il.' Carrying on: New leader Kim Jong Un will continue the policies of his father Kim Jong Il (left) and grandfather Kim Il Sung (right) The destitute North has been suffering from chronic food shortages, relying heavily on outside aid. South Korean president Lee Myung Bak said Kim Jong Il's death was 'portending a sea change' for the Korean peninsula. He said: 'If North Korea comes forward with a sincere attitude, it will be possible for us to work together to open a new era.' North Korea said last week that it would never deal with Lee, but Kim Jong Un's rise could offer a chance to improve ties that have suffered since Lee took office in 2008 and ended a no-strings-attached aid policy toward the North. The young Kim had a brief meeting in Pyongyang late last month with a former South Korean first lady and a business leader who were leading private mourning delegations to pay respects to Kim Jong Il. Lee said the Korean peninsula is at a turning point and 'new opportunities always emerge amid such changes'. But he also warned that South Korea would sternly respond to any North Korean provocation. A UN report said in November the isolated communist state needed food assistance for nearly 3 million of its 24 million people in 2012. Many Korea-watchers in the South's capital of Seoul said the editorial did not suggest any major new changes in social or economic policies but appeared to be sensitive over the food issue. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said: 'In order to solidify and stabilise his grip on power, tackling the food problem is one of the top agenda topics Kim Jong Un should deal with for now.' The editorial also assailed the South Korean government for pursuing confrontation despite efforts by the North to reopen dialogue, and it repeated its demand for the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the South. But conspicuously absent from the editorial was any mention of North Korea's nuclear arms programme, the key source of regional security concerns during Kim Jong Il's reign. Yoo Ho-yeol, an North Korea expert at . Korea University, said: 'The North seems poised to focus its polices on . stabilising domestic matters such as economic issues for the time being . rather than to aggressively come forward with diplomatic affairs.' The North's remarks on the nuclear issue were featured prominently in previous New Year's Day editorials. Winning over the troops: Kim Jong Un applauds military cadets at a camp in the capital of Pyongyang on one of his first days as leader . Momentum was building in diplomatic contacts between the North and the U.S. before the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death, raising expectations the two sides may be closer to reaching a compromise to restart stalled talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme. Those talks stalled in 2008 when Pyongyang baulked at inspections of its nuclear sites under a 2005 deal by six countries - the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia - to give the impoverished North aid in return for disarmament. 'By giving up on comments on the nuclear issue, the North would secure much room in negotiations with the United States and the other signatories of the six-party talks,' said Yang. In a fiery message last week that marked the first communication with the outside world since Kim Jong Il's death, the North's National Defence Commission, which is seen as the apex of power, declared it would not deal with the current government in the South. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak angered Pyongyang by cutting off aid to its destitute neighbour when he took office in 2008, demanding nuclear disarmament and economic reform as preconditions to reopen food assistance and political engagement. Tensions on the divided peninsula reached a new peak in 2010 when the North launched an artillery barrage into a South Korean island, killing civilians. The North was also blamed for a torpedo attack against a South Korean navy ship that killed 46. North and South Korea are technically still at war under a truce ending the 1950-53 Korean War. Experts believe the untested new leader, who had only been groomed for power since 2009, will rule with the aid of a close coterie that includes his uncle and key power-broker, Jang Song Thaek, at least in the early stages of the leadership transition.

Several crew members remained inside the Yekaterinburg sub as the blaze raged overnight at a repair dock in Roslyakovo shipyard in the Murmansk region. Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Igor . Konashenkov insisted there was never any danger . of the fire spreading inside the sub and said the crew reported that . conditions on board remained normal. It remains unclear whether they were trapped by the flames or ordered to remain behind. Scroll down for video... Massive blaze: A fire aboard a Russian nuclear submarine at an Arctic shipyard has been extinguished. Several crew members remained inside the sub during the incident . Smouldering: It remains unclear whether the crew members were trapped by the flames or ordered to remain behind in the sub . Seven others who inhaled poisonous carbon monoxide fumes were evacuated to . hospital. Pavel Falgenhauer, a top Russian political analyst, warned: 'This is a very serious blow to Russia's nuclear deterrence capabilities. 'The loss of a strategic nuclear submarine, especially one that had been due to remain in service for at least another decade, hurts a lot.' President Dmitry Medvedev has given assurances that there was no radiation leak and that the vessel's nuclear-tipped missiles were not on board. He has summoned top Cabinet officials to report on the situation and demanded punishment for anyone found responsible. Military prosecutors have launched an investigation into whether safety regulations were breached. The fire, which broke out yesterday and shot orange flames high into the air throughout the night, was put out this afternoon. Firefighters continued to spray the vessel with water to cool it down, Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said. Russian state television earlier . showed the rubber-coated hull of the submarine still smouldering, with . firemen gathering around it and some standing on top to douse it with . water. In the clear? A Defence Ministry spokesman insisted there was never any danger of the fire spreading inside . Emergency: Seven crew members who inhaled carbon monoxide fumes were evacuated to hospital . Most modern submarines' outer hulls are covered with rubber to make them less noisy and more difficult for an enemy to detect. Norway's Radiation Protection Authority across the border reported it has not measured any increased radioactivity. The governor in Finnmark, Norway's . north-eastern province that borders Russia, and the radiation agency . complained about the Russian response. Gunnar Kjoennoey said: 'There have . been problems to get clear information from the Russian side. We have an . agreement to exchange information in such cases, but there has been no . information from the Russian side so far.' Russia's military said the blaze . started on wooden scaffolding and then engulfed the sub's outer hull. The vessel's nuclear reactor had been shut down and its nuclear-tipped . missiles and other weapons had been unloaded before dry-dock repairs, it . said. President Dmitry Medvedev has given assurances that there was no radiation leak and that the vessel's nuclear-tipped missiles were not on board . Thick smoke rises from the dock where the Yekaterinburg was being repaired . Toxic fumes from the blaze had spread . to the town of Roslyakovo where the shipyard is located, but officials . said there was no need to evacuate local residents. The huge fire which engulfed the . Yekaterinburg nuclear submarine is the latest catastrophe to afflict . Russian submarines in recent years. In November 2008 20 Russians choked to death on poisonous gas on board the Nerpa nuclear submarine. The . men suffocated when faulty firefighting equipment went off by mistake . while the new craft was carrying out underwater tests in the Sea of . Japan. In August 2003, two member of a 10-man crew on a Russian K-159 sub died when the vessel sank in the Barents Sea. The . submarine's nuclear reactor was shut down at the time the vessel sank . about three nautical miles north west of Kildin Island. But by far the worst Russian sub disaster in recent memory happened on the Kursk (pictured above) in August 2000. An explosion during exercises sent the nuclear sub to the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men on board. Russia refused offers of help from Britain and the United States and a Russian rescue attempt failed. The former director of the biggest . shipyard in the area said the fire was probably caused by the failure to . take proper safety precautions, such as coating the scaffolding with . special sprays to make it fire-resistant. Nikolai Kalistratov said: 'It was either lack of professionalism or an attempt to save money that has turned into huge losses.' The Yekaterinburg is a Delta IV-class . nuclear-powered submarine that normally carries 16 nuclear-tipped . intercontinental ballistic missiles. The 548ft-long vessel has a . displacement of 18,200 tons when submerged. The chief of the General Staff of the . Russian armed forces, General Nikolai Makarov, led a team of senior . military officials to Roslyakovo to oversee the emergency response. The damage from the fire could be so . massive that the submarine would need to be scrapped. But Deputy Prime . Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is in charge of the nation's military . industries, today said that the submarine will rejoin the navy after . repairs. The Russian navy suffered its worst . accident in August 2000, when the Kursk nuclear submarine exploded and . sank during naval maneuvers, killing all 118 crew members aboard. A 2008 accident at the Nerpa . nuclear-powered submarine killed 20 Russian seamen and injured 21 others . when its fire-extinguishing system activated in error and spewed . suffocating Freon gas.

Spare a thought then for a 12-year-old girl who has experienced the same symptoms for SIX YEARS. Alisha Atkinson suffers from cyclic . vomiting syndrome, a condition which has no known cause but leaves . patients being sick for days or even weeks at a time. During her worst episode Alisha was sick an astonishing 100 times in 24 hours. Sick to the stomach: Alisha Atkinson, 12, with her mother Maggie, has endured regular bouts of vomiting since she was six . Her mother Maggie Atkinson has now praised her daughter's fortitude. She said Alisha does her best to live life to the full despite the condition that makes her sick up to 40 times a day and strikes particularly whenever Alisha is stressed or nervous. Mrs Atkinson, 45, of Wakefield, said that it is not known how many people suffer from it and doctors could not diagnose young Alisha for months. She said: 'Alisha was six when she first began being sick a lot. None of the medical staff knew anything about it. 'The doctors didn't know what was wrong with Alisha and they thought she had appendicitis at first because of her stomach pains, then irritable bowel syndrome. 'She had loads of blood tests and scans and eventually the doctors told us about this condition. 'It's difficult to come to terms with such a strange condition that we'd never heard of before - and when they told us there was no cure it was hard to hear.' Cyclic vomiting syndrome causes bouts of severe nausea and vomiting that can last for days. These is currently no known cause. It typically begins in childhood between the ages of three and seven. Most outgrow the condition when they hit their teenage years. Symptoms include nausea and severe vomiting, along with loss of appetite and fatigue. The condition has also been linked to migraines. There are no diagnostic tests for the condition. Doctors will diagnose it from the symptoms after all other causes have been discounted. Treatments include an IV drip for dehydration, anti-nausea drugs and tricyclic antidepressants. For more information visit CVSA UK or The Mayo Clinic . She added: 'She can't eat when she's being sick but she can still drink - although she still gets very dehydrated and at these times we have to take her to hospital. 'The worst episode was when Alisha was sick about 100 times in 24 hours. 'When she's ill it's so unpredictable - she can go to school in the morning completely fine but then I'll get a call to let me know she's ill and needs to come home. 'We can never plan anything. We can't go shopping, on a day out or even holiday because there's always the risk that poor Alisha will get ill.' Since the age of six, Alisha has spent 140 nights in hospital at Pontefract General Infirmary and has intravenous fluids to rehydrate her after each 'episode.' 'When Alisha comes out of one of her episodes she may be well for three to four days, taking everything in her stride,' Mrs Atkinson said. 'But then here we go again, as Alisha calls it, a start to her rocky road.' Mrs Atkinson, who also has a son, Luke, . 14, said the one time the family did enjoy a holiday, Alisha fell ill . on the way home and they went straight to the hospital from the airport. 'People would just look upon Alisha as a happy-go-lucky child with no problems in her life, if only they knew the hell she goes through week-in week-out,' she said. Alisha has tried various medications to ease her symptoms but doctors have yet to find a cure for the condition. Mrs Atkinson said: 'She was a perfectly healthy little girl and this just came out of the blue. We have just got to keep our fingers crossed that she will grow out of it.'","During worst episode, Alisha was sick 100 times in 24 hours .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 9:43 AM on 26th December 2011 . This hungry toddler wandered off from his parents and ate his way through a three-tiered wedding cake as it was about to be served at a wedding reception. Alfie Mazeika's parents Norma and Kevin discovered him scoffing down the sponge which was due to be served to around 100 guests as dessert at a working men's club in Durham. The two-year-old suffers from a rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi Syndrome which leaves him with an insatiable appetite because his brain is not able to recognise that he is full. Stuffing his face with cake: Alfie Mazeika eats his way through the three-tier sponge at a wedding reception in July after wandering off from the other guests. His rare condition means that he is unable to help himself . Norma, 45, and Kevin, 51, have to carefully monitor his food intake and have even put locks on the kitchen cupboards as left to his own devices he could potentially eat himself to death. Mother-of-six Norma, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said she was horrified when her son disappeared and she discovered him scoffing the cake. 'It was a friends' wedding. He was in his walking frame and he went missing, she said. 'He went walking off somewhere. I said . to my husband, ""where has he gone?"" We went searching and there he was . sat stuffing himself with wedding cake. 'He'd somehow got himself up on to the . seat and then the table where the cake was. He completely destroyed it.

Four-month-old Eva suffered from Peter's anomaly, a rare congenital condition which makes the cornea cloudy.

"By . Graham Smith and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 6:54 AM on 31st December 2011 . The Egyptian authorities have agreed to stop raiding the offices of human rights and pro-democracy groups after the U.S. government intervened. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta welcomed the decision, but expressed 'deep concern' that the attacks by security forces had been allowed to take place. The non-governmental organisations had been accused . by Egypt's military rulers of destabilising security by fomenting . protests with the help of foreign funding. Provocative: Egyptian military stand guard as officials raid a U.S.-headquartered non-governmental organisation office in Cairo yesterday . Thursday's raids on a total of 17 offices . throughout Egypt were part of the ruling generals' attempt to blame . 'foreign hands' for the unrest that continues to roil Egypt since the . 18-day revolt that ousted long-time leader Hosni Mubarak in February. Among the offices ransacked were the . U.S.-headquartered National Democratic Institute, Freedom House and the . International Republican Institute, which is observing Egypt's staggered . parliamentary elections. The Obama administration demanded . Egyptian authorities immediately halt the raids on NGOs, saying they are 'inconsistent' with long-standing . U.S-Egypt cooperation. The U.S. State Department called on . the Egyptian government 'to immediately end the harassment of NGO staff, . return all property and resolve this issue'. Yesterday the Egyptian authorities agreed to call an end to the raids after negotiations with Mr Panetta and U.S. ambassador to Cairo Anne Patterson. Armed raids: Egyptian soldiers ransack the U.S. National Democratic Institute, an NGO (non-governmental) rights group in Cairo as a soldier stands guard . According to a State Department . spokesman, Ms Patterson told the authorities she expected 'all . international NGOs, including those that receive U.S. government . support, to be able to return to normal operations as soon as possible . in support of the democratic transition under way in Egypt.' She agreed to take part in a dialogue . with Egyptian officials to better explain the work of the organizations . and address any concerns they might have. 'These NGOs should be allowed . to operate freely as they do in countries around the world in support . of democracy and free elections,' the spokesman said. After Ms Patterson's discussions, Mr . Panetta spoke by phone to the head of Egypt's ruling military council, . Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, to emphasize the importance the . administration places on the country's democratic transition and the . ability of non-governmental organisations to work. Panetta expressed appreciation for . the decision to stop the raids and make it easier for NGOs to work in . Egypt, a Pentagon spokesman said. 'The secretary emphasised that it is . critical for Egypt to continue on the path to democratic transition,' he . added. The raids on the NGOs were the first since Mubarak left office, though . Egyptian officials have been levying accusations for months that the . civil society groups are serving a foreign agenda. Most recently, Justice Minister Adel Abdel-Hamid this month accused around 300 non-profit . groups of receiving unauthorised foreign funding and using the money for . protests. The Interior Ministry said the raids on ten non-profit organisations were . part of the investigation into foreign funding of rights groups. By far the largest recipient of foreign funding in Egypt is the military . itself, which has for more than 30 years received about $1.3billion in . annual U.S. security assistance. Out of their hands: NDI workers wait as Egyptian officials raid their office . Freedom House said its staff were held incommunicado during the raids . and that mobile phones, laptops, funds and documents found during the . interrogations were confiscated. The group said in a statement the raids . came just three days after it formally submitted papers to register its . offices in accordance with Egyptian law. Troops and police sealed the doors of the civil society groups and . banned anyone from entering or speaking with employees as they were . interrogated. Freedom House spokesman Charles Dunne said: 'In the current fiscal environment, the United States must not subsidise . authoritarianism in Egypt while the Egyptian government is preventing . NGOs from implementing democracy and human rights projects subsidised by . the U.S. taxpayer.' The Cairo-based Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which is . not under investigation, said in a statement that the raids went beyond . the type of Mubarak-era tactics that spurred hundreds of thousands of . Egyptians to take to the streets demanding freedom and democracy during . this year's uprising. ANHRI said in a statement: 'Mubarak's regime did not dare to undertake such practices prior to the . uprising', adding that the storming of the civil society . organisations' offices is part of 'a systematic campaign against these . organisations, which was prepared for in advance'. The country's military was cheered by protesters when it took over . security from Mubarak's hated police force in January during the . uprising. The military, long the country's most powerful establishment . and one that produced Egypt's last three presidents, sought to portray . itself as a key player in the revolt that toppled Mubarak's 29-year . rule. Held hostage: Employees of the NGOs were banned from leaving and were interrogated as officials searched through computer file . However, in the eight months since Mubarak's exit, the military, led . by a general who served for 20 years as Mubarak's defence minister, has . been methodically seeking to discredit the reformers, accusing them of . illegally receiving foreign funds and being part of a plot hatched . abroad to destabilise Egypt. Egypt's leading pro-democracy advocate, Nobel peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, denounced the raids. Writing on his Twitter account, he said: 'Human rights organisations are the guardians of nascent freedom. Efforts to suffocate them will be a major setback and will surely . backfire.' An official with the Egyptian Attorney General's office said at least . one of the U.S.-based organisations being searched was operating without . proper permits. He did not say which one. Laws requiring local and foreign civil society groups to register with . the government have long been a source of contention, with rights . activists accusing the government of using legal provisions to go after . groups critical of its policies. Offenders can be sentenced to prison . terms. A security official said 'influencing public opinion in non-peaceful . ways' is among the possible charges that could be brought against the ten . organisations being investigated. The official spoke on condition of . anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters. The security sweep on civil society offices comes on the heels of a . military crackdown on protesters demanding ruling generals hand over . power to a civilian authority. Soldiers attempting to end the protest . last week beat women and dragged one half-naked while kicking her in the . street. At least 17 protesters were killed, adding to the roughly 100 . people killed in clashes with security since Mubarak's exit. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's deputy director for the . Middle-East and North Africa, said that the ruling . Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is trying to attack groups that have . criticised the military's human rights records. She said: 'I believe SCAF is trying to find some scapegoat for their human rights . record. Targeting civil society was a technique used by . Mubarak, so it really is reminiscent of the worst tactics of the Mubarak . era.'","Egypt's military rulers accuse organisations of destabilising security .

"By . Wil Longbottom and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 2:36 PM on 21st December 2011 . Up to 10,000 women took to the streets of Cairo yesterday to protest against the horrific abuse by soldiers. They were surrounded by a cordon of male protesters as they marched through the centre of Egypt’s capital. And their actions forced an apology from the military regime behind the violence of the past five days. March: A woman holds up a photograph of a protester being dragged along the ground by police . Anger: The protest is one of the first to be led by women - though many had male chaperones . Many carried shocking pictures of . women being dragged by the hair, kicked and stripped – including the . ‘girl in the blue bra’ who was kicked and beaten with metal bars. ‘They say they are here to protect us, . but they are stripping us naked,’ the marchers chanted. Even before the . demonstration was over, the military council governing the country . issued an apology for what it called ‘violations’. It expressed ‘deep regret to the great . women of Egypt’ and reaffirmed ‘its respect and total appreciation for . the women of Egypt and their right to protest, effectively and . positively participate in the political life on the road to the . democratic transition’. And it promised it was taking measures to punish those responsible for violations. Demands: Anger has been mounted over the military government's heavy-handed treatment of demonstrations . United: The women came together from all social and religious backgrounds . But the protesters have little faith in their rulers. The attacks came during clashes since . Friday as troops broke up protests by activists demanding the end to the . rule of the military, which took power after the fall of Hosni Mubarak . in February. Clashes saw military police chasing . young men and women through Tahrir Square and nearby streets, beating . them with clubs and sticks. The images of abuse drew harsh words . from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who described them . as ‘a systematic degradation of Egyptian women’. 'They say they are here to protect us, but they are stripping us naked,' the marchers chanted. 'The girl dragged around is just like my daughter. They do that and then call us thugs,' said Um Hossam, a 54-year old woman in traditional black dress and a veil. 'I am a free woman and attacking this woman or killing protesters is just like going after one of my own children.' Yesterday morning, in the second dawn raid in as many days, troops and riot police descended on Cairo's Tahrir Square in a bid to evict protesters. Dr Ahmed Saad, a volunteer at the field hospital in the square, said a 15-year-old was in a critical condition after being shot. Clashes: Protesters hurl rocks at Egyptian soldiers during a dawn raid in Tahrir Square, Cairo, this morning . Violence: Egyptian protesters hurl rocks at security forces with one holding a stolen riot shield. At least 14 people have been killed since clashes erupted on Friday . Egypt's general are coming under mounting criticism over the excessive use of force by troops against unarmed protesters, including women. Since the latest outbreak of violence on Friday, at least 14 protesters have been killed. Security forces initially succeeded in removing protesters from the square, but they returned a short time later using a different route. They then pulled out following clashes in which protesters hurled rocks at them. The military took power after an 18-day uprising forced long-time leader Hosni Mubarak to step down 10 months ago. They have since been accused by activists and rights groups of mismanaging the transition period, human rights abuses and failing to revive the ailing economy or restore security. Evicted: Soldiers and police managed to force protesters out of Tahrir Square this morning, but they soon returned . Crackdown: Egyptians step over a blood stain running along a street near Tahrir Square. The military has been accused of using excessive violence . Unrest: A woman walks past a mural that reads 'down with the army council of thieves' in Cairo, Egypt. Protesters want the military to hand over power to a civilian authority . On Monday, a member of the military council sought to discredit the revolutionaries behind the ongoing protests and spoke of a conspiracy to 'topple the state' Major General Adel Emara defended the use of force by troops and refused to apologise for the brutality shown, particularly toward female protesters. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, addressing students at Georgetown University yesterday, accused security forces of specifically targeting women. 'And now, women are being attacked, stripped and beaten in the streets,' she said. 'This systematic degradation of Egyptian women dishonours the revolution, disgraces the state and its uniform and is not worthy of a great people.' Rest: An Egyptian protester takes some time out off Tahrir Square. A 15-year-old is in a critical condition after being shot this morning in a raid on the demonstrators . Salvage: A volunteer collects burnt manuscripts from the ruins of the Scientific Institute of Egypt which was torched yesterday . Navi Pillay, UN human rights chief, called on ruling generals to arrest and prosecute officials behind the crackdown. Some newspapers in Egypt have been critical of the crackdown. Independent Al-Tahrir featured a composite picture of Maj Gen Emara addressing a news conference with the iconic image of soldiers stamping and beating a half-naked woman behind him. Mocking his use of the patriotic card in defence of their record, the words 'Egypt always come first' are written below the image. But others have reacted angrily to further protests. A retired army general told a newspaper this week that the protesters should be thrown into 'Hitler's ovens' - a reference to the gas chambers used by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust.","Teenager shot by soldiers after they attempt to remove protesters .

Its twin, Grail-B, will follow on New Year's day. The $496 million mission has taken three months to reach the moon - travelling two million miles. The Nasa team said they will not celebrate New Year's are both in orbit. 'We're on our way there,' said David Lehman of the Nasa Jet Propulsion laboratory. The washing-machine-sized Grail craft are to 'map' the interior of the moon by scanning its gravity field - measured by its effects on the flight paths of the the two craft. Research published . this year suggested that Earth once had dual moons that collided and . formed the moon people gaze at today. Nasa's Grail spacecraft will fire their engines to move into orbit on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day - the twin probes will eventually orbit at just 35 miles up and will 'map' the moon's gravity by measuring its effects on their flight paths . The pair . will fly in formation at an altitude of 34 miles (54.72 kilometers) above the surface, 124 miles apart. The effects of the moon's uneven . gravity on the probes will allow Nasa to form a picture of what is under . the surface. It's a mission that Nasa described as a . 'journey to the centre of the moon', and will map the moon's interior . 100 to 1000 times more accurately than any previous moon mission. The Grail probes - short for Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory - . will spend the next two months tweaking . their positions before they start collecting data in March. The mission’s chief scientist, Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts . Institute of Technology, said 'We actually know more about Mars - than we do about our own moon.' One puzzle scientists hope to solve is why the moon’s far side is more . hilly than the side that always faces Earth. Nasa aims to 'map' the interior of the moon to understand its past -research published earlier this year suggested that Earth once had dual moons that collided and formed the moon that people gaze at today . The twin spacecraft have been travelling to the moon since launching from the Florida coast in September - a leisurely journey over a distance that took the Apollo astronauts just three days. 'Both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch, but one can never take anything for granted in this business,' said mission chief scientist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise. But things could still go wrong. Cosmic rays might interfere with the probes' engine burn and they won’t get boosted into the right orbit. 'I know I’m going to be nervous,' said project manager David Lehman of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the $496 million, three-month mission. The twin Grail probes have been travelling to the moon since September - a journey that took the Apollo astronauts just three days. The probes launched on a smaller rocket to keep costs down . Once in orbit, the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles. Data collection will begin in March. Previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success. Grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal. As the probes circle the moon, regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down. This in turn will change the distance between them. Radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps, allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field. Once in orbit, the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles . Using the gravity information, scientists can deduce what’s below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces Earth. Spectators on the north coast of Cocoa Beach Pier observing in awe as the Delta II rocket launches towards space . The probes are officially known as . Grail-A and Grail-B. Several months ago, NASA hosted a contest inviting . schools and students to submit new names. The probes will be christened . with the winning names after the second orbit insertion, Zuber said. 'Grail, simply put, is a journey to the centre of the moon' said Ed Weiler, head of Nasa's science mission. Spectacular: A huge moon-shaped ball of smoke is produced as the Delta II rocket lifts off . Lead scientist, Maria Zuber said of the mission, 'It . will probe the interior of the moon and map its gravity field 100 to . 1,000 times better than ever before. We will learn more about the . interior of the moon with Grail than all previous lunar missions . combined,' Weiler said. Zuber, . the Grail mission's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at . the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the precise lunar . gravity measurements will help her and other planetary scientists better . understand how the moon evolved over the past 4 billion years. The findings also . should help identify the composition of the moon's core: whether it's . made of solid iron or possibly titanium oxide. Another . puzzle that Grail may help solve, Zuber said, is whether Earth once had . a smaller second moon. Astronomers have speculated that some of the 'landmarks' on the moon's surface are a result of a collision with a second, smaller moon. Knowing . where the moon's gravity is stronger will enable the United States and . other countries to better pinpoint landing locations for future . explorers, whether robot or human. The gravity on the moon is uneven and . about one-sixth Earth's pull. 'If . you want to land right next to a particular outcrop (of rock), you're . going to be able to do it.

"Rise in demand is believed to coincide with job losses following economic downturn . A quarter of Britons are thought to suffer from mental illness every year . By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 12:53 PM on 30th December 2011 . Soaring numbers of Britons are turning to antidepressants and other pills to combat anxiety, figures show. Last year nearly 50million prescriptions were handed out, a rise of a quarter in the past four years. The most commonly prescribed drugs include citalopram hydrobromide, amitriptyline, Prozac and diazepam. Troubled: Rising stress levels are believed to have triggered the increase in prescriptions of pills . Experts claim the rise has been partly triggered by job losses and financial woes caused by the economic crisis. But others have also suggested that people are more inclined to seek out help as there is now less stigma attached  to depression and anxiety-related disorders. The figures were uncovered by the  Co-operative Pharmacy based on results of Freedom of Information requests to 150 Primary Care Trusts in England. They reveal that 49,864,399 items were prescribed for depression or anxiety in 2010/11, up from 39,556,255 in 2007/8. But while the numbers handed out have gone up, the costs to the NHS have actually fallen as GPs are prescribing fewer brand-name drugs. Instead they are using so-called generic drugs, which are essentially the same as the label versions but much cheaper. Last year the NHS spent £258,360,117 on the drugs, down from £291,583,854, according to the figures. Still, it is estimated that depression is costing the country almost £11 billion a year in lost earnings, demands on the health service and in prescribing drugs to tackle the problem. As the number of unemployed increase the demand for the pill has risen . Around a quarter of Britons are thought to suffer from some form of mental illness every year, although experts say most  will not seek help from their GP or counsellors. The most common forms are depression or anxiety disorders and they are often triggered by bereavement, marital breakdown or other emotional events. Mandeep Mudhar, NHS business director at the Co-operative Pharmacy, said: ‘Our research has shown that the NHS  is getting greater value for money but, worryingly, prescription items have risen at an alarming rate, up 26 per cent in just four years. It is clear more people are seeking medical help to treat depression and anxiety. ‘However, there are many more people who do not share their experiences. If people do feel depressed we urge them to seek medical help.’ Emer O’Neill, chief executive of Depression Alliance, said: ‘For some people depression just happens, but for others  it is triggered by stressful events, for example losing a job, property or bereavement. ‘These uncertain economic times are linked to an increase in the number of people with the illness. ‘However, this is just the tip of the iceberg, as for every person diagnosed with depression there are many more who suffer in silence. ‘Getting an early diagnosis, finding the right support mechanisms and treatment for each individual is crucial to beating the illness. ‘At this time of year, many individuals can feel lonely or isolated but there are a range of support groups available to help with depression.’","Rise in demand is believed to coincide with job losses following economic downturn .

The family of a high-flying lawyer who plunged 100ft to her death from a cliff on a Caribbean island where she lived with her new husband said yesterday they accepted it had been an accident. Sarah Thomas, 46, is said to have been picking herbs from the garden of her villa in St Lucia on Christmas Day hours after returning from an all-night party with her husband Kevin, 36, when she slipped. Mrs Thomas, who had been married for five months, had given up a lucrative career as a City tax lawyer and was hoping to start a family. Sarah at her wedding to Kevin Thomas five months ago. She is believed to have lost her footing while picking herbs from the garden of her villa in St Lucia at 10am on Christmas Day . Police on the island initially said they were investigating whether there was any suspicion of foul play, but have now concluded it was a tragic accident. A post-mortem examination confirmed that Mrs Thomas died from head wounds from her fall. Yesterday her devastated parents William and Christine Pickering and sister Alison said they accepted the police findings and wanted her to be laid to rest on the island. ‘She will be buried in St Lucia, where her heart is,’ said Mrs Pickering, of Ashton-on-Ribble, Lancashire. ‘We wish to make it clear that there has been a full police investigation and we believe that Sarah’s death is just the result of a terrible accident.’ She added: ‘Sarah had been incredibly happy with Kevin. St Lucia was her home. She moved there in 2010 and had a wonderful wedding last summer. She loved Kevin and loved the island. ‘Words can’t express what we feel at the loss of our lovely daughter.’ A post-mortem confirmed Mrs Thomas died from head wounds after falling from this cliff. Police initially said they were investigating whether there was any suspicion of foul play, but have now concluded it was a tragic accident . Mrs Thomas left her job as a managing director of tax advisers Alvarez & Marsal Taxand in 2010. She set up home with her husband, who is believed to be unemployed, in the village of Piaye where he grew up. She also had a £1million house in Clapham, South London. The couple met when she was on a business trip to New York where Mr Thomas was working and moved to the village, which is rarely visited by tourists. They had gone to an all-night party nearby on Christmas Eve before returning to their £350,000 clifftop villa. At 10am on Christmas Day Mrs Thomas’s body was found at the bottom of the cliffs, apparently after slipping while collecting herbs from the garden to make gravy. Neighbours saw Mr Thomas pacing around the clifftop with his head in his hands shortly afterwards. One neighbour, Eunice Sylvester, 34, said: ‘From the herb plant to the edge of the cliff is about ten yards. Nobody really knows what happened.’","Sarah Thomas plunged 100ft to her death hours after returning from an all-night party on Christmas Day .

In her loving arms: Mia Cox (right) smiles broadly as she gets a big hug off new sister Bree after being adopted from the Ukraine by American couple Kris and Kecia Cox . Her beaming smile and the giant hug from her new sister is a world away from the lonely, uncertain life little Mia had been destined to face. At just four years old, she was due to be transferred from her orphanage in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk to an adult mental health institution simply because she has Down syndrome. There, she would have no hope of a family or an education - only the prospect of growing up in an environment of neglect. But she now has a new, loving home, complete with adoring parents and siblings after her picture was spotted on the internet by American couple Kris and Kecia Cox. 'Her eyes were really what spoke to us first,' Mrs Cox told ABC World News. 'They just grabbed us, and we just knew that she was saying: ""You're my mom and you're my dad, and you're supposed to come get me."" Her photograph was posted on the website for Reece's Rainbow, a nonprofit organisation that helps match disabled children - most of them with Down syndrome in eastern Europe - with families in the United States. In the Ukraine, where society praises appearances, children with the condition are often abandoned at birth. Placing them in grotty institutions alongside adults with severe mental illness is quite common. Mia, as she has been renamed by the Coxs, was born Kareen in Donetsk on Jaunary 15, 2007, but when she diagnosed with Down syndrome, her parents terminated their parental rights. Just a month after Kareen was born, Mrs Cox received the same heartbreaking news Kareen's birth mother was told - her third daughter named Bree also had the condition. Kecia and Kris were devastated. Uncertain future: Mia, formerly called Kareen, appears anxious as she waits for her new parents at her orphanage in the Ukraine. It's a long way from her relaxed outlook today . Bleak: A child (not Mia) stares out of a window at an adult mental health institution like the one where the four-year-old was due to be sent. Placing very young children with unstable adults is commonplace in the Ukraine . But their experience made them . determined to bring some love into the life of someone in their . daughter's position who was far less fortunate. So they started trawling . Reece's Rainbow. 'We would . come home at night and, you know, get up, get on our laptop and sit in . bed and look through all these pictures of the babies and nothing stood . out,' Mrs Cox said. And then . one day, when Kris was at work and Kecia was on the computer at home, . she clicked on Kareen's picture. It was one she had seen before, but . this time something pulled at her. 'When . I came in and we sat down and started talking, she, I mean she just . burst into tears,' Kris said. 'Basically just said: ""I think I found our . daughter.""' From then on, it was a family effort to raise money through yard sales and fundraisers to pay for the $30,000 adoption. Emotional: Mr and Mrs Cox were desperate to help a child in need after their own experience of having a daughter with Down syndrome . 'I think we found our daughter': The couple spotted Mia through Reece's Rainbow, a non-profit organisation that helps match disabled children in eastern Europe with families in the United States . The girls - Kyra, nine, Adrie, six, . and Bree - made bookmarks and manned lemonade stands. And perhaps the . biggest sacrifice for three children, they dumped out their jar of coins . they'd been saving for a family trip to Disneyland. Kecia and Kris then embarked on a month-long trip to the Ukraine to complete the complex process of adopting. When . the couple walked into the orphanage for the first time, they were . ushered into a large room with toys on a table and a large mural on the . wall. And then Kareen was brought in, carried by a nurse, her shortly hair carefully styled with tiny white rosettes. 'Priviet,' Kecia said to the little girl – 'Hello' in Russian. She reached out to touch her daughter for the first time. When asked if they wanted to adopt her, they signed the papers on the spot. Big hug: Mia welcomes Mr Cox as he arrives at the orphanage to start the adoption process . Getting acquainted: Mia gets a cuddle from Mr Cox as the couple get into a routine with her at the orphanage during their month-long stay in the Ukraine . Turning her back on it: Mia takes one last look around as she leaves her orphanage with Mr and Mrs Cox ready for a new life in America . They returned to the orphanage the . next day to start a routine that would last them the next 3½ weeks, . taking Kareen to a small playground on a lot of unmowed grass outside . the orphanage. 'She smiled a . little when we first met her,' Kecia said. 'But after only a couple of . days she had a sparkle in her eyes that she did not have before.' As . Kris carried her around the playground - she was a Daddy's girl from . the very start - Kecia touched Kris' chest and told Kareen: 'Papa' At . the end of the 32-day stay, Kris and Kecia walked with her through the . orphanage gates for the final time. Mia stopped to look behind her, but . never looked back again. Mia's new family: The youngster pictured with Mr and Mrs Cox and their three children - Kyra, Adrie and Bree . In the weeks that followed, Mia changed a little bit more every day. Her pale skin became rosy from spending time in the summer sun, ABC News reported. Doctors say her weak legs are much stronger and she will eventually walk normally. Her hair grew in thicker and she gained weight, benefiting from a new diet that included fruits, vegetables and protein. She began learning sign language and now signs words like 'shoes'. She says 'bye-bye' and 'Papa' or 'Daddy' and knows what it means to 'give loves'. Her sisters have taught her how to play on the swingset, how to terrorize the backyard in a motorized Barbie jeep, how to put on dance parties in the playroom. 'We haven't even touched on her capabilities. She has so much to give and that the world gets to see that now,' Kecia said.

Scorpion under ultraviolet light: Biologist Douglas Gaffin of the University of Oklahoma investigated the 'fluorescence' and found that the creatures seem to be able to 'sense' light using their tails . 'Scorpions are largely solitary, nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan-green under UV light,' wrote Gaffin in a paper in Animal Behaviour. 'The function of this fluorescence is a mystery.' Gaffin's team 'blindfolded' scorpions, then tested them with various different colours of light -  and found that the tails seemed to function like secondary 'eyes'. The insects' shell works as a 'whole-body' sensor which relays information about light to the nervous system - so any part of a scorpion can 'see'. Scorpion's shells appear to be able to send information to the scorpion so that their whole body works like a giant 'eye' - enabling the creature to seek shelter more effectively . 'The cuticle (casing)  may function as a whole-body light collector which relays information to the nervous system,' the researchers wrote. 'Scorpions may use this information to detect shelter, as . blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signal.'","Scorpions 'sense' light with their bodies .

Snub: Several Muslim leaders turned down an invitation by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his comments over NYPD policing practices . Several Muslim leaders have refused invitations to the New York Mayor's interfaith breakfast over 'disturbing' claims police are spying on and infiltrating mosques. The unnamed imams and activists said in a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg they're disturbed by New York Police Department's intelligence-gathering programs which monitored Muslim groups, businesses and houses of worship. Reports recently revealed . 16 police officers speaking at least five languages were assigned to use . census information and government databases to map ethnic neighbourhoods . in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Undercover . police officers known as ‘rakers’ visited local businesses such as . Islamic bookstores and cafes, chatting up store owners to determine . their ethnicities and gauge their views. They played cricket and eavesdropped in ethnic cafes and clubs. But Mayor Bloomberg has defended the NYPD, saying it doesn't take religion into account in its policing. His spokesman Stu Loeser added although a several people turned down the breakfast invitation, a couple of dozen said they plan to attend. In an open letter to Mayor Bloomberg the Muslim leaders said they believe NYPD police measures ‘threaten the rights of all Americans, and deepen mistrust between our communities and law enforcement.’ 'Disturbing': In an open letter several Muslim leaders condemned Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly's alleged practices . 'Mayor Bloomberg, the extent of these civil rights violations is astonishing, yet instead of calling for accountability and the rule of law, you have thus far defended the NYPD's misconduct,' the letter said. The Muslim leaders said they although they appreciate the mayor's support a year ago during an uproar over a planned Islamic center near the World Trade Center site they are disappointed by reports police were infiltrating Muslim neighbourhoods. The leaders claim aggressive programs designed by a CIA officer who worked with the department after the September 11 attacks are unnecessary and troubling. Aggressive: The leaders claim the program designed by a CIA officer for NYPD officers to infiltrate mosques is 'troubling' The CIA is prohibited from spying domestically. Its unusual partnership with the NYPD has troubled top lawmakers and prompted an internal investigation. Mayor Bloomberg in October defended the arrangement, saying it was necessary in a dangerous world. 'There are people trying to kill us,' he said. 'And if the CIA can help us I'm all for getting any information they have and then letting the police department use it as - if it's appropriate to protect you and to protect me.' Appreciated: Although the leaders snubbed Mayor Bloomberg's invitation they acknowledged in the refusal letter his support over support a year ago during an uproar over a planned Islamic center near the World Trade Center . The letter noted that Muslims comprise at least 10 per cent of the city's population. It said the Muslims leaders were seeking a meeting with the mayor to discuss the issues raised by the reports. It read: ""We are deeply disturbed that to date we have only heard your words of strong support for these troubling policies and violations of our rights. 'We are equally disturbed by (Police Commissioner Raymond) Kelly's denials of what we know to be true as verified by the leaked documents.'",Muslim leaders claim reports of police measures ‘deepen mistrust between our communities and law enforcement'

The owner of a ferocious dog that mauled a woman to death after being kept in a tiny cage walked free from court after a judge said his actions did not deserve a jail term. Alex Blackburn-Smith, 34, admitted failing to ensure the welfare of his two-and-a-half-year-old Neapolitan mastiff Debo - likened to a hound from the Harry Potter films - but was told his behaviour had not 'passed the custody threshold'. The former paratrooper kept the eight-stone beast cooped up in close quarters in the weeks before it mauled 52-year-old Barbara Williams, Croydon Magistrates' Court heard. Alex Blackburn-Smith arrives at Croydon Magistrates Court to be sentenced . She died after she was savaged by the animal at Blackburn-Smith's home in Wallington, Surrey on December 23, 2010. He was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but later admitted failing to ensure the welfare of the animal. Blackburn-Smith kept Debo in a cage that was too small, which could have caused the dog to become violent, the court was told yesterday. But RSPCA officers and a police community support officer failed to notice this when they visited Blackburn-Smith's home regarding a separate noise complaint prior to the attack on Ms Williams. Debo, described as 'ferocious' and 'distinctly large' by police, was shot dead by armed marksmen, who contained the snarling animal using riot shields after the attack. Debo was a Neapolitan mastiff similar to the one pictured . Blackburn-Smith also admitted being in possession of a fighting dog after police also seized a cross/pitbull puppy called Ruby. At the time of the attack, three other people and a child were also living in the property, the court heard. Police were called to Blackburn-Smith's home at 8.57pm on December 23, said Angela Williams, prosecuting. 'They discovered a female with severe injuries lying in the hallway. She was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene,' she said. 'The Neapolitan mastiff was located, isolated and destroyed. 'The pitbull puppy was also seized.' One witness told how Ms Williams and another woman were upstairs watching TV then went to the kitchen, where the two dogs were kept in cages. Debo was heard to growl then told to be quiet, the court heard, but the dog managed to force the cage open and attack the victim. Richard Jeffries, defending, said: 'It's clear the two charges relate to different dogs. Ruby was Debo's daughter. 'No one knows what set Debo off, police carried out an inquiry and the defendant was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.' It was only after a full inquiry that he was charged with the two offences for which he appeared in court. Mr Jeffries said: 'Keeping Debo in the cage may have been a contributing factor. 'Debo was bought as a family pet and was the same style of dog as you might see in the Harry Potter films. The lawyer defending Blackburn-Smith likened Debo to Fang - Hagrid's dog in the Harry Potter Films - pictured with actor Robbie Coltrane . 'Barbara Williams was more than a lodger, she was perceived as an auntie. 'Nothing I say can diminish the tragedy that occurred and that is something my client has to live with every day.' Blackburn-Smith was banned from owning any animal and having anything to do with keeping or transporting animals at an earlier hearing. Today he was handed a community order and told to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £3340 court costs - half the total sum - due to him being unemployed and on benefits. District Judge Robert Hunter told him: 'We don't know what the direct cause of the attack was. 'I give you a degree of credit for your guilty plea, albeit at a late stage. 'I can't say this matter has passed the custody threshold so I sentence you to a community order and 150 hours' unpaid work.'","Former paratrooper kept the eight-stone .

Gunman: Michael Atherton shot dead three women then turned the gun on himself at a house in Horden, Peterlee, on New Year's Day . Police seized triple killer Michael Atherton’s shotguns three years ago – but returned them to him because they did not think he posed a danger. Officers removed six guns from Atherton’s home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself. But he successfully applied for their return simply by denying that he had ever felt suicidal. Yesterday MPs said the decision on removing guns should not be left solely to the discretion of a police officer and must involve a health professional as well as checks with the owner’s partner. Atherton, 42, shot his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, shortly after returning home from a pub late on New Year’s Day. Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry said Atherton and his partner of 19 years had gone out separately and ‘an argument took place’ on their return to the semi-detached house in Greenside Avenue, Peterlee, County Durham. He said: ‘Mr Atherton produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead Susan, Tanya and Alison before turning the gun on himself.’ The women’s bodies were found in the kitchen and living room and a shotgun was by Atherton’s side. The killer’s stepdaughter Laura McGoldrick, 19, was slightly wounded and escaped from the house by climbing out of a first-floor window. Friends said the once ‘happy-go-lucky’  family man had been depressed about a heart problem.Neighbour Jean Gray, 74, said both Atherton and Mrs McGoldrick were ‘very good neighbours’. She added: ‘I couldn’t say anything bad about either of them. He was a happy-go-lucky person and very well liked. ‘I just don’t know what happened to him. He must have snapped somehow.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

She died alongside her daughter Tanya, right, who at 24 was the . youngest of the three killed in the New Year's Day tragedy . Atherton was a keen angler before taking up game shooting several years ago. Elaine Wilkinson, a friend who runs a fishing tackle shop, said Mrs McGoldrick phoned her last year to ask for advice because Atherton was refusing to get treatment for a heart problem. Mrs Wilkinson’s husband, Bert, died three years ago from a heart attack. ‘She was really worried about Mick, she was on about his heart and the fact that he wasn’t doing anything about it,’ she said. ‘He was a very friendly chap on the outside but I don’t know what he was like between the four walls of his house. Laughing killer: Michael Atherton at an awards evening in 2005. He was a keen angler and took up shooting several years ago . ‘He had suffered from depression for . quite a while, I think. I don’t know if that’s got something to do with . this. They were both hot-headed but very nice people.’ Police . have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints . Committee over the decision to return three licensed shotguns and three . ‘high-powered’ firearms, believed to be rifles, after Atherton . threatened to shoot himself in 2008. Grahame . Morris, Labour MP for Easington, said: ‘At the time the police took his . firearms from him and he applied to have them returned. Police made an . assessment and they were returned to him.’ Durham Police confirmed . that the weapons were taken from Mr Atherton’s house as a precaution, . but as he insisted there had been no threat to harm himself, the weapons . were returned. Shot at close range: Susan McGoldrick, circled bottom right, the partner of gunman Michael Atherton, was killed in the massacre; the identities of her friends in this image is not known . That . decision followed national procedure, a force spokesman said. ‘It was . one person’s word against another,’ he said. ‘If there were no grounds . for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be . returned to the firearms licence holder.’ Commenting . on firearms regulations, Mr Morris said: ‘At the moment it is fairly . subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment . of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms . licence. ‘My view is . there should be some input from a suitably qualified health care . professional. Secondly, I also wonder whether it is reasonable to keep . firearms in a domestic situation.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said the law ‘should be simplified, clarified and made consistent’. Escape: Laura McGoldrick, pictured at her 18th birthday party, was shot during the incident but managed to escape by climbing through a window . Desperate: Drenched in blood and hysterical, Laura, pictured, pounded on the door of a neighbour's house . He . said it would be ‘appropriate’ for the Government to look at gun laws . in Canada where the partners of gun licence applicants are  contacted in . advance of a licence being issued. Friends . have paid tribute to the victims on the internet. Mrs McGoldrick was a . popular figure in the local supermarket where she worked, Miss Turnbull . was an Avon Lady who also worked in a shoe shop and her mother Alison . was described as a ‘lovely woman’. Martin Peel, who knew Atherton  since his school days, said: ‘He was completely sane except for that one night. ‘No one could imagine he would do something like this.

A soldier who was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan has today been named by the Ministry of Defence. Private John King, 19, was from the 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, and was killed in a blast in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province on Friday. Private King, from Darlington, joined the Army in 2009 and deployed to Afghanistan in October. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Private King was taking part in a partnered foot patrol with Afghan national security forces to increase security around the village of Llara Kalay. It said in a statement: 'The patrol had identified insurgents in the area and had begun to search and clear a number of compounds in the village. 'The Afghan National Army members of the patrol came under fire from insurgents and the International Security Assistance Force soldiers moved forwards to support them. 'During the firefight Private King was caught in the blast from an Improvised Explosive Device and was killed in action, despite the best efforts of medics at the scene.' Private King had deployed to Afghanistan as part of Combined Force Nahr-e-Saraj (North), commanded by the Danish Battle Group. The MoD said: 'As an infantryman on the front line he played a pivotal role in the counter-insurgency campaign. He was also a friend to the local community and our Afghan partners, especially the local police, who considered him a brother-in-arms.' Private King leaves mother Karen, father Barry, brothers Ian and Stephen, and girlfriend Kelly. The family said: 'John was a tremendous . son, brother and boyfriend. He was a devoted grandson, a loving family . member, and a proud soldier who died doing a job he adored. Upset: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'hugely saddened' to learn of the death of Private John King . 'He will be sadly missed by all his family, friends, and loyal German Shepherd dog Rex.' Lieutenant Colonel Dan Bradbury, Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment said: 'Private King had been part of the 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment for a little over 18 months - but one of the busiest 18 months in the Battalion's recent history. 'From early on he was able to fit in quickly through a combination of hard work, grit, a willingness to endure difficult conditions and an irrepressible sense of humour. 'Always the first to volunteer for anything, he was one of B Company's characters: someone who could be found at the front at work or play, and was hugely popular as a result. 'His cheeky smile - no matter what we were doing - is the thing we will miss most of all.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'I was hugely saddened to learn of the death of Private John King. 'His colleagues speak of a soldier with true grit and determination who was always willing to support and help those around him, and above all of his tremendous sense of humour. 'I extend my deepest condolences to his family, loved ones and to his brothers in arms in The Yorkshire Regiment.' A total of 394 British troops have died since the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001.","Victim's family say he was a 'proud soldier' who died doing a job he adored .

He was the last member of the Republican party to hold office in the White House - but it seems none of the new candidates want to talk about him. George W. Bush, the two-term U.S. President who finished just three years ago, has hardly been mentioned on the GOP campaign trail so far. No contenders have embraced a legacy of huge budget deficits, two wars and record low approval ratings - or blame him for America’s troubles. Not remembered: George W. Bush, a two-term President who finished just three years ago, has hardly been mentioned on the GOP campaign trail so far . The seven contenders often criticise Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama - but only fleeting references have been made to President Bush. However his name was brought up by a voter in a question to Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who is often critical of U.S. military engagements abroad. ‘We've had, in the past, a couple of presidents from Texas that said they weren't interested in wars - like George W. Bush,’ the voter said. ‘My question is - how can we trust another Texan?’ Analyst Jack Pitney said Republicans 'talk a lot about losing their way during the last decade' and are 'talking about the Bush years'. ‘For Republicans, the Bush administration has become the ""yadda yadda yadda"" period of American history,’ the political science professor added. Targets: The seven contenders often criticise Ronald Reagan, right, and Barack Obama, left - but only fleeting references have been made to President Bush . When the eight-year Bush presidency does surface it's often a point of criticism, with a former Pennsylvania senator coming in with an attack. 'For Republicans, the Bush administration has become the ""yadda yadda yadda"" period of American history' Jack Pitney . Candidate Rick Santorum told CNN on Sunday that he regretted voting for the No Child Left Behind education law Bush championed. The former president himself has been all but invisible since leaving office in 2009 with a Gallup approval rating of just 34 per cent. Bill Clinton had a 66 per cent approval rating in 2001 when he stepped down after two terms marred by a sex scandal and impeachment. The presidential contest has been dominated by concerns over the weak economy, government spending and the $15trillion federal debt. But Republicans controlled Congress for six of the eight years President Bush was in power, clearing the way for many of his policies to be enacted. Contender: Rick Santorum told CNN on Sunday that he regretted voting for the No Child Left Behind education law George W. Bush championed . President Obama's policies, including the federal stimulus programme and car industry bailout, have swollen the deficit and deepened the debt. 'I think Bush has made America a safer nation and better nation and I'm proud of it. But politics isn't about what's fair, it's about winning' Ari Fleischer . He often falls back on complaints about the bad situation he inherited when seeking to defend his own economic performance. But while he may often like to blame the Bush years, GOP presidential contenders seem just as eager to pretend those years never happened. ‘Sad to say, they're looking at polling data that indicates they're better off not bringing him into the campaign,’ ex-Bush spin doctor Ari Fleischer said. ‘I think President Bush has made America a safer nation and better nation and I'm proud of it. But politics isn't about what's fair - it's about winning.’ Taking office in 2001 with a balanced . federal budget and a surplus, he pushed through sweeping tax cuts that . were not offset by spending cuts. Unpopular: George W. Bush left office with an approval rating of 34 per cent . The tax cuts have cost about $1.8trillion and were set to expire after 10 years, but President Obama . allowed them to remain in place temporarily. That was in exchange for a jobless benefits extension and a payroll tax cut. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after . the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 were never budgeted and have cost . taxpayers $1.4trillion so far. Bush signed legislation in 2003 . enacting a prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare, projected to . cost as much as $1.2trillion over 10 years. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank bailout programme widely loathed by many conservatives, was another Bush-era program.

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 12:55 PM on 29th December 2011 . Roger French says the M25 is a 'fascinating' motorway . For many drivers the M25, with its gridlock and never-ending roadworks, is a road to be avoided at all cost. But it seems that there are some who would happily pay to experience life in the slowest of lanes. Brighton and Hove Bus and Coach Company is offering sightseers a tour of the London Orbital. Tourists pay £15 for the journey on the 117 mile road as they learn a bit about the history of the motorway that has been dubbed the 'UK's largest car park'. And there was such interest in the . planned trip that the company has even added a second date - bringing . the inaugural tour forward by seven months. The . bus company, which also runs day trips to tourist attractions such as . Blenheim Palace, Beaulieu National Motor Museum, Bath and Bluewater . shopping centre, included the M25 tour in its 2012 brochure earlier this . month. The planned date was 11 October but another date, 22 March, has now been added. The . trip departs from Worthing and picks up at Hove and Brighton before . heading north on the A23 and M23 to join the M25 at the Merstham . Interchange. The toss of a coin decides which direction the coach will . then travel around the motorway. According to its website, the tour will also include commentary on ‘interesting facts about the motorway’s evolution’. Company spokesman Roger French said the motorway was ‘fascinating’. 'It goes through six home counties and you get a whole taste of the variety of London,’ he said. The coach trip has already proved so popular the company had to put on an extra date . Jams today, probably jams tomorrow: A sightseeing tour of the M25 has the potential to last a while . 117 miles The length of the M25 . 1hr 40mins How long a lap takes at 70mph . 147mph The highest speed recorded by police on the motorway . £909m How much it cost to build . 11 years The time it took to build . 12 The number of lanes at its widest . 454 The number of accidents in its first year . 'In Essex you come to Epping Forest and coming round by Heathrow you see the planes coming in to land.' The first to book on the Brighton and Hove Bus tour was Nicholas Lambert, 55  as a retirement gift for his sister Ashley and her husband Paul. Mr Lambert, told the Sun: ‘They have travelled round places like the Panama Canal and Red Sea so I thought it was time they travelled the real world.’ Mr French praised the M25's 'iconic' status, and said: 'As you go around past Clacket Lane Services, you get . some lovely views from our coach that you just don't see from a car.' He said the trip was already . proving so popular that he needed to bring forward the date of the inaugural tour. 'It's selling well to our main market, women in their 60s, but we're also seeing a lot of interest from ""geeky"" males,' he said. But it seems that the South Coast firm is not the only one to see the M25’s potential as a tourist attraction. The Queen Elizabeth Bridge at Dartford is billed as one of the attractions of the M25 bus tour . The coach trip will also take sightseers past the impressive sight of Heathrow's Terminal 5 . The Epping Forest will provide one non-manmade attraction on the route . London-based firm Premium Tours also plans to launch its own tours of the M25 to coincide with the Olympics. It is making the somewhat bold claim that the M25 is London’s answer to Route 66. Its slogan reads: ‘Forget Route 66, join us on a Premium Tour of the world’s greatest road: the M25.’ The trip will stop off at points of interest such as Waltham Abbey, Wisley Gardens and Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 5, The Independent reports. Premium Tours managing director, Neil Wootton, told the newspaper: 'We welcome competition from our friends in Brighton – it's the Olympics, after all. 'But don't be surprised if some of our coaches are creating traffic problems ahead of their buses, or blockading the M23. 'They won't be able to match our standards of comfort, nor our plan for an “Alternative Marathon”. 'This is understood to involve taking a vintage Routemaster bus around the M25 on 5 August, the day of the Olympic women's marathon.’ Speaking to the BBC, travel writer Simon Calder said: 'I think we have got a bit of an arms race developing here. 'I fear before long we are going to be nose to tail with coach trips on the M25. 'I do not buy Roger French's lyrical description of the beautiful English countryside seen from the M25. 'But it is a fantastic route to use to get to all kinds of marvellous places.' Professor Edmund King, president of the AA, said: 'I'm not sure regular M25ers will welcome the addition of coach loads of tourists gawping at their misfortune.'",Bus company offers coach trips of the London Orbital .

The funeral of a mother and her two young sons who are thought to have been stabbed to death by the boys' father took place today. Through heavy rain and high winds, the coffins of Clair Smith, 36, Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, were brought to Rawdon Crematorium in Leeds in two hearses. Clair's husband, Richard, 37, is believed to have attacked his family at their home in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, before setting light to the main bedroom a day later and killing himself by smoke inhalation. He was not cremated with his family. Two hearses carrying the coffin of Claire Smith (front) and those of her two children, Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, arrive at Rawdon Crematorium, Leeds, for their funeral service today . The tiny white coffin for baby Aaron and a bigger one for Ben, adorned with a football made of flowers in tribute to the soccer-mad youngster, are carried to the service . The first black hearse held a traditional wooden coffin for Clair, followed by the second which contained two small white coffins, a tiny one for baby Aaron and a bigger one for Ben on top of which was a football made of flowers in tribute to the soccer-mad youngster. The cars slowly pulled down a winding drive to the crematorium, surrounded by a heavy woodland, for a private gathering to pay tribute to the tragic family. After the hour-long service, mourners young and old, dressed in black and wrapped up to brave the windy day, left the crematorium, many arm-in-arm to support each other. A murder inquiry was launched last month after police said the family were found dead together on a double bed in the fire-damaged main bedroom of their home in Sheridan Way, Pudsey, on Sunday, December 11. Richard Smith (pictured) killed his wife Clair, also pictured here with Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, at the family home in Pudsey, West Yorkshire in December. He was not cremated with his family .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:58 PM on 4th January 2012 . There was double humiliation at Penn State's final football game of the season, after one student dressed up as anti-paedophile mascot 'Paedobear' to protest at the sex scandal cover up at the college. The unknown fan dressed in the provocative outfit during Penn State's 30-14 defeat in the Ticketcity Bowl in Dallas, Texas, and carried a sign that read: 'Keep quiet and don't tell anyone.' The game between the Nittany Lions and Houston Cougars at the Cotton Bowl stadium was taking place without Penn State's long-serving coach, Joe Paterno, who was sacked in November over the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal. Scandal: Jerry Sandusky denies more than 50 charges of alleged abuse of young boys. Right, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was sacked after it emerged he had failed to act on warnings about possible abuse . Charges: Last month Sandusky, pictured with wife Dottie, waived his right to a preliminary hearing . Sandusky, assistant coach to Paterno . for 30 years, faces more than 50 child sex-abuse charges over decades of . alleged abuse of young boys. Wearing . the costume was apparently the idea of a University of Texas fan, . furious at the apparent cover up of Sandusky's alleged abuse. A . user on the university's sports message board, Ghost of LL, wrote: 'The . conspiracy undertaken by the staff and administrators of the . Pennsylvania State University to cover up the rape of children so as not . to damage its precious football program is shameful. 'For . a decade, Penn State employees, agents, trustees and officers - from . the janitor to the president of the university all the way up to the . Lord High Football Coach - knew that Jerry Sandusky was raping children, . and doing so on Penn State property.' Message: The fan was wearing a bear suit in reference to this internet meme - 'paedobear'. Originally it was used to signify illegal pornography, but is now used to signify paedophilia . Sandusky has said he is innocent of . more than 50 charges stemming from alleged sexual assaults over 15 years . on 10 boys at his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere. The scandal prompted the sacking of Hall of Fame football coach Paterno and the school's long-time president, Graham Spanier. Former athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz also face charges of perjury and failure to report a crime. The appearance of the 'Paedobear' is the latest blow to the college since the scandal erupted last year. Last . month, Sandusky waived his right to a preliminary hearing just before . the first witness was due to testify against him in a Pennsylvania . courtroom. The 67-year-old said: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defence and stay the course for four full quarters.' His attorney, Joe Amendola, then told reporters if they believed claims against his client they should call 1-800-REALITY - the number of a gay-sex phone service. And another of his lawyers, Karl Rominger, claimed he had showered with boys from his Second Mile charity to 'teach them basic hygiene skills'. The image of the 'Paedobear' is apparently used as a signal in online message boards that illegal pornographic images have been posted, although not necessarily paedophilia. It has since been used to indicate the existence of child pornography or to mock paedophiles and draw attention to their actions.","Fan dressed in provocative outfit at Penn State's 30-14 defeat in Ticketcity Bowl, Dallas .

Three more major Tory donors were rewarded in the New Year honours list, it emerged yesterday, as the political row over the ‘devalued’ system intensified. Doug Ellis, James Wates and James Lupton received a knighthood and two CBEs respectively, for charitable and philanthropic work. They have given £370,000 to the Tory Party between them. The revelation put fresh pressure on David Cameron, already under attack after a knighthood went to another Tory donor, Paul Ruddock, and a CBE to property tycoon Gerald Ronson, who was jailed for his part in the Guinness share-trading scandal. CBEs: Investment banker James Lupton, left, has given . £105,000 to the Tories in recent years while James Wates, right, deputy chairman of the . construction firm Wates, has given £175,000 to the . Tories since 2001 . Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister had played no role in deciding who received honours. Government sources pointed out that . two major Labour donors, Capita boss Rod Aldridge and the founder of . online gambling firm bet365, Denise Coates, had also been honoured. But Labour accused the PM of using the . honours to reward Tory donors. Doug Ellis, former Chairman of Aston Villa Football Club, gave £90,000 to the Tories in the run-up to the last election . And Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of . the committee on standards in public life, said that although the four . Tory donors had been honoured for their contributions to society, their . inclusion threatened to ‘devalue’ the honours system. Mr Ellis, who made his fortune in the . package holiday business, gave £90,000 to the Tories in the run-up to . the last election. He was knighted for services to charity. Investment banker Mr Lupton has given . £105,000 to the Tories in recent years. A former trustee of the Dulwich . Picture Gallery in South London, he was awarded a CBE for services to . the arts. Mr Wates is deputy chairman of the . construction firm Wates. His companies have given some £175,000 to the . Tories since 2001. He received a CBE for services to construction and . charity. Mr Ruddock, co-founder of the . Lansdowne Partners hedge fund, has given £570,000 to the Tories. His . firm is said to have made £100million by betting on the collapse of . Northern Rock. Government sources pointed out that he was knighted for . his philanthropic work. He is one of . the City's wealthiest men, with a fortune estimated at £280million. Among his philanthropic work, he is chairman of the Victoria and Albert . Museum, for which he has helped raise more than £120million. Mr Graham . told the Sunday Times: 'It is most unfortunate if there is a public . perception that there is a clear link between honours and political . donations. Controversial: Gerald Ronson, . pictured left with wife Gail, is appointed CBE while Tory donor Paul . Ruddock, right, is to be knighted . No decision to make: A Government source said that the Prime Minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours . 'If it is going to become a routine right under this government I think there should be... a closer look at the system.' Andrew George, a senior Liberal Democrat MP, said the Coalition Government needed to 'keep the whole thing squeaky clean'. Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'David .

A traveller who entered the United States from Canada without a passport was let over the American border - after presenting officials with a scanned document on his iPad. Martin Reisch had driven from his home in Montreal before realising half an hour from the border he did not have his passport. Mr Reisch, 33, instead told an official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection he was heading to American to drop off Christmas gifts for his friend's children, before presenting a scanned passport and driver's licence on the Apple device. Allowed in: Martin Reisch used his iPad showing his passport before being let over the U.S. border . But rather than demand he drive two hours home to fetch the hard copies of his documents, border officials spent several minutes studying the photos on his iPad before allowing him over the border last week. Mr Reisch said: 'I thought I'd at least give it a try. He took the iPad into the little border hut. 'He kind of gave me a stare, like neither impressed nor amused. 'He was in there a good five, six minutes. It seemed like an eternity. When he came back he took a good long pause before wishing me a Merry Christmas. 'I think a good part of it had to do with the fact that it was the holidays and I seem like a nice-enough person.' U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it will accept documentation such as a passport, an enhanced driver's licence or a Nexus pass from Canadian citizens entering at land crossings. The list doesn't mention facsimiles, such as scans and photocopies. Mr Reisch said border officials studied his iPad for several minutes before allowing him into the country . A spokeswoman for the department did not immediately respond to questions Tuesday on whether scanned passports are also commonly accepted at U.S. points of entry. Professor Heather Nicol, a border-security expert from Trent University, said Mr. Reisch's experience is likely one of many unspoken exceptions carried out at U.S. border crossings. 'There is some wiggle room,” said Prof. Nicol, a political geographer at the Peterborough, Ont., university. 'What it suggests is that this whole standardization process is a little bit of a shell game because we're told it's not about individuals, it's about data sets.

She said: 'That is not the way anyone . should have to find out something so devastating and we completely . understand how upset the family are. 'Social networking is instantaneous . and we have no control over when and what people post on such sites, but . no one should hear such tragic news in this way.' His father Subhash Bidve had today . spoken of his complete devastation after hearing the crushing news his . son had been killed over the social networking site, not through . official channels. Police said a 16-year-old boy and two . 17-year-old boys arrested over the murder have been released on bail . pending further inquiries while two men, aged 19 and 20, remain in . custody on suspicion of murder. Mr Bidve told BBC Radio 5Live: . ‘Nobody official from the UK Government or consulate or the Indian . Government called us and told us about this. Victim: Anuj Bidve, who had a 'heart of gold' ‘I . am really surprised because they confiscated his phone and must have . known his father's or mother's number. They could have called us and . told us what had happened to him.’ Anuj had arrived in the UK in September to study micro-electronics at Lancaster University. Speaking about the last week’s events Mr Bidve, from Pune, Maharashtra, said the family were desperate to return his son’s body to India. He . said: ‘The last four days we have been feeling so much trauma because . we are yet to know as to when Anuj can come back. We are really worried. All family members are worried about it. ‘Everyone at home, they are all shattered and waiting for his remains to do all religious things.' Lancaster . University has already said it will pay for Anuj's body to be . repatriated while Greater Manchester Police said today they were offering a . £50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of . those responsible for the brutal murder. Det Chief Supt Mary Doyle, leading . the murder inquiry, said: 'It is an extremely unusual, savage and . motiveless attack, an absolutely horrific crime, which is why we are . taking the step of issuing it (the reward) a bit earlier than we . normally would. 'We absolutely understand the need to . take whoever is responsible for this off the streets. That's the reason . we are issuing it now at such an early stage.' The gunman is thought to have asked . Anuj the time before shooting him and one tribute page set up on . Facebook claimed: 'He was killed for not answering a simple question - . What's the time?' Anuj was earlier described by his family as a 'loving son, a super-caring brother and first and forever a friend for many.' Peace marches in response to his murder are due to take place in Salford, Lancaster and in India in the new year. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, . Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said detectives were not ruling out . that the shooting might have been racially motivated. He said: 'A racially-motivated crime is when there is actual evidence to show that it is the actual motivation for the crime.' He said a hate crime, 'by definition, is something that a community or anyone perceives is racially motivated'. Yesterday locals left tributes to Mr Bidve at the scene in Ordsall, an area known for high crime levels. A note addressed to Mr Bidve and . attached to a small bouquet of flowers, said: ‘Evil and mindless people . took your life away for nothing. ‘We are local residents who are so . saddened and sickened at this senseless act (that) we don’t think living . here will ever be the same. Devastation: Tributes have been left at the scene where the student was killed . ‘We send our condolences to your . family and friends and hope you don’t blame us all. Rest in peace Anuj. God bless you – unlike your murderer who will rot in hell.’ The killing has disgusted members of . the community in the tough inner city suburb, which has found itself the . subject of worldwide condemnation on news and social networking sites . since the killing. Norman Owen, leader of Salford’s Liberal Democrats, agreed Mr Bidve’s murder had shamed the city. ‘This is a disgrace,’ he said. ‘What . kind of city are we living in when we have a young man walking on the . street with a gun and is ready to use it. We are being dragged down by . this issue and the police have got to get into gun crime.’ The Lancashire University electronics student had been approached by the killer and another man as he walked with friends to Christmas sales at 1.35am on Boxing Day. Murder probe: Police cordon off the scene following the random shooting in the early hours of the morning . After Indian-born Mr Bidve, from a wealthy Delhi family, . fell to the pavement, his two attackers fled into the night. Mr Bidve – who had not been drinking – had been walking with nine . friends through a rough inner-city district in Salford, Manchester, . after leaving their nearby hotel to queue for early morning bargains. The group were making their way into the city centre on foot using a GPS . system on Mr Bidve’s phone when they strayed into Ordsall, an area known . for high crime levels. His friends desperately tried to give him first aid as armed police arrived at the scene and launched a widespread manhunt. A police . source said the youths arrested were ‘connected to the shooting’ but were not . believed to be the gunman and his accomplice. Witness Sheetal Patel, 25, said she held Mr Bidve’s hand as he lay dying in the street. The cake maker had been driving past when the student’s friends waved down her car. Probe: Forensic officers search for clues into the shooting which happened at around 1.35am this morning. It was unclear what the motive was for the killing . ‘When we arrived at the scene, the guy was lying on the floor,’ she . said. ‘I was holding his hand, but he was alive. 'He . was making noises. All I was saying is, “You’re very strong, you’re going to be all right”. We just kept on trying to keep him breathing and to make him know that . we were there. 'There was one guy holding Anuj’s head trying to put . pressure on the wound. And there was another guy who was on the phone to . the police.’ Miss Patel said that ‘he was shot in the head, but the bullet didn’t go . through his head’ and there did not appear to be an exit wound. ‘We all . thought he was going to live,’ she added. A statement from Mr Bidve’s family said: ‘Anuj was a loving . son, a super caring brother and first and forever friend for many. ‘He valued his relationships and put them over anything else. He was the . first person you could call when in trouble. Anuj loved to travel and . loved his food. He loved to cook. ‘He could easily bring a smile on anyone’s face with his innocent jokes. He loved playing football. He enjoyed his life and is an inspiration . for us to live life to its fullest. ‘His passing will not only leave a void in our lives, but in the hearts of all those who knew him.’ McDonalds murder investigation: The man was stood outside the fast food restaurant with another man when two people walked over to them. Shortly afterwards the victim, aged in his 20s, was shot . Mr Bidve was the postgraduate representative on the Lancaster University Indian Society Committee. Society president Sonakshi Saran said: ‘He was killed for not answering a . simple question. Did he deserve this? Did his family deserve such pain . and such loss?’ She said students and friends planned a candle-lit peace march on January 2 at the spot where he was killed. Mr Bidve had been visiting Manchester in a group of nine male and female friends. Greater Manchester Police said the shooting was a truly ‘awful’ attack . and pledged to ‘leave no stone unturned’ in the hunt for the killer. Armed officers were on the streets of Ordsall yesterday conducting searches. Officers holding what were believed to be semi-automatic machine guns . were seen ordering three men to stand against a wooden fence with their . arms outstretched. Evidence hunt: The victim was taken to hospital but was later pronounced dead . Mr Bidve, pictured with an unknown companion, was murdered over the Christmas holiday . Mr Bidve's death was one of several killings that happened over the Christmas holiday.","Father of Anuj Bidve pleads for body to be released so his son can be returned home .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 1:23 AM on 4th January 2012 . Judge Beatrice Bolton has avoided disciplinary action after being convicted of failing to control her dangerous dog . A judge who launched a foul-mouthed tirade on the British justice system after being found guilty of owning a dangerous dog has escaped disciplinary action. Beatrice Bolton, 57, vowed never to sit in a court of law again after she was found guilty of failing to control her dog, branding the verdict a ‘f***ing travesty’. The Crown Court judge from Northumberland had been facing disciplinary action after a number of complaints about her behaviour. But yesterday the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) dropped its probe after she retired ‘on medical grounds’. An OJC spokesman said: ‘After receiving a number of complaints about comments reportedly made by Ms Beatrice Bolton, a Circuit Judge, following her conviction under the Dangerous Dogs Act, the Office for Judicial Complaints investigated the matter in accordance with the Judicial Discipline Regulations 2006. ‘The judge has, however, retired on medical grounds before the disciplinary process was formally concluded. ‘As a result, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice have decided no further disciplinary action is required. Ms Bolton’s retirement took effect from 1 January 2012.’ The circuit judge was convicted at Carlisle Magistrates’ Court of allowing her pet German Shepherd to bite her 20-year-old neighbour, Frederick Becker in December 2010. Following the hearing, she yelled: ‘I’ll never set foot in this court again’. Bolton, who sat at Newcastle Crown Court, was later taken back into court and asked to apologise for her outburst. Furious: Bolton, who presided at Newcastle Crown Court (above), has vowed never to set foot in a court of law again . After telling District Judge Gerald Chalk ‘I’m sorry’, she was fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £275 compensation to the victim, plus £930 court costs and a £15 surcharge. Bolton, who was asked by the court usher during the two-day trial to stop chewing gum, had denied a single charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act. During the trial, the former judge was labelled ‘the neighbour from hell’ by Mr Becker’s parents, David and Anne Malia. The Malias clashed repeatedly with the judge, demanding she keep the German Shepherd, named Georgina, tethered up, the court was told. Their son was lying on the lawn at his parents’ home when the then seven-month-old bitch went for him on May 31 2010. He was left bleeding and bruised after the dog charged towards him and bit his leg.","Beatrice Bolton branded verdict a 'f***ing travesty'

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:54 AM on 4th January 2012 . The Republican Presidential contenders are tonight nervously awaiting the results of the Iowa caucus - as early entrance polls predict Ron Paul will win closely followed by Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in third. Many likely caucus-goers are still undecided ahead of Tuesday night’s voting but poll leader Mr Romney declared he wants ‘the kind of send-off we need for a pretty long campaign season’. Only 25 delegates are at stake in Iowa out of 1,144 needed to win the Republican nomination, but the Iowa voting is seen as a key indication as to how the rest of the race will pan out this year. Scroll down for videos . Contenders: Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, pictured today left-to-right, are leading the high-stakes battle for the Iowa Republicans' favourite presidential candidate as they kick off the race on Tuesday night . ‘This has been a failed presidency,’ former Massachusetts governor Mr Romney said in Des Moines, Iowa, in a blistering attack on Barack Obama. ‘I will go to work to get Americans back to work.’ The volatile race has elevated and discarded a wide assortment of front-runners, with some falling out of the race or not even deciding to run - such as businessmen Herman Cain and Donald Trump. The two who seem most likely to challenge Mr Romney for victory in Iowa were former Pennsylvania senator Mr Santorum and libertarian Texas Representative Ron Paul. Texas Governor Rick Perry and Mr Gingrich seem likelier to give Mr Romney a long-haul challenge, but Mr Santorum insisted his rise is because Iowans are ‘looking for the candidate they can trust’. Republicans will gather in living rooms, high school gymnasiums and local libraries for caucuses that start the process of picking the GOP nominee on Tuesday night. Struggling: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann and Texas Governor Rick Perry, all pictured today left to right, are all trailing and not expected to do well in Iowa . Voters will urge friends and neighbours to support a preferred candidate. But for all of the attention paid to the caucuses, they are essentially a nonbinding straw poll that awards no delegates. 'This has been a failed presidency. I will go to work to get Americans back to work' Mitt Romney . Republicans do that at county and district conventions later in the year. President Obama isn't ceding the stage to the Republicans while they kick off sorting out the 1,144 delegates. The President, fresh off a 10-day Hawaiian vacation with his family rumoured to have cost $4million, made plans to host an evening web chat with supporters in Iowa as the caucuses were under way. Most polls in recent days have put Mr Romney and Mr Paul atop the GOP field in Iowa, with Mr Santorum in third and gaining ground. More than a third of voters could yet change their minds. But Mr Perry, Mr Gingrich and Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann are trailing and not looking likely to do well in Iowa. Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman is all but out of the state race. Wives: Rick Santorum, left, walks with his wife Karen after speaking at Valley High School in West Des Moines, Iowa, and Mitt Romney, right, and wife Ann listen as he is introduced at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa . This way: Ron Paul makes his way through the crowd as he arrives at a campaign stop in West Des Moines . Mr Romney - whose rivals are trying to exploit questions about his moderate past - faces the same challenge he did in 2008 of winning over a conservative base uncomfortable with much of this. 'I want to make sure I vote for and caucus for someone who is a winner. We cannot have another four years of Obama' Paul Massey . Four years ago socially conservative voters united behind former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, denying Mr Romney a first-place finish and contributing to his eventual defeat. Mr Perry told Fox News that Mr Romney is simply a ‘conservative of convenience.’ Mrs Bachmann, another of the onetime front-runners who has fallen, said she is the ‘one true conservative’. Mr Gingrich, who still insists anyone could win, said Mr Romney should ‘level with the American people’ about his moderate political views and admitted on CBS that he is calling his rival a ‘liar’. Early on, Mr Gingrich had insisted he would run a positive campaign, but that strategy disappeared after he sank in the polls under the weight of negative ads paid for by his opponents. My girls: Michele Bachmann, centre, arrives with her daughters Elisa Bachmann, left, and Caroline Bachmann, right, to campaign at the 'Rock the Caucus' Rally at Valley High School in West Des Moines . Support: Rick Perry, left, leans in to kiss his wife, Anita, at the West Des Moines Sheraton in Iowa, while Newt Gingrich, right, stands with his wife Callista as he buys two scoops of 'Moose Tracks' ice cream in Muscatine . Mr Santorum, blaming the Paul campaign for recorded phone calls questioning his policies on guns and abortion, told Fox News that his rival is ‘disgusting’. 'It might come down to the speeches at the caucuses. I want to support someone who can go all the way and defeat the Democrats in November' Phil Ubben . The former senator’s conservative views on issue like gay marriage and abortion make him popular with evangelical Christian voters - a strong force in Iowa Republican politics. Mr Romney said he can handle any criticism his Republican rivals heap on him, calling it only a warm-up to whatever will come from Obama's camp. ‘My shoulders are wide,’ he told Fox News. He is trying to win Iowa by arguing he is the most electable candidate against President Obama - a pitch that is winning over conservatives who desperately want to beat the Democrat. ‘I want to make sure I vote for and caucus for someone who is a winner. We cannot have another four years of Obama,’ said eyeglass salesman Paul Massey, 65. T-shirt backing: Supporters of Ron Paul attend a campaign stop in Cedar Falls, Iowa, on Monday . Rivals: Supporters of Ron Paul, left, and Rick Perry, right, prepare for the start of the GOP voting. Rick Nova, of Chicago, Illinois, is seen left . Helping: Volunteers make phone calls on behalf of Republican presidential candidate Mr Romney in Des Moines . The voter turnout will help drive results. In 2008, a record of more than 120,000 Republicans showed up. Weather could be a factor in this year's attendance, with clear conditions forecast. GOP voters in Iowa gather for the caucuses at more than 800 sites across the state beginning at 7pm local time (8pm ET). Results should begin to come in within a few hours after then. After Tuesday's vote, Mr Romney, Mr Gingrich and Mr Santorum planned to depart immediately for New Hampshire, where the primary is on January 10. Mr Paul will join them there later this week. Mr Romney holds a commanding lead in polls there, and will be in a strong position to win even if he doesn't win in Iowa. Mr Perry and Mrs Bachmann don't plan to compete in New Hampshire. They are instead heading straight from Iowa to the first South primary, set for January 21 in South Carolina. Mr Romney also plans to visit that state this week. Florida is on January 31. ‘It might come down to the speeches at the caucuses,’ said voter Phil Ubben, of Sioux City, Iowa. ‘I want to support someone who can go all the way and defeat the Democrats in November.’ See videos here .","Iowans kick off voting in presidential race from 7pm CT / 8pm ET / 1am GMT .

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 9:35 PM on 26th December 2011 . Japan's response to the nuclear crisis that followed a violent tsunami was utterly confused, a report claimed today. Bumbling government employees and relief workers made a catalogue of errors during the disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, the 500-page document concluded. It said authorities had grossly underestimated tsunami risks, assuming the highest wave would be six metres (20 feet), when they in fact hit more than double those levels. Disastrous mistakes: Government employees have been fiercely criticised by a report for being unprepared and disorganised ahead of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant explosion . Workers at Tokyo . Electric Power Company, which ran Fukushima Dai-ichi, were . untrained to handle emergencies such as the power shutdown that struck when . the tsunami destroyed backup generators, it said. All these mistakes contributed to the world's worst . nuclear disaster since Chernobyl on March 11, said the damning report. The report, which is set to be completed . by 2012, attacked the Tokyo . Electric Power Co. for the mistaken assumption an emergency cooling system . was working and a delay in disclosing dangerous radiation leaks. It criticised the authorities for further delays in publicising the dangers and describing the situation using the word 'soteigai', meaning 'outside . our imagination', which it said implied they were shirking . responsibility for what had happened. National tragedy: The report painted a disturbing picture of the errors made by workers at Tokyo Electric Power Co. and by government officials . Life-threatening issues: Authorities underestimated the tsunami risks and wrongly assumed a cooling system was working . 'This accident has taught us an important lesson on how we must be ready for soteigai,' it added. It said that by labelling the events as . beyond what could have been expected, officials had invited public . distrust. There was no clear manual to follow, and the workers failed to communicate, not only with the government but also among themselves, it said. Finding alternative ways to bring sorely needed water to the reactors was delayed for hours because of the mishandling of an emergency cooling system, the report said. Workers assumed the system was working, despite several warning signs it had failed and was sending the nuclear core into meltdown. The report acknowledged that even if the system had kicked in properly, the tsunami damage might have been so great meltdowns would have happened anyway. But a better response might have reduced the core damage, radiation leaks and the hydrogen explosions that followed at two reactors and sent plumes of radiation into the air, according to the report. More worrying still was how the government delayed in sharing vital information with the public and used evasive language to avoid admitting serious meltdowns at the reactors, the report said. Dangerous delays: Officials were too slow in revealing the extent of the radiation leaks during the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, said the report . The government did not release radiation data fast enough in the area, the report found, unnecessarily exposing towns to radiation when they could have evacuated. The government has norecommended changes so utilities will respond properly to serious accidents. It recommended separating the nuclear regulators from the unit that promotes atomic energy, echoing frequent criticism since the disaster. Japan's nuclear regulators were in the same ministry that promotes the industry, but they are being moved to the environment ministry next year to ensure more independence. The report did not advocate a move away from nuclear power but recommended adding more knowledgeable experts, including those who would have been able to assess tsunami risks, and laying out an adequate response plan to what it called 'a severe accident'. The report acknowledged people were still living in fear of radiation spewed into the air and water, as well as radiation in the food they eat. Thousands have been forced to evacuate and have suffered monetary damage from radiation contamination, it said, and the earthquake and tsunami left 20,000 people dead or missing. 'The nuclear disaster is far from over,' the report said.","Catalogue of errors includes 'underestimating tsunami risks' and 'delays in revealing extent of radiation'

A man who planned to celebrate the New Year by sacrificing a goat with a machete has been arrested. Hunter Goldberg, 23, was caught after being reported to police by a goat-owner who became suspicious after he phoned her to ask if he could buy her animal. He later admitted that he had been planning to steal the goat and kill it, and said that he had already sacrificed an animal a few weeks earlier. Goldberg's father explained his son's behaviour by comparing him to William the Conqueror, the mediaeval king from whom the family claims to be descended. Oregon State Police were first alerted to Goldberg's macabre plan when a woman told an off-duty officer about a strange phone call she had received asking if she had any goats for sale. Although the woman does own a goat, she does not sell them.Goldberg, from Roseburg, Oregon, was later found on New Year's Eve, waiting in a car near the woman's home. He confessed that he had hoped to steal a goat from her and sacrifice it before the New Year, but claimed that he was in the process of writing the woman an apology note. The suspect also admitted that he had killed another goat some weeks earlier and dumped its remains in a creek. Police later found the remains of the dead animal, and upon searching Goldberg's car they discovered two machetes. A goat: Goldberg admitted he had already killed one animal, whose carcass was found by police after the suspect's arrest (file photo) His father, Josiah Goldberg, told Seattle Weekly that his son could yet grow up to be a high achiever - just like the 11th-century King of England William the Conqueror, whom Mr Goldberg says is an ancestor of his. 'Before William the Conqueror was William the Conqueror, he was called William the Bastard. It was later in life that he became great,' he said. 'Hunter is a nice boy. He's going through a difficult period in his life. Hopefully 20 years from now he'll be doing something worthwhile.' He added: 'One has to have a historical perspective. It's unfortunate that this is happening with my son. But a goat is just meat.' Goldberg was arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail for investigation of aggravated animal abuse, trespassing and conspiracy, according to the police.",Suspect's father compares his behaviour to 'ancestor' William the Conqueror .
"Most likely to return home to the U.S. from bases in Germany . By . David Gardner . Last updated at 9:02 PM on 4th January 2012 . The United States is planning to drastically reduce the number of soldiers that it keeps based in Europe. The move, to be announced tomorrow by Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, is part of a massive cost-cutting review. The number of brigade combat teams, each consisting of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops, will be slashed from three to two. The soldiers going home are likely to be from one of the two infantry brigades in Germany. 'Deeply involved': Barack Obama has instructed Defence Secretary Leon Panetta to cut military costs by reducing the number of troops in Europe . The decision continues a U.S. drawdown from the continent that has seen a force of 300,000 during the Cold War fall to fewer than 80,000 today. Mr Panetta is also expected to say the U.S. is abandoning its strategy of maintaining a force that can fight and win two wars at the same time. Instead, America will aim to triumph in one war while being able to meet and ‘spoil’ any aggressive actions by a second adversary. The eight-month review was ordered by . President Obama, who wants the Pentagon to slice up to $470 billion from . the Pentagon budget over the next 12 years. Mr Obama was said to have been ‘deeply involved’ in the review process. The pullout of U.S. troops from Europe was first suggested by George Bush’s defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, but it was put on hold because of the demands placed on the military by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The spending reductions, while not yet set in stone, are expected to trim the number of military and civilian defense personnel, delay or cut back on some high-profile weapons systems like the radar-evading F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and take steps to control spiraling health-care costs. A senior defense official said Mr . Panetta would unveil some details affecting major weapons programs but . added that he did not expect the kind of ‘bloodbath’ another former . Defence Secretary Robert Gates announced in April 2009, when he killed . or cut back on many weapons systems. Major . defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman . have been anxiously awaiting news about any major programme cuts in the . new budget. Slowdowns are . expected in several new weapons programs, including two-year delays in . work on a replacement for the Ohio-class submarine and on a second new . Ford-class aircraft carrier. In . an effort to get control of the government's huge deficits, Obama and . Congress agreed last year on a budget deal that could cut projected . defense spending by more than $937 billion over the next decade. Heading home: The U.S. military presence in Europe is shrinking and it is thought that soldiers may be brought back from bases like Ramstein in Germany .",Most likely to return home to the U.S. from bases in Germany .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 1:12 PM on 30th December 2011 . An aggressive species of crayfish which has been invading England's waterways is being tracked with radio transmitters in a bid to understand why they move so quickly - and help control their advance. The American predators have colonised the River Lee near Enfield, moving at more than 500m per month. The crayfish have now taken over 17km of the river. The Environment Agency said virile crayfish, which are non-native, prey on native wildlife and spread crayfish plague, a disease deadly to native white-clawed crayfish. It is believed that virile crayfish arrived in the UK after an aquarium owner released them into an east London pond. The predatory North American crayfish are believed to have escaped an aquarium in East London before colonising a river. Now they are being fitted with radio transmitters . The Environment Agency has fitted small radio transmitters on the backs of the unwelcome guests, with preliminary results showing that virile crayfish are moving upstream at a rate of 500 metres (1,640ft) per month. This is substantially faster than their cousin, the signal crayfish, which is also non-native. The UK's only native crayfish, the white clawed crayfish, was wiped out along the River Lee following the invasion of the signal crayfish in the 1980s and the associated spread of crayfish plague. Adam Ellis, environmental monitoring officer at the Environment Agency, said: 'Whilst rivers in England and Wales are cleaner than they have been for decades, there is still a lot to be done in order to return them to full health. This includes the control of invasive species like virile crayfish.' I fought the claw and the claw won: Undated Environment Agency handout photo of Inger Jennings, Environmental Monitoring Officer with a virile (right) and signal crayfish (left) 'By tracking the colonisation of the River Lee by virile crayfish, we will better understand how this species impacts the environment and our native wildlife.' 'However, one of the most important ways to protect our wildlife is to stop the spread of non-native invasive species. We're appealing to the public not to release unwanted pets into the wild.' Anyone who catches a crayfish must follow strict guidelines on how to handle them in order to prevent their spread and the transmission of crayfish plague. The rise of invasive species is a major challenge in meeting tough new EU targets on the ecology of rivers and lakes. They cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year, according to the Environment Agency.","Predatory American crayfish take over river in Enfield .

The archaeology of the huge crater is almost like a 'strip mine' on earth - cutting deep into the layers of minerals on the moon. The planners of the Apollo missions had the Aristarchus crater high on their list of targets for human exploration on the moon. This Hubble colour composite focuses on the Aristarchus impact crater, and uses colour information across the ultraviolet and infrared to accentuate differences between minerals . The images were acquired last year when the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over just 16.2 miles above the surface; about two times lower than normal, and just above double the height that commercial jets fly on Earth. Aristarchus crater is located on the southeast edge of the Aristarchus Plateau. This gaping crater is 25 miles wide and more than two miles wide. Pyroclastic beads (volcanic glasses formed during fire-fountain style eruptions similar to those of Stromboli or the Hawaiian Islands) that blanket the area around the crater have slid down parts of the walls in dark streaks and clumps . The ledges forming the wall of the crater, which look a lot like those of a strip mine, are actually blocks of pre-impact crustal and surficial rocks that slumped into the crater during the late stages of its formation. The ledges forming the crater wall, which have a scalloped appearance, are sagging blocks of the pre-impact lunar crust. Bright and dark materials are exposed in patches along the walls. The floor of Aristarchus crater provides explorers a unique opportunity to study a wide variety of lunar rocks and geologic processes, possibly including how lunar granite forms. It's still not fully understood how granite formed on the moon - and Aristarchus crater is one of the best places to study it.","Orbiter flies past just 16.2 miles up .

Forces employ policemen and women . with criminal records for assault, burglary, supplying drugs and . perverting the course of justice. Among them are several senior . officers, including two detective chief inspectors and a chief inspector . working for the Metropolitan Police. Pounding the beat: More than 900 serving police officers and community support officers have a criminal record . A police officer found guilty of gross misconduct after sending racist and sexist texts is still in his job, Northamptonshire Police has confirmed. The behaviour of the constable was revealed in a Freedom of Information request submitted to the force by a member of the public, which said the officer had been disciplined earlier this year over text messages sent to another officer while off duty. Although the force insisted it did not tolerate sexism or racism, follow-up questions by the Chron have revealed the officer is still working in the county. A Northamptonshire police spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that this year an officer was found guilty of racially and sexually-related misconduct, which involved the sending of inappropriate texts. 'It was found that these breached the high standards Northamptonshire Police demands of its officers. Sexist and racist behaviour will not be tolerated on or off duty. 'The officer in question accepted that the texts were wrong. The panel determined that the matter had not affected the officer's service to the community and as such the individual concerned has been allowed to continue to serve for the force.' For such misconduct, an officer could potentially lose their job, but it is only one of a number of sanctions that can be brought, depending on the severity of the case. In each case, previous good conduct and character is taken into consideration. Anjona Roy, chief executive of Northamptonshire Rights and Equality Council, said knowing a still-serving officer had sent racist and sexist texts could damage public confidence in the force. She said: 'Policing is dependent on people's confidence in officers. They are in a position of power and people have to feel that it won't be used for unfair purposes. 'I'd like to see all police standards reports made available where the officer has been found guilty so the public can judge for themselves if they think the punishment is proportionate or not.' In some cases continuing to employ . officers appears to directly contradict Government guidelines which . insist on ‘proven integrity’. They highlight that people with . convictions for certain offences, including assault, dangerous driving . and burglary, should not be recruited. At least 944 serving officers and police community support officers . (PCSOs) have a conviction. Most are for traffic offences such as . speeding and drink-driving, but there are also offences of dishonesty . and fraud. Among the 944 are a Devon and Cornwall PC convicted of burglary as a . teenager and officers in Essex convicted of dangerous driving, supplying . cannabis and robbery. A volunteer special constable continues to serve despite being convicted . of swiping a set of car number plates and using them to steal petrol . from service stations. In Hertfordshire a sergeant was convicted of dangerous driving and a . Kent PC has a 1998 conviction for perverting the course of justice. Five Merseyside officers have been convicted of assault and another has a . criminal record for causing death by careless driving. A North Wales . officer was convicted of forgery and a Staffordshire Police inspector . has a record for keeping a dangerous dog. A Surrey Police detective constable was convicted of obstructing police . while others have records for wounding, drink driving and animal . cruelty. The total figure was revealed by 32 of the 43 forces in England and . Wales in response to requests under freedom of information laws. Many could not provide details of criminal records dating from before . their staff joined, meaning the true figure is likely to be higher. The Metropolitan Police, Britain’s . largest force, employed the most staff with convictions, 356 officers . and 41 PCSOs. It was followed by Kent (49), Devon and Cornwall (44), . Essex (42), South Yorkshire (35), Hampshire (31) and West Midlands (27). There are around 140,000 police officers, 15,000 PCSOs and 70,000 civilian staff  in the 43 forces. The figures emerged as a senior . police officer insisted officers who resign before facing misconduct . procedures are not being ‘let off the hook’. Commander Peter Spindler, of the Met, . admitted more than 130 employees left Scotland Yard over the past year . instead of facing disciplinary measures. But he said in many cases it is more . ‘pragmatic’ to let them resign, and said complaints against police are . falling. Simon Reed, vice president of the Police Federation, said . misconduct panels decide whether an officer should be dismissed after . considering each case. Leading the way: The Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest force, came top with 356 officers and 41 PCSOs with convictions . He said: ‘Most police officers are . dismissed if they commit a crime. It may be easy to condemn some cases . but there will be specific reasons these people have been kept on.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the number of officers with criminal convictions is a small proportion of the workforce. He added: ‘Any instance where the conduct of our staff is alleged to have fallen below the standards of behaviour expected is treated extremely seriously by the Met.’A Home Office spokesman said forces should reject potential recruits with convictions for serious offences unless there are ‘exceptionally compelling circumstances’. Commander Peter Spindler . Hundreds of police officers facing misconduct allegations are being allowed to escape punishment by quitting their forces. More than 130 employees were . permitted by chief officers to walk out of Scotland Yard over the past . year instead of facing a misconduct panel. The force sacked 43 officers over that same period, figures show. With . police conduct under 'unprecedented' scrutiny, Commander Peter . Spindler, the Metropolitan Police's discipline chief, insisted he was . not letting corrupt officers off the hook. But Mr Spindler, head of the force's . directorate of professional standards, said in many cases 'it's actually . more pragmatic to let them resign'. Officers . have been angered by a recent report by the Independent Police . Complaints Commission (IPCC) claiming forces were failing to respond to . 'far too many' complaints about officers. Detective . Chief Superintendent Richard Heselden said he had been told 'we should . be making an example of them' instead of letting them resign. But . he said: 'The process is slow, they are sitting there on taxpayers' expense, secondly there's no guarantee that a panel will come to that . conclusion. 'It's cheaper and quicker to get them out of the force. The objective is to get someone out (of) the organisation.' Officers . working at the internal discipline unit said they would welcome clarity . offered by recommendations in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, the . public investigation launched in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Mr Heselden said there were 'grey areas' surrounding relations between police and journalists. He said: 'For me, if I leak to a criminal, I'm a criminal. No-one doubts it. 'If I make an inappropriate leak to my family and tell them about sensitive police matters, that's a crime. 'But . if I do it to a journalist ... is that a crime? Or is it public . interest? At what point does public interest disclosure meet . corruption?' Discipline officers have beefed up . the internal investigation unit in recent months, moving into a . centralised base in Earls Court. Officers say they now have 'every power available' to beat corruption, including setting up stings on its own employees. In one recent case, the team set up a fake raid in a bid to snare an officer suspected of stealing from crime scenes. 'You wouldn't believe the work we go to,' Mr Heselden said. 'It . had been set up to look like an east European drug dealer, including . even the food in the fridge. People who are corrupt are incredibly . suspicious. 'They know we exist and what lengths we go to - it means we have to go to the utmost lengths to outmanoeuvre them.'","Two detective chief inspectors among 944 officers in England and Wales with a criminal record .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 3:49 PM on 4th January 2012 . A woman who won compensation from Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare has waived her right to anonymity after being awarded an MBE. Shirley Woodman, who was previously known only as Mrs A, has told of her battle to receive a landmark settlement from Hoare in 2009. She spoke to BBC Look North after being made an MBE in the 2012 Queen’s New Year Honours for services to the community in Yorkshire. Landmark case: Shirley Woodman, who was previously known only as Mrs A, has spoken about her battle to receive compensation from Iorworth Hoare, right . Retired teacher Mrs Woodman, 82, was attacked by Hoare in Roundhay Park, in Leeds, in 1988. He was jailed for life the following year for Mrs Woodman’s attempted rape but scooped £7.2 million in 2004 when he bought a Lotto Extra ticket while on day release from prison. Mrs Woodman sued Hoare for damages when she heard of his win but he contested the claim, arguing that victims of sex attacks must make their claims within six years. But in 2008, Mrs Woodman won a groundbreaking ruling from the Law Lords that, in cases of serious assault, courts would have the discretion to extend that time limit. Threat: This graffiti was left on the gates of Hoare's £700,000 home in the exclusive Darras Hall estate in Newcastle, forcing him to flee . She was later awarded compensation in an out-of-court settlement with Hoare, who had previous convictions for rape, two other attempted rapes and three indecent assaults when he attacked Mrs Woodman. Mrs Woodman . said she was 'horrified and terrified' when she heard of Hoare's Lotto . win and said she feared he would come to find her to get revenge for . putting him in prison. Inspiration: Shelley Wolfson hailed her mother as 'a woman of dignity, a woman of strength' She said she felt the win was 'unjust' and wanted him to pay damages for the psychological injuries she suffered as a result of the attack. 'It was a fantastic struggle. It was a long and traumatic one and it was very hard at times,' she told the BBC. Mrs Woodman said she had given all of her compensation money to charity and now felt 'composed'. 'I don’t mind now being identified as the Mrs A who took my assailant to court and changed the law,' she said. Mrs Woodman said she was 'very proud' to receive an MBE after being nominated by her daughter, Shelley Wolfson. Ms Wolfson said her mother was 'a woman of dignity, a woman of strength'. 'She fought the law of the land and she won,' said Ms Wolfson. Hoare, who was released from prison in 2005, was forced to flee his mansion in September last year after the words 'Leave or Die' were spray-painted on the gates of his home. His six-bedroom detached house on the exclusive Darras Hall estate in Newcastle was put up for sale at the bargain price of £595,000 in December.","Shirley Woodman, 82, was awarded MBE for her work to change the law on sex attack compensation .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 2:25 PM on 30th December 2011 . The 'Great Firewall of China': The Chinese government has announced it is to work with search engines to protect Chinese citizens. China is the origin of many cyber attacks including several high-profile hacks of foreign government officials . The Chinese government is stepping up internet security for its own citizens this week after a series of leaks of personal data from social networking sites and 'phishing' attacks on bank accounts. The government announced it would work with 10 Chinese search engines  - which already censor the internet under Chinese law - to ensure 'fake' banks appear lower in search rankings. The move comes in the wake of several high-profile cyber attacks originating in China which targeted U.S and other government officials. China is widely suspected of being . the origin of many hacking attacks on government and commercial websites . abroad, but officials have repeatedly dismissed reports that the . government or military could be behind such attacks. Earlier this year, hackers based in Jinan, China targeted personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts of government officials. The methods used suggested insider knowledge about the offiicals according to many observers. The Chinese government denied any involvement. 'Blaming these misdeeds on China is unacceptable,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei after the attacks. 'Hacking is an international problem and China is also a victim. The claims of so-called support for hacking are completely unfounded.' China bans numerous overseas . websites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and some foreign media . outlets, fearing the uncensored sharing of images and information could . cause social instability and harm national . security. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said on Friday it would work with 10 Chinese search engines to protect the website rankings of financial institutions to lessen the chances that Internet users will be duped by phishing websites. A phishing attack occurs when the user is persuaded to part with his or her username and password via a fake webpage that closely resembles the original. Through the collaboration, the official websites of several Chinese banks, such as Agricultural Bank of China and China Construction Bank will be ranked first in the search engine when a user searches for the related keywords, the Ministry said in an online circular on Friday. The move comes after a spate of personal data leaks that alarmed the online community and prompted calls for tougher scrutiny of who has access to online information. China claims the most Internet users in the world at 485 million, state media reported last month, and despite widespread censorship and monitoring online, many users have been up in arms about the reported data leaks and their implications. The user IDs, passwords and e-mail addresses of more than 6 million accounts registered on CSDN - a site for programmers - were leaked, Xinhua New Agency reported last week, citing an anti-virus software provider which discovered the problem. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would investigate the hacking incidents, 'The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of Internet users and threatens Internet safety. The department strongly condemns such behaviour.'","Will work with 10 search engines to tighten security for China's 485 million web users .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 11:06 PM on 4th January 2012 . A police constable used his force's database to target vulnerable women for sex while on duty, a court was told today. Pc Jasbir Singh Dhanda, 52, is accused of misusing the database while he was a serving officer with Derbyshire Police over a seven-year period. The officer allegedly had sex with two women while he was working after tracking them down on the police systems. Sex on duty: Pc Jasbir Singh Dhanda, 52, allegedly targeted vulnerable women he found on the police database, Nottingham Crown Court heard . One of his victims claimed he would ignore calls that came through on his police radio as he attempted to have sex with her. Neil Moore, prosecuting, told Nottingham Crown Court today that the constable targeted three women in total because they were 'vulnerable' and he did not believe they would report him. Even if they did, Dhanda, from Derby, thought their complaints would not be taken seriously due to their circumstances, Mr Moore added. He is accused of 12 counts of misconduct in a public office and obtaining personal data through misuse of a police database. The court heard Dhanda accessed the records of one of the complainants 100 times over a two-year period. He met one of the women after she complained to the police about an incident involving her former partner. Dhanda went round to her house the day after the incident 'to update her'. He then allegedly performed a sex act on himself and touched her sexually before asking for her phone number. Dhanda then visited her house for sex two or three times a week, day or night, the court heard. Two years later, he turned up out of the blue to another address where she lived in the city, Mr Moore said. He told her: 'At last, I've found you.' Accused: The police officer, who is suspended from duty with Derbyshire Police, allegedly accessed the force database for his own purposes over a seven-year period . Mr Moore told the court Dhanda . accessed 40 reports on 100 occasions between March 2008 and April 2010 . on the Guardian police database system relating to this complainant. Another complainant said she felt compelled to do as Dhanda asked because he was a police officer. Dhanda is alleged to have told the . woman, who was a prostitute, there was a warrant for her arrest but that . he would not execute it if she got him some cocaine. 'Score for me and be a good girl and you'll be all right', he told her. They then smoked a crack pipe together before he asked her for sex. The woman told police she obtained drugs on 12 occasions for Dhanda. They had sex four or five of those times. 'It wasn't nice. It was intimidating. But he didn't hurt me.' She added: 'He took advantage of me because I was vulnerable.' A third complainant, with whom Dhanda . had a relationship, said that he attempted to have sex with her while he . was on duty and would ignore calls that came through to his radio, . telling her he was on a break. Mr Moore said Dhanda used the database . to 'better enable him to carry out relationships with women who were . vulnerable, capable of being taken advantage of or exploited'. There was no policing reason he would have to access such records, he added. Dhanda, who appeared in court from . bail wearing a black suit and blue tie, is also alleged to have looked . up his ex-wife and former partner along with a third woman on the police . database. The police constable, who is suspended . from Derbyshire Police pending the outcome of criminal proceedings, . faces seven counts of misconduct in a public office and five counts of . obtaining personal data. He denies all the charges. Judge Michael Stokes QC adjourned the case until tomorrow, when the court will hear from the first of 14 witnesses.","Officer 'would ignore calls on his police radio while on duty as he attempted to have sex with victim'

"This forces firm to cancel or postpone . flights, destroying passenger confidence it its timetable . By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 2:11 PM on 3rd January 2012 . Zimbabwe's cash-strapped national airline has suspended all of its flights to Britain after one of its planes was impounded at Gatwick over unpaid bills. Air Zimbabwe bosses today announced that the state-owned company will no longer serve London or Johannesburg, South Africa, amid a crippling financial crisis that has engulfed the company. The move comes after one of the struggling airline's 767s was last month seized at Gatwick airport over an outstanding £780,000 ($1.2million) debt with a U.S. parts supplier. Grounded: An Air Zimbabwe plane sits at Gatwick Airport last month due to unpaid debts. The cash-strapped national airline today suspended all of its flights to London and Johannesburg . The impounded aircraft was held at the London airport for more than two weeks before it was finally released after the debt was paid on Christmas Day. The seizure followed the impounding of a second Air Zimbabwe plane earlier in December in Johannesburg over a separate unpaid bill. Airline bosses have since confirmed the company has temporarily ceased flights to both destinations amid fears its aircraft could be targeted again by its creditors. Local media reported that Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe personally ordered the move after he was apparently forced to charter a jet for his Christmas holiday when his usual plane became stranded in Britain. The Radio VoP news website reported: 'The Minister of Transport and Communications, Nicholas Goche, has issued a circular to stop Air Zimbabwe management from flying its aircraft to South Africa and the United Kingdom where one of its long haul Boeing 767 aircraft was recently impounded over an outstanding debt.' Sources at Air Zimbabwe told Radio VoP that the minister took the drastic action last week after he got a tongue-lashing from Mugabe . Dictator: President Robert Mugabe nearly missed his Christmas holiday to the Far East after the long-haul plane was impounded in London . The president nearly missed his annual holiday to the Far East after the long-haul plane that he normally uses to travel on outside trips was impounded in London. The grounding of flights between Zimbabwe and London, and Zimbabwe and Johannesburg, is expected to last until at least January 15. The nationalised airline, which used to one of the most successful in Africa, operates a fleet of seven planes and is based in the country's capital Harare. However, years of financial mismanagement and political interference has left the company swamped beneath a mountain of debt. The government has said it would work to resolve the crisis and the airline is due to contact its debtors this month to discuss its finances. Air Zimbabwe is continuing to operate routes from Harare to other African destinations including neighbouring Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Radio VoP reported that the temporary closure of routes to Britain and South Africa could prove financially catastrophic as the destinations provide a significant proportion of the airline's income. The current crisis follows a turbulent year for Air Zimbabwe, which was grounded for several weeks during 2011 after its staff went on strike. Local media has previously reported that the national flag carrier suffered last-minute changes to its schedules after its aircraft were commandeered by Mugabe. The 87-year-old leader has no presidential private jet and instead reportedly demands to charter one of the airline's planes at his whim when he decides to travel. By doing so, the company has been forced to repeatedly cancel or postpone flights, destroying passenger confidence it its timetable. Mugabe's Christmas holiday is at least the ninth time the tyrant has travelled to Asia in the last year. It is believed several of his previous visits were to receive treatment at a private hospital amid reports he is suffering from cancer.","State-owned airline is not serving London or Johannesburg amid a crippling financial crisis .

Police officers have been warned they face the sack if they have ‘improper’ communications with journalists. A review into the relationship between Scotland Yard and the media has called for tighter controls on the release of information. It even recommends that officers should not drink alcohol with journalists because it ‘loosens tongues’. But it is feared that the rules will lead to less information reaching the public as officers are deterred from speaking out. The guidelines could also allow police to bypass questioning and the potentially critical glare of the media by briefing community groups instead. The report, by Dame Elizabeth Filkin, the former parliamentary commissioner for standards, was ordered by former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson. It followed allegations that ‘cosy relationships involving excessive hospitality between some senior officers and News of the World journalists’ had undermined the Met’s phone hacking inquiry. Sir Paul later resigned following criticism of his decision to hire ex-News of the World executive Neil Wallis as a PR consultant. He had also accepted a £12,000 freebie . at a luxury health spa promoted by Mr Wallis, who was arrested in July . over alleged hacking. Yesterday Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said . there would be ‘no more secret conversations’. He issued a stark warning to officers . that whistle-blowers who act ‘improperly’ by leaking stories for . malicious, selfish purposes or who merely pass on gossip would face . disciplinary action. Ms Filkin's report was commissioned by former Met commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, left, who subsequently resigned amid allegations about the force's PR contract with former News International executive Neil Wallis, right . If leaks did not lead to criminal proceedings, . ‘robust’ management action would be required, he said. Officers could be banned from accepting lucrative work as media pundits soon after leaving Scotland Yard. The report said such moves had damaged the Met. It criticised officers such as Andy Hayman, a former assistant commissioner who was responsible for the original phone hacking inquiry, who became a columnist for The Times two months after leaving the force. The Times is owned by News International, the company at the centre of the phone hacking scandal. Dame Elizabeth said: ‘The speed with which some former police officers take employment within the media is a cause for concern. ‘I am also concerned that former police officers, some of whom have been dismissed, take employment with private investigation firms and continue to obtain information from former colleagues.’ The report said there was a ‘range of . contact that is not permitted’ and which, if unregulated, would continue . to damage trust in the impartiality of the police. Officers are advised to watch out for . reporters’ ‘flirting’ and ‘late-night carousing’, which were described . as ‘long-standing media tactics to get you to spill the beans’. The report also found that contact . between the police and the media had ‘not been transparent enough’. Under the guidelines, officers are to be told to brief community groups . instead of mainstream media. Dame Elizabeth said officers should . ‘weigh up the risk’ when speaking to the Press and formalise meetings by . making a note of every conversation, with those records open to a . random audit. She said: ‘There are lots of other . channels they should be using, because lots of people don’t hear about . what the Met is doing through the Press. ‘They hear about it through community groups, through community and local papers and lots of new media.’ Mr Hogan-Howe said: ‘There should be no more improper contact – that which is of a selfish, rather than a public interest. ‘Anyone found to have improperly shared information will be subject to misconduct and/or criminal proceedings.’","New guide for Scotland Yard urges officers to keep a note of every conversation they have .

Laura McGoldrick, 19, was slightly wounded but managed to escape the slaughter in Horden, Peterlee, County Durham by climbing through an upstairs window. But Atherton, 42, shot his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, shortly after returning home from a pub that evening. He blasted them with his licensed shotgun before killing himself. A joint statement from Laura and her brother, Michael Atherton Jnr, paid tribute to all four who died in the shootings . 'We are truly devastated,' they said. 'Me and my sister have lost the best mother in the world. We don't understand why my dad would do anything like this as he was such a good man. 'At the end of the day we have lost four loved family members and we hope they are all at peace now.' Mr Atherton's parents, Peter and Christine, said: 'We and our whole family want to express our sympathies to the families of Susan, Alison and Tanya. 'Although we loved Michael, we are sorry for his actions and don't understand why he did what he did. 'We dearly loved Susan as a daughter for over 20 years and are devastated by the loss.' The tributes come after it emerged police seized Atherton’s shotguns three years ago – but returned them to him because they did not think he posed a danger. Officers were called out to his home on September 10, 2008, and removed six guns from Atherton’s home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself. He applied to get them back and they were returned to him on November 18 that year after he simply denied that he had ever felt suicidal. Escape: Laura McGoldrick, pictured at her 18th birthday party, was shot during the incident but managed to escape by climbing through a window . Yesterday MPs said the decision on removing guns should not be left solely to the discretion of a police officer and must involve a health professional as well as checks with the owner’s partner. The Independent Police Complaints Commission today launched an investigation into firearms licensing matters in the wake of the rampage. Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry said Atherton and his partner of 19 years had gone out separately and ‘an argument took place’ on their return to the semi-detached house in Greenside Avenue, Peterlee, County Durham. He said: ‘Mr Atherton produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead Susan, Tanya and Alison before turning the gun on himself.’ The women’s bodies were found in the kitchen and living room and a shotgun was by Atherton’s side. Inquests into the four deaths will open at Chester-le-Street Magistrates' Court at 10am tomorrow. Relatives of the three dead women paid tributes to them in . a statement, saying: 'We as a family would like to take this . opportunity to express our devastation at the loss we have suffered . following the tragic events of Sunday evening and would like to pay . individual tributes to each of our much-loved family members whom we . have lost. 'Susan was a . much-loved sister, who was adored by both family and friends. She was . particularly close to her sisters and loved spending time with them. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Turnbull (left) died alongside her daughter Tanya (right) who at 24 was the . youngest of the three killed in the New Year's Day tragedy . 'She was so caring and all that mattered to her was her family. We are shocked and shattered by what's happened. 'Alison was a fantastic mother, sister and partner who was always there for her family and friends when we needed her. 'She was a fantastic mam to her son, Bobby, and daughter, Tanya, always so caring and loving. 'Tanya was the most amazing daughter, partner and sister you could ever wish for. 'She was a popular, funny and a gorgeous girl with her whole life ahead of her, and we idolised her. 'Tanya . and her boyfriend, Michael, were in the process of preparing for their . life together and had plans to buy their first home. 'It was an exciting time for Tanya and she was always smiling and happy. 'This . horrific loss is still sinking in and, as we are sure you can . appreciate, we are devastated to lose Tanya in such tragic . circumstances. 'We would also like to offer our heartfelt condolences to young Michael and Laura, who we know will be devastated by their loss. 'It's extremely important to us as a family that we are left in peace to grieve our loss and begin to recover from this. 'We . would ask that the media respect our privacy and that we be left alone . to comfort one another and attempt to come to terms with our devastating . loss.' Laughing killer: Michael Atherton at an awards evening in 2005. He was a keen angler and took up shooting several years ago . Friends said the once ‘happy-go-lucky’  family man had been depressed about a heart problem.Neighbour Jean Gray, 74, said both Atherton and Mrs McGoldrick were ‘very good neighbours’. She added: ‘I couldn’t say anything bad about either of them. He was a happy-go-lucky person and very well liked. ‘I just don’t know what happened to him. He must have snapped somehow.’ Atherton was a keen angler before taking up game shooting several years ago. Elaine Wilkinson, a friend who runs a . fishing tackle shop, said Mrs McGoldrick phoned her last year to ask . for advice because Atherton was refusing to get treatment for a heart . problem. Mrs Wilkinson’s husband, Bert, died three years ago from a . heart attack. ‘She was . really worried about Mick, she was on about his heart and the fact that . he wasn’t doing anything about it,’ she said. ‘He was a very friendly . chap on the outside but I don’t know what he was like between the four . walls of his house. ‘He had suffered from depression for . quite a while, I think. I don’t know if that’s got something to do with . this. They were both hot-headed but very nice people.’ Shot at close range: Susan McGoldrick, circled bottom right, the partner of gunman Michael Atherton, was killed in the massacre; the identities of her friends in this image is not known . Police . have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints . Committee over the decision to return three licensed shotguns and three . ‘high-powered’ firearms, believed to be rifles, after Atherton . threatened to shoot himself in 2008. Grahame . Morris, Labour MP for Easington, said: ‘At the time the police took his . firearms from him and he applied to have them returned. Police made an . assessment and they were returned to him.’ Durham Police confirmed . that the weapons were taken from Mr Atherton’s house as a precaution, . but as he insisted there had been no threat to harm himself, the weapons . were returned. That . decision followed national procedure, a force spokesman said. ‘It was . one person’s word against another,’ he said. ‘If there were no grounds . for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be . returned to the firearms licence holder.’ Commenting . on firearms regulations, Mr Morris said: ‘At the moment it is fairly . subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment . of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms . licence. ‘My view is . there should be some input from a suitably qualified health care . professional. Secondly, I also wonder whether it is reasonable to keep . firearms in a domestic situation.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:07 PM on 4th January 2012 . A police officer at the scene of the alleged murder of Marie McGrory at her house in Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, today . A former Scots Guardsman was under arrest tonight on suspicion of killing the mother of his twin boys after she was found strangled in their home. John McGrory, 46, was detained by detectives investigating the murder of his wife Marie, who was discovered seriously injured and died hours later in hospital. The couple’s two 14-year-old sons, who were at the house when the emergency services were called, were today being cared for by relatives as they come to terms with the death of their mother. Paramedics and police were called to the semi-detached home in Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, yesterday, after a 999 call reporting that a woman had been seriously hurt. She was rushed to Wycombe General Hospital in High Wycombe where she died despite the efforts of surgeons to save her. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the death of 39-year-old Mrs McGrory was being treated as murder and confirmed that a man had been arrested at the scene. The house was sealed off as forensic experts combed the property for clues to the killing in what is believed to have been a domestic incident. Detectives were also searching through Mrs McGrory’s red Audi convertible car and her husband’s silver Ford Galaxy, which were parked outside the house. Next-door neighbour John Clark, 54, said a friend of his wife claimed she heard a disturbance at the McGrorys’ home the night before the tragedy. He added: ‘We can’t believe it has happened - it’s horrible. They were just such a nice family, so easy going. They would always stop and say hello. ‘My missus and I have got grandchildren and they (the McGrory’s) would always talk to us about them.’ He said Mr McGrory, was a soldier from Scotland, adding: ‘He was a Guardsman. I think it was the Scots Guards and that he served in the first Gulf War. ‘Since then, he has worked at Heathrow airport and then I think he was a lorry driver.’ Investigators search Mrs McGrory's red Audi convertible outside the house as they try to piece together how the tragedy unfolded. Mr McGrory's silver Ford Galaxy was also swept for clues . Mr McGrory and his wife had teenage identical twin boys, who were believed to have been at the address at the time emergency services were called. Mr Clark added: ‘My missus saw the ambulance and we both thought “something’s wrong”. ‘Then she saw her (Marie McGrory) being carried out on a stretcher and being put into the ambulance.’ Mr McGrory was arrested around the same time at the house. Another neighbour said: ‘I saw John being led out to a police car. He was in handcuffs. I couldn’t see his face, but he didn’t seem stressed or upset. He just seemed normal. ‘Then one of the boys came out and was put in another police car and then the other one came out.’ The woman then went outside, where she sat with Marie’s distressed sister, who had been contacted about the incident. She said: ‘I was walking back and just then they brought her (Marie) out on the stretcher,’ said the neighbour. ‘All I remember is the eyes,’ she said, explaining how she had learned years ago that the eyes of strangulation victims bulge. She described the former serviceman as ‘all arms and legs’, saying he was lanky and not at all stocky, while his wife was about a foot shorter than him.","Scots Guardsman John McGrory ‘murdered wife in domestic row’

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 11:07 AM on 2nd January 2012 . Wayne Rooney was said to be furious at being fined £250,000 and dropped from Manchester United's New Year's Eve match after being 'lethargic' at training. The 26-year-old striker apparently incurred Sir Alex Ferguson's wrath by going out for a Boxing Day dinner with wife Coleen and then arriving for training looking worse for wear. He was described as 'bemused and upset' at his treatment by the 70-year-old manager over the past week. Sitting it out: Rooney watched from a corporate box at Old Trafford as his team-mates slipped up against lowly Blackburn Rovers on Saturday . Wayward star: Michael Carrick drives Rooney away from training yesterday after his run-in with boss Sir Alex Ferguson . Rooney and Coleen were joined by team-mates Darron Gibson and Jonny Evans and their partners in a celebration of United’s 5-0 win over Wigan on Boxing Day. Good life: The Manchester United star with wife Coleen on holiday in St Tropez earlier this year . The United and England star and Gibson - Evans is missing through injury - were said to have been in a bad state at training the day after. Ferguson was infuriated at their behaviour, sources said, because he had warned them to rest and 'not be seen out and about'. Although it was suggested that the players had only been for dinner, insiders said Ferguson would not discipline players just for going out five days before their next game. It was apparently the unacceptably poor physical condition of the players at training that so angered their manager. Rooney was said to think he had . been treated unfairly. The father-of-one was apparently horrified at Ferguson's 'complete over-reaction.' Rooney was reportedly summoned to his boss's office for a telling-off, and the players were given one of Ferguson's famous 'hair-dryer' rants after apparently discussing what a good night they had had. He was forced to watch his team's New Year's Eve humiliation against Blackburn - a 3-2 defeat - from a corporate box at Old Trafford. The players were initially ordered to do extra training on Wednesday, which had been supposed to be a day off. Then, on Friday night, Rooney was informed he and Gibson would be dropped for the game against Blackburn Rovers, and that he had been hit with the huge financial penalty. Glam: Wayne and Coleen will need to keep a low profile after their ill-advised night out on Boxing Day . The confrontation between Sir Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney has its roots in an earlier upheaval. In October 2010, Rooney publicly alleged that Manchester United were not serious about winning trophies and suggested that they did not share his own ambitions. The striker hinted that he wanted to leave the club, with many believing he was about to be lured by the offer of a bumper contract from big-spending Manchester City. But Ferguson took to the airwaves to voice his disappointment - not anger - at Rooney's apparent desire to leave. Speaking to a group of journalists, he affected shock: 'I couldn't understand it at all. He said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life.' He added: 'This is a club which bases all its history and its tradition on the loyalty and trust between managers and players and the club. That goes back to the days of Sir Matt. That's what it's founded on. 'He wanted to go. I said to him, ""Just remember one thing: respect this club. I don't want any nonsense from you, respect your club"".' The upshot was Rooney stayed - with an improved contract - and Ferguson reserved his ire for agent Paul Stretford, who he blamed for turning Rooney's head. But it seems the rift may not have healed completely. Yesterday afternoon, Rooney told his . followers on Twitter: 'My resolution - to start the year as a champion, . and finish it as a champion...' Sources . insisted Ferguson's strict punishment of Rooney will not have a . long-term impact on the working relationship between the manager and a . player United cannot afford to do without. Rooney is expected to take his place in the team at Newcastle this Wednesday night. But the episode is a serious lapse at a time when the striker is needed to lead a team struggling under the weight of injury, illness and poor form. Rooney and the United manager have been involved in previous major bust-ups. Now, speculation is growing that the latest row could put the player's future at the club in jeopardy. Rooney and Ferguson’s relationship looked beyond repair 14 months ago after the Untied star told his boss he no longer wanted to play for United. Rooney released a statement, saying his decision was based on ambition and it seemed certain he would leave Old Trafford. But within days, Rooney had made a dramatic U-turn and agreed to a contract extension that tied him to the club until 2015. The club has not yet responded to questions about this week's argument.

Tributes were paid today to a 'highly cherished' Gurkha soldier who died in hospital 18 months after being injured in an explosion in Afghanistan. Rifleman Sachin Limbu, 23, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles, died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Monday. He was injured when he was caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device in June 2010. The soldier came from Rajghat, Morang in Nepal, and followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Gurkha soldier. His father was a Gurkha Senior NCO and he was brought up in the life and community of 7th Gurkha Rifles and later 2nd Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in Hong Kong and Brunei. In a statement released through the Ministry of Defence, his father, Dillisher Limbu, said: 'My wife and I are immensely proud of our only beloved son who has sacrificed his life for the good of others. 'Sachin was our only son and we both extend our sincere thanks to all the staff at The New Queen Elizabeth hospital and Brigade of Gurkhas who have supported us all so closely.' Lieutenant Colonel David Robinson, Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, said the Rifleman's 'sacrifice has prevented him from fulfilling a rewarding career but his inspiring determination not to succumb to his injuries for so long was in the true sprit of those Gurkhas who have gone before him. 'He was highly cherished and loved by his fellow Gurkhas and left his mark on all those that had the honour to meet him. 'As the only son of a retired Gurkha . this will have been devastating for his family; our thoughts and prayers . are with them at this difficult time.' A Gurkha from B Company The 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles with whom Rfn Limbu was deployed in Walizi, Afghanistan . He added that the soldier had shown 'remarkable tenacity' in trying to overcome the injuries he had sustained on June 24 2010. Rfn Limbu was deployed on Operation Herrick 12 with B (Sari Bari) Company, 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles as a machine gunner. He was involved in a number of operations to stabilise the area of Walizi Village, many of which involved intense, protracted and close quarter combat in an area known to present a high risk from IEDs, the MoD said. On June 24 2010 he was deployed on a patrol to Walizi as part of an operation to enable local national freedom of movement and deter insurgent activity in the area. As they reached their objective, Rfn Limbu moved into a fire position to provide protection to his comrades and was caught in an explosion from a hidden IED. A Gurlha pictured in the Walizi Village, of Afghanistan - an area known to present a high risk from IEDs . Rfn Limbu, who passed the selection . for the Brigade of Gurkhas in 2007, was evacuated to Birmingham's Selly . Oak Hospital via Camp Bastion before being transferred to Queen . Elizabeth Hospital where he died. Lieutenant Colonel Gez Strickland, . Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles on Operation . Herrick 12, said: 'Rifleman Sachin Limbu has touched many of our lives. 'On operations in Afghanistan he . represented everything that is good about our Gurkha soldiers. He was . diligent, supportive to his friends and committed to what he was doing. 'He had a firm place in his Company and was counted as one of a select few. Since his injury a year and a half ago, he was nothing short of inspirational. 'I watched this young man deal with unimaginable pain and suffering, but all the time he maintained his strength and dignity. 'One of the proudest moments of my life was when he was presented his Afghan campaign service medal on his ward in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital last year, surrounded by his family, friends, and the wonderful staff there who cared for him so well. Rfn Limbu died at a specialist unit that treats troops injured in Afghanistan at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, pictured . 'In hospital, he fought against incredible odds for a very long time with more courage than I have ever seen in another human being, helped at every step by his wonderful, loving parents. He was truly a special man.' Major Dyanprasad Rai, Gurkha Major 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, said: 'Rifleman Sachin Limbu was a courageous and highly capable soldier who was dedicated to his profession. 'He has always been sincere and devoted towards his responsibilities as a soldier, in the best tradition of the Gurkha soldier. 'He was active in all that he did, thoughtful for those around him and incredibly loyal. 'His service within 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles will never be forgotten.' Major Kushiman Gurung, Gurkha Major 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles on H12, said: 'Riflemen Sachin Limbu was a true Gurkha soldier. He was loyal, determined, and enthusiastic and was always up for a challenge with a grin on his face. 'His cheerful attitude and determination made him an inspiring member amongst his fellow soldiers, who both admired and respected him. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him but his sacrifice will not be forgotten.'","Soldier from Rajghat, Morang in Nepal had followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Gurkha soldier ."

While most people across America will be still be humming Aud Lang Syne and making resolutions to be a better person on New Year’s Day, thieves are seizing the opportunity to steal cars. According to a recent report, New Year’s Day is the most popular day for automobile theft, as many cars are sitting unattended in lots as their owners are most likely nursing a hangover far away. The numbers don’t lie – 2,347 cars were stolen last New Year’s Day alone, a report says. No New Years resolutions? New Year's Day is the most popular for car thieves, a report says . The National Insurance Crime Bureau says that thieves jump on the opportunity to pluck a car away on a day where many cars are ripe for the taking. ‘Thieves never miss an opportunity to make a quick buck by stealing a car,’ NICB president Joe Wehrle said. ‘They work nights, weekends and holidays and ironically, they are particularly busy on New Year’s Day and Memorial Day.’ The NICB cautioned in their news release: ‘While Americans are enjoying the holidays and most have time off from work, we need to remember that holidays are just another day at the shop for vehicle thieves.’ Surprising: The 1994 Honda Accord was the most popular car to steal in 2010 .

Car owners may be surprised to learn that most burglars don’t target high-end - or even new - cars. According to the NICB, the most stolen car in 2010 was the 1994 Honda Accord, a low to mid-range compact vehicle. The bureau recommends parking your car in a safe, well-lit area and also reminds drivers of a few seemingly obvious pointers – like taking the keys out of the ignition and not hiding them anywhere in or around the vehicle. To slow down would-be thieves, the NICB also recommends additional security measures aside from car alarms. Applying the emergency break, turning the wheels hard to the left or right, and putting the car in the parking gear are all ways to deter potential robbers from towing your car. A total of 20,995 vehicles were stolen on holidays during 2010, compared to 22,991 reported stolen the year before.","2,347 vehicles stolen on New Year's Day in 2010 .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 11:31 PM on 4th January 2012 . At 21, she was a talented English literature student with a bright future ahead of her. He was a volatile 26-year-old electrician consumed with jealousy for his gifted girlfriend. Yesterday an inquest heard how Katy Winchester was found strangled next to the body of Kurt Tyrrell, the boyfriend variously described as violent, possessive and controlling. Tempestuous relationship: Katy Winchester with Kurt Tyrrell . At the time of the incident police said they believed he had killed Miss Winchester and then hanged himself. Friends said the couple had ‘drifted apart’ while Miss Winchester was 100 miles away at Manchester Metropolitan University. She was killed during a weekend visit to Tyrrell’s home in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire, just weeks before her finals. Coroner Stuart Fisher heard that the pair were found dead in the 26-year-old’s locked bedroom last April. Friends of the couple said Tyrrell – a ‘weekend binge drinker’ – had been both violent and unfaithful towards his girlfriend in the past. Miss Winchester’s best friend, Natalie Watson, said that while the couple appeared normal on the surface, Tyrrell was ‘quite controlling and the jealous type’. Katy, left is believed to have been strangled by boyfriend Kurt before he hanged himself . She added: ‘I didn’t think  they were . going to be together forever. They had different views on life. They . wanted to do  different things.’ The court heard that in 2010 Tyrrell . took a job in Manchester to be closer to Miss Winchester. The couple . split up in the autumn of that year but had reunited by that Christmas. Miss Winchester’s semi-naked body was . found by a paramedic who smashed open Tyrrell’s bedroom door with a . sledgehammer after a 999 call from a housemate who had been unable to . rouse the pair. Tyrrell was also found dead in the room. The inquest heard the couple had spent the previous evening drinking with different groups of friends in Lincoln city centre before sharing a taxi for the five-mile journey back to the house. Stuart Hall, one of Tyrrell’s housemates, said the pair had shared four bottles of vodka with another friend during ‘drinking games’ before heading off for their night out. Reunited: Katy and Kurt's bodies were discovered at Tyrell's house in Lincoln in April last year . Mr Hall told the inquest when he arrived home at 3am he noticed what turned out to be blood on the floor of the house, but which he dismissed at the time as ketchup. He saw Miss Winchester’s and her boyfriend’s shoes outside Tyrrell’s bedroom door and assumed they were inside, but raised the alarm when they had failed to appear by 5pm the next day. Mr Hall said he noticed ‘the largest knife from our kitchen’ in the bedroom alongside the bloodied and bruised bodies. Asked by Mr Fisher if it was correct to say the couple were drifting apart, Mr Hall replied: ‘Yes, they argued a lot.’ Mr Hall described the couple’s relationship as ‘tempestuous,’ adding,: ‘It was always on and off, one day he never wanted to see her again and the next he wanted to marry her.’ Katy was strangled during a visit home to Lincolnshire, pictured . Another housemate, Oscar Campbell, said Tyrrell once admitted going ‘mad’ during a night out in Manchester, which culminated in him wrecking Miss Winchester’s bedroom. Mr Campbell also said Tyrrell had once admitted his girlfriend ‘made him that mad he could kill her’, but dismissed the remark as a figure of speech. He added: ‘Kurt had a bad temper but only when he’d had alcohol. I know he’d hit her a few times ... He was a weekend binge drinker. He would just flip and lose control of himself.’ A post-mortem examination revealed Miss Winchester died from compression to her neck and had also suffered two blows to her face. Tyrrell died from ligature strangulation and also had superficial stab wounds. The couple had booked a holiday in the Canary Islands for when Miss Winchester finished her studies, her father told the hearing. But although Frank Winchester, 71, said they seemed happy together it was also apparent the pair ‘wanted different things’. Mr Winchester, from Sleaford, said: ‘She was a very popular girl and had many friends.’ The couple were due to visit him on the day they were found dead. The inquest continues.","Police said they believed he killed Katy Winchester and then hanged himself, an inquest heard ."
"By . Thomas Durante . Last updated at 2:28 PM on 2nd January 2012 . Victim: Margaret Anderson is a mother of two young daughters who has worked as a park ranger for four years . Authorities are scouring Mount Rainier National Park for a cold-blooded killer who gunned down a U.S. Forest Service Ranger and then fired at officers who were coming to help her. Officials closed the park after the shooting yesterday, and asked people to stay out of the area while they search for a man carrying a long rifle. He is also the prime suspect in the shooting of four people at New Year's Eve party hours earlier in the south of Seattle - which left two people critically injured. The female ranger, Margaret Anderson, 34, a married mother of two young girls, was shot as she stopped the suspect's car. A 'strong person of interest' has been identified as Benjamin Colton Barnes, 24, an Iraq war veteran who is believed to have strong wilderness survival skills and is heavily armed. Pierce County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ed Troyer said authorities recovered Barnes' vehicle, which had weapons and body armour inside. Authorities believed the gunman was still in the woods with an assault rifle. They asked people to stay away from the park, and for those already there to leave. Mr Troyer said there were about 100 people hunkered down in lodges and cabins on the mountain.  They were told to stay put because they could be in the line of fire. Armoured vehicles were being brought in to ferry them safely out of the park early this morning around 4am. Crews had initially planned to keep everyone in a basement with guards. But Mr Troyer said it was determined to be 'better to do it [evacuate] under the cover of darkness than daylight'. Mr Troyer said authorities were following tracks in the snow they believe are from the gunman, and crews planned to bring an airplane through the area with heat-seeking capabilities. He added: 'We believe we have a good track on him, but he's way ahead of us'. The officer said Barnes was being followed in the snow but he was making it hard for crews by climbing in and out of streams to cover his tracks. 'We do have a very hot and dangerous situation,' he added. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Benjamin Colton Barnes is believed to have gunned down a U.S. Forest Service ranger after shooting four people at a New Year's Eve house party . Location unknown: Iraq War veteran Benjamin Colton Barnes is wanted by the authorities . 'Strong person of interest': Benjamin Colton Barnes, who cops say has a . military background and strong wilderness survival skills, is also a . suspect in an earlier shooting incident at a New Year's Eve party . A parks spokesman said Barnes is an Iraq war veteran. The mother of Barnes' child had alleged that he suffered from post-traumatic stress following his deployments. Barnes was involved in a custody dispute in Tacoma in July 2011, during which the toddler's mother sought a temporary restraining order against him. 'We do have a very hot and dangerous situation.' Ed Troyer, Sheriff's Office . In an affidavit, the woman wrote that Barnes was suicidal and possibly suffered from PTSD after deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008. She said he was easily irritated, angry and depressed and kept weapons in the house. Police said that Barnes is also a . suspect in an early-morning shooting at a New Year's house party in . Skyway, Washington, south of Seattle that left four people in their 20s injured, two . critically. It is believed to have began in an argument over a gun. Police have been in contact with Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and tell his side of the story'.

Ms Jackson said: 'That was scary for the kids.' The park would remain closed today, . officials announced last night. Jason Simpson, 29, of Kent, said his . parents were still trapped at the visitor's centre after travelling to . the mountain for a day hike. His parents were able to make a call explaining their situation, and Mr Simpson drove to the park entrance to wait. Mr Simpson said: 'It's very distressing'. At around 10:20am Sunday, another park service employee had tried to stop a man in his vehicle. When he didn't stop, Anderson set up a road block with her vehicle in the middle of the road, said park spokeswoman Lee Taylor. Mapped out: A board showing Pierce County Sheriff's search for Benjamin Colton Barnes . The man pulled up to Anderson about 11am, jumped out, and fired before running off, she said. According to The News Tribune the incident occurred near the Longmire Ranger Station, in the southwest corner of the park. Mr Troyer said that when authorities arrived they were also shot at, but no one else was hit. About . 150 officers were on the mountain, but they had not made contact with . the gunman and did not know where he was, Troyer said. Responders were only able to reach Mrs Anderson, who had radioed for help, around 12:45pm. Park superintendent Randy King said that Anderson is a mother of two young daughters who has served as a park ranger for about four years. He added that her husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting. Adam Norton, a neighbor of Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the ranger's family moved in about a year ago. He said they were not around much, but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said. The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said. 'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.' Running: A gunman is on the lose after shooting a female ranger in Mount Rainier National Park in Washington Sunday morning . Lockdown: Authorities are asking people to stay away from the park, and for those already inside the park to leave. Armed officers were stopping and questioning drivers as they departed. It has been legal for people to take loaded firearms into Mount Rainier since 2010, when a controversial federal law went into effect that made possession of firearms in national parks subject to state gun laws. The shooting occurred on an unseasonably sunny and mild day. The park, which offers miles of wooded trails and spectacular vistas from which to see 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, draws between 1.5million and 2million visitors each year. The Longmire station served as headquarters when the national park was established in 1899. Park headquarters have moved but the site still contains a museum, a hotel, restaurant and gift shop, which are open year-round. Authorities believe the gunman is still in the woods with some type of long assault rifle and possibly other weapons.

'The Department of the Interior and the National Park Service will do everything possible to bring the perpetrator of this crime to justice and to ensure the safety of park visitors and other park rangers.' He added: 'This tragedy serves as a reminder of the risks undertaken by the men and women of the National Park Service and law enforcement officers across the Department every day, and we thank them for their service.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:23 PM on 4th January 2012 . Benjamin Colton Barnes was discharged from the Army for misconduct after being charged with drunken driving and improperly transporting a privately owned weapon . Iraq War veteran Benjamin Colton Barnes was last stationed at a troubled U.S. Army base notorious for suicides and violence, it emerged today. The 24-year-old, suspected of killing a Mount Rainier National Park ranger after shooting four people in Seattle, was expelled from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington two years ago. Lewis-McChord has drawn national attention for . widespread problems with post-traumatic stress disorder among service . members returning from Afghanistan and from Iraq. In 2009 Barnes left it after being discharged from the Army for misconduct. He was charged with drunken driving and improperly transporting a privately owned weapon. Then on Monday the survival expert is believed to have gone on the rampage. He was eventually found dead face down in snow after police launched a manhunt for him. Police think he fled to the remote park on Sunday to hide after an earlier shooting at a New Year's house party near Seattle that wounded four, two critically . Authorities suspect he shot ranger Margaret Anderson later on Sunday, before freezing to death. A . year ago, the military newspaper Star and Stripes rated Lewis-McChord . as the most troubled base in the entire U.S. military, with multiple . criminal and military investigations under way into troops' behavior and . the quality of the medical and mental health care for service members . returning from the war. That . was before the base set a record for presumed suicides in 2011, with . 12, according to military statistics due to be released this month. Joint Base Lewis-McChord is one of the largest bases in the country, with about 100,000 military and civilian personnel. The Army directed base officials last . year to focus specifically on the mental health of members of the 5th . Stryker Brigade, which saw heavy action in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. Barnes served with a Lewis-McChord Stryker brigade, although officials said they didn't immediately know whether it was the 5th. It follows a series of reports about and incidents at Lewis-McChord. Passing out: A commissioning ceremony for Army cadets at the troubled Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington . The base set a record for presumed suicides in 2011, with 12, according to military statistics . Victim: Benjamin Colton Barnes (right) was said to have shot dead Margaret Anderson, a mother of two young daughters, at the national park near Seattle . Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, 50 miles . south of Seattle, has seen numerous violent incidents, leading to . several charges and convictions of soldiers for serious crimes. These include: . In a paper for the Army War College last year, Army Colonel Ricardo Love reported that 'veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at an alarming rate'. A 2008 RAND Corp. study indicated that 18 per cent of all service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 had 'PTSD or major depression'. Only about half seek treatment, it said. 'Although Commanders are conducting tough and realistic training prior to deployment, the high number of returnees diagnosed with PTSD indicates we are not doing enough,' Love concluded. But the problem is especially severe at Lewis-McChord, which the Los Angeles Times profiled as 'a base on the brink' just last week. 'I can tell you that in the last two years, we have had 24 instances in which we contacted soldiers who were armed with weapons,' Bret Farrar, police chief in nearby Lakewood, told the newspaper. 'We've had intimidation, stalking with a weapon, aggravated assault, domestic violence, drive-bys.' The issues have come to widespread public attention after Lewis-McChord's heaviest year of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, where 18,000 soldiers from the base served in between 2009 and 2010. Barnes is known to have had a troubled transition to civilian . life, with accusations he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and was . suicidal. He was involved in a custody dispute . in Tacoma July, during which his toddler daughter's mother sought a . temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents. In seeking sole custody of the girl, she said Barnes was suicidal and 'gets easily irritated, angry, depressed and frustrated'. Undated photos . provided by police showed a shirtless, tattooed Barnes brandishing two . large weapons. The . woman said Barnes had numerous weapons in his home, including firearms . and knives, adding: 'I am fearful of what Benjamin is capable of with . the small arsenal he has in his home and his recent threat of suicide.' In November 2011, a guardian ad litem . recommended parenting and communication classes for both parents and . recommending Barnes be allowed to continue supervised visits with the . child, two days a week. That visitation schedule was to . continue until he completed a domestic violence evaluation and mental . health evaluation and complied with all treatment recommendations. Late Sunday police named Barnes the suspect in the New Year shooting incident which preceded the murder of the park ranger. On New Year's Eve, there was an argument . at a house party in Skyway, south of Seattle, and gunfire erupted, . police said. Four people in their 20s were reported injured, two . critically. Barnes was connected to the shooting, said Sgt Cindi West, . King County Sheriff's spokeswoman. Tragedy in the woods: The flag flew at half-staff at the entrance to Mount Rainier National Park in Washington after Ranger Margaret Anderson was shot dead . It is believed that the man had been . asked to leave after an argument over a gun. The man came back with a . weapon and opened fire on the crowd, according to police. Police believe Barnes headed to the . remote park wilderness to 'hide out' following the Skyway shooting. There were children present in the home at the time of the shooting. 'The speculation is that he may have . come up here, specifically for that reason, to get away,' parks . spokesman Kevin Bacher told reporters early Monday. 'The speculation is . he threw some stuff in the car and headed up here to hide out.' Mrs Anderson had set up a roadblock . on Sunday morning to stop a man who had blown through a checkpoint . rangers use to check if vehicles have tire chains for winter conditions. A gunman opened fire on her before she was able to exit her vehicle, . authorities say. Benjamin Colton Barnes is believed to have gunned down a U.S. Forest Service ranger after shooting four people at a New Year's Eve house party . Manhunt: Police released this picture of Iraq War veteran Benjamin Colton Barnes . Before fleeing, the gunman fired shots at both Anderson and the ranger that trailed him, but only Anderson was hit. Mrs Anderson would have been armed, . as she was one of the rangers tasked with law enforcement, parks . spokesman Kevin Bacher said. Troyer said she was shot before she had . even got out of the vehicle. Park superintendent Randy King said . Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two young girls who was married to . another Rainier ranger, had served as a park ranger for about four . years. King said Anderson's husband also was working as a ranger elsewhere in the park at the time of the shooting.

High School, New Jersey in 1995 and fulfilled her dream of becoming a . park ranger, according to local newspaper the Westfield Patch. She met her husband through work and they married in 2005. The couple had two daughters, Anna, three, and one-year-old Katie. Adam Norton, a neighbour of . Anderson's in the small town of Eatonville, Washington, said the . ranger's family moved in about a year ago. He said they were not around much, . but when they were Norton would see Anderson outside with her girls. 'They just seemed like the perfect family,' he said. The town of about 3,000 residents, which is a logging community overlooking Mount Rainier, is very close knit, he said. 'It's really sad right now,' Norton said. 'We take care of each other.' Police have been in contact with . Barnes' family, trying to have them coax him to 'come to the police and . tell his side of the story'. The shooting has meanwhile renewed . debate about a federal law that made it legal for people to take loaded . weapons into national parks. The 2010 law made possession of firearms . subject to state gun laws. Bill Wade, the outgoing chair of the . Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, said Congress should be . regretting its decision. 'The many congressmen and senators . that voted for the legislation that allowed loaded weapons to be brought . into the parks ought to be feeling pretty bad right now,' said Wade. Remote: Mount Rainier National Park in Washington covers a vast area . Hours: The shooting occurred near the park's Longmire Ranger Station but took responders several hours to reach Margaret Anderson because of shots continually fired by the gunman . Wade called Sunday's fatal shooting a . tragedy that could have been prevented. He hopes Congress will . reconsider the law that took effect in early 2010, but doubts that will . happen in today's political climate. Calls and emails to the National Rifle Association requesting comment were not immediately returned on Monday. The NRA said media fears of gun . violence in parks were unlikely to be realised, the NRA wrote in a . statement about the law after it went into effect. 'The new law affects . firearms possession, not use,' it said. The group pushed for the law saying people have a right to defend themselves against park animals and other people. Bacher, the parks spokesman, said . surviving overnight in the open on Rainier is difficult, but not . impossible for a person with gear and skills. He added that authorities . wouldn't shed tears if Colton didn't survive. 'I don't think any of us would be sorry if he was not in a condition to fire on our searchers this morning,' Bacher said.","Louis-McChord set a record for presumed suicides in 2011 .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 6:42 PM on 3rd January 2012 . The number of complaints about postmen leaving cards to say residents weren't in when they tried to deliver packages, when in fact the householders were home, has risen by more than a third. The cards are meant to be used by postmen if they knocked on the door to deliver a parcel and received no response from the resident. However, it appears the cards are being increasingly misused, pre-prepared by postmen seeking to lighten their loads and save time on their rounds. Actually, I was in: The number of complaints about postmen leaving 'Sorry, you were out cards' when residents were home has risen by a third in two years . In 2011, 32,000 people complained about being left a . P739 form, better known as a 'Sorry, you were out' card, a 14 per cent . rise. Between June and September last year . alone, more than 8,500 people complained about the practice, which . represents a 37 per cent increase in the same period in 2009. The figures show that the practice is on the rise despite promised by Royal Mail to curb the problem. A 2009 study found that Royal Mail staff were routinely leaving 'Sorry, you were out' cards without even knocking doors. Some sorting office managers have allocated just 10 seconds per house on new delivery routes, the postal workers union CWU has claimed. It has led to postmen filling out the forms before they approach houses because they do not have enough time to complete their rounds. Snap survey: Customers queuing outside the Royal Mail delivery office in North Shields, North Tyneside to collect their Christmas parcels in December . 'When we heard the allegations that . people were not ringing the door bell, we reminded staff they have to . ring and wait for people to answer the door, a spokesman for Royal Mail . told the Daily Telegraph. A spokesman for CWU acknowledged that . pressure to finish greater deliveries and in some cases insufficient . time built into delivery times was a factor in the increase in cards . being left. But she also said there had been a . huge rise in the number of packets, largely from internet shopping, . being delivered, which require more door knocking and therefore more . cards being issued. She also said over the past three . years deliveries had been pushed back later and people were more likely . to be out with the later delivery start times. A . snap survey of sorting offices by the Daily Mail, taken in . mid-December, revealed queues of customers waiting to pick up parcels. Many left empty-handed because they were too busy to wait up to 90 minutes in the Christmas rush, while others reached the counter only to be told their item couldn't be found. In a rush: Postmen are facing limits of 10 second per property on some rounds, increasing use of the cards . A variety of reasons were given for . the delays. Frustrated customers said the queues could have been avoided . if Royal Mail had put on extra staff to handle the workload. And while some parcels may have . genuinely been too big for letterboxes, or needed to be signed for, a . significant number of customers complained that they had been at home . when their postman shoved a notice through their door and drove off. North Shields, North Tyneside, saw . waits of 20 minutes, while customers in Bristol waited for over an hour . in temperatures of 5c. In Cambridge, the delays topped 90 minutes as 70 . people stood in line. Heavily pregnant teacher Jo Starkey, 31, lost 30 minutes of her day in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. 'You can never park here so I had to walk,' she complained. Royal Mail apologised to customers who . have 'experienced difficulties' but stressed that it has taken steps to . improve its service, such as extending opening hours for 1,400 offices . and carrying out deliveries that require a signature on Sundays to catch . people at home. The company has been criticised for . curtailing collections and deliveries while hiking prices and pursuing . other money-spinning ventures. It emerged this year that the firm was seeking a five-fold increase in revenue from junk mail deliveries as profits slumped.","Some 'overworked' postmen fill out the cards before they even arrive at houses to save time, admits union .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 10:01 PM on 2nd January 2012 . A man who had never weighed himself told how an unflattering wedding photograph forced him to shed half his bodyweight. Andrew Montgomery, 34, tipped the scales at 30 stone after a decade of unhealthy living that saw him gorge on a diet of junk food and unhealthy snacks. He had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 60.26 - a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25 - putting him in the morbidly obese category, and could not climb a single flight of stairs without panting. But is was only when he saw pictures of himself dwarfing a slim size 8 bridesmaid at a friend's wedding that he finally realised he had a serious weight problem. Shocking: The photo that shamed groomsman Andrew Montgomery, left, into losing half his bodyweight . Drastic measures: 34-year-old Andrew, far left, bought a treadmill and consumed just 500 calories a day to shed the weight, before embarking upon a healthy eating plan . In a bid to fight the pounds Andrew, from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, joined an online weight loss site called Lighter Life last January. He bought a treadmill and consumed just 500 calories a day, living on milkshakes, soup and cereal bars, before eating a balanced diet after ten months. He has since lost 15 stone and is hoping his new physique will be the boost he needs to help him find a wife this year. The agricultural contractor said: 'I . couldn't avoid the pictures and it was a shock to see how huge I looked . next to a size eight bridesmaid. Transformation: Andrew, who has lost 15 stone in 12 months, is now hoping to find himself a wife . Wake-up call: Andrew had never weighed himself, saying he didn't realise how big he really was . 'I had never weighed myself and I didn't realise how big I was until I could see myself compared to other people. 'That was the wake-up call I needed. 'I realised I could no longer avoid . my weight issues and that if I didn't do something about it I might . never find someone who wanted to walk down the aisle with me.' Andrew was best man at his friend's nuptials in June 2009, attending the wedding in a huge suit. Later in the evening he joined the wedding party on the dance floor and was photographed with bridesmaid Hayley Doyle, who was a slim size eight. When pictures emerged he was horrified to see how he dwarfed her petite frame. For the first time he decided to step on the scales and was shocked to discover . he weighed more than 30 stone. Believing he would never find love at such a weight he vowed to shed the pounds as a New Years resolution. After shedding 15 stone in 12 months, Andrew is hoping to move out of the home . he shares with his mother Mary, 60, who desperately tried to encourage him to be more healthy. She said: 'I used to be terrified that . Andrew wouldn't wake up in the morning - he was miserable, our . relationship was in tatters and I never thought he'd get and girlfriend . and move out. 'Now all he needs is to find a nice girl to sweep off her feet - let's see what the New Year brings.'","Andrew Montgomery, who tipped the scales at 30 stone, had never weighed himself .

"By . David Williams and Imtiaz Hussain . Last updated at 1:45 AM on 6th January 2012 . A British aid worker awarded the MBE for his work was kidnapped yesterday by at least four gunmen. Pro-Taliban fighters are suspected of seizing Khalil Dale, 60, in Pakistan after surrounding his Land Cruiser despite its clear Red Cross markings. Mr Dale was honoured for his courage in some of the world’s toughest disaster zones, having been robbed at gunpoint, strafed by machine-gun fire and threatened by a man wielding a Kalashnikov rifle. Seized: Khalil Dale is suspected to have been kidnapped by pro-Taliban fighters in Pakistan despite a Land Cruiser he was in having Red Cross markings . The slightly-built bachelor, previously known as Ken and a former nurse in Dumfries, was driving through the centre of the strife-ridden city of Quetta. Mr Dale has been based in the troubled region, where kidnapping and insurgency are rife, for 11 months running health projects. A veteran of aid work in Iran – where he was put on house arrest during the revolution – Libya, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Afghanistan, he had chosen not to have protection. Mr Dale converted to Islam in 1985 and changed his name. His work earned him the MBE in 1994, which he received from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. Mr Dale once declared that confronting danger did not worry him, saying: ‘I just get on with the job and I believe in destiny. But I’ll put it this way: I’ve made my will.’ Taken: A Pakistani employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) gestures next to the vehicle of British employee Khalil Ahmad Dale, who was captured nearby in Quetta, Pakistan . Criminal gangs in the area have often targeted foreign aid workers in the hope of securing large  ransoms but, by late last night, there had been no demands from Mr Dale’s captors. The Foreign Office said it was urgently investigating the incident and was in touch with his family, although it was not clear if they are also in Pakistan. In a statement, the International Red Cross called for Mr Dale’s ‘rapid and unconditional release’ adding that it had ‘no indication as to the abductors’ identities or motives’. The charity added that it will continue its humanitarian work in Pakistan despite the kidnapping. A spokesman for the British Red Cross said they were working to find out what had happened to Mr Dale. Quetta is the main town of Baluchistan province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. This has raised fears that he could be taken out of Pakistan, making any potential rescue much more dangerous. On guard: Pakistani private security guards stand outside the office of the ICRC where Khalil Ahmad Dale was kidnapped in Quetta. The city is also home to the Quetta Shura, the Taliban’s leadership council which is believed to direct much of its militant activity. Ahsan  Mahboob, a senior police officer, said the aid worker had been travelling with a Pakistani doctor and a driver who were not seized. An official of a security agency claimed the Red Cross in the city had received threats recently from Baloch United Liberation Army. In February 2009, this group seized senior UN official John Solensky and held the American for two months. nThe Iraqi militia which kidnapped five Britons in 2007 has offered to hand over the body of the last missing man. It claimed Alan McMenemy, from Glasgow, died trying to escape. The bodies of three others in the group have been returned to Britain while the fifth man, IT expert Peter Moore, was freed alive in 2009.",Khalil Ahmad Dale snatched outside office by gunmen .

Delaware State Police said the first collision happened at 6.35pm and involved a gold SUV, reports CBS Philly. Tragic: Relatives said Edith McFarland, 58, was a caring person who did not have much but did her best to help her family and friends . State Police Sergeant Paul Shavack said: 'She was ejected from the wheelchair into the southbound lanes. 'And then she was struck by two additional vehicles.' One vehicle is unconscionable. Three vehicles is unthinkable.' McFarland was taking groceries home to the nearby Fairview Inn motel. She had moved there three months ago with her son Jeremy and her two grandchildren. Her son is calling on the drivers responsible for his mother's death to come forward. 'If you did this, if it was an accident, it was an accident, but don’t just drive away from the woman,' Jeremy told CBS Philly. He says his mother was a caring person who did everything she could to help her family and friends. Horrific: Edith McFarland's wheelchair can be seen in the distance with all of her groceries and belongings strewn across the route after the brutal crash . Investigation: A police officer examines the the crumpled wreck which is all that is left of Edith McFarland's wheelchair after she was run over as she tried to cross the street . Distraught: Edith McFarland's son Jeremy breaks down as he makes an emotional appeal to the drivers to step forward and contact the police . 'We didn’t have very much anyway, but she’d give anybody what she had,' he said. McFarland's neighbor Robin Smith told CBS Philly that she hoped the drivers would contact the police. Grief: Robin Smith, Edith McFarland's neighbor said she hoped the drivers would come forward and give the grandmother's family justice . Fatal: Delaware State Police said the first collision happened at 6.35pm on Route 13 also known as Market Street, and involved a gold SUV . 'I pray to God that whoever hit her, their heart would be so heavy that they would turn themselves in and there would be justice for her family,' she said. 'They killed that woman. They killed her and kept going.' Police do not have a description of either the second or third vehicles, but  are still interviewing witnesses. Anyone with information is asked to call Delaware State Police on 302-834-2620 Ext. 275 or Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333.","Edith McFarland, 58, was hit by three vehicles as she crossed the road after grocery shopping - ALL three drivers fled the scene .

"Jakadrien Turner, 15, was arrested in Texas and gave police a fake name, claiming she was an illegal immigrant . Facebook profile discovered by her grandmother . Barack Obama briefed about case this morning . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:24 PM on 5th January 2012 . An American teenager managed to convince police, a court judge and U.S. immigration that she was an illegal immigrant before having herself deported to Colombia. Jakadrien Turner, 15, ran away from home in Dallas, Texas in November 2010 after becoming distraught over the death of her grandfather and parents' divorce. She was arrested in Houston for theft in April last year. The teenager, then 14, gave officers a fake name - Tika Lanay Cortez - claiming she was a 21-year-old illegal immigrant from Colombia. She was convicted of theft under the name Cortez. Her defense attorney also believed that to be her true identity. Scroll down for video . Deported: Jakadrien Turner, 15, ran away from home in Dallas Texas in 2010 and ended up being deported to Colombia after immigration officials mistakenly tagged her as an illegal immigrant . Another life: A picture allegedly posted on Facebook by Jakadrien Turner looking out across the mountains in Colombia . While serving time in prison, she was referred to the State Department of Immigration and Customs . Enforcement (ICE) who she also convinced that she came from Colombia. After a thorough investigation, it was . decided she would be deported. However prior to this, she was also . interviewed by the Colombian Consulate who agreed that she was a Colombian . citizen and approved paperwork for her. The 15-year-old was then deported to Bogota where she was given full Colombian citizenship, work permit and released. Miss Turner, who reportedly speaks no Spanish, ended up working as a housemaid. A Facebook profile, was reportedly set up by Jakadrien Turner, for Tika SoloToolonq (Tika Confero). It says she is originally from Bridgetown, Barbados, studied at Texas Southern University and lives in Bogota. It says she speaks Colombian Spanish along with Creole and Cajun French. In June, her employer was listed as the Convergys Corporation, a management strategy company. She also later worked at a similar company called Teleperformance and had mentioned previously she was employed as a maid. According to a source at the U.S. department of immigration there have been cases in the past where . individuals provide inaccurate information regarding who they are and . their immigration status for ulterior motives. On her Facebook profile, Tika SoloToolonq . has posted pictures with a group of women labelled 'Familia... me happy . 4 once, in the Mountains'. She appears to be photographed in Colombia. Distraught: Jakadrien's mother Johnessa Turner (left) and her grandmother Lorene have begged state officials for help in having her returned . On October 27, she changed her status from 'single' to 'in a relationship'.  She is listed as in a relationship with Alejandro Yoel Almeida Cisneros, originally from Havana, Cuba, who also works at Teleperformance. On November 15, she posted: 'Well bak in . a relationship with same man I broke up with, lol! I love him dearly . tho!!!! I think that will never happen, mae that mistake of oing that, . beause he show me that he is serious with me, an so on, so ok lol!!!!!' [sic] . Miss Turner or Miss SoloToolonq never mentions deportation but does discuss missing home. She also has a Twitter account on which she writes will be posted 'Good Mature EXPLICIT TWEETS'. According to ICE, checks on immigration status of individuals in the agency's custody were not based on race, ethnicity or language abilities - but rather by documentation verifying the immigration status. Her distraught grandmother Lorene Turner spent more than a year trawling Facebook trying to find her granddaughter and finally tracked her down in the South American country. 'She [Jakadrien Turner] maintained this false identity throughout her local criminal proceedings.' Immigration spokeswoman . At the time of her arrest, the State Department of Immigration and . Customs Enforcement (ICE) ran Miss Turner's fingerprints but she was not found in the system. An ICE official denied that Miss Turner had assumed the name of an existing Colombian citizen with outstanding criminal warrants. After she found out where her . granddaughter was, Mrs Turner contacted the U.S. government who found . out where the girl was living. The . American Embassy in Colombia asked police to go and collect her. Colombian officials . put the 15-year-old, who is allegedly pregnant according to W-FAA TV, in a detention centre but have made no moves to release her for . more than a month. It was unclear when the girl will be able to return to the U.S. The Department of State confirmed to MailOnline that they were aware of the case and were working with Colombian officials in Bogota but had no further comment at this time. Questions have been raised as to how a  black, American teenager was mistaken for a South American woman. ICE spokeswoman, Gillian Christensen, said: 'ICE takes these allegations very seriously.  At the direction of DHS, ICE is fully and immediately investigating this matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of this case. Far from home: Miss Turner gave police a fake name which happened to be the same as a 22-year-old illegal Colombian immigrant - and was sent 'back' to Bogota . No way back: The teenage girl was taken from Houston, Texas by U.S. state officials and released in Bogota, Colombia . 'Preliminary information suggests . that after being arrested on state charges for theft by the Houston . Police Department, the minor provided a false identity, representing . that she was an adult from Colombia with no legal status in the U.S. 'She . maintained this false identity throughout her local criminal . proceedings in Texas where she was represented by a defense attorney and . ultimately convicted by the State criminal court. At no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false. 'Upon . her conviction, she was referred to ICE where she continued to maintain . a false identity during immigration court proceedings. Involved: A Facebook page reportedly set up by Jakadrien Turner under the name Tika Solotoolonq claims that she is in a relationship with Cuban Alejandro Yoel Almeida Cisneros . 'As . is standard protocol, criminal database searches and biometric . verification were conducted and revealed no information to invalidate . her claims. She was ultimately ordered removed from the U.S. by a . Department of Justice immigration judge.' Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the civil rights organisation, the . National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), met with President Obama to discuss the matter this morning, a spokesman told MailOnline. The organisation was unable to comment on the outcome of the meeting today. 'How do you deport a 15-year-old to Colombia? Without a passport, without anything?' Jakadrien was reported missing last year and her family initially thought she may have travelled to . New Orleans, according to the National Center for Missing Children. On the U.S. immigration department's website it states that it 'places a high priority on combating illegal immigration, including targeting illegal aliens with criminal records who pose a threat to public safety'. Chief Charles A McClelland Jr, of the Houston Police Department, released this statement: . 'On April 2, 2011, a female suspect was arrested by HPD officers for Class B misdemeanor theft. The female told the arresting officers she was a native of Colombia and that her name was Tika Lanay Cortez, born on March 24, 1990. 'Officers transported her to the HPD Southeast Jail where she was processed. Personnel fingerprinted her and followed procedure by processing her through the secure communities database to determine if she was wanted by immigration and custom enforcement [ICE] personnel. Dumped: Miss Turner, who speaks no Spanish, was left in the South American county with a work card after being removed from the U.S. under a mistaken identity . 'It provided no prior arrest history, . no wanted status or alternate identification for the prisoner. As is . customary, the prisoner was the transported to the Harris County Jail . and booked on a theft charge.' Colombia is the most violent nation in Latin America, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace last year. It is the world's largest producer of cocaine and around one third of citizens have been affected by armed conflict either through warring drug factions or long-running civil wars. During the first six months of 2011 it was estimated that 98,000 people had to flee their homes due to the armed conflict in the country. Colombia has the fourth largest economy in Latin America but there is huge inequality. Some 46 per cent of people live below the poverty line and 17 per cent in 'extreme poverty'. Impoverished: Almost half of Colombians live below the poverty line while last year it was voted the most dangerous country in Latin America .","Jakadrien Turner, 15, was arrested in Texas and gave police a fake name, claiming she was an illegal immigrant .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 12:47 PM on 4th January 2012 . A student nurse was left fighting for her life after being stabbed in a random attack as she boarded a bus after a night shift. Tanya Mitcham, 20, was on her way to visit her supervisor when Rebecca Jackson, also 20, plunged a kitchen knife into her victim's back at Leeds Central Coach Station. Jackson then walked through the city centre still clutching the 8in knife which was dripping with Miss Mitcham's blood. Leeds Central Coach Station where Rebecca Jackson stabbed Tanya Mitcham three times in an unprovoked attack . Speaking at Leeds Crown Court about the attack, Miss Mitcham said that at first she did not realise what had happened. She had to be treated at Leeds General Infirmary after being stabbed once in her left arm, severing an artery and a vein, and twice in her back, narrowly avoiding her spine. Miss Mitcham broke down while giving evidence and Judge Peter Collier adjourned the hearing for several minutes so that she could compose herself. 'I felt like someone was punching me. I was in that much shock over what was going on really. 'I touched my arm and I felt the blood. I started to scream. 'Everyone seemed to be staring at me when I was shouting to phone an ambulance. I didn't feel like anyone was going to help me. I started stumbling backwards.' Before the attack on April 18 2011, Jackson had been to Leeds General Infirmary at 9am to be treated for cuts to her head. She told a nurse that she wanted to kill her mother. Staff nurse Angie Stafford told the court: 'She said, ""It's not me, I need to harm my mum"". Then I asked her about it some more and she said ""I need to kill my mum"".' But before a mental health team could see to her, Jackson left the hospital heading to a shop where she stole the knife. Jackson had been to Leeds General Infirmary (pictured) just before the attack where she told staff she wanted to kill her mother . She then sent a text message to a friend which said 'Nicked a knife to kill the diff [sic]'. She was then seen at the bus station, acting strangely and aggressively before approaching Miss Mitcham and stabbing her from behind three times. Student support worker, Holly Pettit, witnessed the attack and gave first aid by applying pressure until paramedics arrive. She said: I heard a woman scream and I saw her take out a knife. Blood just spilled out onto the floor. 'I turned her round and there was a big gaping hole with lots of blood seeping out.' Miss Mitcham had to be resuscitated at Leeds General Infirmary and underwent surgery but has been left with scarring across her left shoulder, left arm and her back. Jackson then walked through Leeds city centre with blood on her hands. Karen Downend saw her drop the knife's packaging and went to give it back to her when she noticed the blade. She said: 'I thought ""she has a crazed look on her face"". She was waving it about. There was blood dripping as she was walking and I thought she had cut herself.' When Jackson was arrested she told police 'I thought I saw my mother so I stabbed her'. Jackson was charged with attempted murder but found to be not mentally fit to plead and flanked by four carers in the dock . After a one day trial, a jury took 30 minutes to return a verdict that Jackson had carried out the act and she was detained at a mental health hospital. It is expected she will be made the subject of a hospital order later today after the court has heard evidence from a psychiatrist.","Rebecca Jackson said she thought she was stabbing her mother in the attack .

Cameras were positioned on the black marble plaque which marks the spot where the teenager died in Well Hall Road, Eltham, south-east London, in 1993. Officers acted after passing motorists spat racial abuse at mourners who came to leave flowers on Tuesday after Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder. Under surveillance: The police van with cameras trained on the plaque in Well Hall Road, Eltham, south-east London, where Stephen died . The memorial is yards from Dobson’s home at the time of the murder in Phineas Pett Road. The rest of the gang were seen running away down Dickson Road after Stephen was stabbed. One visitor said: ‘It was really bad here . last night as emotion was running high and there were a lot of comments . shouted from cars. Victim: Stephen Lawrence who was stabbed to death in April 1993 . ‘The police van came down this morning and that’s seemed to stop it. The cameras on the top of it are probably the main deterrent, but you just don’t know what people will do.’ Dozens of bouquets were placed around the memorial – mostly by people who did not know the 18-year-old A-level student. One read: ‘The start of justice for the murder of an innocent young man. RIP Stephen.’ Another had written: ‘Two down. Three to go. Rest in peace.’ The plaque has been targeted three times in the 16 years since it was placed at the site of the stabbing. On one occasion it was chipped and it has also had paint and flammable liquids poured on it. A permanent camera has been installed on the other side of the road. Last month, father-of-three Paul Peters, 33, was cleared of racially aggravated criminal damage after dropping a bottle on to the plaque which smashed. Peters claimed he did not remember what happened because he was so drunk. Shrine: A gang of five or six men were at the scene as Stephen was knifed to death while he was with a friend .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 9:18 AM on 5th January 2012 . Estate agents will wax lyrical about even the most unassuming property – but this time, they really do have something to sing about. The country estate which inspired the classic hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful is up for sale. And the generations of children who have sung about ‘the purple-headed mountain’ and ‘the river running by’ have actually been giving the rather spectacular particulars of Llanwenarth House. Magnificent: The ivy-clad manor house in the Usk Valley near Abergavenny was the inspiration for the well-loved children's hymn . Stunning natural beauty: The 'purple-headed mountains' and 'river running by' refer to the beauty of the Usk Valley . Creatures great and small: Horses graze beside the river and drink from its calm waters . Cecil Alexander is believed to have written the lyrics while she was a guest at the 16th century manor, nestled in the Usk Valley in South Wales. The ‘purple-headed mountain’ in one verse of the 1848 hymn is thought to refer to  the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks, while ‘the river running by’ in the next line is the River Usk which winds along the valley floor close to the estate’s boundary. And the six acres of land it sits in would have offered plenty of space for the Irish poet to observe ‘each little flower that opens’ and ‘each little bird that sings’. These days, however, the £2.25million seven-bedroom manor is simply advertised as having ‘stunning views’, along with rather more modern additions of a high-ceilinged cinema room, ornamental raised Jacuzzi bath and remote-controlled mood lighting. The rooms in the manor house where Mrs Alexander stayed are bright and airy . Cecil Frances Alexander (nee  Humphreys) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns. She . was born in Dublin in 1818, and spent much of her later life in . Londonderry and Strabane with her husband, William Alexander, who became . Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. Mrs . Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 . published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most . popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, . Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away. The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities. She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry. The estate agent’s description of the former boutique hotel insists that ‘much of its character still remains’ but it ‘also embodies great comfort and ease of living’ in the village of Govilon, near Abergavenny. Still, when Mrs Alexander wrote her famous verses she could never have imagined the home’s selling points would one day include its proximity to top golf courses, Michelin-starred restaurants and the M4 motorway. It is also said to have an ‘exquisite interior’ and an ‘abundance of reception space’, and comes with Farrow and Ball décor, a detached coach house and an orchard. With some poetic licence of their own, the vendor even describes how ‘chandeliers reflect in gleaming white marble floors’ and boasts of ‘polished black granite work surfaces and gold inlay’. But Mrs Alexander, who also wrote Once in Royal David’s City, would no doubt be  comforted to know that the modernised house contains traditional wood panelling ‘in the style of Hampton Court’ and boasts ornate fireplaces. The poet, who died in 1895 at the age of 77, was married to the Anglican Archbishop of Armagh, and included All Things Bright and Beautiful in her bestselling Hymns for Little Children. The tome proved so popular that 69 editions were published in the 50 years after it was written. Irish poet Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander, who wrote the hymn, stayed at the Elizabethan manor house in 1848 . It has been claimed that the hymn was . also inspired by countryside near Dunster in Somerset, and the poetry . of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The words in turn influenced the . works of James Herriot, who used the ‘all creatures great and small’ line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the Yorkshire . Dales. A spokesman for Cardiff estate agent . Fine, which is marketing the property, said of its link to the famous . hymn: ‘Not many houses have such a selling point. ‘But it is easy to see why Mrs Alexander was so inspired. The scenery surrounding the house is magnificent.’",Irish poet was inspired by magnificent scenery surrounding South Wales mansion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:19 PM on 5th January 2012 . William Hague today called on Burma to release all political prisoners and hold fair by-elections - as he became the first British minister to visit the country in 56 years. The Foreign Secretary met President Thein Sein, who unexpectedly embarked on a series of liberalising measures after coming to office last year, and urged him to continue his reforms. Hague, who was pictured with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi this afternoon prior to their formal meeting tomorrow, also spoke with his Myanmar counterpart Wunna Maung Lwin. At that meeting, which came at the start of the two-day visit, he asked for 'concrete progress' in two other areas - that aid groups have more access to areas of conflict and steps are made to resolve ethnic violence. Friendship: William Hague met with Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party has been re-admitted back into the political process, at the British ambassador's residence in Yangon today . Discussions: William Hague (left) spoke with Myanmar President Thein Sein during a meeting at the president's residence in Naypyidaw today . Talks: William Hague (left) with his Myanmar counterpart Wunna Maung Lwin during a meeting in Naypyidaw today . And he said that if the pledge for reforms, which began last year with the handing of power to a civilian government, continued then it would lead Burma to have deeper economic and political ties with the West. Hague's visit is the first by a foreign minister from the former colonial power since 1955, before the military takeover in what was known as Burma in 1962. It was made possible by the handover of power last year to a civilian government - albeit one stuffed with former military men and backed by the army - and a series of political and economic reforms since then. Hague said of his meeting with the president: 'I emphasised the importance the British Government attaches to the reforms that the Burmese Government has undertaken in the last six months, and my sincere hope that there will be further progress in the weeks and months ahead. 'I made clear that the British Government expects to see the release of all political prisoners, credible by-elections in April, and a genuine alleviation of the suffering in ethnic areas, including through humanitarian access and peace talks. 'I spoke of the long-standing friendship that exists between our two peoples, one that can and should form the foundation of improved relations across the board between our two countries. Touch down: William Hague pictured on his arrival at Naypyidaw airport at the start of an historic visit to Myanmar . Greetings: William Hague is met by Myanmar Deputy Foreign Minister Myo Myint after arriving in Burma . 'I made clear that the British Government stands ready to respond positively to evidence of further progress towards that lasting improvement in human rights and political freedom that the people of Burma seek.' And of his meeting with Wunna Maung Lwin, he added: 'I have assured him that if they do (continue the reforms), there will be a strongly positive response from the UK and, I believe, the rest of the European Union. 'The foreign minister has reaffirmed commitments that have been made to release political prisoners. 'He said the changes are irreversible and I welcome that way of thinking. I stressed that the world will judge the government by its actions.' Hague later spoke with Thura Shwe Mann, the influential speaker of parliament and number three in the former junta. Shwe Mann then issued a statement acknowledging that not everyone was happy with the number of people released so far. He said: 'Our parliament will continue to work so everyone can participate for democracy and development.' Sustained political reform in Myanmar could pave the way for stiff economic sanctions to end and lead to Western investment in natural resources, including oil and gas and other sectors. Myanmar's neighbours in Asia, especially India, Thailand and China, are already rushing to tie up deals. Hague's trip follows one late last year by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised concrete support from Washington if Myanmar moved faster on political reforms and the release of political prisoners. Britain has maintained a tough stand on human rights issues in Myanmar but expressed guarded optimism after the release in October last year of 230 political prisoners. Just 12 political detainees were thought to have been freed this week among 900 prisoners released as an Independence Day gesture. As many as 600 may remain behind bars. Arrival: British Foreign Secretary William Hague is in Burma for two days of talks he hopes will end in all political prisoners being released . Sanctions: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with President Thein Sein in December last year . Hague is due to hold talks tomorrow with Oxford-educated pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The visit is a tricky balancing act . for Hague, who will face criticism at home if he is seen as appeasing . members of the former military regime slammed for its human rights . record and brutal suppression of dissent. Rights violations by the army are still reported from areas where it is fighting ethnic groups. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi today said Myanmar's government has approved her National League for Democracy to run in upcoming by-elections. Suu Kyi said in an interview at her residence that the party had been accepted. NLD spokesman Nyan Win also said the party will start accepting new members on Monday. Suu Kyi declined to say if she herself will stand in the election. The NLD boycotted general elections in 2010 because of restrictions. Among other things, it would have prevented Suu Kyi from running. Derek Tonkin, a prominent Myanmar analyst and former British diplomat, said: 'Hague can't appear to go soft. The Burma issue has become a political football at home and if he's not forthright, he will be criticised. 'But there's a feeling that we have been battering away at the Burmese for 22 years and not got anywhere. Britain is very much under the influence of the Americans.' He also noted that Britain's discouragement of trade, tourism and investment was far heavier than that of the EU in general. British firms in the energy and financial services sectors in particular are believed to be interested in Myanmar, but Hague's visit is likely to be little more than a testing of the waters before the EU holds its annual sanctions review in April. Mark Farmaner, director of the UK Burma Campaign, said: 'Hague could offer some small concessions but at the moment, he's there to deliver the message that lifting economic sanctions requires more genuine reforms. 'Britain will be very careful. There's broad support for engagement, but I don't think they'll move too fast.' Analysts said Hague could discuss inducements such as development aid or humanitarian assistance, which, if supported by Suu Kyi, would be more acceptable to activists at home. Suu Kyi has shown a willingness to compromise in recent months, notably by agreeing to run as a candidate in an April 1 by-election after letting her National League for Democracy (NLD) party re-enter the political process.","Foreign Secretary is first British politician to visit Burma in 56 years .

She touted herself as a 'consistent conservative' while playing up her win in the Iowa GOP's summer straw poll. But as the Iowa votes were tallied, it became evident that the so-called 'queen of rage' may be losing her step, as rumours swirled over whether or not she would continue. The caucus site was hardly unified. Mrs Bachmann needed more than hometown connections to pull back into contention. 'I feel sorry for her,' said Randy Herod, a retired business consultant. 'She's real nice, but this isn't her time.' That statement was echoed yesterday by former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who urged Mrs Bachmann to call it quits.

Ammaria Johnson, a first grade student at Hopkins Elementary School in Chesterfield County, Virginia, died after suffering the reaction on the first day back after the Christmas holidays. She complained about shortness of breath and had broken out in hives during a recess break on Monday before being treated by the school's nurse. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Ammaria Johnson, who 'loved school and her teachers' died after suffering an allergic reaction to peanuts on a recess break . Probe: Hopkins Elementary School in Chesterfield County, Virginia, is being investigated after the child's mother raised questions over Ammaria Johnson's treatment . The youngster then went into cardiac arrest, which her family said was caused by her coming into contact with a peanut product. Although it is not clear where or when Ammaria may have eaten a peanut-based product, her devastated mother said she tried to leave an Epipen with school staff in case of a reaction, but was told to keep it at home instead. The first grade student came into contact with a peanut product after a friend shared a snack with her on a recess break, according to the examiner.com. Laura Pendleton has since claimed the school did not follow their own allergy action plan in treating her seven-year-old daughter. Lt. Jason Elmore, a spokesman for the Chesterfield County Fire Department, said: 'From what we understand, she possibly had gotten something outside.' Chesterfield Schools spokesperson Shawn Smith said: 'At the beginning of the school year, we sent home a packet to the family, the understanding that there are certain students that have severe allergies.' Reaction: Ammaria Johnson came into contact with a peanut product and became short of breath at school before suffering a cardiac arrest . According to Chesterfield police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon, the initial investigation revealed that Ammaria died after she suffered an allergic reaction. Chesterfield County School policy apparently states that parents are supposed to provide the school medication for children with allergies. Public Health Nurse Supervisor for the Chesterfield County Health Department, Jody Enoch, said: 'Parents need to provide all necessary medication their child needs to the school. Devastated: Ammaria's mother, Laura Pendleton, has raised questions about how school staff responded to her daughter's severe reaction . 'That is the responsibility of the parent.' Her mother still has questions which she wants the school to address. She said: 'She has an allergy action plan at the school. They didn't do that.' Pendleton also wanted to know how her daughter got access to the peanut product. She added that her daughter 'loved school, she loved her teachers, she was compassionate, she cared about everybody.' Public Health Nurse Supervisor Jody Enoch said parents need to provide medication for their children in case of a reaction . Spokesman Shawn Smith added in a statement: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.  The school division will continue to provide additional services to support students and staff in this difficult time.' Ammaria Johnson's body will be released to her family today. School officials encouraged all parents to submit a list of their child's allergies that can be retained on file.","Ammaria Johnson suffered cardiac arrest on first day back after Christmas .

Traditional homes made of local stone blend into surrounding countryside and sit comfortably alongside the historic manor house, once the estate of the Horlicks drinks family. But the village’s well-heeled residents fear all that will change – thanks to a dramatically designed new house described by some as an ‘ugly cowshed’. Under construction: This contemporary home has labelled an eyesore by villagers in Cowley, Gloucestershire . Picturesque: Most of the buildings in Cowley, which has a population of around 350 and was once home to the estate of the Horlicks drinks family, are made from local stone . They fear the building, which in its . current partially built state has light-coloured walls and a shiny . metallic roof, will set a precedent that will permanently alter Cowley’s . character. The owner of the modern property – . who could not be contacted by the Mail yesterday – has been granted . planning permission, but residents say they were not made aware of . last-minute changes to the plans. Ray Goodwin, 78, a retired farm . manager who has lived in Cowley since 1971, said: ‘Most of the houses . around here are built of lovely Cotswold stone and all fit in. ‘It is so nice around here. But this . one looks like an ugly cowshed. It has a massive tin roof and it is . spoiling the view of many people around here. ‘It just does not look good at all. This is a traditional Cotswold village with a proud history. It used to . be home to the Horlicks family. ‘The planners should not let a home . like this be built in the first place. We’ve contacted the local council . about it and they said it’s not finished and we should wait until it’s . done before we say it doesn’t fit in with the village. ‘We just want the planning department to do its job properly.’ Cowley, near Cheltenham, has a population of around 350. Planning permission for the controversial new property was sought in 2002, originally for a studio and craft centre. In the dark: Villagers are furious that the modern property is being built when they were unaware of last-minute changes to the plans . Neighbour Ray Goodwin, 78, is one of many residents whose property overlooks the new-build, which he describes as an 'ugly cowshed' Consent was finally granted last year . after the designs were altered to include a bathroom and a bedroom, . turning it into a contemporary home. Edward Hollingworth, who has lived in the village since 1996, claimed residents had not been consulted about the development. He said: ‘When the original . application was made in 2002 it was for a studio and a craft centre, but . it’s just got bigger and bigger. ‘In 2010 the plans were changed so . the roof is flat rather than curved and an additional bedroom and a . bathroom were added and we weren’t notified. We’ve been to the planning . office and the files are a complete mess. ‘We are worried it could set a precedent and someone could come along and try to build another one.’ Cotswold District Council  defended . the development – stressing that all the correct procedures had been . followed in the planning process. A spokesman said: ‘While we . acknowledge that the contemporary design may not be to everyone’s taste, . we can confirm that all the appropriate processes have been followed in . regard to this planning permission. ‘Anyone who has queries is welcome to review the relevant reports sent to the planning committee and the delegated approvals.’",Residents of Cowley claim they were not shown changes to building plans .
"By . Fiona Macrae . Last updated at 3:49 PM on 4th January 2012 . Dozens of clinics have come forward to admit that breast implants they gave to women have ruptured – but Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has revealed much of the data filed is incomplete. He has . given clinics until Friday to submit full data on the implants and the . results will be published next week. But he . told BBC Breakfast today: 'Some of the private providers, as of yesterday, . had not provided any data at all, many had, some had provided what on . the face of it looks quite good data, others what appeared to be very . poor quality.' There is growing concern about the safety of the cheaply made implants, which used low-grade industrial silicone designed for mattresses . At least 50 clinics have reported . burst, perished and broken implants made by French firm PIP to the . medical watchdog since Friday. The . total number of women whose implants have ruptured is not known, but . even conservative estimates suggest it could be as high as 1,000. The Government still insists there is no need to remove them en masse. Yesterday, consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah, who is sitting on the panel investigating the implant scandal, said there were no firm figures in the UK on what proportion of devices have ruptured. The president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who is advising Mr Lansley, added: ‘The point is not so much the rupture rates but that the quality of the silicone in these implants is not of medical grade. Andrew Lansley, left has ordered clinics to produce data on the implants and Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, right, has criticised the cosmetic surgery industry for poor after-care 'when things go wrong' Surgeons can take out most breast implants in around an hour, going in through the original 5cm scar under the breast. All implants create scar tissue around them once inside - known as the scar capsule - and this can be removed at the same time as the implant. However, if an implant ruptures, scar tissue can build up to a greater degree, causing hardness, and can be more difficult to remove. While most women have no symptoms when a silicone breast implant ruptures, the leaking gel can cause pain and result in changes to the contour or shape of the breast. The gel may cause inflammation and the layers of extra scar tissue.Rupture of a breast implant can be confirmed by mammogram, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI. Douglas McGeorge, consultant plastic surgeon said if an implant ruptures the 'goo' must also be taken out. Operations of this type also carry the risks of anaesthetic and a small risk of infection. 'Recovery is also about two weeks - that is you should allow two weeks to get back to day to day activities,' he added. 'Therefore, the implants are not fit to be implanted into humans. They are substandard, they are defective. 'The Government must make sure that . women who have these implants are not caught in the middle of an . argument over who's going to pay for their removal. 'I think we have reached a point and . the level of anxiety is such that there should be clear advice over what . is the right course of action for women to take.' Nigel Mercer, a former president of . BAAPS, said: ‘It would be sensible for the Government to say, “Take them . out” and then sort out the funding later.’ Labour said that the public had been . ‘left in the dark’ and called for the £2.3billion private cosmetic . surgery industry, which carried out 95 per cent of the operations, to . take responsibility. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham . said: ‘I get a sense that these individuals are very good at the sales . pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at . after-care and facing up to responsibilities when things go wrong.’ But the trade body for private medical . clinics, Independent Healthcare Advisory Services, said it would be . ‘irresponsible’ to remove all implants as any surgery carries risks, . and, in any case, clinics couldn’t afford to foot the bill. It said that an audit of thousands of cases by its members suggests the true rupture rate lies between  1 per cent and 2 per cent and so is ‘within the industry standard’. As many as 50,000 women in the UK, including thousands of breast cancer survivors, have the fragile implants, so even a 2 per cent failure rate would take the number of ruptures to 1,000. French health minister Xavier Bertrand, pictured, has ordered a full investigation into the 'truly contaminated' implants . At the weekend, figures from private chain Transform suggested the true rupture rate to be 7 per cent. But a spokesman said the figure was based on seven cases out of just 108 patients – too small a sample for robust statistics. In France, between 5 per cent and 10 per cent have ruptured and the state is to fund removal from 30,000 women. Last night, French health minister Xavier Bertrand ordered a full investigation into the ‘truly contaminated’ implants.","Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has given .

"Twin birth rate rose by 76%  between 1980 and 2009 . Twins accounted for one in 53 babies in 1980 . Dramatic rise down to older mothers and fertility drugs . Twin births doubled among non-Hispanic white women . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:04 PM on 4th January 2012 . American parents are seeing double more than ever before with one in every 30 babies born as a twin. The twin birth rate in the United States rose by 76 percent in 2009 since 1980, when only one in 53 babies was a twin, according to a government report published today (Wednesday). Experts are attributing the astounding increase to older mothers and fertility treatments. Older mothers: Jennifer Lopez, 42, had her twins Max and Emme when she was 38-years-old . 'When people say it seems like you see more twins nowadays, they're right,'said Joyce Martin, an epidemiologist who co-authored the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Some increase was expected as more women are waiting until they are over 30 to have babies. For some unknown reason, mothers in their 30s are more likely to have twins than younger or older women. As much as a third of the increase can be attributed to that, Martin said. The rest of the rise is due to fertility drugs and treatments, experts said. 'You have a double whammy going on. There are more older moms and more widespread use of fertility-enhancing therapies,' Martin said. Starting in the early 1980s, couples who had trouble conceiving began to benefit from medical advances like fertility drugs and in vitro fertilization and other procedures. On the rise: This graph shows how the twin birth rate in the United States rose by 76 percent from 1980 to 2009 . These treatments became fairly widespread in the 1990s but are expensive, and availability and insurance coverage varies. The twin birth rate rose by more than two percent a year, on average, from 1980 through 2004. It leveled off to less than one percent annually although the rise from 2008 to 2009 was nearly two percent. In 2009, twin rates increased in all 50 states, though the jumps were highest in lower New England, New Jersey and Hawaii. In Connecticut, twins now account for nearly five percent of births, where nationally, 3.3 percent of all births were twins in 2009, up from two percent in 1980. • In 2009, 1 in every 30 babies born in the United States was a twin, compared with 1 in every 53 babies in 1980. • The twin birth rate rose 76 percent from 1980 through TO 2009, from 18.9 to 33.3 per 1,000 births. • If the rate of twin births had not changed since 1980, approximately 865,000 fewer twins would have been born over the last three decades. • Twinning rates rose by at least 50 percent in the vast majority of states and the District of Columbia. • Twin birth rates rose by nearly 100 percent among women aged 35–39 and more than 200 percent among women aged 40 and over. •The older age of women at childbirth in 2009 compared with 1980 accounts for one-third of the rise in twinning over the 30 years. Over the last three decades, rates rose for white, black and Hispanic women, but the increases were not uniform. Rates doubled for whites, rose by half for blacks and by about a third for Hispanics. Historically, black mothers have twins most often, but white mums have almost caught up. 'That's changed with infertility treatments,' said Barbara Luke, a Michigan State University expert on twin births. Twinning: The bar chart highlights the twin birth rate for different age groups with mothers over 40 have the highest number . Handful: Angelina Jolie had her twins Knox and Vivienne when she was 33-years-old . The greatest increase in twin rates was for women 40 and older. They . are more likely to use fertility treatments and to have two embryos . implanted during in vitro fertilization, whereas younger women are more . likely to get just one. About seven percent of all births for women 40 and older were twins, compared to five percent of women in their late 30s and two percent of women age 24 or younger. Older mums: This bar chart shows how more and more women are having children over the age of 30 . While a lot of attention is focused on the impact of fertility treatments, that's not the only factor. Before . fertility treatments existed, about 2.5 percent of the babies born to . women in their late 30s were twins, compared to under two percent for . younger and older women. Some research has suggested women in that age group are more likely to produce multiple eggs in a cycle, increasing their chances of twins. In 2009, twin rates increased in all 50 states, though the jumps were highest in lower New England, New Jersey and Hawaii . Break-down: The birth of twins among non-Hispanic white women has nearly doubled, as shown in the graph, over the last three decades . Clearly, there are more older mothers. In recent years, more than a third of all births are to women 30 and older, up from just one-fifth in 1980. Some experts say the trend is worrisome, noting that multiple births are more dangerous for the mother and their babies. The infants tend to be born earlier, smaller and weaker, and require much more care. But for some older women worried about conceiving, 'having twins is a blessing,' Luke added.","Twin birth rate rose by 76%  between 1980 and 2009 .

But stenographer Terlesa Cowart allegedly only had her transcript on an internal disc, then put it on her computer. Then a virus wiped everything. New trial: Randy Chaviano, 26, of Hialeah, Florida, was convicted by a Miami jury in July 2009 of shooting dead Carlos Acosta in September 2005 . ‘The overturning of a murder conviction always means terrible pain for the victim’s family,’ a Miami-Dade State Attorney’s spokesman said. He told the Miami Herald that it also causes ‘frustration for prosecutors and police’ - but this incident brings a ‘brand new level of pain and frustration’. Mr Acosta had come to Chaviano’s house to buy drugs and they got into a heated argument which saw him shot dead by the defendant. Chaviano then allegedly planted a gun on Mr Acosta’s body. His defence lawyer said this was only because he panicked after the killing. Hearing: The appeal was in the Third District Court of Appeal of Florida in Miami . But jurors still convicted Chaviano of second-degree murder with a weapon and armed drug dealing. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. 'Overturning a murder conviction because of a court reporter’s problem creates a brand new level of pain and frustration' Miami-Dade State Attorney’s spokesman . Chaviano’s lawyers claimed a medical examiner did not properly testify and there was little evidence to show where the shooting happened. ‘Hopefully, I will get to try it again,’ his defence lawyer Israel Encinosa told the Miami Herald. ‘I think I can win it this time.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:56 PM on 5th January 2012 . Smouldering embers blamed for a Christmas morning house fire that killed three girls and their grandparents had been taken out of a fireplace so the children would not worry about Santa Claus coming down the chimney, two officials briefed on the investigation said on Tuesday. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. Authorities say embers in a bag of discarded ashes started the blaze in Stamford that killed ten-year-old Lilly and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger and their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson. Devastating: Fire fighters were unable to save Madonna Badger's three girls and their grandparents from the flames at her home in Stamford, Connecticut . The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, escaped the fire along with a friend, Michael Borcina. Borcina and Badger were treated at a local hospital and released. Fire officials have said Borcina is believed to have placed the ashes in or outside an entryway, near the trash. A funeral service will be held on Thursday in New York City for the girls. The . victims died of smoke inhalation. Lomer Johnson also suffered a blunt . head and neck trauma, which resulted from a fall or being hit by an . object. One of the girls, found dead just inside . a window, had been placed on a pile of books, apparently so Johnson . could reach in and grab her after he jumped out. Instead, authorities . say, he fell through the roof. Stamford police are helping fire officials investigate the blaze. Victims: Lomer Johnson, 71, his wife Pauline, 69, and their three granddaughters, Grace, Lily and Sarah (all pictured right) perished in a fire on Christmas morning after fireplace embers caught the house (left) alight . Victims: Lomer and Pauline Johnson and their grandchildren, from left, Lily, Grace, Sarah and Morgan - who was not in the house - perished in the 5am fire . Last family photo: Matthew Badger with his daughters (left to right) Grace, Sarah and Lily, are pictured for the last time together in front of the Statue of Liberty, four days before the fire that claimed their lives . Survivors: Madonna Badger, left, and her boyfriend Michael Borcina, right, escaped the inferno at her home . Police said Monday officials want to know if there were smoke alarms, the status of renovation work in the house and whether the contractor had permits. The issue of permits could figure in the investigation because the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has said that neither Borcina nor his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was registered to perform home improvement work in Connecticut. Contractors are required to register with the state, though numerous building and other permits are issued by local officials. Gone: The house, which was built in the 1890s, has been entirely demolished . Pain: Firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respects outside the destroyed home in Stamford, Connecticut. Many of the fire fighters dispatched to the scene are undergoing counselling to deal with the horrifying memories . Fire: A neighbour was woken up in the early hours by screaming and saw the house was engulfed in flames . The agency said it did not yet have enough information about what work may have been done or completed and would not comment on whether it will investigate. Facebook messages have been left for Borcina. Repeated attempts to contact him by telephone since the fire have been unsuccessful. Stamford authorities deemed the house unsafe following the fire and ordered it torn down the day after the fire. Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.","Authorities say embers in a bag of discarded ashes started the blaze in Stamford, Connecticut .

"iRobot PackBot device named Scooby Doo used to detect disposed bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan . By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 11:35 AM on 4th January 2012 . A robot that successfully defused bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan was finally destroyed in a blast. The device named Scooby Doo, was an iRobot PackBot, which are 60-pound, treaded robots used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and bomb disposal. They have four cameras, an articulated arm with gripper, and flippers that allow them to go over obstacles such as stairs. The destroyed robot, pictured, was used by Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal units in Iraq . They were used extensively to dispose of domestic bombs during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the best tools for tackling IEDs (improvised explosive devices), which are the number one killer of soldiers there. The destroyed robot was used by Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal units in Iraq used to dispose of 17 IEDs, one car bomb, and one unexploded bomb. For every successful mission it completed, soldiers drew a hash mark on the device similar to the way fighter jets mark the number of enemies. But the robot failed to survive a recent mission when it was destroyed while being used to defuse an IED that exploded. Soldiers became attached to the robot that was used to help them detect disposed bombs . A repair technician said there was no way it could be fixed leaving soldiers feeling bereft. According to Gizmodo, EOD units have been known to assign their robots personalities and promote them to titles such as Staff Sargent, award them Purple Hearts, and even hold funerals for the destroyed devices that have assisted them on the frontline. The remains of the Scooby Doo robot are now on display at a museum in Bedford, Massachusetts alongside a plaque dedicated to it.",iRobot PackBot device named Scooby Doo used to detect disposed bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan .
"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 10:31 PM on 2nd January 2012 . Terrorist: Former BA computer expert Rajib Karim has lodged an official complaint that he is not allowed to use Skype to contact friends from prison . An islamic terrorist who plotted to blow up a passenger jet has complained that he is not allowed to use Skype to make low-cost phone calls from jail. Rajib Karim, 32, wants to use the system, which offers cheap international calls from phones as well as free video link-ups, to contact friends and family in Bangladesh. But officials at maximum security HMP Frankland in Durham barred the move saying it would pose a serious security risk. One source said: ‘This guy planned on killing hundreds of people. 'He is a former British Airways software engineer who knows a lot about computers and telecommunications. 'The last thing he should be given access to is a computer or method of free communication.’ Karim was jailed for 30 years last year after being found guilty of planning a 9/11-style terror attack with former Al Qaeda warlord Anwar al-Awlaki. The father-of-two claims using a prison payphone costs him too much money. In a letter written to Inside Time, a newspaper for prisoners, he said: 'The international call . rates cost a lot using the prison PIN system and the Skype option looked . like a perfect solution. 'The best part was that it was legal . and no breach of prison rules as the call was made to a direct number . and was not being redirected. 'But when I recently tried making my . first call I was told by staff here at HMP Frankland that I am not . allowed to make any calls through Skype.' He said he 'tried to explain' how . other prisons in the UK reportedly allow inmates to use the service, but said: ""The . response was a firm ""no"" as HMP Frankland is part of the high security . estate.' Karim's complaint has been passed on to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). He was imprisoned for 30 years last year . after Woolwich Crown Court heard he wanted to use his position at . British Airways to plant a bomb on a plane as part of a 'chilling' conspiracy with Anwar Al-Awlaki, a notorious radical preacher associated . with Al Qaeda. Home: Karim, who is held at HMP Frankland in Durham, claims using a prison payphone costs him too much money . Banned: Skype is a video and telephone system used by nearly 700million people worldwide that allows people to speak to each other for free . U.S.-born Al-Awlaki has previously . been linked to a number of high-profile terror plots, and was thought to . have inspired the 9/11 bombers. He was killed by a predator drone last . September. Among numerous plots to bring the . airline to its knees, Karim hoped he could exploit industrial action by . staff to become a cabin crew member and cause an explosion on a . U.S.-bound flight. He was found guilty of four counts of planning terrorism. Mr Justice Calvert-Smith recommended that Bangladesh-born Karim be automatically deported after he has completed his sentence. He told Karim: 'The offences were of the utmost gravity. 'You . are and were a committed jihadist who understood his duty to his . religion involves fighting and, God-willing, dying and then being . rewarded in the afterlife.' Skype is a video and telephone system used by nearly 700million people worldwide that allows people to speak to each other for free. It also lets users speak face-to-face via an online video conferencing facility. Users can also buy a personalised phone number giving them very cheap calls - charged at local rates - to anywhere in the world. In October you had a Star Letter in the Mailbag pages which was a very useful piece of information.

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 11:25 PM on 4th January 2012 . The wife of Switzerland’s top banker is enmeshed in insider trading rumours after it was revealed she benefited from a massive currency deal three weeks before her husband moved to protect the Swiss franc for the first time in thirty years. Philipp Hildebrand, president of the Swiss National Bank, is also accused of making money out of his decision to cap the value of the franc against the US dollar. Weltwoche magazine said that the SNB President had personally given the orders on currencies and said it had seen his bank statements in which he reaped a 75,000 franc profit in October after purchasing $504,000 in August. Investigation: Kashya and Philipp Hildebrand both face scrutiny . 'It's a classic foreign exchange speculation,' said Weltwoche editor Philipp Gut. 'The only option for Mr Hildebrand is to step down.' Hildebrand faces scrutiny over the currency trading deal in which his wife profited from the central bank's decision to depress the value of the franc. His wife Kashya bought half a million US dollars in August and sold them two months later earning her 61,000 francs or $65,000. Former hedge fund employee Mrs. Hildebrand said she bought 'almost ridiculously cheap' dollars in August to run her art gallery in the centre of Zurich. 'My interest in the dollar purchase was motivated by the fact that it was at a record low and almost ridiculously cheap,' she said, adding that she felt 'comfortable' with the transaction. Philipp Hildebrand, president of the Swiss National Bank, pictured is accused of making money out of his decision to cap the value of the franc against the US dollar . Mrs Hildebrand’s trades came about three weeks before the Swiss National Bank rattled currency markets by imposing a ceiling on the franc for the first time in three decades. In addition, Bank Sarasin, a Basel-based private bank, said it fired an employee who passed data on the trades to Christoph Blocher, vice president of the Swiss People’s Party, who last year called on Philipp Hildebrand to resign after the SNB’s currency transactions led to a record loss. While Kashya Hildebrand argued that her purchase was business-related, the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported that the money for the dollars came from the sale of a holiday home in Gstaad. Silvia Oppliger, a spokeswoman at the SNB in Zurich, declined to comment. The central bank wouldn’t say whether Philipp Hildebrand will give a statement. Kashya Hildebrand was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, to a Pakistani father and an American mother. At the age of four, she moved to the U.S. and later worked for hedge fund Moore Capital Management in New York, where she met her future husband. After moving to Switzerland she focused on the art business, opening galleries in Zurich, New York and Geneva. The couple has one daughter and live in Zurich. The Swiss central bank amassed a record loss of $21bn in 2010 through foreign-currency actions aimed to fight deflation and help exporters.","Philipp Hildebrand, president of the .

The mother of the suspected LA arsonist is facing deportation over claims she failed to pay for a breast enlargement operation in her native Germany. Harry Burkhart, 24, was arrested on suspicion of starting more than 50 fires in the Hollywood area and has now been charged with dozens of counts of arson. He is suspected to have started his arson spree after seeing his mother dragged off by State Department officials. Yesterday his mother Dorothee Burkhart, who is in her 50s, appeared in court charged with 19 counts of fraud in Frankfurt, some of them allegedly carried out 'as a member of gang'. She claimed her son was 'mentally ill', and produced a letter from a Canadian doctor which appeared to support this, suggesting that he is autistic and suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Burkhart is currently on suicide watch in police custody. It emerged today that he is suspected of being responsible for a fire at a house in Germany owned by his family. Detained: Harry Burkhart, left, has been arrested at a time when his mother Dorothee faces deportation. The picture on the right was posted on an advert linked to a phone number believed to belong to her . Taken in: The suspect's arrest was a measure of relief to anxious residents who had grown fearful after several nights of seemingly random blazes .

Online: This picture comes from an advert for an erotic masseuse, also linked to Mrs Burkhart . Ad: This page links to a website believed to be registered to Ms Burkhart . Ms Burkhart appears to own an erotic . massage business, and has been linked to websites offering the services . of 'Goddess Annabelle' in the Hollywood area. The sites describe their owner as a 'sexologist', but emphasise that her massages are not to be confused with prostitution. The potential deportation of Ms . Burkhart, who is said not to have a valid visa, is thought to be . connected to her pony-tailed son's alleged rampage through Los Angeles. In a brief court appearance, where . she was accused of crimes including avoiding payment for her breast . augmentation surgery, she appeared perplexed, wondering aloud if her son . was dead. 'Where is my son? What did you do to my son?' she asked the judge. Harry Burkhart was being held without bail after being arrested in the arson case on Monday. According to a police officer, Mr Burkhart erupted into an anti-American rant at a recent immigration hearing for his mother. More: Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters extinguish cars on fire in a carport in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles earlier this week as the spate of arson attacks reached its fifth night . Attacks: The arsonist set 12 new fires early on Monday morning, in North Hollywood, California .

But Shlomo Elady, a hair stylist who . regularly trimmed Burkhart's long hair, recalled someone who spoke three . languages, dreamed of visiting Jerusalem and cared for a sickly mother . who had trouble walking. Mr Elady said he was stunned that the . man who lived with his mother above his Sunset Boulevard shop is . suspected of torching vehicles, some just steps from his home. The fires . caused an estimated $3million in damage. 'He loved his mom, the way every son loves his mom,' Mr Elady said. 'He's not a creepy guy.' Mr Burkhart was described by Los . Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca as ‘the most dangerous arsonist’ he . could remember in the area, after more than 50 fires caused $3million in . damage.

The . onslaught of fires left residents on edge over the weekend in some of . the city’s most densely populated areas. Hundreds of investigators, . police officers and firemen dealt with the blazes. Police conducted extra patrols all weekend, and the noise of helicopters and sirens persisted virtually nonstop in Hollywood. The . blazes forced many apartment dwellers from their homes. But there were . no serious injuries - one fireman was hurt in a fall from a ladder, and . another person suffered smoke inhalation.

Shervin Lalezary,  a reserve sheriff's deputy who works for $1 a year, was billed as a 'true hero' by Sheriff Baca. The Beverly Hills real estate lawyer spotted Burkhart's Dodge Caravan in the early hours of Monday morning. He qualified to ride a patrol car solo last month and had back-up from LAPD officers when he went up to the van. One of . the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim . Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27. It was listed for . nearly $1.2million earlier this year. He . used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s . and it was the inspiration for the Doors' song ‘Love Street’. Despite . the arrest, authorities continued to urge vigilance. ‘We're . not resting, and we're not stopping’ the extra patrols, Police . Commander Andrew Smith said on Monday. ’If you have lights in your carport area, . keep them on tonight.’ Other deliberate fires were reported in Hollywood on Thursday and . two people were arrested.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:56 PM on 5th January 2012 . Hakim Berkani leaves his employment tribunal in London, where he claimed he was unfairly sacked as a parking attendant by NSL because he refused to issue large numbers of tickets . A parking warden with a conscience was sacked for refusing to issue large numbers of tickets to 'extract as much cash as possible' from motorists, a tribunal heard. Hakim Berkani, 45, claims that fellow wardens referred to their company as 'Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves' and that there was 'severe pressure' to issue more than 10 parking tickets per shift. Mr Berkani, who worked for Kensington and Chelsea Council's parking firm NSL, claims top-performing wardens were rewarded with 'plenty of favours in return.' Bosses even cited one colleague as an 'excellent example' for issuing 35 tickets, known as PCNs (Penalty Charge Notice) in a single shift, and manager said it was 'good revenue for the Council and that everyone should generate the same revenue as him.' Mr Berkani, of Wandsworth, south London, was sacked in February last year following more than three years' service after tipping off a driver who was about to be given a ticket by another warden. NSL contract manager Paul Boxali told him in a letter: 'You informed the owner of the car that a PCN was being issued with apparent disregard for the safety and well-being of the issuing enforcement officer.' However, Mr Berkani told a Central London Employment Tribunal: 'It soon became clear that it was commonly accepted amongst my work colleagues that the whole operation of Civil Parking Enforcement in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was dishonest and mainly designed to extract as much cash as possible, via both fair means or foul, from the motoring public. 'I have seen during the course of my employment...things which I would never imagined could exist in a modern country like England, which I have always understood and believed upheld and applied the law in a fair, open and even handed manner.' He claims he saw two female colleagues reduced to tears after being berated by the management for not bringing back a sufficient number of PCNs. He quickly came under 'severe pressure' to issue a minimum of 10 PCNs per shift, he claims, but was informed that 'ten PCN's per shift was a poor performance but was considered just about acceptable.'' He said: 'We were always told that double figures, i.e. 10 or more PCNs, was the minimum number that we should be aiming for on every shift.' Later on, he said, it became 'common knowledge' that if they issued at a rate below 0.9 PCNs per hour that NSL would fire you.' A traffic warden for Kensington & Chelsea council (above), where Mr Berkani (not pictured here) had worked for more than three years when he was sacked . Even this reduced target was 'impossible to achieve in an entirely legal and honest manner' he said. In December 2009, he came across an email from Emma Collins, a top NSL manager, stating: 'There are still a significant number of people issuing at a rate of below 0.9 per hour...We should not be uncomfortable about using the disciplinary process.' He said: 'It seems that all NSL managers' primary aim is to make sure that a particular number of PCNs are issued and they don't really care just how the targets are hit. 'I really did not agree with these highly dodgy practices of issuing parking tickets while bypassing rules and regulations.' Chelsea resident Alasdair Seton-Marsden, a former marketing director, has studied law so that he can represent Mr Berkani at the hearing. A wealth of Chelsea residents and shop owners have also written statements to the tribunal in his support. The Reverend Canon David Reindorp, of Chelsea Old Church, wrote: 'Mr Berkani was courteous and tactful and took enormous trouble to do his job...I always thought he was an object lesson in how to do a tricky job well...I was delighted to see him giving traffic wardens a good name.' While Vincent Saladin, sales manager at Le Pascalou Food and Drink on Fulham Road, said: 'Thanks to Mr Berkani we have experienced some changes. 'All our customers suffer a lot less stress knowing that they have a 'timed' right to load their shopping without risking a fine.' Mr Berkani is claiming unfair dismissal and interim relief for being a trade union representative. The company denies the claims. Nabil Hanafi, NSL spokesman said: 'NSL cannot comment on the specifics of this particular case which is being heard at an Employment Tribunal. 'We instruct all of our Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs) to issue tickets according to clear rules and regulations. Neither NSL nor our officers have any incentive, financial or otherwise, linked to the issue of penalty charge notices and we are very strictly regulated to ensure any tickets issued are legitimate. 'Our staff perform an important public service, keeping the streets clear, traffic flowing and ensuring that all drivers have fair access to parking spaces.'","Hakim Berkani claiming unfair dismissal after he tipped off driver who was about to be ticketed .

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 5th January 2012 . Sir Terry Pratchett is a prominent backers of assisted suicide . Anyone given 12 months or less to live should have the legal right to ask a doctor to help them kill themselves in as easy and painless a manner as possible, an influential report said yesterday. It said that to avoid unnecessary suffering, there should be a right to choose to die, but that it should be limited to those who have the mental capacity to express a wish to end their life and have been diagnosed with a terminal illness by two doctors. Among a string of safeguards, it proposed a minimum two-week period in which the dying man or woman would be given time to change their mind. Anyone physically unable to take the . prescribed deadly drugs by themselves would be ruled out, to avoid the . potential for abuse of the vulnerable by malevolent relatives or . friends. The report by the . Commission on Assisted Dying, led by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord . Falconer, stopped short of recommending euthanasia of the kind practised . by the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. However Lord Falconer told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'I don't think you can ever have a system that is completely water tight. 'We therefore looked at the current system where there is no check on whether or not you are really terminally ill. 'You can go to Dignitas without having a second check.' The . commission was set up in 2010 amid the growing controversy over the . deaths at Dignitas and the erosion of the 50-year-old law on assisted . suicide which sets down a maximum 14-year jail sentence for anyone who . ‘aids or abets’ the death of another. It followed new rules set down by Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer, which effectively free people from the threat of criminal charges if they help the suicide of somebody who is desperately ill out of compassion and without thought for their own gain. But right-to-life groups said the report was fixed in favour of calling for legalised assisted suicide. They pointed out that it was financed by author Sir Terry Pratchett and businessman Bernard Lewis, both prominent backers of assisted suicide. The report recommended a string of safeguards, it proposed a minimum two-week period in which the dying man or woman would be given time to change their mind . Lord Falconer, who chose the other ten members of the commission, himself led an attempt to bring in an assisted dying Bill in the Lords three years ago. The 415-page report states: ‘A dying person who met the legal criteria would be able to ask a doctor to prescribe them a dose of medication that would end their life.’ The report set out in detail how a system of assisted dying would work. An individual would have to have been diagnosed by a doctor as having a terminal illness likely to kill them within a year. They would require the capacity to express the choice to die for themselves. A second doctor would have to approve the first doctor’s diagnosis and both would have to speak to the patient to make sure the decision to die was firm and was not made under pressure from others. The two-doctor system is similar to the process developed to allow legalised abortion in 1967, and which has been in use as numbers of abortions in England have risen to nearly 200,000 a year. The report recommended that if either doctor was suspicious, then an independent assessment should be carried out by a nurse, care worker or social worker. A doctor should collect the poison from a pharmacist and supervise the death. But the patient, the report said, should take the poison him or herself, preferably by mouth. A disabled patient might be allowed to use an automated syringe machine, it added. The report also said that ‘the provision of high-quality end-of-life care must be a priority for the Government, independent of the issue of assisted dying’. But Richard Hawkes, of disability charity Scope, said he had ‘little confidence’ in the commission’s ‘over-simple’ safeguards, which he said drew ‘an arbitrary line between people with a terminal illness and people with long-term impairments’. He added: ‘In reality the lines between the two can often be blurred, making this distinction unworkable.’ Dr Peter Saunders of the Care Not Killing campaign group dismissed the commission as a ‘sham’, adding: ‘This investigation was unnecessary, biased and lacking in transparency and its report is seriously flawed. ‘Those with a differing view, including representatives from the major disability rights organisations and doctors’ groups, were not invited to join the commission.’ But Sarah Wootton of Dignity In Dying said: ‘Opponents to a change in the law will continue to attack any efforts to find a solution to the unbearable suffering which continues daily in the absence of a compassionate assisted dying law, but they themselves cannot suggest an alternative.’","Report said the right to die should be limited to those who have mental capacity to express their wish .

"By . Peter Simpson . Last updated at 4:19 PM on 4th January 2012 . China has drastically slashed the number of 'trashy' entertainment programmes shown on TV. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) claims two-thirds of programming classified as crass and deemed to pollute the minds of the masses have been axed from country’s 34 satellite channels. The airings of 'vulgar' game and talent shows, dating competitions and soap operas containing 'excessive entertainment' have plummeted from 126 a week to just 38, according to the country's strict broadcasting watchdog. 'Crass': Annual talent show 'Super Girl', which unearthed Chinese star Li Yuchun, was axed by the country's authorities last September . 'Low taste' talk shows and Jeremy Kyle-styled chat formats featuring real life stories of emotional upheaval and daily strife have also been banned or heavily restricted. In there place during the 7.30-10pm primetime viewing slot are strictly-government approved programmes - including extra state-sanctioned news and current affairs items. 'Satellite channels have started to broadcast programmes that promote traditional virtues and socialist core values,' watchdog officials said in a statement. The regulator ordered the initiative in October and the announcement of is swift success follows this week's warning from President Hu Jintao that Western culture was out to attack and divide China. The new rules to slash the popular shows became law from January 1. Popular: The Chinese TV talent show Super Girl attracted 400million viewers before it was cancelled last year . Each of the country's 34 satellite channels is now only permitted to show two entertainment programmes per week. And only 90 minutes of 'entertainment content' is allowed every day from 7.30 to 10p.m. Hugely popular dating shows such as If You Are The One, and soap operas are still allowed to be shown – but only during weekend primetime. A popular annual talent show Super Girl - inspired by the UK’s Pop Idol - was axed by government officials last September. The programme was watched by 400 million who were glued to their TV sets for three hours watching women of all ages compete in a singing contest. Vulgar: Chinese authorities believe programmes such as dating show 'If You Are The One' encourage materialism among the young . Officials said the show  'poisoned the country’s youth' and was 'too long'. But it was widely believed the high ratings and democratic overtones during the viewers’ vote for their favourite candidate spooked the Communist-run Government. Since Beijing partly opened the TV market to more competition, scores of new satellite stations have flourished. Most have proved more popular with their cheaply made programmes than state-run TV channels that spend millions on lavish period dramas, many of which are loaded with government propaganda. In his article published in the ruling Communist Party’s member’s magazine 'Seeking the Truth', President Hu warned against hostile Western forces trying to split and divide China via a policy of cultural genocide. He called on his government to promote its own red culture both domestically and overseas.","Number of 'crass' entertainment shows on Chinese TV plummets from 126 a week to 38 .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 4:42 PM on 6th January 2012 . Joseph Kennedy III, the grandson of the late U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy, has announced that he is considering taking a run for Congress. The 31-year-old said last night that he is resigning as a prosecutor at the Middlesex District Attorney's office in Boston, Massachusetts, as he explores a possible candidacy. His last day there will be in two weeks. A political future? Joseph Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert Kennedy, has announced that he is considering taking a run for Congress . Should Joseph Kennedy III decide to run for Congress, he will be actively partaking in a political dynasty that many believe is cursed by tragic misfortune. Most famously, of course, was the assassination of his great-uncle President John F Kennedy in 1963. His grandfather Robert Kennedy also fell victim to an assassin's bullet in 1968. The following year Ted Kennedy survived the Chappaquiddick scandal, in which a . car he was driving drove off a bridge and killed passenger Mary Jo . Kopechne. William Kennedy Smith, son of Jean Kennedy Smith, became famous for . a well-publicised 1991 rape trial in Palm Beach, in which he was . acquitted. John F Kennedy Jr was killed when he crashed his plane in July 1999. Bobby Kennedy's son Michael - Joseph III's uncle - died when he skied into a tree in 1997. In a statement, Mr Kennedy said: 'My decision to look seriously at . elected office is grounded in a deep commitment to public service and my . experience - both my own and that of my family - in finding just, . practical, and bipartisan solutions to difficult challenge.' Kennedy, the son of former Democratic Congressman Joseph Kennedy II, said he will . make a final decision about entering the race after he has time to talk . with potential constituents about issues. As a potential candidate representing . the Fourth District of Massachusetts, he would be vying for the post held by Barney Frank . since 1980. Senator Frank, a Democrat, announced his retirement in late November. Mr Kennedy would be the latest of many Kennedys to seek public office, although no member of the famous political family is in office at the moment. Family business: Joseph Kennedy III embraces his father, former Massachusetts Rep Joseph Kennedy II, in January 2010 . His grandfather was Robert Kennedy, who . served as U.S. Attorney General and as a U.S. Senator from New York. He . was assassinated in 1968. His great-uncles were the late U.S. President John F Kennedy and the late Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts. His father founded the non-profit Citizens Energy Corp in 1979 and later served as a U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts for 12 years. The Kennedy family has seen its . influence in Washington fade in recent years as its younger generations . have largely shunned public office. The death of Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2009 left a void for the family. The retirement of his son Rep Patrick Kennedy . of Rhode Island last year marked the first time in 63 years that there . was not a Kennedy serving in elected office in Washington. His exit marked a bittersweet turn for one of America's most . powerful and prominent political families. Brothers: John F Kennedy (left), Robert Kennedy (centre) and Ted Kennedy all served in Washington . Politics was the family . business, the lifeblood of a dynasty that often dominated the public . stage with its triumphs, as well as its personal traumas. JFK arrived as a young congressman in 1947, later capturing the . White House and leaving an outsized stamp on the nation's history. First . Lady Jackie was equally memorable. Robert Kennedy's presidential ambitions were snuffed out by an assassin's bullet, but he inspired generations of activists. Edward Kennedy was seen as one of the most influential senators in U.S. history. Bobby Shriver is currently the lone family member in politics, serving as a city . councillor in the seaside Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica.","Joseph Kennedy III looks set to enter family business .

Joran Van der Sloot’s long-awaited murder trial was today delayed for five days after the Dutch citizen said he wasn’t yet ready to plead over the killing of a Peruvian woman he met in a casino. The 24-year-old defendant allegedly killed Stephany Flores, 21, who was a top poker player and the daughter of a wealthy businessman, in his hotel room in Lima, Peru, in May 2010. Van der Sloot rose to fame when he became the prime suspect in the unsolved 2005 killing on the Dutch Caribbean island Aruba of U.S. citizen Natalee Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama. Scroll down for video . Court hearing: Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, centre, enters the courtroom in the Lurigancho prison in Lima, Peru, on Friday.

If convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison, Van der Sloot would be eligible for parole after serving 10 years.

Other case: Van der Sloot, was also arrested but never charged in the 2005 disappearance on the Dutch Caribbean island Aruba of 18-year-old Alabama native Natalee Holloway, pictured . Peruvian police said Ms Flores, the daughter of a circus promoter and former race car driver, was robbed and killed on May 30 in 2010, exactly five years after Ms Holloway disappeared. The murder probe brought renewed . attention to the case of Natalee Holloway, who vanished during a high school . graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot was living. He was arrested twice in the case but never charged due to a lack of evidence. Her family has criticised Dutch authorities for not making more . progress in the case. They met at the Atlantic Casino in Lima and CCTV videos show the two playing at the same table, then leaving, police said. They went to his hotel to play poker, he told authorities after the incident. While they were playing, his computer received an instant message on his links to the Holloway case. Van Der Sloot said Ms Flores then struck him, and he became enraged and strangled her. That same day, he was charged in Alabama with trying to extort the Holloway family in return for disclosing where Ms Holloway's body was.

"By . Liz Hull . Last updated at 10:33 PM on 6th January 2012 . A ‘despicable’ thief stole a retired banker’s bicycle as he was drowning in a canal. Michael Houghton, 51, was face down in the water when Adam Lowther, 22, came along the towpath. Instead of rescuing the unconscious father of three or calling for help, Lowther picked up his mountain bike and rode off on it. As Michael Houghton (left) lay dying in the Leeds-Liverpool canal, Adam Lowther (right) stole his bike, later selling it for just £20 . The thief told police he assumed Mr . Houghton was already dead. In fact, he was still alive and might have . been saved had Lowther alerted emergency services. Mr Houghton was eventually pulled from the canal in Leeds by two passers-by, but he died in hospital three days later. Jobless Lowther, meanwhile, sold the . bike for £20. He was arrested on suspicion of murder, but never charged, . and served four months in jail after admitting theft. Detective Inspector Martin Hepworth, . of West Yorkshire police, told an inquest into Mr Houghton’s death: ‘Had . there been an offence for not being a Good Samaritan, as there is in . France, I would have charged Lowther with that, but there is not. ‘It isn’t just a matter of being public spirited, it’s a matter of public duty.’ Coroner David Hinchliff criticised Lowther for failing to get help. ‘The fact that he didn’t shows what a . thoroughly cowardly and despicable young man he is in contrast with the . two that did,’ he said. ‘What makes this all the more . unpleasant and callous was that he was perfectly prepared to steal a . cycle while leaving someone in the water.’ The Leeds court heard on Thursday . that Mr Houghton was on his daily cycle ride from his home in Horsforth . to Leeds city centre along the Kirkstall stretch of the Leeds-Liverpool . canal when he fell off on July 29 last year. Michael Houghton died after falling into a stretch of the Leeds-Liverpool canal near Kirkstall . He landed in the water, which was only 3ft deep, possibly banging his head on a boulder. Fellow cyclist Lowther was the first . person to find Mr Houghton, shortly after 6.30pm. He discarded his own . bicycle, which had a puncture, in bushes and pedalled away on the dying . man’s Apollo Vortice mountain bike. At 6.50pm, cyclist James Atkinson and . jogger William Bentall pulled Mr Houghton from the water and gave him . first aid until paramedics arrived. He was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary and placed on life support, but died three days later on August 2. A post-mortem examination revealed . that Mr Houghton, who retired at 49 to care for his sick wife, Angela, . died of brain damage caused by drowning. Police traced Lowther after he gave his details to a pawnbroker’s shop, where he sold the bike  for £20. Initially he claimed he had not seen Mr Houghton in the water, but later said he thought he was already dead. An Apollo Vortice mountain bike like the one Adam Lowther stole from Michael Houghton as he drowned . Lowther said: ‘I picked up this bike and was just about to get on it and noticed in the canal a dead body. ‘I was shocked so I rode off. All I did was take the bike.’ He claimed that his mobile phone had run out of battery and admitted he did not try to alert the authorities. Addressing Mr Houghton’s distraught family, who wept as the details of his final moments were revealed, Lowther said: ‘I’m really sorry for your loss. I didn’t mean it. I made a stupid mistake.’ Recording an open verdict, Mr Hinchliff said: ‘What leaves a nasty taste in everybody’s mouth is that an opportunistic thief came along, saw [Mr Houghton] in the water, believed he was dead, and choosing to do nothing, saw an opportunity to steal his cycle.’ Mr Houghton’s family were too upset to comment after the hearing.Lowther was charged with theft and jailed for four months at Leeds Magistrates’ Court in November last year. He has finished serving his sentence.","Adam Lowther said he thought Michael Houghton was already dead so didn't try to help him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 6th January 2012 . The Air Force charged three of its cadets with sexual misconduct on Thursday, including one accused of rape, just over a week after the government revealed a rise in reports of sexual assault at military academies. The three cadets all attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but were involved in separate incidents over the past 15 months, the military said. Cadet Robert Evenson Jr, who faced the most serious accusations, was charged with rape, unlawful sex acts, engaging in an unprofessional relationship and conduct unbecoming an officer. Serious charges: AFA cadet Stephan Claxton (pictured) faces sexual assault and underage drinking charges. Two other cadets face allegations . Evenson has three charges against him . for allegedly raping a female cadet on one occasion and engaging in . forced sex acts on other occasions, in all three instances using 'power . or strength or restraint' to prevent escape. The alleged crimes are especially egregious as he was one of the cadets who ran the honour system, which, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette, ‘punishes those who lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate comrades who break the rules.’ The maximum punishment for such a violation is expulsion from the prestigious academy. Cadet Kyle Cressy, a senior, was accused of aggravated sexual assault on a woman while she was ‘substantially incapacitated.’ Riddled with problems: Two other AFA cadets are charged with sexual assault and one with rape . Cadet Stephan Claxton was accused of unbuttoning and unzipping a female cadet's pants while she was incapacitated, the charging sheet said. He was also accused of underage . drinking, abusive sexual contact and several instances of assault, which . included an accusation he punched another cadet in the face. 'Sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the Air Force. We expect the best from our cadets, and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours.' -Colonel Tamra Rank . Colonel Tamra Rank, the Air Force Academy’s vice superintendent said in a statement: ‘The fact that the charges in all three cases are being referred at this time is due to the near simultaneous completion of each individual investigation.’ She added: 'Sexual misconduct is a particularly egregious offense and we have a zero tolerance policy in the Air Force. ‘We expect the best from our cadets, and do not tolerate unacceptable behaviours.' The charges came after the Department of Defence said last week that attacks at the three main military academies – Annapolis, West Point, and the Air Force Academy – rose sharply to 65 in the last academic year from 41 previously. Incriminating reports: A week ago, the U.S. military acknowledged a spike in sexual assault reports at military academies . In September, the U.S. Government Accountability Office had said the military needed greater leadership and oversight to prevent sexual harassment in its ranks. Col Tamra Rank of the Air Force Academy says there is a zero tolerance policy for sexual misconduct . Col Rank said that while the three Colorado cases were separate, the men were charged simultaneously because investigations in their cases were recently completed. The military did not reveal the ages of the men charged, nor were the women identified although some of them were described as female cadets. The charges were not the first instance of sexual misconduct accusations involving cadets. In 2003, reports surfaced that dozens of female Air Force Academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets for a decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints. The fallout from that led to a shake-up in the academy's administration following hearings before Congress. According to the Gazette, rape can bring the same punishment as murder under military law, though there’s only a sliver of a possibility the death penalty would be administered. Famous: The Air Force Academy's renowned chapel at sunset . The next step in the three latest cases is an Article 32 hearing, which is the military equivalent of a civilian grand jury, the Air Force said. The accusations against the cadets are deemed by the military as 'preferred charges,' and the hearing will determine which if any charges are finally levelled against them and whether to move forward with court martial proceedings, Air Force Academy spokesman Lieutenant Colonel John Bryan told Reuters. All three cases will be dealt with separately, Col Rank said, and are expected to begin later this month or early in February.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 1:31 PM on 6th January 2012 . Large parts of Midwestern America are suffering the worst dearth of snow in decades as the U.S. 'Winterless Wonderland' costs the country's tourism industry tens of millions of dollars. In Northeast states like Maine and New Hampshire, natural snow has either melted or been washed away, as ski resort bosses count the cost of a barren December. The two states are among a number which are normally completely buried at this time of year, but the distinctly brown Christmas has left the outlook bleak for winter recreation enthusiasts. Dry season: Man made snow covers a ski run at Shawnee Peak ski area in Bridgton, Maine, one of several facilities to suffer from the barren December . Elsewhere Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York, all places which are normally buried in feet of snow at this time of year, had the third-lightest snowfall on record between October and December. Nationwide, the lack of snow is costing tens of millions of dollars in winter recreation, restaurant, lodging and sporting goods sales, experts said. 'It's Mother Nature. She's playing tricks on us, or something. Now it's getting nerve-racking,' said Terry Hill, whose cash flow is nonexistent because her rental cabins are empty at Shin Pond Village, north of Maine's Baxter State Park, normally alive this time of year with the buzz of snowmobiles. Early in the winter, the Southwest saw some heavy snow, as did parts of the Northeast clobbered around Halloween and Thanksgiving by snow that has since melted. The Pacific Northwest has seen snow recently. And longer-range forecasts predict above-normal or normal snow amounts for much of the country's northern half for the rest of the season. Many economic losses can be made up, said Charles Colgan, an economist at the University of Southern Maine's Muskie Institute of Public Service. But that's of little comfort right now in the Northeast, where businesses that depend on winter recreation usually see heaps of snow around the Christmas and New Year holidays as a bonus and it's critical to have snow by Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, about a week from now. As of Thursday, only 19 percent of the nation was covered in snow, less than half the average snow cover over the past five years on the same date, according to the National Weather Service's National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center in Minnesota. The Shawnee Peak ski area in Bridgton, Maine, along with similar ski resorts in New Hampshire and New England, have been the ones worst affected by the lack of snow . On Friday, the forecast calls for the Northeast to thaw out from its first big cold spell. It'll be in the 50s and sunny in Reno, Nev., a place that normally sees snow by now. In the Midwest, where the temperature hit the 40s Thursday, the warm weather has turned frozen ponds and backyard rinks to slush, sending ice skaters indoors. 'There's no place that has reliable ice. You're skating on Jell-O. You try to shoot the puck. It goes a little ways and it gets stuck in a puddle,' said Barbara Garn, who has seen a big uptick in the number of participants in pickup hockey games she organizes at indoor rinks in Minnesota's Twin Cities region. A graphic from the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center shows the anticipated snowfall in northeastern U.S. states over the next few days . Tom Buker, a pilot with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said he flew over southern Minnesota on Thursday and saw lots of open water and ice that's too dangerous for fishing. 'There was no snow — zero,' he said. 'I was at 2,000 feet; my temperature gauge was reading 62 degrees. That's more like April weather than January weather.' Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, N.Y., normally buried in feet of snow by now, had the third-lightest snowfall on record from October through December. Reno recorded its driest December in history, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University in New York. While some resorts have suffered due to lack of snow, similar facilities across Europe have been forced to close due to have too much of it. Ski resorts across Austria and Switzerland say they are now struggling to cope after metres of snow combined with high winds and stormy conditions over the past 48 hours left runs blocked or in danger of avalanches. Changeable temperatures combined with high winds and new snow has put many ski resorts across Tirol, Salzburg and Vorarlberg on high avalanche alert. Temperatures are expected to drop dramatically over the weekend and winds today (Friday) have already reached over 170 kph making conditions even more treacherous. Avalanche experts are working around the clock to assess the risks and where necessary and possible are carrying out controlled detonations. Rudi Mair, manager of the avalanche action team in Tirol said: 'With winds peaking at 170 kph we can safely talk about a hurricane. 'Heavy new snow, freezing temperatures and the hurricane we are talking about high risk. The avalanche risk across Tirol is high and it will rise.' 'It's been 128 years since Reno didn't have snow in December,' said Scott Hickey, owner of a retail golf shop in Reno. 'Not only have we not had snow, but it's been mild so you can play golf.' He said he thinks snow will arrive in time to satisfy skiers. And what's good for skiers, he added, will be good for golfers in the end. 'We need the snow to water the golf courses,' he said. The ski industry is also having a tough time in New England. Ski resorts have a core of skiers and boarders who are season ticket holders or have slope-side condos. Those folks are going to go ski because they've invested; what's lacking are the thousands of additional skiers — the weekend warriors — who are less likely to spend their dollars unless conditions are great. In Maine, up to 100 people would be skiing on 12 miles of trails on a good day at Carter's Cross-Country Ski Center, but the center has yet to open because there's no snow on the ground. Worse, with no snow, no one is buying skiing gear from the store, said manager Jesse Hill. It's discouraging, he said, given high hopes that accompanied the early snowfall in October and November. 'It was just a big tease,' he said. Fresh snow, said Matt Siekman, a skier from Portland, plays a psychological factor in motivating 'weekend warriors.' He admits to a bit of angst. 'It's mostly anxiety, but I try to remember it's going to happen,' he said. 'It's just a matter of time.' In New Hampshire, there's no snow to slow down Republicans as they zoom across the state to make their last push before next week's primary vote. But the lack of snow means the state is missing its snowy backdrop as bundled-up journalists provide the latest political reports. And candidates have been unable to plunk campaign signs down in snow drifts to provide a showy backdrop for public appearances. 'It's an iconic part of the primary,' said Dean Spiliotes, political science professor at Southern New Hampshire University. 'It's part of the ambiance — the mill shots in Manchester, the snow-covered town squares, watching candidates shuffle through the snow.'","New Hampshire, Maine and New England see much less snow cover .

A ‘chronically obese’ bus driver is suing his bosses for £75,000 after injuring his back when his chair collapsed during a tea-break. Robert Young claimed to have suffered ‘whiplash-style’ injuries when the combined table and chair unit ‘shot backwards’, throwing him and a colleague on to the concrete floor. The driver launched a legal action against Lothian Buses, claiming the incident had left him feeling suicidal. The 54-year-old also claimed to have suffered chronic back pain after the incident, requiring painkilling steroid injections and physiotherapy. But lawyers for Lothian Buses rubbished Mr Young’s allegations. They claimed he was already suffering from back pain before the fall and disputed that the injuries necessitated his long absences from work. They said he already had a poor attendance record before the incident. The accident happened at a Lothian Buses depot canteen on May 6, 2010. After his fall, Mr Young did not work for two months. He returned on July 19, 2010 but only stayed for four days, taking sick leave from July 23 until October 4. The driver, from Prestonpans, East Lothian, then ‘worked normally without reporting difficulties and built up to full shifts’. Lothian Buses’ lawyers claimed Mr Young had other health issues that were not related to the supposed injuries suffered from the fall. They said he was ‘chronically obese and a non-insulin dependent diabetic’. Lothian buses' lawyers said Mr Young had health issues that were not related to the supposed injuries suffered from the fall . In court documents, Mr Young’s legal representatives claimed that the fall had left him with psychological problems. They said he now suffered from ‘occasional suicidal ideation’, depression, low moods and difficulty with concentrating. As well as the whiplash-style spinal injury, the lawyers said he suffered soft tissue damage to his left elbow and right thigh. Mr Young confirmed the case was ‘on-going’ yesterday but refused to comment on the details of his compensation claim. Ian Craig, managing director of Lothian Buses, said: ‘It is our policy not to comment on legal matters.’ It is unclear if Mr Young is still employed by Lothian Buses. Lothian Buses is the largest provider of bus services in Edinburgh. The company is the only publicly owned transport operator in Scotland, the City of Edinburgh Council being the main shareholder. It employs more than 1,000 people and has a fleet of almost 650 buses – including 30 that provide open-top tours of Edinburgh. Lothian Buses is the largest provider of bus services in Edinburgh and the only publicly owned transport operator in Scotland . Mr Young’s compensation case is one of a number of claims launched against the bus operator recently. George . Fyall, 62, fractured his finger and injured his foot when a bus driver . ‘slammed on the brakes’ and threw him to the floor as he was leaving the . bus on the North Bridge in Edinburgh on November 19, 2010. Mr Fyall, of Kirkcaldy in Fife, subsequently launched a claim for negligence, seeking £50,000 in damages. His lawyers said he was on the top deck and, as he walked to the front of the bus to climb down the stairs, the driver, William Brown, braked suddenly, throwing Mr Fyall to the floor. Lothian Buses has admitted liability. In November last year, the bus company was forced to pay compensation to a Chinese university student who broke her pelvis, arm and collarbone after being hit by a bus while cycling. Dongmin Yan sued for £500,000 after spending six months in hospital due to the severity of her injuries. The 38-year-old University of Edinburgh student, who now lives in Gorgie, was hit by the bus at Crewe Toll roundabout. Firemen had to free her after she was dragged underneath the bus and her lungs collapsed. Lothian Buses settled for an undisclosed fee.","Driver launched a legal action against Lothian Buses, claiming the incident had left him feeling suicidal .

Barack Obama vowed today to maintain the best-equipped military in history, despite dramatic defence cuts which top Pentagon leaders admit will increase the risks to the U.S. 'Our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority,' Mr Obama said in a rare appearance in the Pentagon briefing room. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and several top military brass lined up on the stage behind him, underscoring Pentagon support for cuts that Mr Panetta and others said they know will be criticised as too drastic. The strategy will ditch traditional 'Cold War-era systems' and concentrate instead on unmanned drones and electronic cyberwarfare. Both ways: U.S. President Obama vowed to strengthen military presence in the Asia-Pacific region despite fiscal constraints that expect to cut $662 billion from the country's defense budget next year . Mr Obama said the emerging strategy . overhaul is designed to contend with hundreds of billions of dollars in . budget cuts and refocus the United States' national security priorities . after a decade dominated by the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and . Iraq. The strategy, devised through a . comprehensive review by civilian and military leaders, centered on the . military the country needs after the 'long wars of the last decade are . over,' Mr Obama said. The cuts may make it impossible for the U.S. to wage two full-scale wars at the same time, as they have done in recent years. Mr Panetta said that smaller military . budgets will mean some tradeoffs and that the U.S. will take on 'some . level of additional but acceptable risk.' But Mr Panetta said that at this point . in history, in a changing world, the Pentagon would have been forced to . make a strategy shift anyway. He says the money crisis merely forced the government's hand. More cuts: While the U.S. is said to take on some additional risk due to its planned defense budget cuts, an additional $500 billion in cuts may be required in January of 2013 . The president announced that the . military will be reshaped over time with an emphasis on countering . terrorism, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, protecting the U.S. homeland, and 'deterring and defeating aggression by any potential . adversary.' Those are not new military missions, and Mr Obama announced no new capabilities or defence initiatives. He described a U.S. force that will . retain much of its recent focus, with the exception of fighting a . large-scale, prolonged conflict like the newly ended Iraq mission or the . ongoing war in Afghanistan. 'As we end today's wars and reshape . our armed forces, we will ensure that our military is agile, flexible . and ready for the full range of contingencies,' the president wrote in a . preamble to the new strategy, entitled, 'Sustaining U.S. Global . Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.' The strategy hints at a reduced U.S. military presence in Europe, notwithstanding a continuing close . relationship with NATO, and says Asia will be a bigger priority. It also emphasises improving U.S. capabilities in the areas of cyberwarfare and missile defence. Mr Obama said: 'We’ll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces. 'We’ll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities we need for the future.' Inevitable: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the change to the defense budget and handling was inevitable and that the money crisis merely forced the government's hand . Mr Obama's decision to announce the . strategy himself underscores the political dimension of Washington's . debate over defence cuts. The administration says smaller . Pentagon budgets are a must but will not come at the cost of sapping the . strength of a military in transition, even as it gets smaller. In a presidential election year, the strategy gives Mr Obama a rhetorical tool to defend his Pentagon budget-cutting choices. Republican contenders for the White . House already have criticised him on a wide range of national security . issues, including missile defence, Iran and planned reductions in ground . forces. Mr Obama also wants the new strategy . to represent a pivotal point in his stewardship of defence policy, which . has been burdened throughout his presidency by the wars he inherited . and the drag these conflicts have placed on military resources. Difference: Next year's defense budget is planned to be $43 billion less than congress gave the Pentagon last year . The new strategy moves the U.S. further from its longstanding goal of being able to successfully fight . two major regional wars — like the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraqi forces . from Kuwait or a theoretical ground war in Korea — at the same time. The document released Thursday made . clear that while some current missions of the military will be . curtailed, none will be scrapped entirely. 'Wholesale divestment of the . capability to conduct any mission would be unwise, based on historical . and projected uses of U.S. military forces and our inability to predict . the future,' the document said. The administration and Congress . already are slashing projected defence spending to reflect the closeout . of the Iraq war and the drawdown in Afghanistan. The $662billion defence . budget planned for next year is $27billion less than Mr Obama wanted . and $43 billion less than Congress gave the Pentagon this year. The Pentagon announced no specifics on . the size of expected troop reductions; the Army and Marine Corps . already are set to shrink beginning in 2015. The document said the Pentagon will . have to find savings in pay and health care benefits for members of the . military, but it offered no specifics. Mr Panetta in recent months had . previewed the main themes of the strategy by emphasizing a need to . continue pressuring al-Qaida and paying more attention to Asian security . challenges, including China and North Korea. Factors guiding the Mr Obama administration's approach to reducing the defense budget are not limited to war-fighting strategy. They also include judgments about how to contain the growing cost of military pay and health and retirement benefits. The administration is expected to form . a commission to study the issue of retirement benefits, possibly led by . a prominent retired military officer. The administration is in the final . stages of deciding specific cuts in the 2013 budget, which Mr Obama will . submit to Congress next month. The strategy to be announced by Mr . Panetta and U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs . of Staff, is meant to accommodate about $489billion in defense cuts . over the coming 10 years, as called for in a budget deal with Congress . last summer. An additional $500billion in cuts may be required starting in January 2013. A prominent theme of the Pentagon's . new strategy is what Mr Panetta has called a renewed commitment to . security in the Asia-Pacific region. The administration is not anticipating . military conflict in Asia, but Mr Panetta believes the U.S. got so . bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 that it missed chances to . improve its strategic position in other regions. China is a particular worry because of its economic dynamism and rapid defense buildup. A more immediate concern is Iran, not . only for its threats to disrupt the flow of international oil but also . for its nuclear ambitions.","New strategy to focus on drones and cyberwarfare .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Last updated at 12:02 PM on 5th January 2012 . Thousands more women may be at risk after it emerged that suspect PIP breast implants were repackaged and sold under a second name. Industry experts estimate that some 5,000 British women have Rofil M-implants, described as simply being PIPs with a different branding. Last night, plastic surgeons and patients said it was vital that women know that it is not just the PIP name that is suspect. Fresh fears: The PIP breast implants at the centre of a safety storm were also repackaged and sold under a different name . One woman told how she believed she had breast cancer after a gel that leaked from a split M-implant left her in excruciating pain and created a lump the size of a golf ball. The warning came as Health Secretary . Andrew Lansley said he would consider setting up a national register for . breast implants and called on private clinics to pay for any PIP . implants that have leaked to be removed. The Government, however, still . refuses to advise mass removal. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he would consider setting up a national register for breast implants . Yesterday, as the medical watchdog continued to collect data on rupture rates, the Nuffield Health chain pledged to follow Mr Lansley’s advice. And, in a slightly unusual move, an Austrian clinic offered to remove all PIP implants from British women willing to pay to fly to Vienna. Until now, the implant scandal was widely thought to be limited to those made by Poly Implant Protheses in France and filled with a gel believed to have been made for mattresses. But industry experts believe that while some 45,000 British women have PIP implants, thousands more may have them without realising. A Dutch implant manufacturer called Rofil is believed to have had a long-standing agreement to buy implants from PIP. They were then rebranded as M-implants but the contents remained the same. While they were not sold to British clinics, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons says many UK women would have had them implanted when they travelled abroad to countries such as Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic for cut-price operations. Some 20,000 women a year go abroad for cosmetic surgery and breast enlargements are particularly popular. The Dutch healthcare inspectorate banned the sale of both PIP and M-implants in the spring of 2010. 'Golf ball size swelling': Jo Tooley feared she had cancer - but instead the implant had ruptured . Rofil has gone bankrupt and could not be contacted for comment. But Bernard Murphy, an investigative journalist who has been probing the implant scandal for two years believes some M-implants are still on sale. Mr Murphy, of the Clinica Medtech Intelligence medical news service, says there are reports of the implants being used in Estonia as little as two months ago. Simon Withey, a plastic surgeon advising the Government on the scandal, said that any advice about PIPs must also be extended to M-implants. Mr Withey, a BAAPS member, said: ‘Those with M-implants should also seek advice. I would suggest they do not seek advice from the surgeon who put them in because I suspect they are probably not going to give the best advice.’ Concern about PIP implants flared at the weekend when figures suggested a 7 per cent rupture rate for Britain. Mr Lansley ordered a review of the data amid speculation he would order mass removal of the implants, which were among the cheapest on the market. The industry’s own investigation has since claimed the figure to be much lower, at 1 to 2 per cent, and so ‘within the industry standard’. An expert panel of surgeons, officials and statisticians met with Mr Lansley yesterday. Their recommendation is expected tomorrow, the deadline for clinics to submit their data. BAAPS says the implants are not fit to be in the human body and so should be removed, whatever the rupture rate.","45,000 women have PIP implants - but thousands more may have them under a different name .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:31 AM on 6th January 2012 . Police investigating the murder-suicide that left four dead in a wealthy suburb are looking at whether the New Year's Day shooting could have been motivated by jealousy. John Robert Reeves, 25, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head after murdering three others with him - fellow Navy pilot David Reis, 25, his sister Karen Reis, 24, and Matthew Saturley, 31. The four dead were found in Coronado, California, after authorities responded to a report of gunfire shortly after 2am on Sunday. Officials say they do not know the motive for the killing, but are investigating the possibility that Reeves had romantic feelings for, or a relationship with, Ms Reis. Alleged killer: Police are investigating the suggestion that John Robert Reeves was motivated by jealousy . Dead: David Reis, 25, right in left photo, his sister Karen Reis, 24, left in left, and Matthew Saturley, 31, right, were all killed on Sunday in Coronado, California . 'We are looking into all aspects, including the possibility there was . some type of relationship between Karen Reis and John Reeves but that . has not been confirmed yet,' said sheriff's captain Duncan Fraser. 'That is one reason why we are . still soliciting information from the public who may know about this.' Authorities are also awaiting toxicology results to see if drugs or alcohol might have played a role. Mr Fraser cautioned that investigators might never determine the motive . because there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting. He said the suggestion that Reeves was jealous of the attention being paid to Ms Reis by Mr Saturley was only speculation. A passerby called police on his mobile phone after hearing shots being fired at this address in Coronado in San Diego Bay at 2.20am. Retired Naval pilot Steve Diamond said the case was shocking because it involved such high achievers. 'The first thing that most people think of even within the Navy community is how could such an enormously tragic thing happen involving people who are the cream of the crop, highly trained, highly educated, national assets basically,' he said. It takes years of training to get one's wings as a Navy pilot, and fighter-jet pilots are considered to be among the top in that group. They undergo a battery of rigorous physical, psychological and background tests before finishing the highly competitive program. Their top-notch skills and mental toughness were featured in the film Top Gun. 'It's still a shocker,' said Rebecca . Bailey, 26, who played college volleyball with Karen and later coached . with her at a high school and club programme. 'This kind of thing doesn't . happen to people like her and David. Their family is the family . everybody wants to be a part of. They're just so loving, and there's so . much love in their family.' Confirmed dead: Tom Reis said on Monday that his son David, left, and daughter Karen, right, were confirmed as victims by the Navy . A SWAT team sent in a robot to the first floor of the building before searching the second and third floors. The bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the three-storey building . The siblings' father Tom Reis . didn't know who else was at the condo in the seaside community where . his son had been living. 'He just had his first F/A-18 flight,' Mr Reis . said. 'Oh man, he loved it.' David Reis held a mechanical . engineering degree from the University of New Mexico. Karen Reis . graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2009. She . stayed in the area, coaching volleyball and working at a grocery store. 'She has a really great spirit and knows how to make things fun,' Ms . Bailey said. A passer-by called police on his . mobile phone after hearing shots being fired outside the San Diego Bay . condo in Coronado, California, at 2.20am on Sunday morning. The first officers arrived within . four minutes and found a dead man in the doorway to the three-story . condo and the bodies of two men and a woman inside in different parts of . the structure. 'This is Coronado, for heaven’s sake. The biggest thing that happens here is a kid rides his bike on . the sidewalk' Don Hubbard, 85 . 'They checked and he had no . obvious signs of life,’ Sheriff's Lieutenant Larry Nesbit said. ‘They . tried to make contact with anyone else that might be inside the building . and they got no response.’ A SWAT team then sent in a robot . to the first floor and later searched the second and third floors. The . bodies of two men and a woman were discovered in different parts of the . three-storey building. It was not immediately clear how . the four people died. However, authorities previously said they did not . believe there were any outstanding suspects. Asked if it was a murder-suicide, . he said: 'I'll let it infer what it does. We're not going to say that. Although it's very early in the investigation, we don't believe there . are any outstanding suspects.' Family photo: David, far left, and Karen Reis, next left, are pictured in a photo after what appears to be their sister's graduation . Close: The killings took place just a few blocks from the famous Hotel del Coronado (pictured), where it was long speculated that the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VIII, visited and met Spencer Simpson . Neighbour Don Hubbard said he was . awakened by the shots that he thought were fired by New Year's revellers. He went back to sleep, but two hours later got a phone call and heard . SWAT teams swarming the area. Hubbard, a retired Navy commander, . said he saw the body of one man in the condo doorway and recognized him . as his neighbour — a Navy pilot receiving training at Miramar. 'The amount of crime happening in Coronado is absolutely unacceptable. This is supposed to be a quaint little village where people come to sleep, not to party' Jerry Toci . 'I knew these guys were pilots . because I was one and we'd talk about airplanes,' Hubbard said. 'Even . now, you say, how could this have happened? What the hell is going on . here?' Officers from the Naval Criminal . Investigative Service (NCIS) were called to the scene of Sunday's . shootings in case any of the victims were military personnel. Mr Hubbard confirmed two victims were Navy pilots training at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. NCIS is the federal law . enforcement agency which conducts investigations of offences - . punishable by imprisonment of more than a year - affecting the Navy and . Marine Corps. NCIS spokesman Ed Buice said its investigators were participating in the probe, which was being led by the Sheriff's Department. Famed: Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe in the 1959 film 'Some Like It Hot'. The Hotel Del Coronado can be seen in the background . ‘This is very shocking,’ neighbour . Julie Lisne told 10 News. ‘We think we live in such a safe little town - . so it's always shocking and sad.’ Coronado, where 24,000 people . live, is home to Naval Air Station North Island where several aircraft . carriers are based and is a haven for Navy pensioners. Murders are . extremely rare in the area. However in July last year the area . made national headlines when the naked girlfriend of a millionaire was . found hanged in his Coronado mansion. The Coronado area was rocked last year by an apparent suicide at a millionaire’s mansion when his lover allegedly hanged herself. Rebecca Zahau, 32, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, in July, two days after his son Max, 6, was fatally hurt from a fall off the stairs while she was looking after him. Her family believed she did not commit suicide but police were not convinced to reopen the case following the results of a second autopsy that was discussed on the TV show Dr Phil. Police sources said Rebecca Zahau, . 32, killed herself two days after her boyfriend's six-year-old son was . fatally injured while in her care (see box). ‘This is Coronado, for heaven’s . sake,’ local man and retired naval officer Don Hubbard, 85, told Sign On . San Diego. ‘The biggest thing that happens here is a kid rides his bike . on the sidewalk.’ The condo where the bodies were . found sits a few blocks from the famed Hotel del Coronado and a block . from the main street, which is lined with boutiques and restaurants. Eleven U.S. presidents have . visited the hotel beginning with Benjamin Harrison in 1891 - just three . years after the beachfront resort was built. In 1920 the Prince of Wales, later . to become King Edward VIII, visited and it has long been speculated . that it was at the hotel that he first met Coronada divorcee Wallis . Spencer Simpson. It was 16 years later that he gave up the throne to . marry her. The hotel is also where a banquet . was hosted to honour aviator Charles Lindbergh after he crossed the .

Only once all political prisoners are released and free and fair elections have been held will sanctions against Burma be lifted, according to the British Foreign Secretary. Rounding off a two-day visit to the country, William Hague said he welcomed recent reforms but warned that they were not enough for the sanctions to be eased. He spoke after meeting Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon and said: 'What we’ve seen so far is not sufficient, there are still political prisoners. Tea for two: William Hague met with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma where the two agreed that more needed to be done in order for sanctions to be lifted . Afternoon stroll: William Hague walked around the grounds of Aung San Suu Kyi's home, where she was once under house arrest, after talks about the future of Burma . 'It is important that we don’t relax the pressure prematurely and are clear on what we want the government here to do for us to change our policies. 'Much more needs to be done and it is vital that the remaining political prisoners be released. It's not possible to say a country is fair and democratic while people are still in prison on the grounds of their political beliefs. 'It is vital for them to be released if restrictive EU measures are to be removed. Suu Kyi widely agreed with Hague, who has laid down four conditions for the easing of sanctions, during their historic meeting in her home where she was once placed under house arrest. Hague wants to see the release of hundreds of political detainees, an end to human rights abuses by the army, an effort to resolve ethnic conflicts and the holding of free and fair elections. She said: 'All political prisoners should be released and there should be all efforts made to put an end to all ethnic conflict within our country. Certainly we would want to see free and fair by-elections.' Friendship: Aung San Suu Kyi talks to the media as William Hague looks on, during his two-day visit to Burma . Friendship: William Hague pictured meeting informally with Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday on the first day of his trip . The news conference was held on the lawn of Suu Kyi's lakeside home, where she spent years under house arrest until her release days after a general election in November 2010. The pair strolled around the grounds after their talks. Hague added: 'I hope we're at a stage where we can say a long-held dream now has a chance of being realised, but there's so much work to be done. 'The long darkness in which the people of this country have lived may be coming to an end.' Hague is the first foreign minister from the former colonial power to visit Myanmar since 1955. The army seized power in a 1962 coup. The new civilian administration quickly embarked on political and economic reforms last year, to the surprise of many, given the number of former junta officials in its ranks. Other developed countries are cautiously seeking to engage with Myanmar's new rulers. They are keen to improve living conditions in the country but also to let their companies invest in its rich natural resources, which are already being exploited by Asian countries such as China, Thailand and India. Discussions: William Hague (left) spoke with Myanmar President Thein Sein during a meeting at the president's residence in Naypyidaw yesterday . Talks: William Hague (left) with his Myanmar counterpart Wunna Maung Lwin during a meeting in Naypyidaw yesterday . Two Yangon-based sources said today that Myanmar had awarded 10 onshore oil and gas blocks to eight firms in its biggest energy tender in years and was offering nine offshore blocks. The winning firms were mostly from Asia, the sources, with direct knowledge of the deals, said. Hague is in a tricky situation, wanting to encourage the reformers led by President Thein Sein but liable to face criticism at home if he seems to be cosying up to former junta members, including Thein Sein, still pulling the strings. He said: 'I think they're sincere, particularly the president. The risk of how foreign governments engage with this is that we assume it's all done and forget that this is only part way through. 'We must not relax our efforts prematurely. That's the risk we must guard against.' Suu Kyi, the daughter of the leader of the campaign for independence from Britain, is important because of her influence at home and abroad. Analysts and diplomats say that if she withdrew her long-standing support for sanctions, that would make it easier for Britain and others to scale down the embargoes. A British diplomat said: 'She's crucial to driving this process. She has a lot of sway.' Suu Kyi has recently shown a willingness to compromise and plans to run for parliament in by-elections on April 1. The new government may be happy to see her there: Suu Kyi and her party will give the assembly more legitimacy but it will still be controlled by an army-dominated party plus military representatives who have a quarter of the seats. Touch down: William Hague pictured on his arrival at Naypyidaw airport yesterday at the start of an historic visit to Burma . Greetings: William Hague is met by Myanmar Deputy Foreign Minister Myo Myint after arriving in Burma yesterday . The authorities formally registered her National League for Democracy (NLD) as an authorised party yesterday. Parliamentary speaker Thura Shwe Mann, a powerful member of the former junta, made it clear to Hague he wanted Suu Kyi on board. He said laws had been amended to allow the NLD to contest the by-elections, which would be fair, according to prepared comments seen by Reuters news agency. Hague met him and other members of the former junta now running the nominally civilian administration in the capital, Naypyitaw, yesterday, urging them to release all remaining political prisoners and ensure the by-elections were fair. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a landmark visit to Myanmar late last year, seeking the same reforms and offering similar concessions. And yesterday, the European Union said it planned to open a representative office in the main city, Yangon. Britain expressed guarded optimism after the release of 230 political prisoners last October but as many as 600 may remain behind bars. About 900 prisoners were freed as an Independence Day gesture this week but only 22 political detainees were among them, according to the latest estimate by NLD official Naing Naing.

But one weary father has not only helped stop them – he’s making £60,000 a year in the process. Matthew Nifield, 33, invented a phone app to send his twin daughters to sleep after he found certain sounds made them nod off. Land of nod: Gwyneth (right) can barely stifle a yawn as she and twin sister Madeleine listen to the app created by father Matthew . App-y dad: Matthew with his popular White Noise Ambience app, displayed on an iPad . The computer whizz created the White Noise Ambience app for iPads and iPhones and it is has been downloaded by exhausted parents all over the world. It has proved so popular he's now making £60,000 a year. The 33-year-old was having sleepless nights because one-year-old daughters Madeleine and Gwyneth would rarely fall asleep together. But he noticed that some relaxing sounds would start them yawning and they would soon doze off. Matthew started recording the gentle sounds of waves crashing, . rain falling onto a car roof and even a cat purring. And whenever the twins were wide awake he would play one of the sounds to send them off. Matthew said: 'I looked on the iPhone app store for something to help them doze off but couldn’t find anything. So I created my own app called White Noise Ambience. Daddy's sleepy girls: Matthew noticed some relaxing sounds would start his girls yawning and they would soon doze off . 'It worked for my girls and now the app is available online - lots of tired parents are downloading it.' Matthew, of Cardiff, South Wales, recorded 150 different sounds and . tried them out on his little girls, who were just six months old at the . time. He said: 'The girls’ favourite is waves crashing, there is something very peaceful about that. 'But personally I like rain on a car - I normally drop off myself within about 10 minutes of that.' Other . sounds on the app are, a steam train, frogs croaking in a rainforest, . and even the sounds of a sprinkler, tumble drier and lawnmower. The app is so popular in America that Matthew is now living in California where he is designing other internet products. He said: 'It is earning me around £5,000-a-month.

A tip-toeing intruder has been dubbed the world's bravest (or most stupid) burglar - after he broke into Mike Tyson's hotel room as the ex-boxer was sleeping. The raider fled the suite at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas after Iron Mike, infamous for biting off an opponent's ear in a bout, woke to the sound of rustling. It was a lucky escape for the thief, who could have been on the end of Tyson's powerful right hook had the heavyweight been fully alert. Nothing was taken in the break-in and security at the resort, where top suites cost up to $1,500 per night, has now been stepped up. Knock-out Hollywood actor Tyson, who floored a burglar as he played himself in The Hangover film after his tiger was stolen, was staying at the hotel with his family on New Year's Eve after attending a Stevie Wonder concert. The TMZ website reported: 'We're told Tyson was sleeping like a baby when all of a sudden, he awoke to rustling sounds and saw a flashlight. 'But by the time Iron Mike realized what was happening, the intruder had already run out of the room.' A hotel spokesman added: 'We have received a report of an incident that is currently under investigation. As always, guest safety is of the utmost importance.' The run-in with the sleepy pugilistic pigeon-fancier, who raises the racing variety of the bird in his spare time, should be considered a lucky escape.

The former boxing champion, 45, was jailed for three years in 1992 for raping a beauty pageant contestant in Indianapolis. Several years later, he spent three months in jail for beating up two men after a minor car crash in suburban Washington. He also bit a piece out of Evander Holyfield's ear during a bout, and once threatened to eat the children of heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. His life was also touched by tragedy in 2009 when his four-year-old daughter Exodus died after an accident in her Phoenix home. Down for the count: Mike Tyson (left) became the youngest heavyweight champion when he beat Trevor Berbick (right) in 1986 . She was found with her neck caught in . the power cable of a treadmill machine, was rushed to hospital and put . on a life support machine, but then died. Tyson first began boxing at a centre for juvenile delinquents in upstate New York at the age of 12. Eight years later he became the youngest heavyweight champion when he knocked out Trevor Berbick in 1986.

When his 26 stone 2lb frame got wedged in a turnstile, football fan Marc Littlejohn realised he had to do something about his weight. Traumatized by the incident, the 30-year-old from Halstead, Essex, who was always considered 'the jolly fat friend', hit the gym and started running three times a week.

Finding a different motivation Michael Jones, 40, from Luton, Bedfordshire, decided to get in shape so he could be a better dad. After falling from 21st 11.2lb to 12st 13lb he won the  title of doting dad slimmer of the year. The computer programmer, lived a sedentary lifestyle. At home he watched TV or played computer games, often until 3am, leaving little time for his son, 12-year-old Jonathan. The final straw came when he was asked to leave a rollercoaster ride because he was too big for the seat. He added: 'I wasn't a very good dad at all.' GP Lady Arabella Onslow, from Kirkby-in-Furness, Cumbria, lost a massive 10st after she had to tell a patient to lose weight. She said: 'As a GP you listen to patients with all sorts of problems and, of course, not all of them are connected with weight, but a lot can be like breathlessness, bad joints and diabetes. 'So when I had to tell a patient they would benefit from losing weight I felt they were judging me.' The 41-year-old who won Rosemary Conley's health professional slimmer of the year award now wears a size 12 for the first time in more than 20 years. She said that she can now give a positive message to her patients, but before she was conscious of her size: . 'I couldn't sit down comfortably, my knees ached, I developed sciatica and at one point I needed an extra seat belt extension on a flight.' Alison Purvis-Gisborne from Dronfield, Derbyshire, also felt self-conscious in her career as a sports physiology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University. 'Weighing 20st and lecturing others on how the human body responds to exercise made me feel embarrassed,' she said. HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SLIMMER .

But the 36-year-old now weighs 10st 12.5lb after she realised her unhealthy diet of  ice cream, chocolate biscuits and pizza was having a negative impact on her body. She said: 'I was horrified to discover how high . my blood pressure was and realised I had to change to protect my health . before it was too late. 'That early grave seemed a whole lot closer but I was given the chance to reduce it through weight loss rather than medication.' Alison,now trains five times a week and has signed up for the London Marathon. She landed Rosemary Conley's online slimmer of the year award for losing 9st in just 14 months. Sport and exercise unite all the winners and discovering a love of cycling after shedding a mammoth 8st 2lb in just over a year earned Michelle McBarnett, 39, the title of super fit female slimmer of 2012. Michelle, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, used to weigh 20st 2lb and wear a size 20 - 22 but now weighs just 12st and is a slimline size 12 - 14. For years she had been on medication for high blood pressure, but not wanting to take tablets for the rest of her life she decided to take action. She said: 'At only 37 years of age the thought of having to take tablets for the rest of my life was a real shock. 'Rather than having a final goal weight I set my sights on getting off medication as quickly as possible.' Since losing weight she has completed her first bike marathon - in just two hours and six minutes, and cycles four miles every day and up to 30 miles at a weekend. She has also set herself a new challenge of completing the London to Brighton 54 mile bike ride - something she never thought she would be healthy enough to do. Helen Elverson, 33, was the final slimmer to be awarded for her successful weight-loss. The mother-of-three,  from Milton Keynes, was slim when she had her children, but found that pregnancy and a change of lifestyle took their toll on her body. Her weight shot up to a 'hefty' 19st and she became a size 24, gorging on cakes, pastries, chocolates and five bags of crisps a day. She said: 'It wasn't just baby cravings, it was me being a pig and I reckon I was getting through 4,000 calories some days. 'I had no interests, no hobbies and no social life.' But after joining a slimming club she lost 8st 7lb in just 14 months, and now shops for size 10 clothes for her 10st 7lb frame. The winners will all be presented with their awards and £1,000 from Rosemary Conley at a ceremony held in London this evening. SUPER FIT FEMALE SLIMMER .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 3:42 PM on 7th January 2012 . Multi-millionaire fraudster and Liberal Democrat donor Michael Brown has been arrested in the Dominican Republic after three years on the run, police said. Brown was sentenced in his absence to seven years in jail after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court in 2008. He donated about £2.4million to the Lib Dems ahead of the 2005 general election - the party's largest donation to date. Fraudster: Michael Brown and his wife Sharon in Mallorca in 2008. The multi-millionaire fraudster has been arrested in the Dominican Republic . An international manhunt was launched when Brown went on the run after stealing £36million from clients, including nearly £8million from the former chairman of Manchester United. He posed as a highly successful bond dealer and claimed connections with royalty to steal the money from Martin Edwards and others. He secretly used investors' money to fund the record donation to the Lib Dems' 2005 election war chest and also blew a large slice of his ill-gotten gains on an 'extravagant' lifestyle. Brown mixed freely with senior Lib Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a company called 5th Avenue Partners. The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money, which Lib Dem senior figures admitted had been spent anyway. It emerged in September that police had tracked Brown to the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean nation neighbouring Haiti - which has no extradition treaty with Britain. No Briton has ever been forced to return from . the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a . ground-breaking deal. There is no guarantee that his latest arrest means he will face justice in the UK. Brown's former solicitor, Jamil Ahmed, would not disclose what he has been arrested for. He said: 'He has been arrested but it is unrelated to what went on in the UK. It is nothing to do with previous convictions that were found against him. 'The arrest is not the doing of the UK police but they are likely to want to go over there and interview him or see him.' Crook: Brown fraudulently obtained millions from various individuals including former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards . Brown's escape before standing trial . was facilitated by convicted drug smuggler Paul Nally, who gave him a . fake passport and travelled with him to the Dominican Republic on June . 30, 2008, according to The Sunday Telegraph. Nally . came back a week later, but Brown stayed and set up bank accounts and . real estate ventures using a fake name – Darren P Nally. He has been living a low-key life of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf on exclusive courses. A . photo from a golf club membership card revealed he has lost weight, . grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to turn grey. The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery. Brown’s disappearance was only . possible in the first place because another Lib Dem donor, Lord . Strasburger, had put up the £250,000 bail money. Brown fled to the Dominican Republic in 2008 before being sentenced in absentia in Britain to seven years in jail for a multi-million pound fraud . A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'The Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found that the party accepted the donation in good faith, and were in no way at fault. 'It cleared the party of all wrongdoing and accepted that at the time of the donation, Michael Brown was a permitted donor. 'There is no indication that the Electoral Commission will revise its opinion in this matter but any arrest abroad should lead to his extradition to the UK.' A City of London Police spokesman said . yesterday: 'We are pleased to hear that Michael Brown has been detained . by authorities in the Dominican Republic, and are currently . establishing contact with them to find out further details about his . arrest. 'Clearly, at some stage we will look . for his return to the United Kingdom, so he can serve the sentence for . the fraud offences for which he has been convicted in this country.'","Convicted in absentia in 2008 of defrauding clients including Manchester United chairman of £36million .

The 50-year-old, one of Scotland's richest women, was caught over the limit after driving her sick partner to hospital. Banned: Audrey Baxter, 50, pictured leaving court today, had her driving licence taken away from her for a year after being caught at the wheel over the limit . Baxter had been attending a function before going home to prepare food and drinking two large glasses of wine. She later discovered her partner's . condition had deteriorated and drove him to hospital. When the couple . arrived at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Moray, she parked her Range . Rover over an ambulance bay. Medical staff suspected she had been drinking and police were called. Following a later breath test, Baxter was found to be more than one-and-a-half times the legal limit. At Elgin Sheriff Court on Wednesday, the businesswoman admitted drink-driving. Fiscal depute Shona Duncan told the court that Baxter had arrived at the hospital at around 9pm on December 24 last year. Offence: Staff at Dr Gray's Hospital, Elgin, reported the Baxters soup boss to police . She was asked to remove her 4x4 from . the ambulance bay some 45 minutes after she arrived and was seen driving . away shortly afterwards. When police went to the tycoon's Elgin . home, she admitted to police officers: 'I know I shouldn't have driven. My husband is sick and I had to take him to the hospital.'

Baxter was told to take him home and put him to bed. Miss Turner said her client accepted full responsibility for her actions and apologised to the court on her behalf.

Russell is being investigated by police over claims he inappropriately touched the breasts of his 19-year-old transsexual nephew. Russell, the director behind The Fighter, is accused of grabbing the breasts of preoperative Nicholas Peloquin at a south Florida gym on December 30. Peloquin, Russell's transsexual nephew and the son of the director's adoptive sister, told police the 53-year-old groped him during a workout session at the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach last Friday. Claim: Director David O. Russell, pictured at the Oscars last February, has been interviewed by police over the groping of 19-year-old transsexual Nicholas Peloquin, right. It was reported that, according to . Peloquin's testimony, the pair had been doing abdominal exercises and . began talking about the 19-year-old's breasts when Russell's hand . hovered above Peloquin's 'private parts'. Peloquin, . a non-blood relative of Russell who has yet to undergo male-to-female . gender reassignment surgery, had described 'the hormones to increase his . breasts' to Russell. It was then the director put his hands under Peloquin's shirt 'and felt both breasts,' according to a police report. Peloquin is said to have told police he felt 'uncomfortable' about the exchange, but at the same time did not tell Russell to stop. The alleged groping took place at the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach, Florida on December 30 . Russell confirmed the exchange to police during an interview with officers, and said that Peloquin was acting 'very provocative toward him' during their workout before inviting him to feel his breasts. The director is said to have told police that he was 'curious about the breast enhancement'. Police told TMZ the case is still under investigation, and that they plan to re-interview both parties.

"Stoppages will hit production of the global giant's leading brands, . including Dove, Marmite, PG Tips, Pot Noodle and Hellman's Mayonnaise . By . Gareth Finighan . Last updated at 8:00 PM on 7th January 2012 . Workers at consumer goods giant Unilever are to stage a series of strikes in a huge escalation of a row over pensions. Leaders of three trade unions today decided to call strikes for up to 12 days starting on January 17. Thousands of employees will be involved at sites across the country and unions said the action will hit production of goods including Marmite and PG Tips. Workers held a one-day strike last year in protest at the ending of Unilever's final salary pension scheme. Tough business decision: The London headquarters of food group Unilever, which manufactures such products as Marmite and PG Tips . Unilever workers from sites at Purfleet, Port Sunlight, Warrington, Leeds, Crumlin, Gloucester, Manchester, Burton-on-Trent and Chester say they are fighting an 'unjustified' attack on their pensions. Unite, the GMB and Usdaw say the company's plans to axe the final salary pension scheme will see the retirement income of thousands of staff slashed by up to 40 per cent. Jennie Formby, national officer of Unite, said after today's union meeting in Liverpool: 'It would seem that Unilever believed the workers would give up after one day's strike but they are badly mistaken. Sending out a message: The GMB's national officer, Allan Black . 'The workforce is angry that the company has refused to meet us or to attend talks at the conciliation service Acas.' Allan Black, national officer of the GMB said: 'Unilever need to get the message that profitable companies will not be allowed to walk away from their savings commitments to their loyal workforce.' Mr Black warned of further strikes unless the row is resolved. The announcement comes after another leading union leader - Mark Serwotka of the Public and Commercial Services union - said workers across the country faced a 'pivotal moment' in their fight against pension cuts. Mr Serwotka said that if the unions were still united, they should call for another national strike. Unilever issued a statement saying: 'Whilst we fully respect the right of our employees to protest about the changes we are planning to make to our UK pensions arrangements, we remain deeply concerned by the disproportionate action the trade unions are taking. 'This was a tough but necessary choice which reflects the realities of rising life expectancy and increased market volatility. 'We believe the provision of final salary pensions is a broken model which is no longer appropriate for Unilever. Everybody out: Last year public sector workers carried out a series of strikes. Could 2012 see similar widespread walkouts? 'It is our responsibility to protect the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of our business, and to do so is in the best interests of our people.' The company added that its new pension plan was 'exceptionally competative' and only devised after extensive consultation with staff. 'We believe these significant changes underscore the value and legitimacy of the consultation process which was concluded in early October,' the company said. 'It is currently not clear how the dispute with the trade unions will be resolved but we are continuing to urge our employees who have participated in industrial action to give further objective consideration to the very competitive new arrangements. 'By continuing to offer all of our employees a defined benefit career average pension plan on their earnings up to £48,000, we are offering arrangements which are unavailable at most other companies in the UK.'","Stoppages will hit production of the global giant's leading brands, .

"By . Ian Gallagher . Last updated at 12:57 AM on 8th January 2012 . Fall from grace: Derek Smith has been forced to resign from West midlands Police after claiming expenses for a hotel stay with a female colleague . A married police finance chief has quit  his £121,000-a-year job over an expenses claim for an unauthorised hotel stay with a blonde female colleague. Derek Smith, who advised the Government on charging for police services, faced an investigation into the £200 bill. But the West Midlands Police civilian director of finance and resources resigned before the inquiry – conducted by another force – was completed. Mr Smith was also a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers and helped lead West Midlands Police’s £750 million cost-cutting drive, involving hundreds of job losses. An internal investigation into alleged misconduct by the woman, a civilian police worker who is understood to be married, has also been launched. She is not expected to lose her job. It is not the first time Mr Smith has been at the centre of controversy. In June last year it was reported that a £40,000 BMW 5 Series car – normally used by undercover officers – was stolen from outside his home, raising questions about why desk-based staff had access to emergency vehicles. It was kitted out with sirens, police radio and special covert blue lights and was said to be for ‘personal use’. It was unclear how long Mr Smith had been using the car. He spent 20 years with the West Midlands force and had a range of responsibilities, including managing the human resources department, the police estate – its stations and patrol bases – and its fleet of vehicles. In his senior management role, which included attending conferences, Mr Smith was authorised to charge legitimate expenses – including hotel stays. But his fall from grace began after he booked into a Manchester hotel, where he was joined by a female colleague, and charged the stay to the force. The stay was not linked to any police-related event. Long career: Mr Smith had spent 20 years with West Midlands Police (above) where his latest post was that of civilian director of finance and resources . The £200 claim is understood to include the accommodation bill, drinks, food and travel expenses. A West Midlands Police spokesman said its professional standards unit was ‘made aware of an allegation of misconduct against two members of police staff’ in November last year. He added: ‘The allegation concerns the use of police funds in connection with expenses, travel and accommodation. West Midlands Police expects every employee to act with integrity and honesty. ‘In line with our values, any allegation of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour will be investigated by our Professional Standards Department. ‘One individual has left the force. The second individual concerned  continues to be investigated under  the police staff disciplinary arrangements.’ The spokesman defended the decision to accept Mr Smith’s resignation rather than pursuing costly misconduct proceedings. ‘Regardless of the outcome of  the investigation, it was felt by  the individual concerned, the force and the Police Authority that  this person’s position would be  untenable,’ he said. Mr Smith had offered to pay  back the money ‘and this will be accepted’. It is understood there is no suggestion of financial impropriety involving the woman and the allegations are  not serious enough to risk her losing her job. Mr Smith could not be reached for comment last night. When contacted by The Mail on  Sunday, his female colleague said: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t comment on that.’","Derek Smith faced probe over £200 bill, but resigned .

The victims were killed by flames that ravaged the waterfront mansion after Mr Borcina took still-lit embers from the fireplace and took them outside. They later sparked the deadly 5 a.m. inferno. The 'Service in Thanksgiving for the . Lives of Lilian, Sarah and Grace Badger', held at St. Thomas Church in New York City, was . attended by friends, relatives and recognisable faces from their . mother's successful fashion career. 'My little girls are not gone from us . entirely because my little girls are in my heart. Right here. And this . is where they live,' Mrs Badger, 47, said during the service. She described each of her daughters in a eulogy to her 'little girl tribe', the New York Daily News reported. In loving memory: The Badgers lead the crowd of mourners as they exit the service, left, and right their three daughters, Lilian, Sarah and Grace laughed delightedly in a photo that adorned the program for the service .

Tragic: Three hearses carry the caskets of the sisters who perished in the 5 a.m. blaze on Christmas Day . Devastated: The Badgers comfort each other as the caskets arrive. Mr Badger was in New York during the fire . She recalled Lily's brilliant smile, Sarah's love and Grace's fearlessness and adoration for her sisters. Badger said Lily was 'my angel and my life and she was my firstborn.' 'Lily was naturally shy, but when she . let her smile glow it glowed completely,' Badger said. 'She had better . dance moves than Michael Jackson.' Lily’s 7-year-old twin sisters, Grace and Sarah, both looked up to their big sister, she said. Sarah was 'my little whippersnapper, loved and lovable and full of love.' Grace was 'fearless' but 'asked a thousand times if she was going to die before me,' Badger said. 'I said, ""No. That's never going to happen. But it did, and I wonder why. Why my children? Why my parents?' Badger told mourners, 'In all the incomprehensible loss and chaos, all I can hang onto is that love is everything.' Before the service, loved ones embraced each other on the church steps, with some wearing dark glasses to hide their tears. They watched as the small wooden coffins were carried into the church by 18 of the Stamford firefighters who responded to the fire. Former . colleagues of Mrs Badger, who worked as an art director for Calvin Klein, . showed their support for the grieving family. Designers Vera Wang and . Calvin Klein himself attended the service. Respects: The girls' coffins are carried in front of the church on Fifth Avenue, which was closed for the event . Sadness: The girls died after fireplace embers were put outside - because they did not want Santa to be burned . Time of need: Mr and Mrs Badger are comforted by the clergy of the church before the funeral service . The Gothic-style church, filled with lilies and faux evergreen boughs from Christmas, was brimming with well-wishers well before the service began. The . program featured a photograph of nine-year-old Lily and . her seven-year-old twin sisters, Sarah and Grace, laughing together, . wearing summer dresses. Readings at the service included Bible . passages: 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them . not,' and 'For every time there is a season'. Songs were performed to honour the three sisters, including Amazing Grace and This . Little Light of Mine. Singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright sang an a cappella version of 'Over the Rainbow' during the service, which also featured hymns performed by St. Thomas' all-male choir.

There will be a further, private service for the five victims . Heartbreaking: Sarah Badger's coffin is taken from the church. Her mother recounted the girl's loving nature . Together: The Badgers follow the caskets carrying the bodies of their three daughters . Despair: In her eulogy, Mrs Badger described each of her daughters, before asking: 'Why my children?' 'The family is here today to privately . remember, mourn and honor their beloved Lily, Sarah and Grace as well as . Lormer and Pauline Johnson,' family friend Kate Askew said in a . statement. 'It has been an incredibly, incredibly difficult time.' After attending the service, Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte added: 'The closure you are looking for when you see those little caskets, it just doesn't come.' A private service will be held later . at Woodlawn Cemetery for the girls' grandparents, Lomer and Pauline . Johnson, who also perished in the flames. Embers in a bag of discarded ashes . started the blaze on Christmas Day at the $1.7million . property, officials have said. Mr Borcina had taken them out of a fireplace so the children would not worry about . Santa coming down the chimney. Fire officials said he then placed the ashes in or outside an entryway, near rubbish bins. All victims died of smoke inhalation, . while Lomer Johnson also suffered a blunt head and neck trauma, which . resulted from a fall as he attempted to save one of his granddaughters. Support: Mrs Badger's former boss Calvin Klein (left) and fellow designer Vera Wang (right) attend the service . Shared sadness: Musician Lou Reed, left, and actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, right, showed their support . Loss: Mrs Badger arrives with Mr Borcina. They were the sole survivors of the blaze that destroyed her home . Mr Borcina told fire officials he had tried to flee with two of the girls, but amid the chaos of the flames, the girls apparently panicked and ran upstairs, according to Stamford fire chief, Antonio J. Conte. One of the girls, found dead just . inside a window, had been placed on a pile of books, apparently so . Johnson could reach in and grab her after he jumped out. But it is . believed he fell through the roof. Mrs Badger and Mr Borcina were treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation. Police and fire officials are investigating the blaze. They want to know whether there were smoke alarms at the home, as . well as the status of its renovation and whether the contractor had . permits. Remembered: Matthew Badger poses with his daughters Grace, Sarah and Lily, shortly before their deaths . Victims: Lomer and Pauline Johnson, seen standing, also died in the fire. Mr Johnson died trying to save their grandchildren, from left, . Lily, Grace and Sarah. Another grandchild Morgan (right) was not in the house . House of horror: Authorities are investigating if the home had activated fire alarms and contractor permits . Emotional: Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte (pictured left on the day of the fire) attended the funeral service with Mayor of Stamford Michael Pavia, right. They said it was the worst Christmas the town had ever known . Pain: Firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respects outside the destroyed home in Stamford, Connecticut. Many of the fire fighters dispatched to the scene are undergoing counseling to deal with the horrifying memories . The . Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has said that neither . Borcina nor his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was registered to . perform home improvement work in the state. The agency said it did not yet have . enough information about what work may have been done or completed and . would not comment on whether it will investigate. Stamford authorities deemed the house unsafe following the fire and ordered it torn down the day after. Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people. Matthew and Madonna Badger have set up The Other 364 Foundation to collect donations to 'champion compassion' in the girls' memories.

"By . Liz Hull . Last updated at 1:46 AM on 7th January 2012 . The parents of the gifted student gunned down on Boxing Day made an emotional pilgrimage yesterday to the spot where he died. Subhash Bidve and his wife Yogini travelled more than 4,200 miles from their home in India to the Salford street where Anuj, 23, was shot. Mr Bidve comforted his wife as she sobbed uncontrollably before they laid flowers and a wreath, and studied the many tributes left at the spot in the deprived area of Ordsall. Grief-stricken: Anuj Bidve's mother Yogini wipes away a tear as she visits the site where her son was killed in Salford, Manchester, with her husband Subhash. Shot dead: Anuj Bidve was killed as he walked along the road with friends on Boxing Day . Then, at the request of the family, news photographers turned off their cameras as they knelt down and prayed. Anuj and some friends had strayed into the neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning as they made their way into Manchester for the sales. The post-graduate engineering student at Lancaster University was apparently shot in the head at point-blank range despite replying ‘politely’ when his attacker asked him the time. The family’s visit came as David Cameron, also visiting the area, condemned the ‘horrific’ killing. In a phone call, he assured Mr Bidve that ‘everything possible’ would be done to bring his son’s killer to justice. Mr Bidve, a former Indian Air Force officer who works as a general manager, said: ‘Anuj was our only son and we cannot comprehend this dreadful tragedy. 'We have made the journey to see Anuj, see the place where he died, and most importantly take Anuj home with us. ‘When he left India in September, he was full of hope and ambition. 'We were all so very proud of him.’ He added: ‘We have been deeply moved and taken comfort from the hundreds of messages from the people in Salford and Lancaster. We would like to say thank you.’ Weeping: Anuj Bidve's mother Yogini wipes away a tear as she visits the site where her son was killed in Salford, Manchester . Tribute: Yogini Bidve views the messages of condolence left at the spot on a Salford street where her son was killed . The couple had taken out a £25,000 loan to enable their son to travel to the UK. They were due to fly home with his body last night. During his trip to Salford earlier in the day, Mr Cameron said that Anuj Bidve's life had been,'cruelly and brutally ended'. 'My message, on behalf of the whole country, is one of huge sympathy and understanding to them. 'An absolutely horrific act has taken their son away from them, and it is absolutely essential the Greater Manchester Police do everything they can to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure the person is rightly brought to justice and there is a very tough punishment. Respectful: Yogini, Anuj's mother, is supported by friends at the shrine to her son who was killed in Manchester on Boxing Day . Shrine to Anuj: A photograph of the young student is surrounded by candles at Ordsall Lane, Salford . 'It's unacceptable to have this sort of crime going on in our country.' This is the family's statement in full: . 'We have made the journey from India . in order to see Anuj, see the place where he died, and most importantly . take Anuj home with us. 'Whilst in England we have taken the . opportunity to meet a number of other people who were involved in Anuj’s . life and to achieve our goal of taking Anuj back home with us as soon . as possible. 'As you can imagine this has been an exceedingly difficult journey to make. 'When Anuj left India in September last year he was full of hope and ambition for the future. We were all so very proud of him. Commons visit: MP Keith Vaz, centre, with the family of murdered Indian student Anuj Bidve outside the Houses of Parliament.

'We have been deeply moved and have . taken comfort from the hundreds of messages we have received from the . people in Salford and Lancaster and especially the Indian community and . would like to take this opportunity to say thank you. 'We have been overwhelmed by the reaction and interest of the media both at home in India and here in the United Kingdom. 'We would like to thank the police . for the manner in which this investigation has been conducted. We are . confident in the British justice system and sincerely hope that this . will eventually bring justice for Anuj. 'We now wish to have some time on our . own to take in the enormity of the situation and say some prayers for . Anuj at the very place where he died.' Yesterday, they collected his belongings from Lancaster University and met his friends and tutors. The family met with Home Affairs Select . Committee chairman Keith Vaz for 35 minutes on Thursday to discuss the . police investigation into their son's death and to plead for justice. Mr Vaz pledged to get a full report on . the incidents surrounding the death of Mr Bidve following the completion . of the criminal proceedings.

"By . Russell Myers . Last updated at 12:30 AM on 8th January 2012 . It looks like the kind of home owned by a successful businessman or influential politician. But this imposing five-bedroom house, in one of the most affluent districts of Lahore, Pakistan, is understood to be owned by a man being investigated for benefit fraud in Britain and Denmark. The opulent two-storey home, worth up to £300,000 in the country’s second-biggest city, is the subject of an investigation by the Department for Work and Pensions and Danish authorities into Hassan Gilani. Imposing: The £300,000 Lahore house, in one of the most affluent districts in Lahore, owned by Hassan Gilani . Investigators want to know how the father of three, who has allegedly claimed nearly £292,000 of benefits in both Britain and Denmark during the past decade, could afford to keep such a property. His Pakistani address was included in a file given to the DWP by the Danish authorities following a tip-off that he did not live in Denmark but had been receiving state support since 2002. Mr Gilani has allegedly been paid huge sums after saying he was disabled and could barely walk, while claiming to live in both countries. But his neighbours in Pakistan say he is regularly seen strolling round the upper-class neighbourhood of Model Town and that he often spends  several months at a time at the house to escape the cold English winters. Last week, this newspaper revealed he has received up to £110,000 in housing benefit from the British taxpayer since 1997. He has also been paid up to £70,000 in disability allowance in the past decade, while banking about £112,000 of benefits in Denmark. Under investigation: Hassan Gilani, pictured at his home in Croydon . Locals in Lahore told how Mr Gilani, 58, who lives in a taxpayer-funded three-bedroom terrace house in Croydon, South London, bought land for the house in the early Nineties. In the years that followed, he turned it into one of the smartest homes in this tree-lined street, five miles from Lahore. When The Mail on Sunday first visited the property last week, Mr Gilani’s name, and that of his wife Iffat, 58, were painted in Urdu on a stone plaque outside the house. But when we returned the following day, after making our initial enquiries, the plaque had been reduced to a pile of rubble on the ground. Only the name Syed Zahur Hussain Gilani, believed to be Mr Gilani’s brother, remained on the entrance to the house. After identifying a photograph of Mr Gilani, one neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I often see Hassan around the area. He is a good man and always stops to talk about his family and life in general. ‘He is a regular at the local mosque and spends most of his time there if he is not at home watching TV or walking in the park with his family. ‘He was here in the spring last year, but I haven’t seen him for a while. He usually likes to come in the English winter as well because he says the weather is so bad he cannot stand it.’ Local men at the mosque, less than 500 yards from his front door, said  Mr Gilani has often spent many hours chatting to friends and praying. One said: ‘Hassan is a good man with a very good family. He is always smartly dressed in traditional clothes and gives generously to the mosque.’ Some locals who claimed to know Mr Gilani said they believed he owned the house with his brother, who is also a regular visitor. When members of the Gilani family are staying at the house they have up to four staff, including a cook, a driver and a gardener. Other Model Town residents include bankers, judges and senior government workers and almost all of the houses in the area are gated, many with armed guards outside the high-walled homes. The smart self-contained town is a world away from the bustling markets and shanty towns nearby. The family has a cook, driver and gardener . Most blocks have their own mosques at the end of the road and two former prime ministers, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, have also kept homes in the area. A man who was at the house last Thursday when a Mail on Sunday reporter called said he lived there with his wife and daughter and that they were responsible for looking after the house and the Gilani family when they were in Pakistan. He said: ‘Hassan was supposed to come in November last year, but he didn’t for some reason. ‘He usually spends the winters here, sometimes for a few weeks  at a time, but I don’t know when he  will be back.’ Mr Gilani, originally from Pakistan, faces up to seven years in jail in Britain if he is found guilty of misleading social services to claim state support. He could also face charges of fraud in Denmark. It is alleged he was paid incapacity benefit in Britain from 1999 to 2002, totalling £4,900 a year, and also banked an estimated £112,000 of benefits in Denmark since 2002. Mr Gilani, seen earlier this month strolling to the bank and a branch of Western Union near his Croydon house, has also received up to £2,700 a year of income support in Britain since 2002 and as much as £5,000 a year in disability living allowance since 2005. Incapacitated: Mr Gilani, pictured getting into his Mercedes, has told social workers in Britain and Denmark that he can barely walk and has severe difficulty with basic tasks . Tip off: Authorities in Copenhagen were told that Gilani had not been seen at his house for more than two years . Mr Gilani has told social workers in Britain and Denmark that he can barely walk and has severe difficulty with basic tasks such as eating and dressing himself. It is believed Mr Gilani may have also rented out his taxpayer-funded, three-bedroom apartment in Copenhagen while he has not lived there, netting up to an extra £800 a month. A DWP source in Britain said: ‘Investigators will certainly want to know how Mr Gilani has been able to afford to keep such a large house in Pakistan with no income other than his benefits. This will all form part of any case against him.’ On Friday, a new paper-shredder was delivered to Mr Gilani’s home in Croydon. However, when The Mail on Sunday knocked at the door, there was initially no answer. After five minutes a man opened the door and asked our reporter who he represented. When details of the house in Lahore were put to him, he said the family had made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission and were advised not to talk to reporters. Asked if Mr Gilani was at home, the man refused to answer.",Two-storey home in one of Pakistan's most affluent districts 'owned by a man being investigated in Britain and Denmark'
"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 6:26 PM on 6th January 2012 . A woman who was on the brink of death has told how she has returned to her pole dance-teaching day job after life-saving surgery. Kirstie Tancock, 22, was blighted by cystic fibrosis, which meant her lungs and digestive were clogged with thick mucus, making it difficult to breathe. And last June, just days before getting married she was rushed to hospital after she stopped breathing and turned blue. Head over heels with happiness: Having been told she was on the brink of death, Kirsty has undergone a double lung operation - and is now back in shape and fitter than ever . Doctors told her she was critically ill, but following a double lung transplant Kirstie, of Honiton, Devon, is able to return to work and says she 'can do routines I could never . do before'. She said: 'I have been building up my strength for a while and started using the pole again about three months post-transplant. 'Now I am nearly six months in and I am nearly back to full strength . and ready to get right back into it. 'My cardio has improved ten-fold from what it was before the transplant. I can do routines I could never do before.' Kirstie with her husband Stuart Tancook on their wedding day just days after she collapsed . Big day: On a cocktail of prescribed drugs, Kirstie managed to walk to the aisle but had to remain in a wheelchair for much of the day and had to be aided by nurses as she put on her wedding dress . Kirstie was diagnosed with . cystic fibrosis at birth, and took up pole dance teaching in 2007 as a way to improve her health and . fitness, before being forced to give it up after . falling ill. Despite her near-death experience Kirstie decided to through with her wedding and married her childhood sweetheart . Stuart, 26, at Hornbury Mill, a 19th century corn mill in Chard, Somerset, on June 16. She spent the night before her big day sleeping in a hospital bed, instead of the plush hotel she had booked, and was aided by nurses as she put on her wedding dress. On a cocktail of prescribed drugs, Kirstie managed to walk to the aisle but had to remain in a wheelchair for much of the day. In the meantime she was placed on the transplant list and doctors told her she would die unless . a suitable organ donor was found. Doctors told Kirstie she would die if she didn't find a suitable organ donor . After an anxious wait, Kirstie underwent surgery in July and had both of her lungs transplanted. Now her incredible turnaround is complete - and she is back in the gym taking her pole dancing classes. She added: 'After the transplant I had to learn to walk again. The . first time I went to the pole after transplant I could not get my feet . off the ground and I thought I really was back to square one. 'But . I was really shocked about how quickly I was able to progress. 'The . moment I was able to perform my hardest move, which is the twisted group . hand swing, I knew I had cracked it. 'It . felt amazing. I was so into pole before, that when I had to stop I . wrote a blog saying goodbye to it, as it was a piece of me. 'It really hurt that I could not do it any more. It is a big and important part of who I am.' Alongside . pole dancing Kirstie also works with the charity . LiveLifeGiveLife, helping with PR, fundraising and campaign initiatives to . promote organ donation. She also has her own pole dancing fitness . clothing range which she is looking to expand. Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited disease and affects over 8,500 children and young adults in the UK. There is no cure for the condition, but many treatments and therapies can make it easier to live with. It is only in severe cases, when the lungs stop working properly, that a lung transplant may be recommended.

"Footballer insisted he was in bed by 12.30am despite pictures of him at bar taken at 2.12am . By . David Gerges . Last updated at 12:12 PM on 7th January 2012 . Pictures of Rooney have surfaced showing the striker out into the early hours of the morning . Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has been left red-faced after new footage was released of the England international out at a bar, contradicting the striker's own claims that he was at home in bed. In the snap, Rooney is seen together with team-mate Jonny Evans at Tony McGee's establishment in The Vincent Hotel in Southport. Along with Darren Gibson, the trio were all out celebrating United's 5-1 win on Boxing Day against Wigan, but Rooney's camp later insisted that the striker had returned home following a timid outing together with his wife Coleen. The striker was fined £200,000 by his club after boss Sir Alex Ferguson suggested that the forward had been below par in training in the build-up to United's New Year's Eve 3-2 home defeat against Blackburn Rovers. However the Hotel's manager Paul Adams has reaffirmed Rooney's claim that he was in bed by 12.30am telling The Mirror; 'Wayne went to bed shortly after midnight, about 12.30am. 'He was not drunk, he was just having a quiet evening with friends.' Whilst phone records of the picture show it was taken at 2.12am, a spokesman for the striker insisted that it was captured at the wrong time. However the mobile's makers BlackBerry are adamant that any photograph captured on a handset would 'automatically have the correct date and time.' Rooney was out celebrating United's win at McGees Bar with team-mates . Suggestions that relations . between Rooney and Ferguson are strained were denied by the club yesterday, after it emerged that Ferguson is considering the possibility of sanctioning . the sale of his star forward. Rooney took to Twitter to refute the rumours, saying: 'The independent are talking absolute rubbish, my future is with Manchester United and the club and I am totally committed, the manager and I have no issues and anyone who says different doesn't know what they are talking about.' Meanwhile the Old Trafford club released a statement denying the 26-year-old's relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson is strained. 'Manchester United and Wayne Rooney have been made aware of the theme of an article in tomorrow's Independent newspaper,"" said the statement. Relations between Wayne Rooney and boss Sir Alex Ferguson appear strained .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 10:02 PM on 6th January 2012 . Labour leader Ed Miliband faced embarrassment yesterday after he bungled the task of sending a tweet to mark the death of Bob Holness. A tribute to the Blockbusters host on his Twitter account read: ‘Sad to hear that Bob Holness has died. A generation will remember him fondly from Blackbusters.’ Within minutes, the message was removed and replaced with the correct spelling of the game show. The mistake suggests the Labour leadership might still have Thursday’s race row on its mind, when shadow minister Diane Abbott apologised for tweeting that ‘white people love playing divide and rule’. Just minutes ago the Labour Party leader took to Twitter to pay tribute to Blockbuster host Bob Holness, typing 'Sad to hear that Bob Holness has died. A generation will remember him fondly from Blackbusters' Correction: Ed Miliband hastily corrected his gaffe with the right spelling of Blockbusters . Mr Miliband’s gaffe has sparked a . Twitter storm, with a competition establishing itself on the internet to . come up with other fitting mistakes based on game show titles. Examples included ‘Ready Steady . Cock-up’, ‘Come Diane With Me’, ‘Mock the Weak’, ‘Bland Gate’ and ‘Eight . out of Ten Cuts’. Some concentrated on his thorny relationship with . leadership rival and brother David Miliband, such as ‘Family . Misfortunes’ and simply ‘Big Brother’. Other genuine titles that tweeters . suggested might be appropriate for Mr Miliband included ‘I’m Sorry I . Haven’t A Clue’, ‘Are You Smarter Than A Ten Year Old?’ and ‘The Weakest . Link’. Then there were more suggested spoofs, . including ‘Dancing on Thin Ice’, ‘Mastermindless’, ‘Blackety Black’, . ‘Universally Challenged’, ‘Dole or No Dole’, ‘Wheel of Misfortune’ and . ‘Balls Eye’. At one point yesterday, the competition was the most . popular subject on Twitter. Meanwhile, Miss Abbott became . embroiled in yet another race row yesterday after it emerged she had . accused taxi drivers of racism in another tweet earlier in the week. Ed Miliband quickly deleted his mis-spelled tribute to Bob Holness, who died today at the age of 83 . Who's that ringing? An unrepentant Diane Abbott takes a call and the Labour leader tells her to apologise . Whoops! Ed Miliband's tweet has been trending on Twitter this afternoon . London cabbies attacked her suggestion . that they do not pick up black passengers. She had tweeted: ‘Dubious of . black people claiming they’ve never experienced racism. Ever tried . hailing a taxi I wonder?’ Steve McNamara, a spokesman for the . Licensed Taxi Drivers Association said Miss Abbott was indulging in the . ‘stereotypes of the 1960s’, and that many drivers now were black and . Asian. ‘At worst she is racist and at best she is stupid in making comments like that,’ he said. ‘Either way, she should go.’ Mr Miliband has endured one of his . most difficult weeks as Labour leader – being attacked in print by his . guru and criticised by one of his frontbenchers. On Tuesday, academic Lord Glasman, who . received a peerage on Mr Miliband’s recommendation last year, wrote . that the leader had ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’. A day later, a memo written by Labour . spin doctor Tom Baldwin was reduced to claiming that Mr Miliband was not . as bad an Opposition leader as Iain Duncan Smith. And on Thursday, it emerged that the . party’s defence spokesman, Jim Murphy, was distancing himself from . Labour’s attacks on Government spending cuts. He told The Guardian that . Labour’s credibility depended on rejecting ‘shallow and temporary’ populism. Abbott's comment about 'divide and rule' caused a Twitter storm and led to calls for her resignation . The full conversation between Diane Abbott and freelance journalist, Bim Adewunmi following the sentencing of Stephen Lawrence's killers .

The killers of Stephen Lawrence are thought to be likely targets for reprisals from ethnic minority inmates angered by the vile racist attitudes that emerged during the trial. It is likely they will serve their sentences in segregated wings alongside other 'vulnerable' prisoners such as paedophiles who are also thought to be at risk of attack. Gary Dobson and David Norris are likely to be given extra protection in prison amid fear of revenge attacks . Dobson and Norris will start serving their sentence at the category A Belmarsh prison . A legal expert told Mail Online: . 'There is a general duty of care to ensure their safety; how it is . fulfilled is a matter for the prison governor. 'But Rule 45 is likely to come into play, under which they could be put in solitary confinement for their own protection. 'Precautions could include making them exercise on their own, and housing them in the hospital wing or another solitary wing. 'There is a duty of care to take reasonable steps to keep them safe.' Rule 45 (formerly Rule 43), is the . rule that allows the isolation of vulnerable prisoners in the interests of their own personal safety. The pair are likely to be kept in a segregated to wing to protect against revenge attacks . The . extra precautions - which will come at increased cost to the taxpayer - . follow an attack on Norris in Belmarsh prison, south London, while he . was on remand awaiting trial. He was attacked by three black inmates just weeks after he was arrested for Stephen’s murder in September 2010. Prison . sources said the three men, thought to be Muslims, beat Norris after he . tried to ‘throw his weight around’ by using his family's underworld . reputation. The assault left him with problems to . his hearing and throughout the trial he had to wear a special headset to . follow the proceedings. It also saw extra protection placed on him at the prison and heightened fears that he and Dobson will be 'marked men'. The need for extra protection is also . triggered by the fact that the killers could seek compensation if an . assault does take place.

One of Norris's associates makes an obscene gesture at our photographer . It is feared ethnic minority prisoners will seek revenge for the death of Stephen Lawrence . Norris could potentially bring legal action against prison authorities for failing in their 'duty of care' towards him. Following their convictions . yesterday, the pair were taken to Belmarsh. They are likely to be . transferred to Category A prisons elsewhere in the country. Guards are also likely to be told to keep a special watch on the pair to further minimise the danger that they face. Soham murderer Ian Huntley, who was . slashed in the throat in 2010 in jail, attempted to sue authorities for . £100,000 for failing to protect him. The Ministry of Justice pays significant sums each year to injured prisoners. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said inmates at risk were kept apart from other prisoners when necessary. It is not yet known if the two men convicted of the Lawrence murder will be seen as suicide risks. But Dobson could yet see his sentence cut short. Detectives . believe he might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean . about who else was responsible for Stephen’s death. Police . believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic . evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the . other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward, or Dobson – long regarded as one of the ‘weak links’ in the mob –were to become a supergrass. It is understood the possibility of Dobson co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators.

"Jailed after 20 years, abuser taught geography at leading Catholic independent school . Monastic authorities 'hushed up child abuse' Parents of one victim sought injunction to keep scandal out of the press . By . Rebecca Seales . Last updated at 5:35 PM on 4th January 2012 . Jailed: Richard White pleaded guilty to abusing two boys at Downside, a Roman Catholic public school . A paedophile monk who forced a schoolboy to take part in sex acts and paid him 50p each time has been jailed for five years. Richard White, 66, was finally jailed yesterday after evading justice for more than two decades - because monastic authorities and the parents of one of his two victims hushed the matter up. White, a Benedictine monk, abused pupils while a geography teacher at Downside, one of England's leading Roman Catholic schools. Taunton Crown Court heard that he was warned about his behaviour after molesting one 12-year-old boy, but instead of contacting the police the Benedictine abbot of the monastery attached to the school simply stopped him from teaching younger students. He went on to indecently assault a second boy over the course of several months when he was aged 12 and 13 in 1988 and 1989. Robert Duval, for the prosecution, said that White lured the pupil, who was interested in old books, to the monastery library, which was usually off-limits to students. There he sexually touched the boy and forced him to take part in sex acts, paying him 50p each time. Cover-up: Downside School was aware of the allegations against White, but failed to contact the police even after he confessed they were true . He was discovered after other pupils at the independent Catholic School in Stratton-on-the-Fosse near Bath, Somerset saw the boy had extra money to spend at the tuck shop and he admitted how he had come by it. Astonishingly, the police were not told even when the matter was again reported to the monastic school authorities, and White himself told the principal what he had done. Instead the former British Army soldier, whom the court heard was repressing his homosexuality at the time, was dismissed from his teaching post and sent to monastic communities across the country over the next 20 years, a move designed to keep him away from children. After the News of the World ran an article about the scandal, the boy's own family obtained a court injunction to keep him out of any further reports before removing him from the school. Despite the publicity, no complaint was ever made at the time to the police and White's offending was only brought to light when police investigating another teacher at the school for child pornography offences found a file in school records detailing what he had done and contacted the second victim. He attended court to see White jailed and afterwards praised the police and his partner for giving him the 'confidence' to come forward. He said he thought the monk's sentence was 'appropriate. 'I'm not the only boy at Downside who was abused,' he said. 'I hope this will highlight to the school that it needs to address the risks associated with religious orders running educational establishments without the appropriate safety nets. 'Downside has a poor history of child abuse and the reason for the original statement (to police) was not to convict Richard White but to protect the 1,500 children at Downside School.' White, of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, sat in the dock with his head bowed throughout proceedings. He admitted five charges of indecent assault and two of gross indecency with a child, relating to the second boy, at a previous hearing last November. He also asked for four offences against the first boy, who has never made a complaint to police, to be taken into account. White's conviction is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the English Benedictine congregation, after monks from the religious order's communities at Ampleforth, Ealing and Buckfast were also jailed for sexual offences against children. Father Richard Yeo, the former Abbot of Downside, recently stood down from a Vatican inquiry into sex abuse at Ealing Abbey in west London, following concerns about the order's record in dealing with child abuse cases.","Jailed after 20 years, abuser taught geography at leading Catholic independent school .

An extraordinary £13,000 amphibious caravan, dubbed the Sealander by its German designer, is set to ensure road and boat trips will never be the same again. The floating two-in-one two-bed mobile home has been created by Daniel Straub, a German-based industrial designer, to combine the features of an electric power boat and a camping trailer. All at sea: The Sealander is taken for some sea trials, the small outboard engine is visible at the back . It took him two years to design, build and test the Sealander so that he could mass produce and sell it. The innovative floating caravan boasts onboard cooking, cleaning, eating and sleeping facilities and can move around on water thanks to an electric motor. And its creator said: 'This extends the possibilities of camping and leisure. Whoever travels with our floating caravan can spend free time on both land and on water. Perfect towing mate: The Sealander can be hitched to a car with a trailer like any other caravan . Perfect spot: With its amphibious capabilities the Sealander can stay on land or go on water . 'It's just like a holiday should be - up to them and unlimited possibilities. 'You can settle for the night at the campsite and during the day sunbathe, cruise on the lake or even go fishing for dinner. 'You can even up sticks and settle on the next island if the camp site is crowded. I think the advantages offered by the Sealander are varied and different for everyone.' Start your engines: Once it hits the waves, the Sealander is powered by a regular outboard motor . Bedtime: The interior of the Sealander has two bench seats which double as beds. It also has cooking and washing facilities onboard just like any other caravan or boat . So far the Sealander can only be used in shallow waters but Daniel is already looking at building vans which can take to deeper waters and even the sea. His current design has a clever double hull which means that should the outer shell spring a leak, only the sub-floor will fill with water, ensuring that it remains afloat. Daniel added: 'The body shape of the trailer, or the 'case', is made of fibreglass-reinforced plastic and then connected to a water-tight chassis. 'So the Sealander is drawn on land as a . caravan and when needed can be lowered into the water. On the water it . can then be moved independently using a motor. 'In future I hope to develop larger versions of the floating caravans which can run on other waters.' The Sealander is expected to go on sale for camping/boating enthusiasts at the start of next year with a price tag of £13,000. It is not the first time cars and boats have been combined. Since the 1920s there have been numerous designs but amphibious craft have been most commonly used for search and rescue purposes and in military applications. Visitors to London and Boston can even see the sights from amphibious Duck vehicles designed to take visitors around on both land and on the river.","Two-in-one floating mobile home goes on sale early next year .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 10:03 AM on 5th January 2012 . A young woman faces an uncertain future with her loving fiance - as there is a 50/50 chance he will end up as her carer. Lisa Heathcock is just 26 but has already seen her father, aunt and grandmother succumb to Huntingdon's disease. She is afraid that she too will fall victim to the neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and dementia. Blissful ignorance? Lisa Heathcock and fiance Darren Parkes who may become her carer later in life . The condition typically shows symptoms in middle age, but Lisa's grandmother was just 35 when she first fell ill. Every patient is affected differently but the most common symptoms are jerky, uncontrollable movements, dementia, depression, lack of coordination and general decline which more often than not results in an early death from pneumonia, heart disease or physical injury. Huntingdon's patients in the later stages of the disease need round the clock care and there is no cure. A simple test could tell whether Lisa is a carrier of the gene before she embarks on married life and the task of building a family with her fiance and childhood sweetheart Darren Parkes, 32. But recruitment consultant Lisa has chosen to leave her future to fate for now rather than face the possibility that she too will end up needing constant care like her father, Simon. She said: 'I know Darren would take care of me if I ever fell ill but I don't want to spend the rest of our lives dwelling on what could happen. 'I've always said to him, ""Whatever happens, don't put me in a home."" I think that is my biggest fear. 'I find sometimes the only way to get through it is to stay positive. I do have my down days - maybe once every couple of months - but Darren reminds me that there is always someone else out there worse off than you.' Collect photo of Lisa Heathcock and her father Simon Heathcock, who suffers from Huntingdon's disease . Lisa was only young when her grandmother Muriel died of the disease. Initially her family suspected she was going senile as she was frequently falling over, bumping into things and at one point set herself on fire.  Over time it became apparent that something was seriously wrong and eventually Muriel was diagnosed with Huntingdon's disease. Lisa's aunt Karen was one of the first people in the UK to be tested for the dominant gene which causes the condition. She tested positive. Lisa said: 'We didn't see a lot of her as kids and it's really only been in the last four years that we have regularly been around her. She's really quite bad now. She can't stay still, she's constantly moving and twitching. 'She has got progressively worse, but you can still hold a conversation with her, while my dad has gone the complete opposite way.' Simon Heathcock decided to get tested for Huntingdon's when Lisa was in her late teens. Seeing her grow up and knowing that soon she would want to start a family of her own meant he needed answers about her future. If he was not a carrier of the faulty gene, then she would neither be. If he was, there was a 50/50 chance Lisa could go on to develop Huntingdon's and pass the gene onto her own offspring. The results of the genetic test sank him into a devastating depression. Not only would he have to face the horror of Huntingdon's, but so might his daughter. Lisa said: 'At first my parents kept it quiet for about eight months or so. I think they were trying to come to terms with it and let it sink in. 'In the end, my mother blurted it out during an argument - the usual stuff about me being a bratty teenager, like you do. I had been out at the cinema and she said to me, 'You are so selfish, you don't even realise that your dad is ill.' 'It wasn't the best way to find out but afterwards she sat me down and explained everything. She had all the books and information and told me to come to her with any questions if I had them. But at that point I think I just wanted to stick my head in the sand and ignore it.' Simon was diagnosed ten years ago at the age of 40 and started showing symptoms soon afterwards. First he developed an uncontrollable twitch in his finger, then another in his shoulder.  After a while, his physical symptoms were overtaken by mental ones. Simon's personality has since deteriorated before his family's eyes.  He is no longer capable of showing his wife Jane, 46, love or affection, his selfishness dictates everything and his routine cannot be disturbed at any cost. Lisa bought him a watch with the date on it so she would not have to tell him what day of the week it was several times a day. She said: 'He still asks, I just tell him to look at the watch now. I don't want to take that little bit of independence away from him by just telling him.' It wasn't until Lisa formed a relationship gas engineer Darren, a local boy who she had known since she was 14, that she began to think more seriously about what the future might hold for them. The pair got together eight years ago and have been engaged for two following a romantic proposal in a London hotel. Since then, they have been renovating their home in Dudley, West Midlands, and thinking about starting a family. Lisa said: 'The time for me to have the test is now really, but I would rather leave things up to fate. I think the reason Darren and I didn't get married straightaway is because having a family is more important to us than a piece of paper. 'Darren has a thirteen-year-old son, Brandon, from a previous relationship and I love him like my own, but I would love nothing more than to be able to have a baby with Darren. 'We are not officially trying, we are just waiting to see what happens. But we've been doing that for a while and there's still no change so maybe that's someone's way of telling me that I need to go have a test first. I don't know.' If Lisa were to have the test, and it were to be positive, there are some IVF options available to them that would ensure her children were not carriers of the gene. However, for now, Lisa and Darren would rather not know. Having seen the devastating effect Huntingdon's has had on her grandmother, aunt and now her father, Lisa is not sure she is ready to deal with seeing her genetic lot written out in black and white. She said: 'At least I know Darren would do the same for me, even if I became a totally different person because of this horrible disease.' Lisa has earned a golden bond to run in the London Marathon for the Huntington's Disease Association next April.  To donate, visit http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/LisaHeathcock .","Lisa has a 50/50 chance of having devastating neurodegenerative disorder .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 10:19 AM on 7th January 2012 . Come back: Alistair Darling is being touted amongst some Labour MPs as a replacement for Ed Miliband . Alistair Darling is being touted as a ‘compromise’ Labour leadership candidate if Ed Miliband is forced to quit. Labour MPs have privately floated the idea of the former Chancellor taking the helm as a ‘John Major figure’ if Mr Miliband is unable to kickstart his faltering leadership. The Labour leader will attempt a relaunch next week amid growing unease that voters think he is not a credible prime minister. Labour peer Lord Glasman, a policy guru to Mr Miliband, this week admitted the party appears to have ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’ under his leadership. Speculation about a potential replacement for Mr Miliband is focused on Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, who easily topped the last ballot of Labour MPs to elect a Shadow Cabinet. But Mr Darling is being mentioned privately as a possibility, though it is far from clear he could be persuaded to stand and would certainly not wield the knife against Mr Miliband. Senior Tories would not welcome a return to the frontline for Mr Darling, who they believe was the one senior member of the last government to emerge from the financial crisis with any credit. He was attacked by allies of Gordon Brown for correctly warning Britain faced the biggest economic crisis for 60 years and he pushed for the last government to accept the need for the deepest public spending cuts since the days of Margaret Thatcher. Asked before the last general election if he would stand in any future Labour leadership contest, Mr Darling replied: ‘Me? No, no.’ But in an interview with Total Politics magazine, he hinted at a return to the fray. ‘I said I’d take a year’s break [after the 2010 election] and see how I felt,’ he said. ‘I did take a year’s break. I did see how I felt. I decided that I’d like another year and here I am.’ Pressure: Ed Miliband is feeling the heat as Labour leader, with some backbenchers rumoured to be on the lookout for a new man at the helm . Asked if he expected to return to frontline politics at that point, Mr Darling said: ‘I don’t know. I’m in no hurry and no-one’s putting me under any pressure.’ One Labour source said: ‘This speculation has been going on for a while. ‘I’m not sure whether he’d ever do it, but people were disappointed he stood down and some are saying he would be the best leader we could have at the moment, when politics is all about the economy. ‘Voters basically trusted him and were reassured by him.’ A friend of Mr Darling, however, said they doubted he would regard himself as a potential candidate, saying: ‘He thinks the bus has moved on and that there’s a new generation.’ Instead they suggested he could return as Shadow Chancellor under a new leader – either Miss Cooper or Mr Miliband’s brother David. Labour was yesterday forced to dismiss claims of a split over economic policy after Jim Murphy – the most senior Blairite remaining on the front line – said the party needed to show ‘credibility’ by explaining where it would make cuts. The party’s defence spokesman said he accepted £5billion-worth of the Government’s military cuts and acknowledged that Labour would have to make reductions if it won power. ‘It is important to be both credible and popular when it comes to defence investment and the economics of defence,’ Mr Murphy said. ‘At a time on defence when the Government is neither credible nor popular it is compulsory that Labour is both.’ Treasury minister Chloe Smith said the remarks by Mr Murphy – who was joint campaign manager for David Miliband’s 2010 leadership campaign – amounted to an ‘extraordinary attack’ on Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. ‘This is the latest blow to Ed Miliband as even his own Shadow Cabinet are losing confidence in Labour’s economic policy,’ she said.",One person Tories fear emerged with any credit from financial crisis .
"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Last updated at 1:18 AM on 8th January 2012 . Betty Yates was found dead at her home in the picturesque town of Bewdley, in Worcestershire, which sits on the River Severn . A message on Facebook . suggests a woman knows who killed a retired teacher found stabbed at her . riverside cottage, police said yesterday. Detectives revealed they want to . trace the woman, using the name Katie Eldridge, who posted the message . on a memorial page on the social networking site for 77-year-old widow . Betty Yates. The message read: ‘She wasnt meant 2 b . home, the lad panikd and stabd her cus she told them off 4 bein in her . house. It was meant 2 b a clean sweep but  she was home, she didnt stand . chance.’ Mrs Yates was found dead in the . living room of her £300,000 home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on . Wednesday morning. Police believe she could have been the victim of a . botched break-in. Detectives said the message was . removed from the page – called ‘RIP Betty Yates, the best teacher there . was’ – before they were made aware of it. But they said it was a line of . inquiry they were pursuing and they were keen to find Katie Eldridge, . whose message carries a picture of a dog or wolf-like creature. Mrs Yates’s family joined police in a renewed appeal for information yesterday. Her children, Hazel and David, . described their mother as ‘vivacious, independent, popular and a true . lady. She had a lovely character’. Detectives are investigating the . possibility the 77-year-old grandmother died tackling a burglar at her . home in a beauty spot popular with walkers and anglers. She died in the living area of the . cottage, which lies at the end of a mile-long track between woodland and . the Severn near Bewdley in Worcestershire. Officers recovered a knife. Friends had urged the retired teacher . to leave the isolated £300,000 property following the death seven years . ago at 71 of her husband, Raymond, a consultant engineer. They described her as independent and feisty and liable to ‘put up a good fight’. Picturesque: Police have launched a murder inquiry after the body of Betty Yates was found in her riverside cottage in Bewdley, Worcestershire . West Mercia Police said Mrs Yates had . been subjected to a violent attack at some point between Monday and . Wednesday, when her body was found. A local man told yesterday how he had . overheard one policeman close to the scene say ‘it appeared as if it . was a burglary gone wrong’. He added: ‘It looks like the woman fought the burglar but was killed as a result. It’s tragic but sadly a sign of the times.’ Mrs Yates was a member of the Wyre . Forest branch of the University of the Third Age, an educational group . for retired people, and ran the group’s book club. Jeanne Round, a fellow member, said: . ‘She was a lovely lady. She used to get books out of the library for us . and we would all go round to her house by the river to discuss them.’ Another neighbour, Lynne Marshall, . said: ‘I know that friends had tried to urge her to move closer into the . community because she was so isolated where she lives but she always . refused. Remote spot: Friends had urged the widow to move out of her isolated home (circled) after her husband died seven years ago . ‘She said her memories of her time . with Ray were in the house and she didn’t want to lose that.Betty still . drove her car and went to art classes, she was very fit and feisty and I . would say she probably put up a good fight.’ Mrs Yates was known locally as ‘Beautiful Betty’ in tribute to her good looks in her youth. Last night the track leading to her property remained sealed off as police continued to search the surrounding woodland. The Geopark Way long-distance trail, . which runs for 109 miles from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to Gloucester, is . signposted down the track from the main road. Detectives have set up an incident . room at Stourport police station, with more than 40 staff on the case. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson, who is leading the . investigation, confirmed Mrs Yates had been killed with a knife. Search: Police teams were scouring a lengthy track on the western bank of the Severn near Bewdley yesterday . Isolated: Police in Dowles Road, Bewdley, near the cottage where Mrs Yates's body was found . He added: ‘The lady who died was subjected to a violent attack and we are determined to catch the person or people responsible. ‘I would urge anyone who has any information at all that could help our investigation to come forward without delay.’ Three police vehicles could be seen near the cottage and six more were parked beside the Severn in the track off Dowles Road, near the remains of a disused railway bridge . Mrs Yates’s elder sister, Joan Church, 79, described her as a ‘wonderful, wonderful sister’. Mrs Church, who lives near Ludlow in Shropshire, added: ‘I’m so proud to have known Betty. There’s nothing more I can say, except I am absolutely devastated.’ Hazel Costello, a 53-year-old . solicitor who is one of Mrs Yates’s two children, was too upset to . comment on the tragedy yesterday at her country home outside Stafford. Mrs Yates taught for many years at St John Church of England Middle School in Blakebrook, Kidderminster. Former pupil Verity Worthington said . teaching was her passion: ‘She had a way with children – she didn’t just . teach us, she loved every single one of us, as we did her. ‘She encouraged us to read, to knit, . and to think outside the box. Betty had a great sense of humour – she . was gentle and loving, yet witty and funny. ‘She . loved where she lived, in a cottage on the outskirts of Bewdley, where . she had the memories of her husband, Ray. She missed him tremendously, . yet doted on her two granddaughters and always talked of them with . pride.’ Horror: Police at the scene in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on Wednesday night shortly after the body was discovered .",Poster named Katie Eldridge may know 77-year-old's killer .
"By . Richard Shears and Damien Gayle . Last updated at 10:46 AM on 8th January 2012 . The pilot of a hot air balloon which burst into flames after hitting power lines, killing 11 people on board, had been due to marry his fiancee - and the invitations had been posted on the day he died. In a sad twist of irony, just days after Lance Hopping was killed in the horrific accident in New Zealand, his family and friends will start to receive invitations to his wedding. The 50-year-old pilot was due to marry his long-term partner Nina Kelynack in April and the invitations had been posted on the day of his ill-fated flight, it has been reported. Family man: Pilot Lance Hopping, who was a father and grandfather, with his fiancee Nina Kelynack who he was due to marry in April . 'Hell of a nice guy': Mr Hopping was described as an experienced and safety-conscious pilot . Robert Clyde, Mr Hopping's cousin, told New Zealand's Stuff website: 'The invitations are in the mail now, they were posted yesterday. We were all looking forward to a big reunion. 'Lance rung me a few weeks ago to say to expect an invitation, and that he hoped we could make it for the wedding.' The pilot's father Robert Hopping said . the family were in a state of shock, adding: 'We are coping, but we are a . bit of a zombie house at the moment.' Fellow balloonists praised Mr Hopping, who has two children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren, as an experienced pilot who was safety-conscious and a 'hell of a nice guy'. He had clocked up more than 1,000 hours flying balloons over 15 years and had flown all over the world. Witnesses said the hot air balloon . turned into a horrifying tower of 'sheer flame' after hitting power . lines in rural New Zealand yesterday, killing all those riding on-board.

Emergency crews survey the crash site from a fire service cherry picker as they cordon off the road running past through the town of Carterton . Police said five couples and the . pilot were killed when the hot air balloon crashed near Wellington in an . area that is popular with thrill-seeking tourists. As authorities continued their investigation into the horrific accident, the identities of some of those killed on board began to emerge. Retired couple Desmond and Ann Dean, from Masterson, were thought to have received the hot air balloon trip as a Christmas present from their children while Howard and Diana Cox, from Wellington, were also reported to have been among those killed. Alexis Still, from Wellington, and her boyfriend Chrisjan Jordaan were also thought to have been on board, as were an unnamed mother and daughter. Two other passengers - a man and a woman who have not been named - jumped to their deaths trying to escape the blazing balloon. Despite arriving on the scene within three minutes, emergency services were unable to save any of those on board. The balloon was coming to the end of a 45-minute flight and the pilot was thought to be trying to land in a paddock. Tragic: A police officer approaches grieving people grieving at a police road block near the scene of the crash . Shock: Relatives and friends in grief at the scene of the crash. The tragic accident was witnessed by dozens of locals . Some of the victims' families were . thought to be on the ground and watched helplessly as their loved ones . plummeted to their deaths, Stuff reported. One witness said relatives 'were just . crying' and 'inconsolable' while another revealed that two sisters had . been following the balloon as their parents rode in it and 'saw it fall . out of the sky'. In a particularly heart-rending . account, one witness told Stuff that they heard a woman in her 30s tell . someone in a phonecall: 'Mum and dad have been in a hot air balloon . accident. They've hit powerlines and they're dead.' Disaster victim identification . experts have been working through the wreckage in a bid to officially . identify the victims, some of which are badly burned. Nine bodies remain at the scene while . two others have been taken to a mortuary at Wellington Hospital the . Sydney Morning Herald reported. Local Mayor Ron Mark said those on board were a mix of local people and tourists. Early reports suggested a fire had . started in the basket, causing the canopy to ignite, resulting in the . apparatus plunging to the ground in flames, giving no hope for those on . board. Balloon pilot Lance Hopping, one of those killed in the hot air balloon accident that killed eleven people in Carterton, New Zealand, this morning . One witness said that amid screams . from those in the basket, two of the passengers had jumped out to avoid . the flames as it plunged. The pilot and five couples from the . Wellington area, about 95 miles (150 kilometers) south of the crash . site, were killed. According to reports, at least one couple received . their tickets on the balloon trip as a present. Some of the bodies were badly burned, said Superintendent Mike Rusbatch, a police district commander in Wellington, the capital. 'It's . a tragedy as bad as tragedies get,' local police commander Brent . Register said. Superintedent Rusbatch said it appeared the balloon's . basket struck power lines that set a fire on board. Witnesses . told local media of seeing 32ft (10m) high flames rising from the . basket of the dark blue and maroon striped balloon before it plummeted . to the farmland below. Bevan Lambeth said the basket was on . fire 'and the power lines were holding the basket down, but it was still . about 50m (165ft) in the air. Then the whole basket started to go up in . flames,' as the balloon broke clear of the electric lines. 'I . saw ... (it) then go straight up in the air and the flames just . engulfed the whole balloon and it crashed to the ground. When it came . down it came down really quickly,' he told TVOne News. An aerial photo of the crash site shows two circles of black ash in a green field, close to a white house. Rusbatch, the police commander, said two people jumped from the basket before it hit the ground, but did not survive. 'We . believe we know who the victims were,' he told the news website Stuff. '... A tragedy for those involved and their families.' The only victim publicly identified . so far is the pilot and balloon owner, Lance Hopping. He was safety . officer for the Balloons over Wairarapa annual event, and was considered . an experienced and safety-conscious pilot. David McKinlay, who lives near . the crash site near the small town of Carterton witnessed the crash as he was watering his garden. He said it looked as if . the pilot had tried to take the balloon higher. 'It was just flames and it was just a long streak of flames, probably about 10 meters long. The impact must have been terrible.' Mr McKinlay said the dark blue and maroon-striped balloon was about 150m in the air and dropped quickly. Grim: District Commander, Superintendent Mike Rusbatch, left, with Wairarapa Area Commander, Inspector Brent Register speak to the media near the crash scene . Police have cordoned off the impact zone around where the balloon landed in Carterton, on New Zealand's north island . 'It was just a sheer flame as it hit the ground,' he said. 'It came down like a bloody rocket and there there was a big bang.' Trout fisherman Kevin Curd saw the . balloon disappear behind a hill and then, within five seconds 'it was . blue grey smoke. It shot down but there were no flames then.' The crash has shocked the small . farming community on the North Island. Mrs Aurea Hickland watched in . horror as the balloon came down. 'It was just terrible,' she told the . New Zealand Herald. 'We were just having breakfast and we have big windows that face out onto where the balloon was coming down. 'I got up to have a cup of tea and I . looked out the window and saw the balloon coming down. But then it . started to shoot up in the air. 'I said to my husband ""Oh no, the . basket's on fire, the basket's on fire."" This map shows the location of Carterton, New Zealand, where the horrifying balloon crash happened . 'And it shot up in the air, which I . guess was because of the heat and we saw two people jump out and . everyone was screaming - the screaming was just terrible - and then when . the canopy went up flames it just dropped. 'It was going up at a very big rate. I wouldn't like to say how high but it was a very long way up.' Mrs Hickland said that when she saw two people jump she told her husband Neil: 'They won't survive it.' She added: 'It was just awful. Neil ran out and then came back with . two of the family members (who were waiting for the balloon to land) and . one was saying that they had bought the tickets for their parents for . Christmas. They just kept saying ""How are we going to tell our . children?""' Conditions were described as perfect . at the time of the horror incident, which occurred close to 7.30am on . Saturday, New Zealand time. Resident Don Cunningham told TVNZ that he heard screaming and shouting and then 'suddenly a big pall of smoke.' The balloon was a Cameron A-210, which can carry 10 passengers and a pilot. New Zealand Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee expressed condolences to the bereaved families on behalf of the government. 'We are deeply sorry to learn of this tragic accident and our hearts go out to those who are now mourning the loss of life,' Mr Brownlee said. New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission opened an immediate inquiry. Investigating officer Peter Williams said investigators had looked at the crash site but had yet to begin witness interviews. The investigation could take up to a year, he said. The crash was the deadliest air disaster in New Zealand since 1963, when a DC-3 airliner crashed in the Kaimai Range, killing all 23 passengers and crew aboard, according to the History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage. In 1979, an Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner on a scenic flight slammed into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 people on board.","Pilot Lance Hopping was among the 11 killed in the air accident .

But new owner Kraft complains this makes them virtually impossible for shoppers to see. Firm favourite: For the past 186 years, the chocolate maker's slabs of confectionery have been stacked flat in boxes at checkouts . Boosting profits: The expensive 'innovation' is aimed at capturing more impulse purchases . Now, just over a year after the quintessentially English firm was taken over by the American processed-cheese giant, it has spent £6million on new packaging to make the chocolate bars stand erect in their cardboard boxes, the Mail can reveal. The expensive ‘innovation’ is aimed at capturing more impulse purchases. Research showed customers are more likely to succumb to their sweet tooth if they see a complete bar of chocolate rather than just its side. Kraft is using the cash on a new production line at its factory in Birmingham to repackage bars of Dairy Milk, Whole Nut, and Fruit and Nut. Each cardboard box will be fitted with a spring that prevents the bars from falling over. It also pushes the confectionery forward each time one is removed. Customers will see the new packs in the first half of next year.

Kraft’s UK president Nick Bunker said: ‘Installation of the new packaging equipment at the famous factory in Bournville will begin in the New Year. ‘Shelf Ready Packaging allows retailers to simply remove the front of the case containing the chocolate bars and put it straight on to the stores’ shelves. ‘This will see the bars stacked upright on shelf, ensuring they stand out. Previously, they would have been packed flat – making them harder to find for the shopper.’ The substantial investment is likely to raise eyebrows at a time when hundreds of factory workers have spent their festive break worrying about job security. Earlier this month the American food giant said it would axe 200 jobs. It is seeking the voluntary redundancies in March.",New owner Kraft say Daily Milk bars are too hard for shoppers to see .

Buckingham Palace was adamant yesterday that the Countess of Wessex would not hand back two sets of jewels given to her by a brutal Arab regime. Despite mounting criticism of the gifts – revealed by the Daily Mail on Saturday – a spokesman said the hugely valuable gems from the ruling family of Bahrain had been accepted as an ‘official gift’. They were received during the course of the countess’s public duties on behalf of the Queen, which means she is permitted to keep them on behalf of the Crown.

She is pictured here with Prince Edward on a trip to Bahrain .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 2:07 PM on 4th January 2012 . The British Medical Journal has raised concern that some test results are deliberately hidden . Missing data from clinical trials could endanger patients, health experts have warned. The British Medical Journal has raised concern that some test results go unreported and are deliberately hidden, enabling pharmaceutical firms to make unfounded claims. Commenting on the findings, Dr Richard Lehman from Oxford University and the journal's Dr Elizabeth Loder stated that more effective regulation is needed to prevent this trend. They called for an end to the 'culture of haphazard publication and incomplete data disclosure'. The medical publication released several papers looking into the problem of unpublished data, and highlighted that missing data 'distorts the scientific record' and undermines the 'whole endeavour of clinical medicine'. Dr Lehman and Dr Loder continued: 'Clinical medicine involves making decisions under uncertainty. 'Clinical research aims to reduce this uncertainty, usually by performing experiments on groups of people who consent to run the risks of such trials in the belief that the resulting knowledge will benefit others. 'Most clinicians assume that the complex regulatory systems that govern human research ensure that this knowledge is relevant, reliable and properly disseminated. 'It generally comes as a shock to clinicians, and certainly to the public, to learn that this is far from the case.' One U.S. study from Yale University found that fewer than half of the 635 National Institutes of Health funded trials were published in a peer-reviewed, medical journal within 30 months of trial completion. Lead researcher Joesph Ross said: 'Physicians and policy-makers generally depend on peer-reviewed publications to learn about clinical trial findings. 'However, extensive research has shown that the results of studies are often not shared publicly in a timely way.' More robust regulation and full access to the raw data, is now being called for to ensure greater transparency. BMJ authors stated that those who deliberately hide findings 'have breached their ethical duty to trial participants'. The pair concluded: 'These changes have long been called for, and delay has already caused harm. 'The evidence we publish shows that the current situation is a disservice to research participants, patients, health systems, and the whole endeavour of clinical medicine.' The BMJ has previously attacked the drug industry for being slow to publish data from trials of drugs in development, and also from trials of medicines already licensed and on the market.","Test results are deliberately hidden .
