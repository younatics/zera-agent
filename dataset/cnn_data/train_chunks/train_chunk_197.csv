"(CNN) -- The SpaceX rocket, the first official commercial flight to the International Space Station, lifted off Sunday night carrying an unmanned cargo capsule. The Falcon 9 rocket with its Dragon capsule launched on schedule at 8:35 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with an orange blaze against the black night sky. About 10 minutes into the flight, the Dragon separated from the rocket and was on its way to the station. Mission control called it ""a picture-perfect launch and a flawless flight of Falcon."" It is is the first of a dozen NASA-contracted flights to resupply the International Space Station, at a total cost of $1.6 billion. ""It's a great evening,"" said SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell after the launch. ""It's just awesome."" The launch comes nearly five months after a demonstration mission in which a Dragon capsule successfully berthed at the station and returned to Earth. Shotwell said the Sunday mission isn't ""substantially different"" from that flight, ""with the exception that we got there once."" U.S. astronaut to fly aboard Russian craft . The unmanned capsule is packed with about 1,000 pounds of cargo -- everything from low-sodium food kits to clothing and computer hard drives. It's scheduled to return in late October with about 2,000 pounds of cargo, including scientific experiments and failed equipment that can be repaired and sent back, ISS Program Manager Mike Suffredini said. ""These flights are critical to the space station's sustainment and to begin full utilization of the space station for research and technology development,"" he said. The Dragon spacecraft is supposed to catch up with the space station early Wednesday. Station Commander Sunita Williams and Aki Hoshide from the Japanese Space Agency will use the robotic arm to grab Dragon and berth it to the station. Mars rover gets to play in the sand . Much of Dragon's cargo is material to support extensive experimentation aboard the space station. One deals with plant growth. Plants on Earth use about 50% of their energy for support to overcome gravity. Researchers want to understand how the genes that control that process would operate in microgravity -- when objects are in free-fall in space. Down the road, that could benefit food supplies here on the planet. Photo: SpaceX the 'beginning of a new era' The spacecraft is also carrying nearly two dozen microgravity experiments designed and being flown through the Student Experiment Spaceflight Program. SpaceX is not the only commercial company in the spacefaring business. Within the next few months, Orbital Sciences is expected to fly its own demonstration flight to the space station. Instead of using Cape Canaveral as its launch site, the company's rocket will take off from Wallops Island off the coast of Virginia. Orbital has a nearly $2 billion contract with NASA for station resupply missions. Shuttle makes final landing . SpaceX founder Elon Musk is looking well beyond just these cargo flights to the station. SpaceX is one of three companies NASA has selected to continue work developing a human-rated spacecraft that would carry astronauts to the International Space Station. Boeing and Sierra Nevada are the other two companies. The SpaceX plan is to modify the Dragon capsule to carry people. NASA Administror Charles Bolden praised Sunday's launch as an example of private industry's capability. By hiring private companies to conduct the resupply missions, he said, NASA can focus on exploring even deeper in the solar system, including missions to an asteroid and to Mars.","The SpaceX president says it was ""just awesome""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- All agree that scores angry at Egypt's military-backed government and the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy died in late-night clashes in the volatile nation's capital. But they are of opposite minds as to who began firing first and who is to blame. Dr. Mohammed Ali Sultan, chairman of Egypt's ambulance services, told CNN that 72 had been killed in Nasr City, an area of Cairo the Muslim Brotherhood has made its base after the group's former leader was forced from power and ordered jailed. Medics in a Brotherhood field hospital there earlier Saturday had put the death toll at 66, with another 61 on life support and thousands more wounded. How did they end up in such straits? Ask the Muslim Brotherhood -- the Islamist group that was sidelined under longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak only to become the country's dominant political force after his forced exit in 2011 -- and its members will say police fired live ammunition on protesters Friday and Saturday. A wounded protester getting medical treatment at a field hospital said he saw men in plainclothes fire on pro-Morsy demonstrators with shotguns. He referred to them as ""thugs,"" a term commonly used for young men who support the government and resort to violence. ""Police forces were standing behind them. Also, military forces were outside blocking three entrances to Rabaa Adawiya neighborhood,"" the protester said, adding he had also seen corpses with gunshot wounds at the hospital. Yet the prosecutor general's office, according to a report early Sunday on state-run Nile TV, concluded that protesters not only initiated the clashes but also fired live bullets on security forces. A police spokesman likewise rejected any allegations police opened fire, saying they only used tear gas canisters and were not responsible for the deaths. Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim offered a similar view during a televised news conference. The protesters were at fault for starting violence that wounded 14 police, none of whom fired back, he said. ""I want to emphasize here that the Interior Ministry police force has never and will never fire its weapons at any Egyptian citizen,"" Ibrahim said. Fresh clashes erupted early Sunday in Helwan south of Cairo between residents there and pro-Morsy protesters, reported state TV, citing witnesses. Meanwhile, an attorney has filed a lawsuit at a district court in Cairo, asking that the military overthrow of Morsy be overturned. Tarek Al Kashef is basing his challenge on the country's constitution, specifically sections that stipulate that a presidential term is four years and that the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces. A hearing is slated for October 8. Large, rival rallies in Egypt after judge orders deposed president jailed . Morsy may join Mubarak -- in prison . Morsy has not been seen publicly since the military forced him from office July 3. The military has not commented on his whereabouts, though a Brotherhood spokesman told CNN he was initially under house arrest at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo and later was moved to the Defense Ministry. Nasser Amin -- a lawyer who met with Morsy's former chief of staff, Refa'a al-Tahtawi, who also is being detained -- told CNN that the former president is being ""treated with the utmost respect ... like a statesman."" Yet Amin said that Morsy and others who are being held ""can't contact the outside world or lawyers."" The former Muslim Brotherhood leader became Egypt's first democratically president in June 2012 but found himself at odds with the opposition before the military removed him from power and detained him this month. State media reported he's being held in relation to a jailbreak that took place during Egypt's 2011 revolution but well before he came to power. Prosecutors, who ordered a probe two weeks ago, said the escape of Morsy and 18 other Brotherhood members (among others) was plotted by ""foreign elements"" including Hamas, its military wing, the Islamic Palestinian Army and Hezbollah. The Muslim Brotherhood was named as a domestic group that cooperated with those who broke them out of prison. Morsy -- who local media reports say was in prison for a single day without any formal charges against him -- is accused of escaping, destroying the prison's official records and intentionally killing and abducting police officers and prisoners. Now he could be headed back not just to prison, but the same one where Mubarak, the ousted dictator he and his allies have long railed against, is being held. Ibrahim said Saturday that such a move will probably happen, though an investigative judge will make the final decision on Morsy's next destination. U.S. opts not to define Egypt ouster as a coup . Government awaits legal OK 'to end the protests' Neither side gave any hint of backing down -- not just on who's to blame for the latest violence but on the bigger question of whether Morsy should have been deposed and, more recently, ordered jailed over his alleged actions well before he rose to power. Since Morsy's ouster, supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, have staged mass rallies and sit-ins across the North African nation. There have been rival rallies as well such as the ones Friday called by military chief Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to show support for the army's effort to end what he calls ""terrorism"" -- a statement condemned by the Brotherhood as ""inciting violence and hatred."" Mutual trust appears absent as does the prospect of a peaceful resolution anytime soon. Leaders of the pro-Morsy movement refuse to recognize the interim government or cooperate with it. The interior minister, meanwhile, had pledged that these rallies will be brought to an end soon. ""We have complete coordination between the police and the armed forces to end the protests at the proper time,"" Ibrahim said. ""... But we are waiting for the prosecutor's office to issue orders so can we have the legal cover for it."" Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down . Officials worldwide express concern . Egypt has been on edge since the military forced out Mubarak in early 2011. Yet the situation has clearly gotten more dire in recent weeks. The European Union's foreign minister condemned the killings of pro-Morsy protesters in Nasr City as well as bellicose language by some Egyptian officials. ""There is no room for hate-speech and other forms of incitement,"" according to a statement released by Catherine Ashton's office. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke Saturday with al-Sisi, his Egyptian counterpart, to encourage restraint, said Pentagon spokesman George Little. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry talked Saturday with Egypt's interim vice president and its foreign minister to express Washington's deep concern about the bloodshed. ""This is a pivotal moment for Egypt,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""Over two years ago, the revolution began. Its final verdict is not decided, but it will be forever impacted by what happens now."" Morsy a victim of Egypt's revolution of the mind . CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Cairo, and Greg Botelho and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball on Friday sued a South Florida clinic Biogenesis of America and several men associated with it for flouting its drug prevention program by allegedly providing performance enhancing substances to players, the pro sports league said. According to reports and the MLB suit, filed in Florida's Miami-Dade County, the clinic reportedly supplied banned performance enhancing substances to a number of current and former pro baseball players such as ex-Boston Red Sox Manny Ramirez. ""We believe we have a legitimate legal claim against the defendants, and we intend to pursue it vigorously,"" said Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president of economics and legal affairs. A phone call placed Friday night by CNN to Bosch's lawyer was not immediately returned. Previously, CNN has been unable to reach those involved in the clinic. And after the New Times story broke, a CNN crew went to the Coral Gables, Florida, address of the Biogenesis clinic and found its offices vacant. A-Rod denies performance-enhancing drugs reports . The 14-page complaint names Biogenesis, its predecessor and six individuals -- among them its program director Anthony Bosch, others at the company, someone who worked at a sports agency, a former University of Miami baseball player and a ""self-proclaimed chemist"" who supplied substances. The accused, according to Major League Baseball, solicited players, supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations in order not to test positive for banned substances under the league's program. ""(The defendants) knowingly and intentionally caused and/or induced ... players to breach their contractual obligations under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,"" the complaint said. The complaint did not specify how much money it is seeking, beyond that it's more than $15,000. But it insists the league rightfully deserves to be paid given what BioGenesis and its affiliates have done to the sport. ""MLB has suffered damages, including the costs of (the) investigation, loss of goodwill, loss of revenue and profits and injury to its reputation, image, strategic advantage and fan relationships,"" the league alleges in its complaint. After a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa racing to break Roger Maris's single-season home run record in 1998, followed three years later by Barry Bonds breaking the new record -- Major League Baseball came under a cloud amid allegations it hadn't done enough to recognize, and combat, the use of performance enhancing substances. The league, in conjunction with its players' union, in recent years has beefed up its drug testing programs and penalties. A number of top-level and minor league players have been suspended as a result, like Ramirez who was suspended 50 games in 2009. Biogenesis became part of this story publicly in late January, when the Miami New Times reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes were named in records kept over several years by the clinic. CNN was unable to independently obtain the documents the newspaper said it based its reporting on. And New Times reported earlier this month that it refused Major League Baseball's request for records that contributed to its story. One of those players named by the publication is Alex Rodriguez, a 37-year-old New York Yankee who ranks fifth in home runs in major league history. Shortly after the New Times article came out, ESPN.com published a story quoting unidentified sources as describing how Bosch allegedly went to Rodriguez's waterfront Florida mansion when summoned and injected the star player with performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs. Rodriguez's camp subsequently released a statement denying any connection to the Biogenesis' clinic's owner while disputing the aforementioned reports. ""The purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez -- are not legitimate,"" the player's public relations agent said.","NEW: Major League Baseball says it lost revenue and ""goodwill"" due to clinic's actions .

"(CNN) -- Social networking may be one of the biggest phenomenons of the 21st century, but for some denizens of the Web, it's a way to get in touch with the past. Web sites like livinghistoryworldwide.com (with a membership of more than 5,700) and groups on Facebook allow people who enjoy past eras to connect with each other. But it goes beyond that: Some of them dress and live like they would decades, if not centuries, ago. Step into Estelle Barada's living room in Providence, Rhode Island, and you might feel like you've traveled back to the 1890s. Barada, a hotel caterer, sees it as an escape from her stressful job. ""I was the middle child and kind of like the dreamer, and for some strange reason I always dreamed of living not in America, but England,"" she explained. ""I imagined having tea with the queen and touring the castle and that was my dream as a little girl."" Today, ""Lady Estelle,"" as she likes to be called, lives out that dream by hosting tea parties for her friends while dressed in Victorian clothing, completely in character. When going out, she's dressed in a more understated fashion, but still completely consistent with the late 1800s, with a long skirt and hat. ""I always wear hats and when I go shopping, I get the attention of the older women, who say, I love the way you look,"" she said. iReport: Fashions of a modern-day Victorian . ""Eighteen-seventy-four should have been my birth date ... instead of 1974,"" said Raychyl Whyte of Hamilton, Ontario. Her fascination with the Victorian era began in childhood, coinciding with a pop cultural revival of Victorian themes in the 1970s. Whyte and her ""Victorian gentleman"" began restoration on a circa-1898 house in 2008. Now they host 1800s-themed events there, where dress from the time period is always encouraged. They use Meetup.com to organize these events as part of the Hamilton Victorian & Steampunk Society. Why would one live this lifestyle? For many of these iReporters, it's a reaction to modern society just as much as a love of the fashion and style of days gone by. ""I suppose others might call me an eccentric, but I just live the life I want to live and don't care about what others say or think about me,"" said Ray Frensham, a ""Living Victorian,"" from London, England. ""Even though I've felt increasingly disconnected from the modern world for many years now, I'm not retreating into some past nether-world seeking a kind of comfort-blanket."" Modern society in the United Kingdom can be ""remarkably cruel and unforgiving,"" Frensham said. ""There is certainly no sense of any kind of community anymore,"" he said. ""People are purely self-centered, only in it for what they can get out of themselves."" He points to the recent MP expenses scandal there, which led to the resignation of British House of Commons Speaker Michael Martin, as an example. At the same time, something just feels right to Frensham when he wears a suit and bow tie, or more recently, an ascot. ""It just creates a mind set that you're ready to face the day,"" he said. Frensham is also the coordinator of the London Victorian Strollers, who take walks around the city while decked out in Victorian garb, and says that the reaction from passersby, especially tourists, is extremely positive. ""It's quite extraordinary, people just love it."" Social networking certainly plays a large role, but Frensham also believes that groups like the Victorian Strollers (with its 125 members on Facebook) are emerging more and more lately. ""I think it's just a lot of people saying 'I don't like what I see anymore, so let's create our own reality.' "" Carmen Johnson of Orlando, Florida, certainly sees that as being the case. She runs one of several social networking sites that bring together retro lifestyle enthusiasts of all stripes. ""The first thing I ask [members of the Web site] is what they would like to bring from the past. Many of them say they would like to see the return of good manners and morals,"" she said. ""They like the values of respect for women, respect for others. Now with the society we live in, anything goes."" Johnson, like Frensham, can trace at least some of what influences her to Hollywood. Growing up in the 1970s and '80s, she was a big fan of ""Grease,"" Elvis Presley and ""I Love Lucy,"" but ""Back to the Future"" captured her imagination. ""Just thinking about traveling in time to whatever year that I always dreamed about was fascinating to me!"" she said. Needless to say, the 1950s are her favorite era. This translated into her pursuit of art, which she described as both modern and retro. When her love of this time translated into reality upon viewing a documentary about ""time warp wives,"" she was inspired to start the blog Timewarpwives.com, eager for the opportunity to interview women who live their lives as ""traditional 1950s housewives."" iReport: Johnson's life as a ""retro artist"" Now, those with casual interest as well as those who live their lives in a past era, what Johnson calls ""timewarpians,"" interact on her site, Timewarpliving.com, which boasts more than 250 members. ""When people come to this site, they see that they're not alone,"" she said. Johnson considers ""Lady Estelle"" Barada to be a great example of a ""timewarpian."" Barada hopes to pass on the manners, if not necessarily the fashion, of the era to the next generation by hosting parties with young girls and teaching them about etiquette. As for her own granddaughters, she said they love paying a visit. ""They ask their mother if they can wear a pretty dress and go to grandmother's house.""","Social networking allows those who enjoy past eras to connect .

"(CNN) -- New details are emerging about the agent sent by Saudi counterterrorism agents into Yemen to track a plot by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner. The agent is of Arabic origin but holds a British passport, according to Mustafa Alani, director of security studies at the Gulf Research Center. Alani was briefed on the operation by Saudi counterterrorism officials. The agent, whom another source said had Saudi roots, lived for a long time in the UK and at some point fell in with jihadist sympathizers, Alani told CNN. That made him an attractive target for Saudi counterterrorism agencies, which recruited him about a year ago, Alani said. His background gave him the credibility to infiltrate AQAP, the Yemeni-based branch of the terrorist organization, which is exceptionally careful about whom it accepts and trusts. At the same time, his possession of a British passport enhanced his appeal to the terror group -- because he could travel without a visa to the United States. According to Alani, the agent was sent into Yemen as a potential suicide bomber after the Saudis heard from other informants that a new AQAP plot was in the works. The agent enrolled in an Arabic language school in Yemen in the hope of being talent-spotted by the group. AQAP fell for the bait and the mole connected with the group. After he joined them he had to handle the tremendous pressure of what discovery by al Qaeda would entail, said Alani. Two or three months ago, the agent learned that the group was working on a new device to bomb a U.S.-bound airplane, and he contacted Saudi counterterrorism officials from Yemen. At this point they informed the Americans of the potential threat, and that they had a mole inside the group, according to Alani. The agent was later provided training in how to use the explosive device in a training facility in Yemen, possibly inside a safe house, according to Alani. ""He received instruction how to how to avoid detection at the airport, how to behave,"" Alani told CNN. ""Apparently he was able to convince al Qaeda that he is genuinely ready to carry out the mission."" Alani said his understanding was that AQAP intended the would-be suicide bomber to fly through a Gulf country to connect to a U.S. bound flight. The Saudi operation culminated with the agent and another Saudi informant -- likely his handler -- being whisked out of Yemen, Alani said. The Saudis knew they would never be able to use the agent again, and they and smuggled him through a number of Middle Eastern countries to protect him from al Qaeda retaliation, Alani told CNN. ""My information that he was pulled out after the device was handed to him, and they ordered the green light to carry out the operation. I don't think he was pulled out prematurely,"" Alani told CNN. ""The family is secure, and the man is outside the Middle East,"" Alani told CNN. The device that AQAP bomb-makers had built for the mole was flown from Yemen to Saudi Arabia by Saudi counter-terrorism agents and handed over -- around April 20th -- to U.S. intelligence officials. They subsequently took it to the United States for forensic analysis, Alani told CNN. He also said the intelligence community remained deeply worried that similar devices might be unaccounted for and that AQAP may be planning a similar operation. The details collected from the device brought out of Yemen could allow for important counter-measures to thwart al Qaeda's next operation. The recovered device had two triggering mechanisms -- one involving a chemical reaction and one designed to be set off manually -- to maximize the chances that the device would work, said Alani. It contained 250-300 grams of the high explosive PETN, a slightly smaller amount than that used in two printer cartridges for an October 2010 plot aimed at blowing up cargo planes en route to the United States. Those devices were intercepted after a tip by Saudi counterterrorism, and had the potential to bring down a plane, according to British and U.S. officials. The underwear device used in the attempt to bring down a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 contained about 200 grams of the same explosive. Saudi counter-terrorism officials believe the device was likely constructed by a team working under the supervision of Ibrahim al-Asiri, AQAP's chief bomb-maker. When the device used in the Christmas Day plot was examined, a set of fingerprints matched those of al-Asiri held in a Saudi database. Alani said al-Asiri was the target of a drone strike last year after Yemeni and Saudi intelligence developed information about his possible location. The Yemenis, he said, subsequently established that another member of the group and not al-Asiri was killed in the strike. Meanwhile, a source working closely with U.S. intelligence agencies and the military told CNN that al Qaeda's Yemeni affilliate now has ""a whole outfit designated to target the U.S. homeland."" The United States believes AQAP is working on ""several types of bombs"" that could get past airport X-ray screening machines. Counterterrorism officials in the Gulf and the United States say that AQAP's expansion in Yemen over the past two to three years has given it greater breathing room and resources to plot attacks against the United States. ""This is going to give them a major advantage in future operations,"" Alani told CNN. The group operates out of rudimentary training camps in southern Yemen. Thought it has not yet succeeded in any bomb plot targeting Americans, observers say there are several bombmakers and a group of would-be suicide bombers working inside the group. ""What I think is concerning to myself and other people is that it seems the talent of the organization is getting better,"" said Gregory Johnsen, a Near East studies scholar at Princeton University. ""That is, they are much more capable of carrying out attacks. So when something fails, like the Christmas Day plot in 2009 or again, the cartridge plot in 2010, the organization is able to adapt. And the next time they come back, they present a better and more lethal threat. I think that's what has a lot of people in U.S. and Saudi intelligence quite concerned."" CNN has previously reported that al-Asiri has been involved in training both bombmakers and suicide bombers. The U.S.-affilliated source said al-Asiri is now not making all the components himself, giving the group extra security and the advantage of having multiple manufacturing capabilities if al-Asiri were to be killed. The source also confirmed that the device the mole turned over had no metallic parts and an advanced detonation system to improve the chances the entire bomb would explode. AQAP bomb designs are aimed at hiding explosives in clothing, camera lenses and animals, according to the source. And the fundamental growth in AQAP's ability to control territory has made them tougher to target since the 2009 incident, Johnsen said. ""AQAP at that time was about two to three hundred members, and it controlled no territory in Yemen. Now, two and a half years later, the terror group has more than tripled in strength to over a thousand members and it controls a great amount of territory in southern Yemen,"" Johnsen said. He said the group controls towns, is running its own police department and in some places has established court systems. ""It's providing services -- electricity and water -- to some of the citizens, and really it sees itself in parts of southern Yemen as a government,"" he said.

"(Mental Floss) -- We've all been there: a week until payday, the rent is due, and you're rummaging in your parents' attic to find Dad's Mickey Mantle rookie card. Only 36 of 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence have been found intact since 1820. If you're in need of some quick cash, here are six stories of people who found a fortune when -- and where -- they least expected it. 1. Lose a hammer, find a horde . In November 1992, a farmer living near the village of Hoxne in Suffolk, England, lost a hammer in one of his fields, so he asked Eric Lawes to use his metal detector to search for it. While looking for the hammer, Lawes happened upon something else of interest -- 24 bronze coins, 565 gold coins, 14,191 silver coins, plus hundreds of gold and silver spoons, jewelry, and statues, all dating back to the Roman Empire. As required by British law, the so-called ""Hoxne Hoard"" was reported to the local authorities, who declared it a ""Treasure Trove,"" meaning it was now legally the property of Britain. However, the government is required to pay fair market value for a treasure trove, meaning the farmer and Lawes split a cool £1.75 million (about $2.8 million). The Hoxne Hoard is now on permanent display at the British Museum, drawing thousands of people every year. Sadly, there is no word on whether or not the hammer was ever found. 2. Arkansas is a girl's best friend . W.O. Bassum found a giant of a gemstone in 1924 -- a 40.23 carat diamond. It might surprise you to hear that he wasn't digging in one of the famous South African diamond mines at the time, but was near Murfreesboro, Arkansas, at a site that is now the Crater of Diamonds State Park. Sitting on top of a volcanic pipe (a geologic tube formed by an ancient underground volcanic explosion), the park is the only diamond site in the world that is open to the public. Best of all, the park's policy is: ""You find it. You keep it. No matter how valuable it is."" Bassum's big find -- nicknamed ""The Uncle Sam Diamond,"" the largest diamond ever discovered in North America -- was later cut down to 12.42 carat and sold for $150,000 in 1971 (About $800,000 today). But his wasn't the last valuable rock dug out of that Arkansas soil. In 1964, ""The Star of Murfreesboro"" was discovered at the same site, weighing in at 34.25 carat. Then, in 1975, came the 16.37 carat ""Amarillo Starlight Diamond."" The 6.35 carat ""Roden Diamond"" was found in 2006. And the crown jewel of the park has been the ""Strawn-Wagner Diamond,"" a comparatively small 3.09 carat diamond, that was dug up in 1990, and expertly cut down to 1.90 carat. Despite its smaller size, the Strawn-Wagner stands out because it was given a ""Perfect"" rating by the American Gem Society -- the first diamond to ever receive such a high grade. But don't think this list of big gems means the site has been tapped out. On average, two diamonds are found every day at Crater of Diamonds. They're not all as big as The Uncle Sam Diamond, but maybe you'll get lucky. There's only one way to find out... Mental Floss: 10 diamond-encrusted things you don't need .

Sometimes, one man's trash really is another man's treasure. 3. The Declaration of (financial) Independence . We've all heard of the man who bought a $4 painting at a garage sale, found an original copy of the Declaration of Independence inside, and sold it for $2.4 million. A once-in-a-lifetime story, right? Not so much, actually. Michael Sparks was visiting a Nashville thrift store, where he bought a candleholder, a set of salt and pepper shakers, and a yellowed print of the Declaration of Independence. Sparks figured the document was a worthless, modern reprint, so he paid the asking price -- $2.48 -- and headed home. After looking over the document for a few days, he wondered if it might be older than he initially thought. So he hopped on the Internet to do some research and soon realized he had purchased one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. Of those 200, 35 had been found intact; he had number 36. It took a year for Sparks to have the print authenticated and preserved, and then he put it up for auction, netting a final sale price of $477,650. The salt and pepper shakers, on the other hand, were still worthless. 4. A good Heade for bargains . One day, an employee at a tool-and-die company in Indiana spent $30 for a few pieces of used furniture and an old painting of some flowers. When he got his new stuff home, he decided to strategically hang the picture to cover up a hole in the wall that had been bugging him. Some years later he was playing a board game called Masterpiece in which players attempt to outbid one another for artwork at an auction. Much to his surprise, one of the cards in the game featured a painting of flowers that looked a lot like the one he had on his wall. So he went online and found that his painting was similar in style to the work of Martin Johnson Heade, an American still-life artist best known for landscapes and flower arrangements. Through his research he found the Kennedy Galleries in Manhattan, which handles many of Heade's works, and asked them to take a look at his painting. They agreed and were able to verify that the piece of artwork covering the hole in his wall was a previously unknown Heade painting, since named Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth. In 1999, The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston purchased the painting for $1.2 million dollars. I emailed the Museum to ask if the painting was covering a hole in the wall, but I didn't get a reply.

Sometimes finding treasure is the easy part; finding someone willing to buy it can be the real challenge. 5. It's nice, but it's no Middleham Jewel... Every Sunday afternoon for the last seven years, Mary Hannaby had gone for a walk with her metal detector. She'd never really found anything of value, but she liked getting the exercise, so she kept at it. On one Sunday in June 2009, her detector beeped, and she bent down to dig up what she thought was going to be another common coin or old nail. Instead, she uncovered a postage stamp-sized gold pendant featuring an intricate carving of the crucifixion of Jesus. Maybe she had finally hit the jackpot. Upon inspection by the British Museum, the pendant was described as ""an important find,"" and they estimated the market value to be around £4,000 (about $6,600). Still, they decided not to purchase it for their collection, so Mary took the pendant to Sotheby's. The experts at the auction house felt the piece was much more valuable, because it was believed to be one of only three similar items known to exist. Their initial estimate was £250,000 ($415,900), but said it could easily sell for as much as £2.5 million ($4.1 million) thanks to its resemblance to another English treasure also found with a metal detector, the Middleham Jewel. But as the saying goes, ""Never count your millions until the auctioneer bangs his gavel."" Sotheby's put the pendant up for auction on July 9, 2009, making it the highlight of a large lot of antique sculptures. Clearly the expectations were high. The bidding started at £30,000 (about $49,900), but as the final call was made, the best offer was only £38,000 (about $63,200) -- far below the reserve price to make a sale. Mental Floss: 6 articles of clothing that caused riots . 6. A possible Pollock . In 1992, Teri Horton, a retired truck driver, went to her local thrift store to buy a depressed friend a gag gift. She found a rather large painting -- 66 inches by 47 inches -- that she thought was pretty amusing because it was, in her opinion, so ugly. When she asked the thrift store employee the price, they said $8. She haggled and only paid $5. In the end, her friend didn't want it (she, too, thought it was ugly, plus it wouldn't fit through the door of her trailer), so Teri took it home and tried to unload it at her garage sale. A local art teacher saw the painting and suggested it could very well be a Jackson Pollock. In response, Teri famously asked the teacher, ""Who the f*** is Jackson Pollock?"" Since that day, Teri Horton has been struggling to prove that her thrift store treasure is a lost piece of artwork potentially worth well over $100 million. However, due to the painting's lack of verifiable history of ownership (called ""provenance""), the piece is disputed by many fine arts experts as simply another artist's work inspired by Pollock. To find proof of Pollock, Teri had the work examined by a forensic specialist who claims to have found a fingerprint that matches one in Pollock's studio. But even the fingerprint evidence has been disputed by the art world, leaving the painting, as yet, unsold. Teri, her painting, and her battle with the art world elite became the subject of a 2006 documentary called, appropriately, Who the *$&% is Jackson Pollock?

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish rail chiefs testified on safety before lawmakers Thursday, two weeks after 79 people died and scores were injured in a horrific derailment in northwestern Spain. The investigation has focused on the actions of the train's driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, but questions have also been asked about the safety systems in place on Spain's national railway network. Gonzalo Ferre Molto, president of state-owned rail infrastructure company Adif, and Julio Gomez-Pomar, president of state railroad company Renfe, outlined what is being done to ensure the safety of rail travelers. ""My desire is to know the whole truth and avoid the possibility of an event of this nature happening again,"" said Ferre. ""This is the best service we can offer to the victims and the whole Spanish society."" Lawmakers heard that the route the train was on, from Madrid to Ferrol, includes a mix of conventional and high-speed track, with the latter allowing high-speed trains to travel at over 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph.) Driver on phone when train derailed, court says . Two different safety systems are used in Spain: the European Rail Traffic Management System for the high-speed track and another known as ASFA on conventional lines. The train and its engineer were switching between the two kinds of track and operating system in the course of the journey. A transition from an ERTMS-operated section to the other system happened about four miles before the train derailed on a curve near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, Ferre said. That section of track had been inspected on April 20, he said. Speed limit on bend . Court officials have said the train was traveling at 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened. Victims mourned at memorial mass . After the accident, a temporary speed limit of 30 kph was imposed on the stretch where the accident occurred and is still in place, Ferre said. A permanent limit of 60 kph will come into force once that is lifted. ""Our safety department is developing an investigation report,"" Ferre told the parliamentarians. ""Safety in the rail sector is an open subject."" Gomez-Pomar said Renfe has started to examine the safety systems in place and admitted that they can be improved. He said the driver had taken control of the train at Ourense station at 8:06 p.m., about 35 minutes before the crash occurred. Garzon had started his working day about eight hours earlier, but his effective driving time at that point was less than three hours, he said. The driver, who has worked for Renfe since 1992, had passed his most recent health test, Gomez-Pomar said. He had been qualified to travel the Ourense-Santiago stretch of track since February 2012 and was given permission to drive the kind of train involved in the crash last November. In total, more than 7,000 trains have passed through the stretch where the accident occurred, Gomez-Pomar said. Human error . Some lawmakers from smaller parliamentary groups criticized what they said was a rush to blame the driver for the crash. ""Shifting the responsibility of a high-speed train on to the machine operator is, from our point of view, a rather excessive responsibility,"" said Rosana Perez, of the Mixed Group. She suggested the number of drivers aboard a train should be increased as a safety measure to protect against human error. ""It has been said that the only cause is the human factor. If it is really so, we are lost. This argument falls by its own weight,"" said Gaspar Llamazares, of the United Left group. Charges filed . Investigations continue into the cause of the July 24 derailment, which shocked the nation. As of Thursday, 38 people remain in the hospital, six of them -- all adults -- in critical condition, according to local health authorities. No nationalities were given for those still hospitalized. Authorities have charged Garzon with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. He has been given conditional release but has surrendered his passport. Three witnesses were expected to give statements Thursday to a court in Galicia, in a closed-door session. They are a station manager and two neighbors who went to help the survivors immediately after the crash. Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, a court in Galicia said last month. The train was nearing the end of the six-hour trip between the capital and Ferrol at the time of the accident.

"New York (CNN) -- The first major heat wave of the summer blanketed the U.S. East Coast on Wednesday with scorching temperatures that swept across the region. Hot air -- often in excess of 90 degrees -- stretched from Maine to North Carolina, with the highest temperatures hitting parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, according to the National Weather Service. ""Very few areas are forecast to be below 90 degrees in the Northeast,"" said agency spokeswoman Susan Buchanan. 5 tips to survive extreme heat . States across the mid-Atlantic also had heat indices that reached 105 degrees, said the National Weather Service, which issued warnings and advisories across the region. Heat indices combine temperature and relative humidity to indicate how hot the body feels. New York City and parts of northeast New Jersey are expecting the heat index to reach even higher. Actual temperatures reached the mid-90s on Wednesday. ""I wouldn't say this is highly abnormal,"" said meteorologist Rick Watling. ""Having heat advisories or even warnings this time of the year is not too unusual."" The National Weather Service advises residents to wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing, drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments, stay out of the sun and check on relatives and neighbors. Young children and the elderly are especially at risk for heat-related injuries, the service said. Last year, it reported 206 heat-related deaths. In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said. Zoo animals drown in Minnesota flooding . Cities across the Northeast designated cooling centers and have issued advisories in an effort to help keep residents safe, according to emergency management officials in several cities. ""For the most part, they're places that are already open and they're designated for when the heat rises,"" said New York Emergency Management spokeswoman Judith Kane. ""The centers are places like senior centers that will be open to the public. It's an effective way to get access to air conditioning if you don't have it.""

"Washington (CNN) -- There is a new grounds crew at the Historic Congressional Cemetery in Washington but these landscapers don't bring lawn mowers, just their appetites. About 30 goats were released into an overgrown area adjacent to the cemetery on Wednesday and another trailer full were waiting to join them later. The assignment for these four-legged landscapers: eat the invasive plant species weighing down trees. If no action is taken the trees could eventually fall and destroy historic gravesites. A little camera shy, the goats were hesitant to emerge before a crowd of children and reporters. Owner, Brian Knox reassured his goats, coaxing some of them out individually by name. ""You get a name if you've got a lot of charisma or if you are a real pain in the butt,"" Knox joked later. But soon after a glimpse of the all-you-can-eat buffet which awaited them, the goats were out and busy chowing down. These goats will continue grazing in an enclosed area next to the cemetery for the six or seven days. During that time, they will eat almost anything they encounter, including flowers, vines, brush, and bark. Special enzymes in their stomach allow goats to eat plants that are poisonous to humans and other animals. ""Poison Ivy is probably their favorite,"" explained Knox. The Historic Congressional Cemetery is still in use today. It is the final resting place for many 19th century military heroes, congressmen, and political figures including two vice presidents and a Supreme Court justice. Since the grounds are located within the Anacostia Watershed, the goats are an environmentally friendly alternative to using pesticides, herbicides or machinery that could produce pollution. Light on their feet, the goats are also much gentler on the ground than heavy machinery. And it's cost effective, too. Paul Williams, president of the Historic Congressional Cemetery, said that employing 70 goats for a week will cost the cemetery about $4,000. ""That comes down to about 25 cents an hour per goat."" This money saving technique is apparently not new in Washington. During World War I, sheep could be found grazing on the South Lawn of the White House to save money and manpower. Their wool was auctioned to raise money for the Red Cross. Members of the cemetery grounds crew don't have to worry about losing their jobs just yet. Williams said that they will continue to use lawn mowers to maintain the actual historic burial sites.","More than two dozen goats eating overgrown plants, grasses around historic DC cemetery .

"(CNN) -- After 22 years on death row, Debra Milke is close to freedom. A jury convicted the Arizona woman, now 49, of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. A judge sentenced her to death a few months later. But those convictions and the related sentence were tossed out Thursday by a federal appeals court judge. In explaining his decision, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals chided the prosecution for remaining ""unconstitutionally silent"" on the ""history of misconduct"" of its key witness, a Phoenix police detective. ""The Constitution requires a fair trial,"" Kozinski wrote. ""This never happened in Milke's case."" A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers. Styers picked up a friend, ""but instead of heading to the mall, the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine, where Styers shot Christoper three times in the head,"" according to Kozinski's summary of the case. Styers was convicted of first-degree murder in the boy's killing and sentenced to death. The detective, Armando Saldate, said the friend told him that Debra Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son. But neither the friend nor Styers testified to that assertion in court. In fact, ""no other witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime"" other than Saldate's testimony. After pleading not guilty, Milke stood trial and tried to convince a jury that her account -- and not the detective's -- was the true one. ""The trial was, essentially, a swearing contest between Milke and ... Saldate,"" said Kozinski. The detective testified he ""didn't buy"" Milke's reaction after he informed her that her son was dead. After that, Saldate said he placed Milke under arrest. In a subsequent interrogation, she confessed that her role in the murder conspiracy was a ""bad judgment call,"" the detective said. But Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role in a murder plot. There was no recording of the interrogation, no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror, and Saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report. ""The judge and jury believed Saldate,"" said Kozinski of the verdict and sentence. ""But they didn't know about Saldate's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct."" Specifically, the judge noted that the detective had been suspended five days for taking ""liberties"" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors; that judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because Saldate had lied under oath; and that judges suppressed or vacated four confessions because Saldate had violated a person's constitutional rights. ""The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents,"" Kozinski said. ""... There can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation."" The judge ordered ""the state"" to turn over Saldate's personnel records to Milke's lawyers, after which ""a police official"" must state under oath that everything has been disclosed and nothing has been ""omitted, lost or destroyed."" Once this is done, a district court must order Milke's release unless prosecutors tell the court within 30 days that they plan to retry her soon. ""In the balance hangs the life of Milke,"" Kozinski said, explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions.","Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death, given the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- The Detroit bankruptcy case is acting as a Rorschach test for so many challenges that bedevil older industrial cities in the United States and beyond. A common one: How do older cities rocked by deindustrialization and the loss of population and jobs redefine their economic function and find a new reason to live in a shifting global economy? The experiences of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio offer cause for hope and a roadmap for reinvention and renewal. With the collapse of the steel industry in the early 1980s, the Pittsburgh metro area endured the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in just three years; the city's population declined by almost 12.7% during the full decade. Fast forward 30 years, and it is clear that the city and broader metropolis have regained their footing through a series of strategic and sustained interventions. Smart public, private and civic leadership has helped diversify the economy toward health care and technology, building off a solid base of advanced research institutions and medical campuses (""eds and meds""), such as Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Smart urban regeneration tactics have successfully repurposed waterfront locations, historic buildings and even brown-field sites into new walkable places valued by innovative firms and talented workers. An impressive 25% of the jobs in the Pittsburgh metro area are within three miles of the central business district, compared with just 7% in Detroit. With such employment density, reasonable housing costs and ample cultural amenities, the city now routinely places at or near the top of worldwide livability rankings. Northeast Ohio -- which spans the four metropolitan areas of Cleveland, Akron, Canton and Youngstown -- provides a more recent example of renewal. In the early 2000s, the Cleveland Plain Dealer chronicled the ""quiet crisis"" that was gradually bleeding the region of people, jobs and vitality. In response, philanthropic institutions pooled their resources and supported a series of institutions and intermediaries, including the Fund for Our Economic Future, BioEnterprise and Nortech, to identify precisely the region's untapped potential in emerging technology, health care, energy and manufacturing clusters and then help small- and medium-sized firms meet the demand for new products and services. As in Pittsburgh, these efforts leveraged Northeast Ohio's stellar network of advanced research institutions and medical campuses, many of which (e.g., the Cleveland Clinic) sit at the cores of the region's central cities. The result in less than a decade has been impressive: an additional 10,500 jobs, $333 million in payroll, $1.9 billion in investments, including the first nationally designated additive manufacturing institute in Youngstown. The examples of Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio provide a road map for the renewal not only of Detroit but of older industrial cities more generally. RoboCop creator: Detroit shows the film's fictional future is upon us . First, form and sustain a network. Cities and metropolitan areas are powerful because they are networks -- of corporate, philanthropic, university, community and government institutions and leaders. Each element of the network is not big enough or rich enough to power economic restructuring. But, taken together, they have the potential to design and deliver transformative initiatives and interventions. Second, set a distinctive vision for economic growth grounded in your region's special assets and advantages. Shakespeare was right; what's past is prologue. Northeast Ohio, for example, shows how specialties designed for car manufacturing can be repurposed. As Akron's tire making industry declined, companies working with local universities shifted their focus and research efforts into the related business of polymers. The former Rubber Capital of the World now makes polymers and plastics that can be used in clean energy and biotech. Third, find the series of game changers that have the potential to create jobs in the near term and alter the trajectory of your economy over the long haul. In Pittsburgh and Northeast Ohio, the signature game changer has been collaboration--among companies, universities, entrepreneurs and supportive institutions -- to help reshape the economy and create a sense of place and to grow quality jobs in quality places. The revival of Detroit is not a fanciful dream; in fact it has already begun. According to research in progress by the Brookings Institution and The Reinvestment Fund, Detroit's historic downtown and midtown core is 3 percent of the city's land mass but home to 37 percent of its jobs, and residential and business growth is underway. This growth includes new corporate residents like Quicken Loans bringing over 7,000 new jobs downtown since 2007, and older anchor institutions like Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and the College for Creative Studies driving over $1.8 billion in investments to midtown over the past decade. This resurgence of Detroit's core builds off the physical ""bones"" (such as historic buildings, revised riverfront) of the city and the enviable assets in the broader metropolis, including a relatively high concentration of workers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, given the region's concentration in advanced manufacturing. And the resurgence is stewarded by the leadership of re-energized networks of philanthropies like the New Economy Initiative, as well as the work of capable institutions like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, Midtown Detroit and Invest Detroit. With such advantages, now is the time to revive the city from the core and set ambitious goals for housing, job and fiscal growth that benefits all residents. Detroit's future, in short, is still to be written. Private, civic, and, yes, public investors like the federal government must double down on this momentum, and invest in that future to make it a bright one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley .","Bruce Katz, Jennifer Bradley: Revival in Ohio, Pittsburgh should give hope to Detroit .

"Washington (CNN) -- Look both ways. That is probably the first traffic safety advice most people get. But in 2011, some 4,432 pedestrians were killed in the simple act of crossing a street. Those accounted for 14% of all motor vehicle fatalities. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Transportation released updated pedestrian accident statistics in a bid to increase pedestrian safety. Here are six things you should know: . 1) Sobriety is key. In 48% of fatal pedestrian accidents, either the driver or the pedestrian was drunk. Of pedestrians involved, 35% had blood-alcohol levels of .08%. Of the drivers involved, 13% had levels of .08. Alcohol, the DOT noted, impairs both your walking ability and judgment. 2) It helps to use a crosswalk. Seventy percent of pedestrian fatalities occurred away from intersections, compared with 19% at intersections. (The remainder were listed as ""other."") 3) Nighttime is more dangerous. Seventy percent of the fatalities occurred at night. 4) Most accidents occur in cities. Three out of every four pedestrian fatalities happen in urban areas. 5) Weekends are worse: Thirty-nine percent of pedestrian fatalities occur during weekend nights, compared with 27% during weekday nights. 6) Males are represented in larger numbers. More than two-thirds of all pedestrians killed are male. Males are overrepresented in every age group, from 0-5 to 85-plus. One more thing: Florida, South Carolina and Arizona had the highest pedestrian fatality rates; Nebraska, New Hampshire and Kansas had the lowest. The DOT has launched a website with safety tips and resources for parents, city planners and others involved in improving pedestrian safety.","DOT report: Almost half of pedestrian accidents involve someone who was drunk .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two Americans -- one a Green Beret -- were killed Monday when an assailant wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform opened fire on the group, U.S. and NATO's International Security Assistance Force officials said. The shootout in eastern Afghanistan didn't last long, as coalition forces ""returned fire and killed the attacker,"" a U.S. official told CNN. Two Afghan army personnel also were killed, said Gen. Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman. A U.S. military official told CNN that at least 10 Americans were wounded as well. The assailant fired at the victims with a truck-mounted machine gun, Azimi said, after a meeting between coalition and Afghan forces at a military base in the Jalrez district of Wardak province, about an hour west of Kabul. Green Berets and Afghan forces are based there, a U.S. official said. A spokesman for the Taliban, the militant group that once ruled Afghanistan, said the shooter was an Afghan police officer, but it's unclear if that was the case. A U.S. official said a variety of Afghan security forces -- including army, national police and perhaps local police -- were at a training-related meeting. The incident appeared to be the latest ""green-on-blue"" attack, or strike against coalition members by people dressed in police or army uniforms. Assailants conducting similar subterfuge killed dozens of coalition troops in 2012. On Friday, a coalition contractor in eastern Afghanistan was killed when people wearing Afghan uniforms turned their weapons against ISAF members, NATO said. The last coalition soldier killed in a ""green-on-blue"" attack was a Briton, who was slain on January 7. And in the last similar fatal assault on U.S. troops, two Americans were killed October 25. The coalition has been working to thwart such insider attacks. Coalition soldiers are required to have a loaded weapon within reach at all times. In addition, the coalition ended training for hundreds of Afghan soldiers last year until the completion of background checks for insurgent links. Most of the insider attacks are believed to be the result of Afghan soldiers suffering from combat or emotional stress, a Defense Department official told CNN in September after an especially deadly weekend for coalition troops. Only about 15% of the ""green-on-blue"" attacks are believed to be the result of insurgent links, and about 10% come from infiltrators not affiliated with the military, the Defense Department official said. The latest attack comes a day after Afghan President Hamid Karzai outraged the ISAF commander by contending there are ""ongoing daily talks between Taliban, American and foreigners in Europe and in the Gulf states"" and ""that Taliban want longer presence of foreigners -- not their departure from Afghanistan."" U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who oversees the NATO-led force, said that's ""categorically false."" ""We have fought too hard over the past 12 years. We have shed too much blood over the past 12 years. We have done too much to help the Afghan Security Forces grow over the last 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage,"" Dunford said. Newly installed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited Afghanistan this weekend on his first overseas trip since his confirmation. Hagel told reporters he tried to reassure Karzai that the United States has no unilateral back-channel talks with the Taliban. Hagel, Karzai meet after strained Afghan weekend . ""Secretary Hagel addressed these questions directly with President Karzai in their meeting,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. ""The last thing we would do is support any kind of violence, particularly involving innocent civilians."" Carney noted that the United States and its coalition allies are staying the course with their stated policy to end the war that began in 2001 ""because we were attacked from Afghanistan.""

"(CNN) -- You may not know Trevor Jones by name but chances are you are familiar with his work. The South African composer is the man behind movie soundtracks such as 'Last of the Mohicans' and 'In the Name of the Father.' In a career spanning more than 30 years, he has composed more than 100 original scores for Hollywood blockbusters and popular TV programs. But Jones ultimate career success and critical acclaim masks a journey to the top was far from run of the mill. As a mixed-race child growing up in Apartheid South Africa, he spent the formative years of his life in Cape Town's infamous District 6 neighborhood. ""It was a very violent area,"" says Jones of his early home. ""It was a place (with) so many nationalities and so many people from so many parts of the world. See also: American opera singer finds African soul . Times were tough but such a racially disparate backdrop ensured the young Jones was exposed to a rich symphony of culture and musical influences. He has kept these sounds and inspirations with him as professional career has developed. ""My tastes cover every style from medieval through classical, avant-garde, folk and ethnic, jazz, rock and pop,"" he says. Below, Jones has selected a small sample of the musicians and artists that have inspired him on his way to becoming one of Hollywood's leading composers. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika . First composed by a school teacher in Johannesburg over 100 years ago, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika is one of the two songs (along with Die Stem van Suid-Afrika) that make up South Africa's hybrid national anthem. The original hymn became synonymous with African liberation and was itself adopted as the national song of Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Namibia and Zimbabwe however have since adopted alternative musical pieces for their national anthems. ""I cannot help but feel the hairs rise on the back of my neck whenever I join in the singing of Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, says Jones. Being a South African, ""this music has obvious deep significance for me."" Sir Edward Elgar . In a musical career that spanned the best part of the Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian eras, Sir Edward Elgar created some of the most enduring music of his time. The English composer was one of the first to experiment with the gramophone and is credited with inspiring a renaissance in British classical music. See also: The man who brought MTV to Africa . His extensive body of work continues to capture the imagination and admiration of Jones. ""I listen to the works of Sir Edward Elgar on a regular basis to inspire me and to marvel at his mastery and skill as a composer which transcends the creation of sounds and becomes a direct emotional line to his audience."" ""'Elegy', ('Sospiri') and 'Introduction and Allegro' are just three of the wonderfully inspirational works on the album 'A portrait of Elgar,'"" says Jones. Hugh Masekela . ""The man and his music is an inspiration to us all,"" says Jones of South African jazz multi-instrumentalist and singer, Hugh Masekela. Equally comfortable on the trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn and trombone, Masekela has sold millions of records around the world and collaborated with rock luminaries such as The Byrds and Paul Simon. He also penned the 1987 hit single ""Bring Him Back Home,"" which became a rallying cry for the free Nelson Mandela movement, then still imprisoned on Robben Island. ""Any of his albums from 'Hope' and 'Home is where the Music is' to 'African Breeze' is testament to one of Africa's greatest musicians and role models,"" says Jones. Ariel Ramirez . A native music of an altogether different kind is that of Ariel Ramirez. The Argentine composer, music director and pianist is generally regarded as one of the chief exponents of his country's folk genre. Jones highlights Ramirez's Misa Criolla as an extended piece of music that strikes a particular chord as well as other works such as Navidad Nuestra. See also: Somalian rapper Knaan makes songs in key of love . Both are featured on Miss Criolla - Navidad Nuestra - Navidad Verano, a year 2000 record cited by Jones that saw Ramirez perform alongside Spanish tenor Jose Carreras and the Grupo Huracana ensemble. Bernard Herrmann . A man Jones would have been more than content to call a contemporary, Bernard Herrmann is the composer behind the music of many of twentieth-century's most iconic movies. He died in 1975 but worked closely with legendary directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and Martin Scorcese. Scores for the likes of Citizen Kane, Psycho and Taxi Driver are just a few works from his vast oeuvre. ""Herrmann's work is always superbly crafted imbuing the films with an intensely atmospheric musical structure without ever mickey-mousing the action."" ""The sheer craftsmanship of the writing and the quality of the musical ideas elevate beyond measure the films that were fortunate enough to be scored by him.""

"(CNN) -- I started playing sports at a young age and gravitated toward wheelchair basketball and track. In college, I decided to focus primarily on track and pursue my dream of going to the Paralympics. With the support of a great coach and team, I was selected as a member of Team USA and competed in track at the Paralympic Games in London in 2012. On Saturday, April 6, I embarked on the most challenging journey of my life. I left Los Angeles, heading toward New York City in my racing wheelchair -- a 71-day journey of 3,300 miles. While I didn't know what to expect or how my body would react to the demands of ""pushing"" the equivalent of two to three marathons a day, I knew one thing for sure -- I'd get it done. I committed to Push Across America as my way of giving back to Stay-Focused, an organization that has significantly impacted my life. Stay-Focused offers a SCUBA certification program for teens and young adults with disabilities. I met Roger Muller, founder of Stay-Focused, in 2005, and was given the opportunity to learn to SCUBA dive. For me, it was a chance encounter that changed my life. I love to dive and have been diving ever since. We do all our diving in the Cayman Islands, most often in Grand Cayman, which is one of the best diving destinations in the world. I was chosen to be the first Stay-Focused mentor in 2007, a role that enabled me to assist first-time divers, and I am now actively involved in running the organization. Parkinson's didn't stop his space walk . A few years ago, Muller and I were talking about ways to raise funds for Stay-Focused. He asked me if I thought I could push my racing chair across the country. My first thought: ""If it would help Stay-Focused, I'm in."" And now I have honored that commitment by combining my passion for ""pushing"" with my tremendous desire to support Stay-Focused, an organization I will be a part of for many years. In addition to giving back to Stay-Focused, I was motivated to encourage others to take on challenges and give back to individuals and organizations that have made a difference in their lives. I also wanted to build awareness for the potential of all persons with disabilities and disability sports. During my Paralympic experience in London, where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow Paralympians at each and every event, I was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first, Paralympians second. In doing the Push Across America, I wanted to help promote disability sports in the United States and encourage people to view athletes with disabilities in the same way they view other athletes -- in other words, no differently. Push Across America was a phenomenal experience. For the most part, the weather was good, and of course, there were mountains to climb. But I was focused and knew why I was doing it and I knew this would be a defining moment in my life. I did it to prove I could and to encourage others to never give up, as well as to support Stay-Focused and to have a good time! My theme song is ""No Surrender"" by Bruce Springsteen. Yep, for me, I made a promise to Muller I swore to remember, and this was it --""no retreat, baby, no surrender!""

"(CNN) -- A woman accused of scamming nearly half a million dollars from a nonprofit fund benefiting the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings was arraigned Friday at Boston Municipal Court, a Massachusetts office said. Andrea Gause, 26, was arrested on July 19 in her hometown of Troy, New York, on a Massachusetts fugitive warrant, a statement from Attorney General Martha Coakley's office said. Gause is formally charged with larceny over $250, to which she pleaded not guilty. Judge Thomas C. Horgan set her bail at $200,000 cash, the statement said. The nonprofit -- The One Fund Boston -- began distributing nearly $61 million to 232 eligible claimants starting June 30, according to a release from the organization. Last Boston bombing victim goes home . Gause was awarded $480,000 from the fund after claiming she suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in long-term memory loss, impaired speech and loss of some motor function that would require future surgery as a result of the Boston Marathon bombing, the attorney general's office said. After a tip received by both the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, an official investigation began, Coakley said at a news conference on July 19. That investigation determined that Gause was never a patient at Boston Medical Center for two days or Albany Medical Center for 10 days, as she declared on her notarized claim form, the statement says. ""She was stealing money from the real victims of the Marathon bombing, and from the people who gave so generously to help them,"" Coakley said. The money has since been returned to the One Fund Boston, Friday's statement said. Woman gets new leg - and new life - after Boston bombings . The One Fund Boston divided payments between four classifications that were based on the severity of injuries or loss of life, according to the fund's statement. More than 260 people were wounded and three were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15. Gause will next appear in Boston Municipal Court on September 4 for a pretrial hearing, according to Coakley's office.

"(CNN) -- Indiana can't kick all registered sex offenders off instant messaging services, chat rooms or social networking sites like Facebook, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2008 that was aimed at keeping predators from trolling the Internet for new victims. But that law ""broadly prohibits substantial protected speech rather than specifically targeting the evil of improper communications to minors,"" a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded. State courts can impose limits on social media as a condition of a sex offender's probation or parole, but a ""blanket ban"" on Internet use violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free expression, the judges found. A district judge in Indianapolis had upheld the law in June, but federal courts in at least two other states -- Nebraska and Louisiana -- struck down similar state laws in 2012. The Indiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the statute on behalf of an offender identified only as ""John Doe,"" who had served 21 months in prison for child exploitation. ""Doe"" was released in 2003 and isn't on parole or probation, but was covered by the state ban. Ken Falk, the group's legal director, said Indiana already has laws on the books barring the solicitiation of children, with enhanced penalties for inappropriate communications online. The law overturned Wednesday barred the ""completely innocent"" use of social media, he said. ""If you wanted to participate in a chat room to work around a candidate, you can't do that,"" he said. ""If you want to follow the pope on Twitter, you can't do that."" News websites increasingly require commenters to log in via a social network, and Falk said ""Doe"" couldn't supervise his own child's use of social media under the law. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said his office has not decided whether to appeal the ruling. ""The Indiana Legislature made a policy decision in 2008 that the state's reasonable interests in protecting children from predators outweighed the interest of allowing convicted sex offenders to troll social media for information,"" Zoeller said in a statement issued by his office. ""We have worked with county sheriffs and prosecutors in our defense of the legal challenges to these protections of our children, and we will need to review this 7th Circuit ruling to determine the state's next steps."" Facebook, the largest social media platform, already bars sex offenders from using the site under its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities states. It also prohibits children under 13 and multiple accounts on the site. In the past, Facebook has worked with various states on legislation to help law enforcement find, prosecute and convict sexual predators who attempt to use the site.

"(CNN) -- Cycling is a sport with a dark doping past but the way it has cleaned up its act is a model for athletics to follow, says Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell. The retired British sprinter called for change after track stars Tyson Gay of the U.S. and Jamaica's Asafa Powell both tested positive for banned substances. The legacy of doping still hangs over cycling and Tour de France leader Chris Froome has frequently had to answer questions over his performance during this year's race in the wake of Lance Armstrong's fall from grace. But Campbell, who won 4 x 100 meter gold at Athens 2004, suggests the way the sport has clawed back its credibility is a lesson to the track and field community. ""Athletics needs to have a look at cycling and see how they handled the Lance Armstrong situation and how over time people started to believe in the sport again,"" Campbell, who won 4 x 100 meter gold at Athens 2004, told CNN. ""But this can't go on, eventually it will destroy the sport and it will mean younger fans decide they don't want to watch athletics anymore, and that would be disastrous. ""Everyone has come out and said 'Enough is enough.' We are nearly at breaking point. If we don't do anything it will be broken forever."" Campbell, who also clinched silver over 200 meters at Sydney 2000, has long been a supporter of lifetime bans for athletes who chose to take banned substances, a sanction currently not allowed under the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) code. But, while he is steadfastly opposed to the use of performance-enhancing substances, Campbell is wary of punishing those who inadvertently break the rules. He is concerned that athletes who unknowingly take banned substances contained within nutritional supplements could be sanctioned unjustly. He compares the situation with Britain's 'horse meat scandal' in which some foods advertised as beef were found to contain horse meat. ""How many people knew they were eating horse?"" added Campbell. ""I think that's why we shouldn't just say 'OK, they're drugs cheats' and just forget about it. ""Imagine if they're innocent? Innocent in the sense that they didn't knowingly take it."" ""I run a sports nutrition company. As an athlete myself, there was no way for professional athletes to take nutrition products with the safety of knowing there's not going to be cross contamination. ""I'm an advocate for lifetime bans, but I wouldn't want to see someone banned for life who hadn't knowingly done it."" News of positive tests for both Gay and Powell comes just weeks after Jamaican triple Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown was also provisionally suspended. Campbell is pleased to see anti-doping authorities clamping down on athletes regardless of their stature. ""There isn't a case that high-profile athletes get a different level of treatment to anybody else,"" added Campbell. ""If they are caught doping it will be highlighted and everybody will hear about it. ""In that respect it's definitely the way forward. I still feel that governing bodies need to get to the point where the deterrent is so big and so powerful that it stops people from deciding to take performance-enhancing drugs."" On Sunday, former world champion Gay said he was told by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that an A sample from an out of competition test taken in May had come back positive. Gay didn't name the substance found in his system and added that he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs. He has pulled out of next month's world championships in Russia. Powell, a former world-record holder from Jamaica, said he was caught for using the banned stimulant oxilofrine -- often found in dietary supplements -- that showed up in a test at last month's Jamaican trials. ""I don't have a sabotage story,"" Gay was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""I basically put my trust in someone and was let down. I made a mistake.""","Darren Campbell says athletics should follow cycling's lead .

"(CNN) -- The first emotion I remember is rage. It was a violent, fire-in-your-veins, so angry-you-could-kill-someone kind of rage. I wanted out. I wanted the pain to be over. I wanted to die. I was mad at myself for not having the courage to just do it quickly, angry at the hospital staff for thwarting my masked attempt. I was convinced that I was ""meant to"" endure this, that my long, drawn-out starving to death would prove my willpower to God. In the days prior to my stroke, I'd had vivid hallucinations -- of Jesus on a wooden cross outside my bedroom window and a satanic figure sneaking up under my bedroom covers to suffocate me at night. I thought I was meant to be a martyr. I thought God wanted me to die. As the fury subsided, delirium set in. I became confused, defiant and completely irrational. I told the doctors that they couldn't possibly keep me overnight, because my family didn't have insurance or money to pay. When a cardiologist responded that she wasn't sure if I'd live another week, I told her she was full of s---. I hid the food they were trying to make me eat in my underwear, in flowerpots, even in my cheeks like a chipmunk -- certain no one would notice. I didn't want to get better. I was convinced nothing was wrong. I remember having nurses turn me over in the middle of the night to tend to the bed sores on my behind, places where the skin was so thin that my tailbone was starting to protrude through the flesh. I remember waking up to discover I'd wet the bed nearly every morning for the first three months I was hospitalized. I was ashamed, disgusted. I'd lost control of the muscles in my bladder; I was like an infant all over again. I remember shooting a nurse the bird when she told me I couldn't walk, only to crumble to the floor when I angrily pushed the wheelchair away to give it a try. A boy and his seizure dog . Unbeknownst to me at the time, my arrival at the hospital had launched an investigation by Child Protective Services back at my home in Austin. The caseworkers deemed my mother an ""unfit parent"" and my sister and I were placed under custodianship of the state. My care was left to the doctors and nurses at Children's, while my sister was sent to live with our godparents. My mother, herself an alcoholic and anorexic, had literally drunk herself into oblivion (she was later diagnosed with Wernicke's Syndrome, a form of alcohol-induced dementia). I spent the next 16 months of my life in that hospital. I completed my junior and senior years of high school through a distance education program, talked my way through hundreds of hours of individual and group therapy and slowly, painfully worked to bring my body and mind back to life. When Medicaid finally pulled the plug on funding for my treatment, I was unrecognizable from the day I'd walked in. I'd gained nearly 40 pounds, and the feisty, fiercely independent spirit I'd been known for as a child was on her way back in (close to) full force. Although I was still significantly underweight and terrified to leave the security of the hospital, my medical team managed to convince the caseworkers to grant me emancipation. At 17, I re-entered the ""real world"" as a legally recognized adult. My doctor at Children's helped me make arrangements to move into a garage apartment with a close family friend near the hospital. I got a job at a local Starbucks, started applying for college, and, by the grace of who-knows-what, was offered almost free weekly therapy by a psychologist who'd treated me at Children's. Three months later, I took my first yoga class. I was lucky. I was blessed. I was given enough resources to put the fragments of my broken life back together. 6 years later, burned Iraqi boy stands tall . My hope is that my story might serve as a beacon of hope for people grappling with their own inner demons in silence and isolation. Whether it's an eating disorder, abandonment, depression or addiction, please know: . There is a way out. You don't have to suffer alone. There are people out there who want to love you, who would be honored to bear witness to your pain. Healing doesn't happen in a vacuum. We are human and we have an inherent need to see and be seen, to touch and be touched. No one heals heartbreak alone. For the broader community, I hope this story will diminish some of the stigma and misperceptions about eating disorders. Many of us have been taught that people with eating disorders simply want to be skinny, feel like they have to look like supermodels to be worth anything, or just have an unhealthy ""need for control."" Those are all symptoms of an eating disorder, not the cause. I realized that I feel like a child who was once desperately thirsty, who was given enough water to survive and shake her thirst, and now feels compelled to go out and give water to anyone who's parched. ""Look! Water! I know, isn't it good?! Drink up!!"" When I see people drink the water, I can't even describe the feeling -- it's as if I'm experiencing the first sip all over again. It brings me incredible joy, even healing. It's an act of alchemy. It allows me to make light of some of the darkest days of my life. I once had a therapist who, when asked how I could ever repay her for all she'd given me, told me: ""Your life will be all the thanks I need."" This is how I thank her. This is how I thank all those who helped me find my way out of the darkness. Share the water. 'On Looking;' The world you're not seeing .

"(CNN) -- Does it matter that the new pope comes from Argentina? It matters greatly, because Argentina shaped the life and the views of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now Pope Francis. Through Francis, Argentina will help shape the church. More than any country in Latin American, Argentina is a nation of immigrants, with an unlikely mix of inhabitants -- including one of the world's largest Jewish communities. It is nation that has undergone enormous political upheaval, where the human rights abuses of a cruel military dictatorship remain an open wound. It is country of great natural wealth and a proud culture on impressive display, but one in which poverty and inequality remain urgent problems. The College of Cardinals elected the first pope from the Americas in its history and the first non-European in more than a thousand years. But the choice is important for more than symbolic reasons. The times in which we live test us and mold us. They are our crucible. In Argentina, Bergoglio was tested and we can see some of the ways in which he was molded. By examining his career in Buenos Aires we can gain some insight into his coming papacy. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had an extraordinarily close relationship with the city's Jewish community. He worked together with them on anti-poverty programs and co-authored a book with a rabbi. As part of that relationship he was willing to address the Catholic Church's controversial role during the Holocaust, supporting the need to open the Vatican files to find out the truth. This suggests he might be open to lifting some of the secrecy that has shrouded the Vatican in other controversies, perhaps even including the recent child sexual abuse scandals. Opinion: Pope Francis, open up the church . He showed a commitment to interfaith relations, respect for other religions, and a determination to fight for justice. He attended Rosh Hashana services, lit Hanukkah candles, and pushed the Argentinean government to persevere with a stalled investigation of a 1994 attack against a Jewish community center, the worst terrorist attack in Argentina's history. He showed his commitment to finding the truth was not a matter of offering a sound-bite, but of pursuing justice; again, a possible hint of things to come. His selection was widely celebrated in Argentina. Like every other Argentinean, this pope will be a devout soccer fan. The soccer superstar Diego Maradona proclaimed, ""The god of soccer is Argentinean, and now the pope is, too. It makes our country joyful."" But not everyone in Argentina is celebrating. Some human rights activists say Bergoglio's behavior during the dictatorship that consumed Argentina from 1976-1983 was shameful. During the years of military rule, the regime abducted and killed up to 30,000 people. During most of that time, Bergoglio was head of the Jesuit order. The Catholic Church generally supported the dictatorship. In the book ""The Silence,"" by investigative reporter Horacio Verbitsky, Bergoglio is accused of deliberately failing to protect two Jesuit priests who were captured and imprisoned by the government. In a separate case from that era, Bergoglio has been called to testify about the kidnapping of a baby, part of a regime practice of stealing the children of imprisoned activists and handing them for adoption by prominent families. Elena de la Cuadra says she and her husband were kidnapped and their baby stolen. They claim Bergoglio failed to intercede when he was asked, and accuse him of having knowledge of the practice and not speaking out. Navarrette: Pope pick a signal to Latino Catholics . Bergoglio denies the accusations, and his supporters, including Argentinean Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Perez Esquivel say they are not true. More recently, Bergoglio has not shied away from challenging the government. He vehemently rejected support for same-sex marriage, calling gay rights legislation ""a machination of the Father of Lies."" And he forcefully criticized the government for what he viewed as a failure to tackle poverty and inequality. Much has been written about his disdain for earthly comforts -- he prefers the bus to a chauffeur-driven limousine and cooked his own meals until now -- but his activism on behalf of the poor has been just as much a hallmark of his life. While he rejects ""Liberation Theology,"" a radical social and political ideology, he supports an aggressive policy to promote equality. And in what will be a papacy guided by conservative moral standards on most issues, his past suggests that the fight against poverty will take a primary role. He has declared that ""human rights are not violated just by terrorism, repression and assassination, but also by unjust economic structures that produce great inequality."" Living in Argentina during the years of dictatorship and during times of economic upheaval that created more poverty put the new pope in a position to make moral choices. Other popes before him faced the challenges of their time. Opinion: Pope Francis - A conservative who sides with the poor . His immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, came of age in Nazi Germany and, like other people of his generation, was a member of the Hitler Youth and served in the German military. He tried to explain those circumstances to critics during his papacy. Before him, Pope John Paul II grew up under communist rule in Poland, a fact that played a key role in his papacy when he helped inspire the fall of the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe. Pope Francis grew up in a different place, with a different history. He lived in a country with a large Catholic majority, but one where most people are not particularly devout. He will try to make Catholicism relevant, particularly to the poor, and he has shown he is not likely to promote a theology that seeks to demonize or distance itself from those who practice other religions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Argentina has unique makeup, circumstances that were crucible for new pope .
She says Francis had close, good relationship with country's large Jewish community .
She says he's been accused of abetting dictator there in '70s, '80s; He denies this .

"(CNN) -- Weeks after they found Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body in a Massachusetts industrial park, investigators are still searching for a key piece of evidence: the gun used to kill him. Prosecutors have accused former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, 23, of orchestrating the death of Lloyd, who was shot five times with a .45 caliber handgun. The latest police search for the weapon -- at a lake in Bristol, Connecticut -- didn't turn up the gun, a law enforcement official told CNN Wednesday. Investigators with a Connecticut State Police dive team who've been looking for the gun plan to return to the area next week to search a smaller body of water nearby, the law enforcement official said. Search warrant: Hernandez stored guns in box after killing . The former standout NFL tight end has pleaded not guilty to murder. He is being held without bail. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in the early morning of June 17. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day. Ortiz has told authorities that Wallace said Hernandez fired the shots that killed Lloyd, according to a court document. As part of their investigation into the high-profile case, police have homed in on Hernandez's hometown of Bristol. And a house there where Hernandez's uncle and cousin live has become one focal point. The house is near the lake that police have been searching. And court documents say that Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, learned of Lloyd's death at the house, where she allegedly spoke with Ortiz. Hernandez responds from jail to fan letter . A search warrant affidavit states that Ortiz -- who sources say is cooperating with authorities â€” says that he and Wallace drove to the Connecticut home, where he told Singleton about Lloyd's death. The affidavit also says that Singleton later bought a bus ticket for Wallace. Wallace was charged with accessory after the fact to murder and has pleaded not guilty. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a weapons charge. Singleton was arrested and jailed on a contempt of court charge, according to jail records. The charge is for allegedly failing to comply with a grand jury investigating Lloyd's killing, the law enforcement official said. She was released from the Bristol County Sheriff's Office Women's Center in Massachusetts on August 1, according to jail records. It is unclear whether she was transferred to another facility or decided to comply with the grand jury. Prosecutor raises 2012 Boston slayings in alleging Hernandez motive . A spokesman for the Bristol County District Attorney declined comment to CNN. Attempts to reach Singleton and her family were unsuccessful. At the Connecticut home, authorities also discovered a dusty SUV suspected of being linked to an unsolved double homicide in Boston last summer, sources told CNN. Hernandez has not been charged with anything in that case, but a law enforcement source has told CNN that Boston police were ""very active"" -- and making progress -- in trying to connect the dots that could link him to the shooting. CNN's George Lerner contributed to this report.","A police search of a Connecticut lake doesn't turn up the gun, an official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A California food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a ""proactive"" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths.","The pistachios, mostly sold to wholesalers, came from Setton Farms in California .

"(CNN) -- What do you do if you're a ""crazy kid"" growing up in Utah? You clip on your skis and go downhill fast -- very fast -- that's what. ""I'd say most of the time I'm basically on the verge of crashing,"" Ted Ligety -- the ""King of Schladming"" and arguably the best male skier in the world right now -- told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The fastest way down is just being -- one little slip up and you are done -- so that's the fastest way to go down. We're riding a fine line most of the time."" Known as ""Ted Shred"" for his fearless attitude on the piste, Ligety's approach to gravity -- traveling at speeds that even motorists might start to feel nervous about -- has served him well since making his pro debut a decade ago. See Ligety's downhill run via headcam . ""For me I think it's one of the most fun sports out there too because it's such an adrenaline rush -- you're just using gravity,"" he said. ""We have courses where you reach speeds of 100 mph (160 kph) so it's very unique in those ways."" Securing a stunning hat-trick of titles at this month's world skiing championships in the Austrian resort of Schladming, the 28-year-old from Park City matched a feat last achieved by the legendary Jean-Claude Killly back in 1968. In doing so he all but singlehandedly hoisted the United States to the top of the medals table in Austria. Those victories in the super-G, super combined and his specialty giant slalom, where he was defending his 2011 title, showed Ligety's all-round versatility and catapulted him to superstar status. No-nonsense approach . Not that he is letting his recent success go to his head. The American has even bigger goals ahead -- trying to overhaul Austrian Marcel Hirscher at the top of this season's overall World Cup standings and then challenging for gold at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. ""I still believe the overall (World Cup) title winner is the No. 1 skier in the world,"" Ligety said. ""I have been having a great season but I'm a little way back in the overall, so to me Marcel Hirscher is the No. 1 in the world. ""I had a really hot couple of weeks and luckily that fell during the world championships. I am hopeful I can continue the success of the worlds into the other events besides giant slalom."" Ligety's no-nonsense approach and relentless quest for improvement means he has swerved the media hullabaloo which accompanies his fellow U.S. teammates such as Lindsey Vonn and Bode Miller. ""I'm not doing ski racing to become famous. I do it because I love it and I'm competitive. That's what drives me. My main focus is on ski racing, not the red carpet,"" he states on his official website. Vonn's fall in the women's super-G at Schladming, suffering a serious knee injury, brought her season to a premature end, and with Miller still recovering from a knee injury of his own, Ligety might have to start getting used to a more intensive media glare. Unexpected triumph . Suddenly all the attention is on him, and even he admits that his success was a little unexpected. ""I knew I had very good chances at medals in both the super-G and combined, but to win both was definitely a surprise,"" he said. ""My main goal for the worlds was to defend my giant slalom title, so winning the super-G and combined added a little extra pressure. ""I was so focused on the giant slalom I didn't realize what I had done until it was over. Though it's still hard to fathom that I won three golds and that it has not been done since Killy in 1968."" There is also the smaller matter of Sochi 2014, where Ligety hopes to add to the Olympic gold he won as a 21-year-old in the super combined at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Ligety insists he is ""not focused on the Olympics yet"" but memories of his earlier success leave a warm glow. ""Winning the gold medal in the 2006 Olympics was pretty surreal,"" he said. ""I still kind of shake my head when I think about winning the gold medal because I was so young and it was really cool to win the gold. To hear the national anthem and stand on top of the podium was a really surreal experience."" While his career is on an upward trajectory, Ligety downplays suggestions that he will be carrying main U.S. hopes at the Russian resort next February. ""It's far enough away so much can change between now and then. Bode and Lindsey should be healthy for the Olympics so we will have a very strong team besides myself."" Commercial venture . That 2006 victory opened up other commercial opportunities, and Ligety cleverly exploited his nickname to start a similarly-titled company specializing in custom-made helmet and goggle combinations. ""I was a crazy kid and would go straight line moguls and was willing to push myself to another level. And, you know, it rhymes with Ted, so 'Ted Shred' was what I was called."" Ligety may have had a wild streak as a teenager, but he has adopted the same levelheaded approach to business as his skiing career, partnering a friend who brought technical expertise to the venture. ""It's nice to have the distraction of running a company. I wouldn't say I do the day-to-day business side of it just because it would be impossible with my schedule, but it's a fun distraction to take it away from the grind of always traveling and ski racing."" His products are worn by a growing number of fellow World Cup skiers, including Alexis Pinturault, a young Frenchman who beat Ligety into third place as he claimed his maiden World Cup giant slalom win at Garmisch-Partenkirchen last weekend. It was a rare defeat in giant slalom this season for Ligety, who has taken advantage of a change in the length of skis and their turning circle to dominate the discipline. Outspoken critic . Ironically, Ligety was an outspoken critic of the rule changes introduced by world governing body, the FIS, and was perplexed that as a leading competitor he wasn't consulted on the changes. ""I wasn't even talked to about it or asked if I thought it was a good idea, it just happened and I thought it was done in a very improper manner,"" he said. He quickly put that lack of consultation to one side when he won an early-season race by more than two and a half seconds -- the margins are usually tenths of seconds -- and Ligety is still waiting for the rest of the world to catch up. The American believes the new regulations play to his strengths as a near 10-year veteran of the circuit and because of his style of starting the turns around the gates a little earlier and finishing a little later. ""It allows me to be cleaner on the edge and accelerate more out of the turns,"" he said. Using gravity . As a youngster he was inspired by the exploits of Tommy Moe -- ""my first ski hero"" -- who won gold and silver at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer. Skiing since the age of two, Ligety started competing seriously as a 10-year-old, progressing through the ranks to make the full U.S. ski team by the team he had left high school. However, his early Olympic success in Turin, becoming the first American since Moe to claim a skiing gold, was not matched in the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver where he finished fifth behind teammate Miller in his super combined title defense. A ninth place finish in the giant slalom was also a disappointment. But 2011 saw Ligety claim his first world title, winning the giant slalom at Garmisch and then going on to clinch his third World Cup crown in his favored discipline. For Ligety, the 2013-14 season will bring promise of finally winning the overall World Cup title -- ""that's been my goal since I was a little kid"" -- and truly cementing his status as the No.1 racer. ""I think a lot of guys are faster skiers than me but they might not necessarily have the same mental fortitude as me,"" he said. Ligety will spend the offseason hanging out with friends, taking part in other sports such as mountain biking and keeping track of the progress of his favorite basketball team -- the Utah Jazz. Then the hard work will begin in his quest for World Cup and Olympic glory: six months on the road with the U.S. team when he hopes to fulfill his remaining ambitions in alpine racing.

"(CNN) -- As driving snow enveloped him and the temperature sank towards zero, Songezo Jim must have wondered if all that hard graft to realize his dream was worth it. But not even the extreme weather conditions that blighted the Milan-San Remo cycle race could tarnish the pride the 22-year-old felt at becoming a pioneer for his sport in South Africa. Eight years previously, a wall of color and noise had transfixed him as Cape Town's biggest bike race snaked through the Khayelitsha township where he lived. It was the first time he'd seen or heard of competitive cycling, and it started a journey that would end with him becoming the first black South African to participate at the sport's elite division, on the International Cycling Union's World Tour. And all the wind, rain, snow and ice thrown at him during Italy's famous 298-kilometer race couldn't wash away the elation Jim felt at etching his name in the history books forever. ""I've never been that cold in my whole life,"" Jim told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It was snowing, it was wet and the rain kept coming down. ""I was riding with my eyes closed at some points because there was no visibility with sunglasses, but when you took them off the snow went into your eyes. ""While the racing and weather was so hard I was thinking, 'Why am I doing this, this is horrible.' But then I thought, 'This is what I've dreamed about. I would not want to be anywhere else in the world.' ""It was unbelievable but I told myself I'm just going to keep on going."" Tragedy took Jim from his home in Mthatha near the east coast of South Africa to the Western Cape as a teenager, but it would prove to be the place his sporting dream crystallized. After losing both his mother and father in the space of two years he moved 1,200 km to Khayelitsha, the country's largest township, to live with his aunt. Soon after the sight of those 35,000 riders sweeping past his home had ignited in him a desire to discover cycling, he was introduced to the Velokhaya project, which aims to help disadvantaged kids become champions on and off the bike. Jim was desperate to throw himself into competition right away. There was just one problem -- he had no idea how to cycle. ""When I actually saw people riding, to me it was like 'Why are these people riding bikes? What's going on here?' and then I actually joined them,"" he explained. ""But when I did it was weird because I didn't even know how to ride a bike because I never knew anything about bikes."" It is no surprise that despite the treacherous conditions in his first World Tour race, Jim's dedication to the cause was absolute. After some promising junior results, and finishing third in the African Championships in 2012, he swapped his home in South Africa for the Italian town of Lucca, near Pisa, in order to train harder and smarter. By the end of his Milan-San Remo appearance the cold had taken such a grip on him that he had to be helped out of his cycling threads by the director of his MTN-Qhubeka team, Africa's first pro-continental outfit. He was not able to finish the race, which was shortened due to the weather, but he had played his part in helping teammate Gerald Ciolek to claim victory. ""It was just an unbelievable feeling, especially for me to be part of the team,"" Jim said. His passion for the sport has helped in his battle to overcome the traumatic events that visited him at such a tender age. ""For me to lose my parents at a young age, it was one the biggest challenges I've had to face in my life,"" he said. ""To grow up without the support of a parent, it was very difficult, but then I actually got to know the sport of cycling, that's when I decided, 'OK I just have to do this.' ""No-one is able to ride the bike apart from you -- even if my parents were there they wouldn't ride the bike for me -- so at the end of the day it just depends what you want in life. ""There's no point feeling sorry for yourself and people are not going to feel sorry for you. I decided I just have to do what I have to do because I love the sport."" Jim's feats have not gone unnoticed back in South Africa, and press interest in him has been extensive. It'll go through the roof if he fulfills his ultimate ambition to make it to the Tour de France. With his profile rising like his career, he hopes he can now prove an inspiration for other kids with similarly challenging lives in the townships of South Africa and encourage a wave of interest in the sport. ""There are very few black cyclists that are in the sport,"" he said. ""The first reason is this sport is really expensive. ""In order to become a cyclist, it requires you to be dedicated and your family to be behind you because you have to buy bikes, helmets and shoes. ""Second of all, if I could go back to me, at the age of 13 you don't even know what cycling is and you don't even know there's a sport that exists that's called cycling. ""At least now there are more people recognizing me so when I go back to Eastern Cape they ask me questions and I start to tell them everything. ""It's improving but there's still a lot that needs to be done. It would be great for me to see a lot of black South Africans in the sport.""","Songezo Jim is the first black South African to compete in a World Tour cycling event .

"(CNN) -- Unimaginable cruelty marked the beginning of Youssif's story. At 5 years old, he was attacked by masked men as he played outside his Baghdad home in 2007. The men poured gasoline on his face and then set him on fire. His parents wondered, given their child's horrific injuries, whether he would ever smile again. But Youssif's story struck a chord with CNN's millions of viewers and readers worldwide. Just months after the attack, the boy and his family came to the United States with a single suitcase. Their living expenses and medical expenses -- hundreds of thousands of dollars -- were paid in full by the kindness of strangers. The family was granted asylum in the United States and still calls California home. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been following Youssif's journey since he arrived in the United States and recently traveled to California to visit Youssif and see his progress. Youssif rubs face with hands, says 'no hurt' Gupta says it's hard to believe that this is the same Youssif CNN has been following for nearly six years. The boy has undergone 19 operations and a total of 61 procedures at Grossman Burn Center since 2007. Now 10, Youssif is very much a typical American fifth-grader. He's smart and confident. His favorite subject is math, and he tells Gupta that he hopes to be a doctor someday so he can help other people. When asked whether he has any trouble making friends, he's quick to respond, ""No, it's easy. Whenever a new person comes, the next day, we're just friends. No one is ever mean to me."" Youssif is now standing tall, thanks to the strength of his parents who risked so much to move to the United States. His father, 30 years old, still fears for the safety of his family in Iraq and prefers to keep his identity concealed as well as the full names of his children. Video: Horribly burned Youssif has new life . CNN: How has life been since we last saw you? Youssif's dad: His life is getting better and better. He's changed a lot, as you know. His English is great, and he is making a lot of of friends. He is much better than before. CNN: How about you? Youssif's dad: Life is getting really hard, and I'm just doing my best to keep my family happy and my kids. CNN: Are you happy here in the United States? Youssif's dad:  I am happy, yes. I am happy especially because I see my kids happy. It means a lot to me. I see them happy. I'm here for their future. CNN:  Do you think you can do it? Can you make a life here in the United States? Youssif's dad: It's not easy. I have two part-time jobs ... but it's not even covering even the rent. I get a little help for food from the government. I'm trying to find a full-time job. I'm just trying to make it all work. CNN: Youssif seems happy today. I know you're happy about that. Does he know what the rest of the world is like? Youssif's dad: I think he's a smart boy. He knows what's going on. Sometimes he comes and asks questions like a big man, not a little boy. So I think he knows what's going on. Burned Iraqi boy's road to recovery . CNN: Do you worry about that -- when he goes to a new school he's going to get teased? Youssif's dad:  Yes. CNN: Does a father prepare his son for that? Youssif's dad: We have to be strong, and then we have to make him strong, too. I let him know that if anyone is going to come to you and tease you, you have to be smart and think before you do anything wrong. CNN: Do you worry new wounds will be opened up emotionally? Youssif's dad: I don't know about the new kids, how they're going to act towards him. He'll be fine with the friends he has now, but with the new kids, I think it is going to be hard. CNN: Do you tell people what happened to Youssif? Youssif's dad: Sometimes it bothers me when they don't ask and they keep just looking. It really bothers me. If they came to me and asked me, I would answer. I would love to answer and tell them what's going on instead of just looking at him. That bothers me a lot. Youssif's mom: Why my son? CNN: Does Youssif ask you to tell him about the attack? Youssif's dad: He doesn't ask. He doesn't say anything about his face. Nothing bothers him, but it bothers me. I'm doing my best to keep them happy. CNN: Youssif seems very ambitious and very courageous. What do you think about that when he says he wants to be a doctor? Youssif's dad: I'm so happy to hear that, of course. Sometimes he comes to me and says, ""I know you work like every day, you don't sleep well. I hope one day I'm going to be become a doctor, and then I will buy a house, pay for everything, and then you just rest, Dad."" Sometimes when he comes to tell me that, I cry. It just means a lot to me. CNN: It's been almost six years now since you've been in the United States. What do you think the next five years hold? Youssif's dad: We don't know what is going to happen, but I hope it keeps getting better and better.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- President Richard Nixon continues to loom large over America's political imagination. This week, CNN will air a documentary, ""Our Nixon,"" based on home movies from three of Nixon's top advisers: H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Dwight Chapin, all of whom served time in prison. The film offers viewers a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like to be part of that White House during one of the most turbulent periods in the nation's recent history. The film joins a huge library of books, movies, documentaries, academic publications and music -- all of which have taken us into one of the most puzzling and troubling American presidencies. In his most recent comedy special, comedian Louis C.K. mocked younger Americans who complain about their frustration with President Barack Obama, reminding them, ""Today people are like, 'The president's kind of disappointing.' Really? Our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away!"" Despite our fascination with Nixon, it is remarkable how many of the important lessons from his presidency that we forget and how many of the problems that emerged in the final months of the Watergate scandal remain with us. As the nation looks back at Nixon's legacy with this film and other anniversary commemorations that are certain to come, we would do well to think harder about four lessons from those difficult days about the problems with our government institutions and our political leaders so that we make sure to do better for future generations. Lesson 1: The dangers of executive power . Nixon believed firmly in the power of the presidency. As Nixon later told David Frost, ""When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal."" At the heart of Watergate was Nixon's effort to obstruct an investigation into his presidency. Even before this scandal unfolded, Nixon had employed executive power in aggressive fashion to combat the Democratic Congress and federal bureaucracy. Yet, executive power has remained extremely strong since that time. Even though Congress reasserted its role in a number of areas, such as the budget, the nation's political leaders and voters continued to accept an extraordinarily strong presidency in which members of the executive branch were able to take actions without accountability and the public was supposed to trust presidents to do the right thing. Too often, Americans have learned, they didn't do the right thing. Most recently, we have seen enormous growth of executive power since 9/11. The recent stories surrounding the National Security Agency and the surveillance program is an important reminder of how much power we bestow on this branch of government. Members of both parties who claim that we can trust elected officials to do the right thing might want to look back at Nixon to remember how far the envelope can be pushed. Lesson 2: What Congress can do . Congress has been the focus of criticism throughout American history. But in the Watergate crisis, public approval of the legislative branch skyrocketed as America saw a political institution that aggressively responded to a breakdown in our system. As the reports emerged about what had gone on, the Senate stepped to the forefront of the investigation and forced administration officials to stand before the public and reveal what had happened. The Senate was also instrumental in opening the investigation to other kinds of wrongdoing that had been taking place. After Nixon resigned, Congress approved reforms that aimed to improve the political system, some of which did create better rules for campaign finance and openness in government. Today's Congress doesn't seem to have the same character. It is an institution where investigations are conducted primarily as partisan affairs, and Congress shows little interest in tackling the underlying problems -- such as campaign finance or ethics -- that are at play in key scandals that have emerged. Nor does Congress show the capacity to function in the same way as the institution did during those dramatic years. Lesson 3: Money and politics . Beyond the break-in, the Watergate investigation raised all kinds of issues that disturbed Americans about how the political system worked. During the congressional hearings, there was massive evidence that the Nixon White House had made policy decisions that were related to campaign contributions. The hearings included dramatic stories of one administration official, G. Gordon Liddy, obtaining a briefcase with $83,000 and the president reversing policies because the milk industry made donations. It became clear that the lines separating policy and money were thin. For some time, Congress made the system better. The campaign reforms in 1974 created a system of public finance for presidential elections that vastly diminished the amount of private funds in campaigns. They also imposed limits on campaign contributions in presidential and congressional elections. Although the reforms improved campaign finance for over a decade, gradually candidates and contributors found loopholes in the system. Supreme Court decisions, starting with Buckley v. Valeo (1976) undercut the power of the reforms. Most recently, George W. Bush and Barack Obama decided that they would not accept the public money for their campaigns, which in turn allowed them to take as much private money as they wanted. Today, there is a tsunami of private money flowing into our political system. Washington is dominated by fundraising. Until the nation truly does something about how campaign finance works, we leave ourselves open to repeating the mistakes that surrounded Watergate. Lesson 4: Investigative journalism is essential . A positive change to come out of Watergate was a new ethic of journalism. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two reporters for The Washington Post, were a driving force behind the investigation as they discovered how the burglars in the Watergate had links to the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Other journalists, such as CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, played a huge role in connecting the dots of this story. Woodward and Bernstein became models for younger journalists, encouraging them to conduct fearless investigations into power. Investigative journalism moved to the forefront of the profession, with younger reporters determined to find the next Watergate. Yet today that kind of journalism is under attack. As Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote in The Washington Post, there has been a dangerous trend since 9/11. First, many in the news industry failed to ask tough questions during the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. In recent years, the Obama administration has dramatically increased the prosecution of suspected leakers. And a federal appeals court recently prohibited reporters from invoking the First Amendment to avoid testifying in cases about leaks. . The ""very act of newsgathering,"" vanden Heuvel writes, ""is under siege...."" Unfortunately, too many of the problems that shaped Nixon's presidency continue today and, if we don't do something about it, we might just end up with another major scandal on our hands, of the kind that is shown in ""Our Nixon."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","A film based on home movies by Nixon aides airs on CNN at 9 p.m. ET Thursday .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian authorities released Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, on bail Tuesday after she relinquished assets to the state. Suzanne Mubarak, 70, gave up bank accounts worth $3.4 million, said Aly Hassan, a spokesman for the department overseeing a corruption probe. Mubarak also signed an affidavit allowing further investigation into her fortunes both in Egypt and abroad, Hassan said. She also gave up a villa, reported the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. Mubarak and her husband, who was ousted from power February 11 after 18 days of uprising, face allegations of illegally acquiring wealth. Hosni Mubarak is also being investigated for culpability in the deaths of protesters. He remains in detention. Mohamed Fathalla, a doctor at the Sharm el-Sheikh hospital, said Suzanne Mubarak's blood pressure was extremely high and she should not be detained any more, Al Ahram said. Her psychological state was also volatile, said Adel Adawy, assistant to the health minister, and she will be treated at Sharm el-Sheikh hospital, the newspaper said. She was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack last week and was treated in the intensive care unit. Assem al-Gohary, the assistant justice minister for the Illicit Gains Authority, had ordered her detained for ""obtaining illegal wealth using her husband's position and political authority."" A team of investigators from the authority, a separate investigative unit under the Ministry of Justice, had questioned the former president in the same hospital for three hours last Thursday regarding ""using his political position as president to acquire illegal wealth."" ""Hosni Mubarak was also questioned about his luxury mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh,"" al-Gohary said. Last month, the former president suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges, Egyptian state television reported. But the head doctor from a Ministry of Justice team assisting with the questioning disputed the diagnosis, saying later that the former leader had heart palpitations and was able to walk with assistance. He was deemed stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital, according to Al Ahram. Hosni Mubarak has said the state inquiry is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Suzanne Mubarak gave up bank accounts worth $3.4 million .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- The United States and Canada stepped up efforts to open other aid routes Wednesday after a leading relief agency complained that air traffic congestion in Port-au-Prince was costing lives on the ground. Doctors Without Borders has blamed five deaths on the delays, telling reporters that flights carrying drugs, surgical supplies and dialysis machines have been diverted from Port-au-Prince to the neighboring Dominican Republic three times since Sunday. ""If we don't move now, we will lose patients, as we did,"" Loris de Filippi, an official at the group's hospital in the Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil, told CNN Tuesday. ""We lost two patients tonight because we don't have the capacity to do more."" At least 72,000 people have been confirmed dead in the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti January 12, according to the country's prime minister. International aid contributions have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars since then, but relief agencies on the ground say transportation bottlenecks and poor communications have slowed the delivery of food, water and medicine to survivors. The U.S. military, which has been assisting Haitian authorities in controlling air traffic into Port-au-Prince, says the single-runway airport has been handling up to 180 flights a day. But in an effort to open up the flow, the U.S. military said Wednesday that it has obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, near the capital of Santo Domingo, about 220 km (150 miles) east of Port-au-Prince. Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, the head of the U.S. military task force in Haiti, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that any aircraft identified as carrying medical supplies has priority for landing rights. Aircraft are only turned away ""if there's no parking space on the ramp, and they don't have sufficient fuel to hold in their holding pattern."" But he said Wednesday night one aircraft was sent back to the Dominican Republic ""that we should have put on the ground, but we did not know what was on it because it was not posted."" ""If the air traffic controller knows what's on the plane and what the tail number is and he has three planes stacked up and he knows one of them has got medical supplies on it and that's the top priority identified by the government of Haiti, then that plane is going to come in,"" Keen said. In addition, the Pentagon is dispatching a ship equipped with cranes that could get the port of Port-au-Prince back into operation ""within a week or two, perhaps,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters Wednesday during a visit to India. And Canadian troops are working to open up an airfield in the southern city of Jacmel by Thursday, Canadian Defense Minster Peter Mackay said. ""This achievement is crucial, as it will allow the Canadian forces access to a viable landing strip 24 hours a day, making it easier to ensure a continuous flow of aid supplies and equipment,"" Mackay announced in a statement from Ottawa. Meanwhile, he said, two warships are landing supplies by sea, and Canada has reached an agreement with Jamaica to fly supplies into southern Haiti from there. A senior U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the priorities for aid flights are set ""by the government of Haiti first and then by the U.N. second."" But the number of flights that can land at Port-au-Prince is ""a sheer issue of physics and geometry; you just can't get them all in there."" ""There are great people on the ground, working very, very hard to try and get as much in as they can as fast as they can, and try and keep everybody impressed that we are there to support them. But there are some people that are just not going to be happy because we can't get it all,"" the official said. The U.S. military has the capability to build dirt runways that rugged cargo planes like the C-130 Hercules can use, but the equipment needed to build those is ""always at a premium,"" the official said. The U.S. military has nearly 50 helicopters in the field that can help move supplies around the stricken country, he said.","Doctors Without Borders has blamed five deaths on aid delays .

"(CNN) -- When was the last time you looked at the label on your clothes to check where they were made or what they are made of? A few years ago, I was living a paradox familiar to many Americans: eating local and organic food, carrying reusable bags to the grocery store and choosing eco-friendly products wherever I could. This mindfulness was in no way extended to my closet -- I owned more than 350 items of clothes, every single bit of it cheap, trendy, poorly made and assembled in low-wage factories in other countries. See the lifecycle of your cotton T-shirt . Fashion today has a here-today-gone-tomorrow mentality, where the latest look, lowest price or the hottest designer are paramount and quantity is valued over quality. For the first time in history, we are consuming clothes as a disposable good, buying a cheap dress for a date night and wearing it but once or twice. These changing attitudes prompted me to write my book, ""Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,"" and what I learned about the fashion industry during the process compelled me to change. Complete coverage: Fashion Week . Our consumption of clothing is growing at an alarming rate. Most Americans have closets brimming, if not overflowing with clothes. Few of those purchases are made here -- 3% of apparel is produced in the United States, down from about half in 1990. While American factories sit empty, our thirst for cheap imported clothing has kept the cash registers at many stores humming throughout the recession. Fashion's environmental footprint has also mushroomed. There are more than 80 billion garments produced around the world today, and according to a study by the UK's Cambridge University, the industry is creating 70 million tons of waste water as of 2006 in the UK alone. In China, the largest clothing manufacturer in the world, the textile industry is also a major polluter. Last year, I traveled undercover to southern China and saw smog enshrouding a landscape of factories and, more shockingly, hundreds of factory workers wearing cheap, trendy clothes. As China's consumer class grows, already-scarce resources like water and petroleum may soon buckle under all of this shopping. In July, when it came out that the Olympic uniforms were made in China, Americans were outraged, making it clear that we're growing weary of soulless consumption. I believe we're ready for more meaningful wardrobes, and to support our amazing clothing heritage. My mother recently gave me a dress that she wore in high school in the 1960s. It was made by Jonathan Logan, a juniors brand that was considered cheap for its day -- the dress is 100% wool, fully lined, finished with French seams and made in the USA. What's so wonderful about locally made fashion is that it offers designers tight control over their product, has a lower environmental footprint and makes it easier to keep an eye on any labor problems. And according to a Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor survey, approximately 55% of consumers agree it is ""very/somewhat important"" that their clothing is made in the U.S. I was recently in Portland, Oregon, and met with the owners of Spooltown and the Portland Garment Factory, two small shops that have opened recently in a city that had very little existing garment industry infrastructure. They were able to build profitable manufacturing businesses from scratch. Just imagine what other Americans cities could do with the right government and consumer support. Major fashion brands also have an obligation to dramatically reduce the amount of water and energy used and waste emitted in making and selling their clothes, as well as to offer consumers more stylish products that are made out of recycled and eco-friendly materials. Nike is creating athletic team uniforms out of recycled PET bottles and has recycled more than 28 million pairs of athletic shoes through their Reuse-a-Shoe program; Eileen Fisher has just released a beautiful line of bluesign-certified silk shirts dyed without hazardous chemicals; and H&M has agreed to stop using toxic and nonbiodegradable perfluorinated compounds, called PFCs, in their outerwear by 2013. These efforts need to be expanded. Clothing designers also need to rethink the materials they're using and how they're sourced. Fortunately, eco-friendly textiles have improved so much in recent years that luxurious eco-friendly fibers like Tencel, Modal and Cupro have far more in common with silk than a hemp sack. Some emerging designers are eschewing new textiles altogether for upcycling, which means taking waste and reclaimed textile material and turning it into a product with higher value. I recently bought a lovely red tunic upcycled from a men's dress shirt produced by a small Brooklyn designer called State. Designer on the rise: Mohapatra's moment . According to the Environmental Protection Agency, we are throwing away 68 pounds of textiles per person per year and donating such a staggering volume of clothes that a majority of our donations to charity have to be sold to textile recyclers who then sell more than half of our used clothes overseas, largely to Africa. Retailers like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are accepting returns of their worn products -- Fisher resells them in her Green Eileen retail store, while Patagonia recycles theirs into new products. Fast-fashion stores need to start these types of recycling programs. Consumers can also take more responsibility by repairing and caring for the clothes they own, trading their duds at clothing swaps and, for the particularly creative, refashioning last year's styles into fresh looks. Now for the million-dollar question: How can you afford this? It all starts by taking an honest look at how you're spending money on clothes. The average American consumer spends $1,700 a year on apparel. Most of us own more clothing than we know what to do with, so I encourage people to first of all buy less clothing and to try to limit trendy, throwaway purchases to only one or two a season. Divert the rest of your clothing budget to clothes that you truly love and are going to wear for several seasons. If just a quarter of our purchases were put toward locally made or eco-friendly fashion and fashion companies with a commitment to sustainability, we could change the face of the industry. I also believe we'd be happier with our clothes. See what a cotton T-shirt goes through before it gets to you. Is your closet filled with cheap, disposable clothing?

"(CNN) -- Inspirational music has long served to focus the mind of some of the world's greatest sporting stars. Retired swimming champion Michael Phelps swore by the grizzly bark of rapper DMX, while former England footballer Stuart Pearce was known to crank out the snarling punk of the Sex Pistols. For giant judo champion Teddy Riner, however, the motivational music of choice is something altogether more sensitive. ""The moments before the fight, I put my headphones on to enter into the zone,"" Riner told CNN's Human to Hero series. And on his iPod, alongside a dollop of rap and dance music, the Frenchman confesses to getting pumped up on the power ballads of Celine Dion. See also: Skiing's winning machine . The Canadian diva may seem like an unorthodox motivator for a sport where brute strength and controlled aggression are key. But the tuneful preparation has already helped the man nicknamed the ""Teddy Bear"" shape up for spectacular success -- a long way from his early days, when he admits to being ""a bit useless."" The 23-year-old -- who measures in at an imposing 6 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs 282 pounds (128 kg) -- is already a five-time world champion and the Olympic gold medal winner at London 2012. He also picked up a bronze at the Beijing Games of 2008 and has twice been crowned Europe's best. Caribbean roots . Born in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, Riner was raised by his parents in Paris. A self-confessed bundle of energy as a child, he was encouraged to hit the tatami (judo mats) at a small club in the city. Given his sheer size and athleticism, he was a natural and soon fell in love with the sport. The goal of achieving ""ippon"" -- the fight-ending maximum score a judoka receives when a move that flips or throws an opponent onto their back is executed -- was a source of particular pleasure for the young Riner . ""Before judo I did many other sports,"" he explains. ""I did tennis, basketball, swimming, golf ... squash, football. I stuck with judo because of the call to score ippon. ""To win a fight there are rules, a technique. The two shoulders of the opponent must touch the tatami. If the two shoulders touch with speed and impact on the floor, it's ippon (and) it's won."" Disciplined approach . Like any athlete operating at the elite level of their chosen sport, Riner adheres to a strict training program that requires unwavering discipline and a robust frame of mind. In judo, more so than other sports, these qualities are especially valuable. The philosophy of self-control and respect for one's opponent outside the arena is just as critical to master as the physical conditioning for when the fight begins. See also: Blind runner beats bullies . ""It is a sport which demands an irreproachable lifestyle, a sport which demands a rigor,"" Riner says. ""(There is) a moral code which is similar to that which you learn from your parents. ""You need to be strong up here,"" Riner adds, tapping his head. ""The opponent in front of you may be strong, tall, thin -- you have to work hard to get ippon. ""It's this that makes the difference, you can't let anything go."" While an array of medals and championship-winning performances suggest Riner has mastered both the mental and muscular side of his sport, he is quick to point out that his path to the top was far from smooth. ""I don't think I have a gift. You should have seen me when I first started, I wasn't the great judoka I have become,"" he says. ""I was a bit useless."" ""Today it is true that with a lot of work and a lot of assiduousness I have succeeded in forging a good judo, a good character and an intelligence for the fight,"" he adds. ""My secret to winning, I think, is the fact that I am so determined in my training, to put myself in the red, always pushing the limits."" Judo calling . This desire to constantly improve is undoubtedly made easier with a genuine enjoyment and appreciation of the intricacies of his sport. Riner's daily training schedule consists of five hours' intense cardio and meticulous judo work. But while some athletes look for distractions once away from competitive arena or training field, Riner remains firmly attuned to his sport. See also: Ice Hockey's David faces Goliathan challenge . ""Judo is a calling, a vocation for me,"" he enthuses. ""Sometimes we finish a training session and I'm tired, but a few hours later I already feel like playing again. ""For me it's not a work or a sacrifice, it's a game and it's a pleasure. The day I no longer feel like playing on the tatami ... I'll stop."" For now, the day that Riner hangs up his kimono seems a long way off. Still very much in his youth and operating at a level few of his peers can match, there seems little capable of subduing this Goliath of the mats or his hunger for success. ""What motivates me is winning medals, reaching the top of my sport,"" he says. ""I have my mentality, I have my way of being, I have my personality which makes me a fighter. I am a real fighter, and I love that.""","Teddy Riner is the reigning heavyweight Olympic judo champion .

"(CNN) -- With the holy month of Ramadan approaching, lawyers for four Guantanamo Bay captives are trying to end forced-feeding at the U.S. detention facility in Cuba. Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Belbacha, Nabil Hadjarab and Abu Wa'el Dhiab seek a speedy hearing to have their complaint heard because Ramadan begins on the evening of July 8. The timing is urgent because Muslims who observe Ramadan fast daily from dawn to sunset. The lawyers for the four filed the federal lawsuit in Washington on Sunday. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler set a deadline of noon ET Wednesday for the government to respond. Navy Capt. Robert Durand of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo said it would be ""inappropriate to comment on that current litigation at this time."" Gitmo hunger strikers: 'What more can they do to me?' Addressing the religious requirements of Muslims during Ramadan, he said, ""we essentially invert our schedule to accommodate these religious practices, including involuntary feeding."" The lawsuit says Aamer is a Saudi national and British citizen cleared by the Obama administration for release in 2009. Belbacha and Hadjarab, who are Algerian citizens, were first cleared for release in 2007 during the Bush administration and reauthorized for release by the Obama administration in 2009, the suit says. Dhiab is a Syrian national cleared for release in 2009, the lawsuit says. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, repeated its call Monday for the force-feeding of hunger-striking prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to stop. Daily life at Gitmo: Hunger strikes, sprays of filth . Ibrahim Hooper, the national director of communications at the council, said the practice of forced-feeding is always wrong and is particularly offensive during Ramadan. ""We've asked for the forced-feeding to be stopped in any case. ... It sends a very negative message to the Muslim world."" Because of security measures in place, it's difficult to determine how many detainees are on hunger strikes. As of Tuesday, 166 detainees were at Guantanamo. Durand said 106 of them are being tracked as hunger strikers. Of those, 45 are being fed through tubes directly to the stomach or intestinal tract, he said. The number could be higher: The Joint Task Force does not comment on the 15 ""high-value detainees"" being held in a separate camp at Guantanamo. Some of them could be on hunger strikes, as well.

"(CNN) -- She's a perfect 10; the surfer that other professionals will drag themselves out of the water to watch. But it is the satisfaction of being able to help her family that ranks as Silvana Lima's proudest achievement. The diminutive Brazilian, twice a runner-up on the women's World Tour, is seen as a pioneer in her sport who is still pushing the boundaries at the age of 28. That talent has taken her round the globe and offered rewards that she has been able to divert back to her family in the north western state of Ceara. ""Surfing has helped me a lot,"" the sole Brazilian representative of the elite 17 competitors on the women's tour told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""My success was the fact that I was able to help out others. ""To have been able to leave my hometown, and being able to help out my family, who didn't have good enough conditions to eat, to study. ""Surfing was amazing; it arrived in the best moment for me. It took me away from my hometown and got me where I am today. ""I already helped my Mom, gave her a house and helped my brother a lot."" After becoming besotted with the sport at the age of five, Lima's path to the elite level was clearly defined ever since she eschewed a possible career in soccer to focus on surfing. And that decision was vindicated when she became the first woman to ever record a perfect score of 10 for her ride during a competition in Hawaii in 2005. ""It's a wonderful memory,"" she explains. ""It was my first wave and it was Honolulu Bay in Hawaii. I managed to be on the first beautiful, beautiful wave. ""I remember I dropped down -- I still have that image in my mind today -- entering the tube and pumping, pumping, pumping. It was a great maneuver. I knew then that it was going to be a 10."" Lima has since gone on to record two more perfect rides to enhance the reputation she holds for a progressive, all-action style that even her peers find intoxicating. Full of dynamic set-pieces, Lima spends a healthy portion of her competition performances tucked in the barrel of a wave or using it as a ramp to propel her into the air -- a move known as an aerial. ""It's a very hard maneuver to execute, because you are just taking off from a wave with the board under your feet and you land,"" Lima said. ""It's very difficult and you have various types of aerials. It's my favorite because it took me a long time to learn that maneuver. The feeling that you get from taking off from a wave and completing that maneuver is wonderful. ""After the aerial, the barrel is the best. You feel like you are in your mother's womb -- it's special. ""In the barrel you are inside the wave and you see that image in front of you, the door of the barrel for you to exit and you feel like, 'Wow, I'm inside the barrel.' ""You stay there just riding it and when you leave you feel like it was the best maneuver you have ever made."" As competition surfing continues to evolve, more and more professionals are taking the aerial route. But as surfers strive for greater heights by taking on moves of greater complexity, the danger is increased and, in turn, the risk of injury -- a topic Lima knows all about. She spent the whole of the 2012 season on the sidelines after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament during a competition on the Gold Coast in Australia. It meant a third bout of similar surgery and an exhaustive rehabilitation process, though she did receive an injury wild card to compete on the 2013 Tour. ""I remember all three moments, all three surgeries and it's not a very good memory,"" she said. ""I feel sad and happy at the same time because I've got through it and that makes me feel good but to remember how it all happened is bad. ""(The most recent injury) was turning around while doing a maneuver and while my body was twisting, my leg remained in the same position, so I basically just twisted my body. Brazil's best beaches . ""When you have pain in your knee or anywhere else in your body, you want to get back into the water to do what you have always done, to give 100%. ""I want it to stop there and not have any more surgeries, to feel 100% by doing everything right: gym, physiotherapy, good diet, sleep well, be a complete professional! ""I think if I do everything right, God won't let those things happen to me again."" Though Lima has been part of the fabric of the women's tour for a decade, she is still more than holding her own against much younger competitors and proudly flying the flag for Brazil. ""My biggest dream is to be world champion,"" Lima said. ""It's really important for me to be here among the best surfers in the world -- the only Brazilian. I'm really happy and proud of myself, and want to keep on improving.""","Silvana Lima is the only Brazilian on the women's surfing world tour .

"(CNN) -- With a straight face and a shrug, world motorcycling champion Jorge Lorenzo details the danger involved in reaching the sport's dizzying pinnacle: ""I had my first injury at age seven."" For most of the last 18 years his body has absorbed a litany of crashes -- some at speeds of 150 miles per hour as he contests the elite MotoGP competition which he has now won twice. ""On my wrist, maybe twice, and as for my collar bone -- five, six times. My head, so many."" He catalogs these events as if reeling off a shopping list, pausing briefly to explain that one of them, at a Spanish circuit in 2008, left him unable to remember anything for ""two or three days."" The riders, whose bikes cost millions of dollars, get so close to the ground when racing that they not only touch the tarmac with their highly-padded knees, but also their elbows. ""Too much pain, too many injuries,"" Lorenzo told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's almost 20 years that I have injures, have crashes. It's normal when you are a rider, it sometimes happens, no?"" Given this gruesome roll call, it is a wonder the Spaniard's mind isn't submerged by dread as he tears round the track but it is with a softer, more sensuous tone that Lorenzo explains his relationship with the motorbike that so often puts him in harm's way. ""It's like dancing,"" he said. ""When you dance with a girl, you don't think. Just hear the music and just move. ""At the beginning when you don't know how to dance you have to think how to put the feet and how to move your body. ""But when you do it for so many times, then you don't think. Just flow, no? That's the same for the bike on the track when you are a professional rider."" Change of tack . Lorenzo ascension to such an ingrained in-race mentality has come from his history of hard knocks, but his past also pivots on a decision to race smarter, not faster. The crash which accounted for his temporary memory loss marked a watershed in his career. It was the fifth consecutive meeting in which he'd toppled off his bike. It signaled a necessary change of approach that paved the way for him to realize his dream of becoming MotoGP champion in 2010 and 2012. ""I was an aggressive rider in the past,"" he explained. ""Then the first year in MotoGP I still was an aggressive rider. I crashed many times. I injured myself many times. ""In 2008 I had my fifth consecutive crash in Catalunya in 2008. And I hit my head in one crash twice or three times, bump bump bump bump ... so much. I didn't remember anything for about two or three days. ""So at this time I told myself, 'I have to change.' Or change my way of riding. I became more calm, more clever, or thinking (about) more things I do on the bike, or I stop riding. ""And now I'm much more different. I'm different and normally I don't crash so much. Last year I crashed maybe twice."" Broken ankles . If the frequency of these crashes is hard to compute, the desire for Lorenzo and his peers to race at all costs is even more mind-boggling. After a nasty smash during practice ahead of the China Grand Prix in 2008 -- his self-confessed reckless period -- Lorenzo broke both his ankles. Yet he still took part in the race, securing fourth place. He had to be lifted off his bike once he'd finished. Lorenzo's new stealth on the track was evident in the 2010 season as he charged to his first MotoGP title. He won nine grands prix and showcased his new-found maturity by finishing on the podium in 16 out of 18 races. It marked the realization of a dream that was formed at five years old and, alongside his first ever world title in the 250cc division, it is Lorenzo's proudest achievement in a sport that has dominated his life. Bike-mad upbringing . If his epiphany at five sparked a desire to win the world title, his love for bikes came even earlier growing up in Mallorca, part of Spain's Balearic Islands and also the home of tennis star Rafael Nadal. ""I started to practice at three years old with a bike that my dad started to build, handmade, for me,"" he said. ""My first race was at three years old, but I didn't have the license. I was crying because I wanted to race. The boss of the race saw me crying and he said, 'Okay, you can race. But I didn't have the license, so I had to wait two more years to get the license. ""I started at five to race constantly. Trial, motocross, minicross, scooter, pocket bikes. Everything I could do, and my father could offer me. ""And then in 1997, I started to race around all of Spain in world racing. Then at 14 I signed with Derby, a Spanish brand, for the 125cc world championship."" 'The most important thing' He revs himself up ahead of races by listening to American rockers Linkin Park (""because it gives me a lot of power"") but afterwards Lorenzo needs to take the edge off the adrenalin rush. ""I do some meditation, some yoga. I stay relaxed, just breathing and not thinking anything for five minutes. And I finish completely relaxed."" Lorenzo's rise through the ranks of motorbike racing now sees him sitting on top of the world -- a place he intends to maintain when the 2013 season kicks off in Qatar this April. ""The competitive goal must be trying to fight again for the world championship,"" he said. ""But I always try every year to grow as a rider, and especially as a person. ""To improve my weak points, and try to keep the good points I have. But to grow -- grow as a person, and as a rider. It's the most important thing.""","Jorge Lorenzo is the reigning world motorbike champion in MotoGP .

"(CNN) -- Great Britain can legitimately claim to have invented ice hockey, and even won gold at the 1936 Winter Olympics -- but its modern-day heroes are struggling to uphold that heritage in the face of adversity. When some British solders first ventured on to the ice in Ontario, Canada in the mid-19th century to play a modified version of field hockey, they could never have dreamed a multibillion-dollar business would be the legacy. However, while the sport has flourished in North America and other European nations, in the UK it battles a chronic lack of funding and fights for snippets of media coverage in a country where football dominates the back pages. Team GB has not played in the Winter Games since 1948, and suffered another heartbreaking failure last week in the final round of qualifying in Riga. Despite the setbacks, stalwart player David Clarke remains optimistic for the future of the sport. ""Great Britain isn't renowned for its ice hockey talent, but it's growing and we've made a great account for ourselves over the last four or five years,"" Clarke told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""So, I think gradually we are getting more respect but with that comes expectation."" A squad coached by Scotsman Tony Hand, who briefly played alongside Wayne Gretzky in the NHL, lost to 11th-ranked hosts Latvia, France and Kazakhstan, ending their hopes of going to Sochi in 2014. ""We gave a decent account of ourselves, but it would have been nice to have been able to get together as a team for more than just two days to properly prepare,"" said Clarke. Andy French, general secretary of Ice Hockey UK, which now boasts over 10,000 registered players, is dismayed they receive no funding from the British sports authorities. ""Extra backing would create more revenue to enable all our teams from junior to senior level to have four international breaks per year to prepare for world championships, to bring on board a sports psychologist, team nutritionist, better preparation,"" he told CNN. Clarke could have followed Hand over the Atlantic to try his hand in the toughest league of all, but decided to stay home after becoming a father at the age of 18. He also had trials for his local professional football club Peterborough, but chose hockey. Star player . If he has any regret at missing out on the possible riches in the NHL, or even the EPL, the 31-year-old does not show it. He has forged a reputation as one of the star players in the British domestic league, being the all-time top scorer, and has helped Nottingham to a Playoffs and Challenge Cup double the past two seasons. Matches are played in purpose-built arenas, with the capital cities of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland hosting the Cardiff Devils, Belfast Giants and Edinburgh Capitals before audiences of between 5,000 to 8,000 partisan fans. London had a team, for which Clarke briefly played, run by the Anschutz Entertainment Group -- one of the world's largest sporting owners and investors. The London Knights were wound up in 2003 after only five years when the competition they played in folded and their home stadium was sold. The NHL hosted two fixtures between the Anaheim Ducks and the Los Angeles Kings at London's 02 Arena in 2007, but French bemoans the fact the English capital is not represented in the GB professional league. ""I think having the NHL play here is great for the fans and also does encourage people to find out where their nearest ice rink is either to go and watch a game or for the youngsters to start playing,"" he said. ""But one big issue that we have is that we do not have a professional team playing in London. We used to have the London Knights but they finished a few years ago now."" But Clarke is encouraged by the rise of homegrown talent in a GB team which used to be packed with dual nationality players, often of Canadian and U.S. heritage. So can a GB team make it to a future Olympics and take a short step towards emulating the 1936 heroes? ""Without a doubt,"" he said. ""But if we don't start now we are going to miss the opportunity. ""It's a case of getting that talent to play to the best of their abilities. Slovenia, who we have beaten, came through the qualifying to make it to Sochi, and so can we at future Games."" Clarke shows no signs of hanging up his sticks, and playing for his country remains the ultimate goal. ""It's a massive honor. Any sport you're involved in, the pinnacle is to represent your country,"" he said. That he has been able to survive at the top of the tree for that long is testament to Clarke's commitment and a fitness program that begins at 7 a.m. each morning. He practices on the ice for about two hours, in the gym for an hour and a half followed by about 45 minutes of rehabilitation and stretching. ""We consume lots and lots of food, way over the recommended daily allowance,"" he said. ""Especially for me because I struggle to keep my weight on."" Physical sport . The world over, ice hockey is a tough and physical sport and Clarke has his tales of woe. ""Broken leg twice, a few knee ligament injuries, concussions. A few pucks, sticks in the head but we have good dentists and good doctors on hand."" He first picked up a stick at his local rink when only six years of age and, aside from the brief flirtation with football, was dead set on representing Britain at ice hockey. He progressed through the under 18 and 20 ranks, eventually taking his place in a GB lineup with players he had considered ""his idols"" when watching as a youngster. ""When he first broke into the British squad at the turn of the century his talent was obvious,"" said Ice Hockey UK's media officer Chris Ellis. Clarke's regular position is as an offensive forward ""expected to contribute goals and in assists"" and his standout abilities earned him a one-year contract with Alleghe in Italy in 2007. ""He is one of the few British players to play abroad at the top level,"" said Ellis. But the lure of home proved too strong and he returned to Nottingham for another successful spell. The Elite League has a heavy schedule, ending in April when Clarke will again hurriedly form up with the GB team as they bid to erase memories of their Latvian disappointment. ""We've got the world championship which is in Budapest this year and that will be our next focus ... we'll give it our all,"" he said. Britain plays in the second tier of competition -- the top pool dominated by the likes of the United States, Canada and Russia -- but will be bidding to improve its 21st ranking. It's a far cry from the days when a GB team took bronze in the 1924 Games in Chamonix, and capped that with gold in Germany 12 years later. The sport's powerhouses Canada and the United States took the silver and bronze, but with the NHL going to strength to strength in North America the foundation for their later domination was forged. The break-up of the Soviet Union also made it tougher for the likes of Britain to take a place at the top table, with countries such as Latvia and the Belarus forming strong national teams, with many of the players competing in the Russian league. Early roots . After those early Olympic successes, the British influence at the highest levels faded fast, but it has been a popular spectator sport and in the late 1980s enjoyed a revival with top teams featured on national television.

"There are few issues that preoccupy new parents more than this: Is my baby growing normally? When the percentiles seem off-kilter, we worry -- but experts say there's rarely reason for concern. A growth chart can be used to monitor where a child's height and weight falls in relation to national averages. For starters, healthy kids come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and they don't grow at a steady rate, either. Your child can look very different from your friends' kids -- or from his own siblings at the same age -- and still be completely normal. What influences growth . At birth: A baby's size when he's born is based partly on genetics. Firstborns tend to be smaller than subsequent children because the uterus is smaller and tighter in first-time moms. Boys are larger than girls, and multiples, boys and girls, are smaller than average. Some environmental factors that can influence a newborn's size: . • the mother's weight -- very heavy women tend to have larger babies . • weight gain during pregnancy -- a very low gain (under ten pounds) usually means a smaller baby . • whether or not Mom smokes or drinks a lot of caffeine -- both of which can limit an unborn baby's growth . • a mom's chronic illness -- diabetics, for instance, often have very large babies. During the first two years: A baby's growth is based on a combination of her birth size and the size she's genetically programmed to be: A small newborn who's going to be a big child will grow faster in the first two years than a big baby who's going to be a small child. Parenting.com: Baby milestones . Laura Hileman's son, John, was 23 inches long when he was born -- the average newborn is just 20 inches -- and his pediatrician joked that he might be seven feet tall as an adult. ""But based on my height and my husband's, the doctor didn't think that would happen,"" says the Nashville mom. Sure enough, by the time John was 3, his growth had slowed and his height was just average for his age. Parenting.com: Toddler milestones . During childhood: Both weight gain and increases in height come in short bursts of what can seem like rapid growth -- which is why kids can sometimes look almost chubby one month but lean the next. The duration of a growth spurt, as well as how much a child grows during one, differs from child to child (and from spurt to spurt in the same child). But it's not uncommon to see a visible difference in a very short time: At age 10, my son Sam once outgrew a pair of dress pants in less than a week. No one knows what causes a kid to shoot up one month and not another, but there does seem to be a seasonal pattern. ""Although we don't have a good explanation for it, children seem to grow fastest in the summer and slowest in the fall,"" says Joseph Gigante, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital in Nashville. Doctors do know what triggers growth in the first place: It's the human growth hormone, a chemical produced in bursts throughout the day but released largely during sleep. That's why it's important for kids to get the shut-eye they need throughout childhood and adolescence. During puberty: After infancy, the tween and teen years are the period of most rapid change. For girls, the growth spurt begins between 10 and 11 and lasts until around 15; for boys, it starts about two years later and lasts until age 17 or so. Girls typically stop growing about three years after they've had their first period, but boys continue to grow throughout their teens. Parenting.com: Ages, stages hot spots . Ways to keep track . Until 2002, the growth chart -- the tool doctors use to make sure kids are growing normally -- was based exclusively on norms for bottle-fed Caucasian children. Since breastfed babies tend to be smaller, as do Hispanic and Asian-American babies, the chart now includes averages for all ethnic groups, as well as for breastfed infants. In addition, the new charts track body mass index, which helps pediatricians know when a child is at risk of obesity. Parenting.com: Guide to childhood obesity . Most growth disorders are diagnosed by pediatricians, not parents, but sometimes a child who isn't growing normally can slip through the cracks. According to a study in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, about 70 percent of all kids are measured inaccurately at their checkups. (Measurements tend to be off by about half an inch.) So watch carefully as your child is being measured. And feel free to pitch in, if needed, to hold a wiggly baby still, which will help make sure the measurement is accurate. Double-check to see if the nurse records this information on the correct chart for your child's age and sex, too. My son Sam was once briefly in the 110th percentile for height; then the nurse realized she'd charted him on the curve for girls, not boys. Parenting.com: Height calculator . By comparing your child's current place on the chart with earlier recordings, your doctor will be able to see if he's growing normally. Signs that something may be amiss: . • His height seems off, given the height of his parents or siblings. • He's nowhere near the averages . • He drops 20 percentile points or more from one year to the next. • He's gaining weight much more rapidly than he's gaining height. • Puberty comes very early or very late. In such cases, your doctor may suggest a specialist. Most of the time, though, you just need to wait for the next growth spurt. And then you, like me, may find yourself buying your child another new pair of dress-up pants. E-mail to a friend . Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Parenting Magazine - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- If you've ever considered running away to join the circus, first you will need to impress someone like Krista Monson. The Canadian choreographer and former dance instructor is ultimately responsible for casting Cirque du Soleil's 1,300-odd performers. She directs a team of 60, including 21 talent scouts, who work in several countries and across social media platforms to find the world's best gymnasts, trapeze artists, contortionists, jugglers, ballet dancers, parkour practitioners, clowns, mime artists, musicians, synchronized swimmers and cliff divers. Originally a small theater troupe formed by a stilt-walking, fire-breathing accordion player named Guy Laliberte, Cirque du Soleil began to tour in 1984, as part of Quebec's 450th anniversary celebration. Today, it's one of the world's biggest and best-known circus shows, the subject of a new 3D film by ""Shrek"" director Andrew Adamson, and with licensing deals for shows featuring the music of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. This year, the company estimates nearly 15 million people will see one of its 21 shows, and it will take in more than $1 billion. More from Leading Women: The chess prodigy who beat men at their own game . To audiences, a Cirque du Soleil show looks entirely fanciful, but there are serious logistics behind all that fantasy. Before joining the company in 2004 as artistic director -- which she says was like jumping on a fast moving train -- Monson choreographed the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2001 IAAF Athletics World Championships. It involved directing more than 1,000 people on a field for a year, working with a multitude of people from different cultural backgrounds and artistic disciplines within set corporate protocols. She says it was good preparation for her current role. ""You're constantly balancing logistics with creative inspiration,"" she said. ""What do you want this piece to say? What is the message? But at the same time you cannot forget the logistical nightmare that you have to deal with. No amount of inspiration or creative genius will make that presentable."" Besides fulfilling some 500 artistic and acrobatic roles for existing Cirque du Soleil shows, Monson is also constantly on the prowl for new acts. ""Just when you think you've discovered every discipline in the world, someone refers someone new and you can't categorize them ..."" said Monson. ""We actually like those moments because we know we're hopefully discovering something new. Cirque journeys through 'World of Cinema' ""We (were) just referred a mermaid the other day,"" she adds. ""A professional mermaid -- she's absolutely stunning ... "" Once new talent has been identified, signing them up can be a delicate matter. Dancers and actors often have agency representation while some sportspeople can't be approached until they have been released from competitive careers by their government. She also observes a particular protocol when approaching performers from longstanding circus families. ""There's a certain ethic and a respect on our part -- maybe we will not approach the artist, maybe we will approach the grandfather or the father or the mother and tell them -- ask them -- 'Where is this artist in his or her career?' ""Because some of these circus families, they depend on each other. (A) flyer needs a catcher; catcher needs a flyer."" Even after an elite performer has joined the company, there are still more challenges to overcome, in order to integrate them into Cirque du Soleil's idiosyncratic, colorful mode of expression. ""They're seasoned pros in what they do, and we want that high level,"" Monson said. ""But we also want them to do dances in the background dressed in weird costumes. ""Even if you're talking about an Olympic diver, artistic excellence is usually not something in their vocabulary."" Part of Monson's job, she says, is coaxing elite athletes to take artistic risks, ""while assuring them that being foolish sometimes, or outside of your comfort zone, is noble."" See also: Gold medal sprinter teaches girls winning habits . Monson's own path to Cirque du Soleil came about while she was spending a year in Quebec studying French. A friend introduced her to one of the company's first touring shows, ""Saltimbanco,"" in 1992. ""He said, 'You have to see what's going on in the Montreal pier,' and I saw the show and was inspired. You weren't told where to look and who to look at -- the lights didn't always direct you -- and so the freedom, as a spectator, was huge. You could really sit back and allow yourself to interpret."" Twelve years later, when Monson was working in Los Angeles, she was invited to interview for the role of artistic director: ""It was a very non-traditional job interview,"" she said. ""The woman was asking me about what makes me passionate, and what makes my heart turn blue, and what makes my blood turn yellow. ""I thought it was a bit of a waste of time, frankly, but it's not just about being on stage; it's about being in the Cirque du Soleil family."" Monson's husband is Cirque du Soleil band leader Paul Shihadeh -- they met in a green room -- and she says their two sons have a ""crazy life"" due to the scheduling challenges of their work. But that's better than a banal life -- the thing, she says, she fears above all. ""My biggest fear is ... I don't want to be normal. I'm scared of prescribing to what I'm supposed to be or supposed to be doing. I think that's a big challenge for me, as a woman: I'm a mother, we have children, they have friends, we have a community and we want to be part of it. ""But what makes my adrenaline go is to really embrace the world around us that isn't necessarily normal.""

"(CNN) -- A jury on Monday convicted former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick of most of the federal charges against him -- including racketeering conspiracy, extortion and the filing of false tax returns -- in a case that accused him of using the mayor's office to enrich himself and associates, CNN affiliate WDIV-TV reported. Contractor Bobby Ferguson also was found guilty Monday of racketeering and extortion. Kilpatrick's father, Bernard Kilpatrick, was found guilty of a single tax count, and not guilty on two others charges, according to WDIV. Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson were sent to a federal detention facility by U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds hours after both were convicted in their corruption trial, CNN affiliates WDIV and WXYZ reported. ""While he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, he watched the quality of life erode for the people of Detroit,"" Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said. ""The mayor was not focused on running the city. He was focused on using the mayor's office as a money-making machine."" Kilpatrick, the Detroit mayor from 2002 until he resigned in 2008, was the biggest target of a years-long Detroit City Hall corruption probe that led to the convictions of two dozen people, including several of his closest friends and former City Councilwoman Monica Conyers, the wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers. Ex-Detroit mayor got free trips from pension fund broker, feds say . The former mayor was found guilty on 24 of 30 counts in federal court in Detroit. He could face up to 20 years in prison; sentencing did not take place Monday morning. Federal prosecutors alleged Kilpatrick ran a criminal enterprise through the mayor's office to enrich himself through bid rigging and extortion, and using nonprofit funds for personal gain. When reporters asked Kilpatrick for a reaction to the verdict as he left the courthouse, he said, ""Not at this time."" Prosecutors said the defendants were ""working together to abuse Kilpatrick's public offices, both his position as a state representative as well as his position of mayor of Detroit, to unjustly enrich themselves through a pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud."" At the heart of the scheme was corruption in municipal contracting, mostly centering on the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, said Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Derrick Miller, a former Kilpatrick aide, entered into a plea agreement last year and is expected to testify against his former associates. In September 2008, the ex-mayor pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case.","NEW: Judge orders Kwame Kilpatrick and Ferguson to detention facility until sentencing .

"(CNN) -- It was a year ago this month that British singer Amy Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning at 27. The ""Back to Black"" singer had a very close relationship with her father, Mitch, and he recently released a book, ""Amy, My Daughter."" It is a bracingly honest account of Amy's problems with heroin, alcohol and men. But it's not all gloomy. The book is also an intimate and tender account of his daughter, who he says was cheeky, funny and a good, but troubled, soul. The elder Winehouse, a London taxi driver and sometime jazz singer, recently spoke to CNN about his only daughter. CNN: Why did you write this book? Mitch Winehouse: First of all, I felt that the book would help me with my recovery, and then there were lots of misconceptions about Amy after she passed away, so I wanted to set the record straight. I wanted people to see who the real Amy was, what a lovely girl she was. Also we have set up a foundation in the U.S and the UK, and we needed the money. A great way of raising money was to write a book. All the author proceeds go to the foundation. CNN: It must have been very difficult for you to write. Winehouse: Writing the book wasn't too difficult actually. I was kind of in the zone, but when I had to read it back for the edits, that was really tough. That was more difficult than writing the book. CNN: What do you want people to know about Amy? Winehouse: Certainly what a great wit she had, how funny she was, how generous she was. People still think she died of an overdose or that she committed suicide. I want people to know she had quit drugs for three years, that's important to me. CNN: You really get a sense from reading your book how hard it is to deal with loved ones struggling with addiction. Winehouse: I pretended to have heart attacks just to shock her, nothing worked until she was ready to quit. When she was ready, she told me and she quit in December 2008. She was clean from drugs for nearly three years. CNN: In the end, it was the alcohol that got her. Winehouse: Often one addiction can follow another. She was dealing with that. The last six weeks of her life she was abstinent. That's even more difficult to deal with. That's a typical pattern of someone moving toward total abstinence. She was on the course for full recovery. Alcohol will get you quicker than heroin. People think because it's socially acceptable, it's safe. What it does to people is just incredible. CNN: They say time heals all wounds, but I don't think that's true when you lose a child. Winehouse: It's pretty much like being a drug addict. You take every day as it comes. You're in recovery. You're never fully recovered. After a reasonable amount of time, you're able to function like everybody else, but of course you'll never fully recover from something like that. It's impossible. CNN: Does it make you sad that she only released two albums? Winehouse: I'm really not that displeased she didn't write any more albums. It might sound a ridiculous thing to say. The last album particularly took a lot out of her emotionally, every song was autobiographical, dragged from her soul, and I wouldn't want her to have made more albums like that because she would have been in constant turmoil. I'm pleased that she didn't write more albums like that actually. CNN: She had a tattoo that read ""Daddy's Little Girl."" Winehouse: We had a great relationship. She had a great relationship with her mum and my wife and her brother and all her uncles and aunts. She was just a wonderful family girl. We miss her greatly. I want people to understand that she was just a normal girl who had an extraordinary talent.","Amy Winehouse's father, Mitch, has written a book about her .

"(CNN) -- I see your million-man march and raise you another million. That's the game the Muslim Brotherhood and opposition parties were playing in Egypt this week. After President Mohammed Morsy granted himself sweeping new temporary emergency powers, his opponents vowed to send a million protestors to the streets yesterday. Morsy's supporters responded by announcing their own equally massive gathering. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, and a deal was struck between Morsy and Egypt's judges, who had threatened a countrywide strike. But too often, the ""winner-takes-all"" Mubarak model persists in Egyptian politics. Instead of engaging or working within the system, and compromising, opposition forces protest in Tahrir Square or boycott. While these tactics won a revolution, they will not build a democracy. Morsy's government won worldwide acclaim last week when it achieved two enormously impressive victories (albeit with no input from the so-called secular liberal parties): a ceasefire in Gaza and a commitment of $4.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund, with billions from the European Union to follow. News: Fresh clashes in Cairo over Morsy decree . But a day later, claiming that the work product of the country's 100-member Constitutional Assembly could be jeopardized, Morsy suspended the ability of the independent court system to review or block the draft constitution, which is due to be released in less than two weeks. A plebiscite is to follow in 60 days and then an election of the new parliament (the old one was declared invalid by the now-neutered court system). What to make of all this? It's the politics, stupid, or the absence of capacity on both sides to entertain opposing views and forge compromise. (Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" may be the most relevant and compelling how-to guide this season.) Last week, during my third trip to Egypt this year, I suggested to the secretary general and a leading member of the Constitutional Assembly that they reach out to a group, nominally led by former Arab League director and former presidential candidate Amr Moussa, who is now boycotting the process. I made the same suggestion to top aides to Morsy. They are suspicious that Moussa has political motives. But, hey, of course he does! As do they. Opinion: Don't blame Muslim Brotherhood for Morsy power grab . To be legitimate, Egypt's new constitution will need to respect the separation of powers (including an independent judiciary) and accommodate political differences in a document that passes the international smell test. It cannot move women back to the Stone Age, and it must embrace pluralism and tolerance for all religions. On the other side, liberals and human rights advocates want to play odds that this government will overreach and fail. Well, it might. But that's no guarantee they'll come next, especially if they don't bring good political skills with them. And their outside game shortchanges the Egyptian people, whose need for food, jobs, fairness and respect are now. News: Morsy's decrees could be lifted in as little as two weeks . The secular liberals need to get in the game, not just into Tahrir Square. If they do, they can insist on amendments to the constitutional draft that will incorporate their own vision for the future of Egypt. More million-man (and woman) marches aren't enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Harman.","Jane Harman: Egypt's opposition, governing party planned dueling million-man marches .

"(CNN) -- In Tunisia, an Islamic party wins the election. In Libya, statements about adopting Sharia, or Islamic law, raise concerns about the future. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood strategizes about how best to score political gains. In the West, real fears arise that the Arab Spring will spawn new states more akin to the principles of al Qaeda and Hamas than fledgling democracies. Political Islam is sure to be a factor as major change sweeps through formerly despotic nations. But exactly how is a question that is up for intense debate. The idea of political Islam raises eyebrows among secularists, women, minority religions who fear their ways of life will come under serious threat if Islamic parties enforce their will. But some caution against looking at Islam's role too simplistically -- it is, after all, deeply rooted in the region. ""Political Islam is basically Western alarmism,"" said Ebrahim Moosa, professor of religion at Duke University. ""It's lazy analysis to dredge up images of a Khomeini-like prospect for any country,"" he said referring to the Iranian revolutionary leader. So when Libya's National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil announces that any law contradicting Islamic principles of Sharia are ineffective, it doesn't mean that Libyans will have hands cut off for stealing or women will be forced to cover up head to toe, Moosa said. What Jalil's comments will mean in practice has yet to be determined, said British writer Patrick Seale in Middle East Online. ""It needs to be stressed that each country's experience will be different."" Libya's ambassador to the United States, Ali Suleiman Aujali, said Sharia is not necessarily against democracy and equality. And Jalil quickly reassured the international community that Libyans are moderate Muslims. Moosa said it's almost impossible to be a leader of a Muslim nation without paying obeisance to Sharia. Saddam Hussein did it in Iraq; Hosni Mubarak did it in Egypt. ""It's like the president of the United States saying, 'God bless America,' "" Moosa said. ""It's your credibility marker that you are a believer, a way to show religious credentials."" In Tunisia, Rashid Ghannouchi, the founder of the winning Ennahda party, is known to be a philosophical thinker drawn to the Turkish model of governance and faith -- an officially secular country ruled by an Islamist party. Turkey's constitution limits the public exhibition of religion. Moosa sees Turkey as a nation that has internalized Islamic ethics. And Tunisia, he said, could do the same, where Islam could play a public role but with filters. Moosa, who said he knows Ghannouchi fairly well, said the Ennahda leader was alarmed when Khomeini issued a death fatwa against author Salman Rushdie after the publication of ""The Satanic Verses"" -- a novel written by Rushdie that has been decried as blasphemy by some Islamic fundamentalists. Ennahda is not looking to impose Sharia as it has traditionally been imposed wrote Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Trudy Rubin. The party's leadership contends Sharia is a set of principles open to interpretation, wrote Rubin. Rubin recently met with Ghannounchi and Hamadi Jebali, Ennahda's secretary general, and wrote that both men see Sharia as a ""body of immutable demands."" ""We know there are some Muslims who do not believe in democracy or freedoms in society,"" Jebali told her. ""We consider this a wrong interpretation. For us, the authority in Islam is given to the people, and even the legislative power should come from the people."" The key is for Western nations to exercise patience, said Akbar Ahmed, a professor of Islamic studies at American University. ""Certain parties may have a tendency toward Islam. They may succeed or they may not,"" he said. ""But we have to give them a chance."" Ahmed said democracy is a Western ideal that is foreign to many Muslim nations. It took the United States centuries to perfect its own brand of democracy. Why then, should Washington expect Tunisia, Libya or Egypt to achieve perfection overnight, Ahmed asked. Part of the problem, he said, is that after three decades of hostage taking, terror threats and attacks by Islamic groups, Western nations now associate Islam with unsavory actions and the word Islamic has taken on a negative connotation. ""It is important to understand that most Muslims in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya want justice,"" Ahmed said. ""They want compassion. They want incorruptibility, honesty from their rulers. All of them quote Islamic precedence for these features. In the ideal, Islam promises that these rulers must have these virtues."" Moosa said he would not be surprised if some time down the line, discordant voices rise up in Tunisia to advocate for what they view as genuine Sharia. ""One hopes saner voices will slap them down,"" he said. But it's that debate that will make the Arab world's post-dictatorship nations a real test for whether Sharia can ever be reconciled with democracy. Islamic law, said Moosa, can be interpreted as a need for providing for the poor, stable governance and implementing a rule of law that is in the best interests of the people. ""What does Sharia mean?"" he said. ""There has not been an honest conversation on what it can be."" The answers will help define how the people of the Arab Spring try to rebuild their nations.","Political Islam is sure to be a factor as change sweeps through Arab nations .
But can Islamic law be reconciled with democracy?
Tunisia's leadership may look to Turkey as a model .
Libyans reassure the West they are moderate Muslims ."
"(CNN) -- Ariel Castro, the Ohio man accused of holding three women captive for about a decade, is competent to stand trial, a judge said at a hearing Wednesday. Judge Michael Russo said a competency evaluation showed with ""reasonable medical certainty"" that Castro, 52, is capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting counsel. The next pretrial hearing is July 24, and jury selection is tentatively scheduled to begin August 5. How the kidnappings unfolded . ""So consistent with the statute where there is presumption of competency and consistent with the report done by our experts which the court is accepting as evidence for purposes of this hearing, the court finds Mr. Castro is competent to proceed in this matter, to assist council and to stand trial,"" the judge said. Neither the defense nor the state presented witnesses at the hearing and both agreed that Castro is competent to stand trial. Trial date set for Castro, more charges possible . Castro, clad in an orange prison suit, sat in the court during the hearing, his head lowered and eyes sometimes closed. He answered questions directly, telling the judge he understood the proceedings. The suspect was evaluated by two psychiatrists. The competency report is sealed, so it won't be publicly available. The issue of visitation came up. The judge said he would not allow Castro to have contact with his 6-year-old daughter, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Her mother is Amanda Berry, who was one of the three captives. Castro also has adult children. Prosecutors confirmed in court they intend to seek a superseding indictment, meaning they will present the case again to the grand jury from scratch. It is unclear whether that will affect the August trial date. Castro is accused of holding the women in his Cleveland home. He faces 329 counts, including one count of aggravated murder for allegedly causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. DNA studied for more possible victims .

"(CNN) -- When the judge's gavel fell, the future had been decided for the two teenagers convicted of rape in Steubenville, Ohio. Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, will spend at least a year in a juvenile correctional facility, although authorities could decide to keep them in custody until they turn 21. Both must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders. For the 16-year-old victim, the next steps aren't so clear. She was raped last summer at a party; witnesses posted images of the assault on social media. The case has garnered national attention and sparked a conversation about rape in America. ""My family and I are hopeful that we can put this horrible ordeal behind us,"" the victim's mother said Monday. ""We need and deserve to focus on our daughter's future."" Every two minutes, someone in the United States is sexually assaulted, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. Every survivor responds differently to rape, says Jennifer Marsh, vice president of victim services for RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual-violence organization. Emotions run the gamut from fear to anger to guilt. ""It's such a violent and personal crime,"" Marsh said. ""It's not somebody just breaking into your house. It's somebody assaulting the most private part of you. Having that be public, especially as a minor, can be traumatic."" Victims of sexual assault are three times more likely to suffer from depression and six times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to RAINN. Some try to self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. Many have trouble with intimacy and forming trusting relationships. One of the most common issues survivors face is blaming themselves for the assault, Marsh says. A lot of that has to do with our culture: Marsh says she sees rape cases like the one in Steubenville every day that aren't taken seriously. ""A lot of times, it gets chalked up to, 'Oh, kids will drink, and things will happen,' "" she said. ""But ... sexual assault is sexual assault. And it doesn't matter if the victim was drinking or using substances. The fact is that something was done to her that she didn't want to be done. And I think that's the conversation we really need to talk about."" The victim in the Steubenville case has endured hostility from the attackers' supporters. Although mainstream media have kept her name private, it's obvious she's well-known in the small Ohio community. Defense attorneys questioned the victim's character on the stand, asking witnesses about her alcohol consumption that night and what she told them the next morning regarding the assault. They also attempted to bring the victim's past into the trial, but the judge did not allow the line of questioning. The character attacks weren't over after the verdict was read. Shortly after the trial concluded, two teenage girls were accused of making threats against the victim on Twitter, according to Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. One of the girls was charged Tuesday with one misdemeanor count of aggravated menacing for threatening the victim's life. This kind of personal persecution is a big fear for victims, says Becka Meier, a licensed professional counselor with the Women's Center, a large nonprofit crisis center in Fort Worth, Texas. More than half of sexual assaults are not reported to the police; experts estimate that 97% of rapists don't spend a day in jail. ""When we have a high-profile case that gets reported and we see the victim be re-victimized ... it makes it all the more difficult for victims to come forward,"" Meier said. ""Survivors are faced with that difficult decision: Am I ready and willing to be in a courtroom and face this and talk through all the details again in such a public forum? It's a lot to ask."" Meier says a guilty verdict often offers survivors a sense of validation -- that someone, at least, believes them. ""Does it provide closure for a victim? I've never seen it provide closure,"" she said. ""It's just a step in the healing process."" That process never ends, Meier says. Photos of an attack that are posted online can make it even more difficult, acting as triggers to bring back painful memories each time they resurface. ""As hard as they try to delete or erase those images, five, 10, 15 years down the road, they'll be notified that it's popped up again and in some ways they feel like they're reliving that assault,"" Marsh agreed. How a victim's support network responds can have a big impact on the long-term recovery for that survivor. ""The first thing that loved ones should do is believe what the victim has said,"" Marsh said. ""Although we know it's natural to try to figure out exactly how this happened, we encourage loved ones to avoid using 'why' questions, because victims often perceive that as blaming them for what happened."" Family and friends should also recognize that each victim needs to recover at his or her own pace, she says. They should provide love and support without forcing them to do something that they're not prepared to do yet. Survivors can contact RAINN through their National Sexual Assault Hotline or go to online.rainn.org. Many local crisis centers offer individual/family counseling services and support groups. Rape isn't something survivors get over, Marsh says. But counseling and a solid support system will help them move on. ""Although they may never be able to forget that this happened, it doesn't have to define who they are or the choices that they make.""

"Washington (CNN) -- All in-bound cargo on commercial flights from Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- and quite possibly other areas of the world -- is being screened twice, as a result of the recent terror threats that have closed U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, according to a cargo industry official. The Department of Homeland Security late last week ordered airlines to increase the inspection of cargo at the last point of departure for the United States, said Brandon Fried, the executive director of Airforwarders Association, a trade group. ""They said, 'until further notice, this is what you're going to do,'"" Fried said. ""Nothing unscreened gets on the plane,"" Fried said. ""Basically they said, 'If you used one method, or several methods (of inspecting cargo), you need to do it again.' It's redundant, dual screening."" TSA expanding program to speed security lines . ""So now the freight is doubly secure,"" he said. The U.S. beefed up screening after discovering two toner cartridges packed with plastic explosives on board two aircraft bound for the U.S. in October 2010. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility for the plot. AQAP is involved in the communications leading to the most recent warnings that have closed U.S. facilities, U.S. officials say. Department of Homeland Security officials have declined to say what, if any, security measures have been taken as the result of the recent worldwide terror alert. Travelers must 'say something' In a statement released to the media, a DHS official said: ""As always, our security posture, which at all times includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, will continue to respond appropriately to protect the American people from an ever evolving threat picture."" Privately, officials say that even in the absence of specific intelligence, it is prudent to increase security in the United States, especially given AQAP's past deeds. Fried said the increased screening has resulted in some backlogs and delays, especially as some airlines have sought to clarify the rules. ""We're in August, so it's not the busiest time of year,"" he said. ""Our membership has reported sporadic delays."" The impact would have been more severe had the change occurred during busier shipping seasons, he said.

"(CNN) -- The holder of one of three winning tickets in a record $656 million Mega Millions drawing has come forward to claim a share, Maryland Lottery officials said Monday. They scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning, at which ""no winners will be present,"" said Carole Everett, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Lottery. When asked whether there was more than one winner, she responded: ""Perhaps."" No other details were immediately available. Maryland was one of three states where three tickets matched the winning numbers -- 2, 4, 23, 38 and 46, with a Mega Ball of 23 -- amounting to an equal share of roughly $218.6 million, before taxes, under the annuity option. The other winning tickets were purchased in Kansas and Illinois. The Kansas winner, who was the first to officially come forward last week, chose to remain anonymous -- as will the holder of the ticket sold in Maryland, said Everett. Last week, Maryland Lottery officials were responding to a flurry of questions from the media after a Baltimore-area woman told the New York Post that she had one of the winning tickets. However, in a bizarre twist of the story, Mirlande Wilson, a 37-year-old single mother of seven who works at McDonald's, told the Post she wasn't sure where she last had the ticket. ""I'm still looking for it. I haven't even looked in my uniform pants yet,"" the Post quoted Wilson as saying. ""I'm still looking everywhere to find it, in my purse, everywhere."" The state's lottery director said last Thursday he hadn't seen the ticket, but he also said then that no one else had come forward. Spokeswoman Everett said last Tuesday she didn't ""put much stock in that story."" ""She claims she won,"" Everett said last week. ""She can't produce a ticket. ... In our opinion, until they walk in that door, hold that ticket, produce valid identification and our security people can process and validate it, it doesn't matter."" Everett declined to comment Monday on whether the winning ticker holder was, in fact, Wilson.

"(CNN) -- ""Everything happens for a reason,"" the saying goes. But when the little old lady who cuts in front of you in the lottery line wins the biggest Powerball jackpot ever, what good reason can be behind that? Mindy Crandell has an answer because that's what happened to her. The 34-year-old mother found out Wednesday that the old woman who stepped in front of her in the lottery line at the Zephyrhills, Florida, Publix supermarket last month bought the winning ticket for the $590 million jackpot. The jackpot winner, 84-year-old Gloria Mackenzie, thanked Crandell in a statement read by a Florida lottery official Wednesday. ""While in line at Publix, another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning quick-pick ticket,"" Mackenzie said. In fact, when Mackenzie got to the front of the line, the ticket clerk offered Crandell her spot back, according to a report from ABC News. But Crandell refused the offer. Mackenzie bought one computer-generated ticket that had the winning numbers: 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52 with a Powerball of 11. Mackenzie passed up a payout spread over 30 years for a somewhat smaller one-time lump sum, pocketing $370.9 million before taxes, lottery officials said. Friends later chided Crandell that she probably let the Powerball winner buy a ticket that should have been hers, ABC reported. Why you keep playing the lottery . ""The joke was, that's the lady that's going to win it. I was like, 'Yeah right. No one is going to win from little Zephyrhills,'"" Crandell, of nearby Dade City, is quoted as saying. So what one good reason beats out 590 million other ones? Crandell's 10-year-old daughter Mallory, who was in line with her mom at the Publix, found it. ""Sometimes it's better to be patient than rich,"" Crandell said Mallory told her. There's also a lesson for lottery players here. If the line jockeying changed the time when the clerk would have hit the button to buy the ticket even by a split second, the numbers would have come up differently. ""Each lottery terminal has its own random number generator, and there are a lot of factors,"" the Times quoted Florida Lottery spokesman David Bishop as saying. ""If there was even a millisecond difference in the time between key strokes at the terminal, it would have changed the numbers."" So when the next big payout comes up and you're in a long line for a ticket, think about that. And maybe let someone have your place in line. Or not.","$590 million Powerball winner thanks person who let her cut in line .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Canadian teenager who committed suicide after she was allegedly gang-raped and bullied says it opposes any kind of ""vigilante justice"" to avenge the attack. This comes after the activist group Anonymous said it might release the names of teens it says raped the girl in an effort to force authorities to pursue prosecution. An earlier police investigation ended without criminal charges. Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year-old high school student from Halifax, Nova Scotia, was taken off life support Sunday, three days after she tried to hang herself. ""Better act fast,"" Anonymous warned Canadian law enforcement in a statement. ""Take immediate legal action against the individuals in questions."" ""The names of the rapists will be kept until it is apparent you have no intention of providing justice,"" the group said. Jason Barnes, partner of Rehtaeh's mother, Leah Parsons, said Thursday that the family does not ""support the publishing of the names"" in the case -- which has shocked Canada. ""We are not looking for some kind of vigilante justice. We just want justice."" Her family told CNN they met with Canadian justice officials Wednesday and urged them to reconsider filing charges. The officials assured them they would take a fresh look after a police investigation ended without criminal charges. How to help young rape victims . A girl in torment . Rehtaeh was bullied for more than a year after the alleged sexual assault, which happened in November 2011 when she was 15, her family said. Authorities confirmed that a photograph allegedly showing Rehtaeh having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers. As a result, her family said, she developed suicidal thoughts. She also struggled emotionally after the police investigation, her mother wrote on her Facebook tribute page. ""Rehtaeh is gone today because of the four boys that thought that raping a 15-year-old girl was OK and to distribute a photo to ruin her spirit and reputation would be fun,"" her mother wrote. ""All the bullying and messaging and harassment that never let up are also to blame. Lastly, the justice system failed her. Those are the people that took the life of my beautiful girl."" Disseminating such a picture -- even if the sexual encounter was consensual -- is considered child pornography under Canadian law. However, a joint investigation by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and local authorities found ""insufficient evidence to proceed with charges,"" RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae said. ""There are factors in determining other than the picture itself; ages, who sent the material, computers, so it's complex,"" he said. ""We do understand people want the answers, and the big question here is why was it done or why weren't there charges, and we understand that. We're not trying to deflect blame or not be accountable."" Healing process after rape never ends . Anonymous slams law enforcement . The Halifax case is similar to the recent case in Steubenville, Ohio, in which two boys were convicted of rape. In that case, lurid text messages, cell phone pictures and videos, and social media posts surrounding the sexual abuse of a girl emerged at the Ohio trial. It attracted the attention of bloggers and Anonymous, a loosely organized hacking activist group. As far as the Canadian incident goes, Anonymous told Nova Scotia Justice Minister Ross Landry that ""justice is in your hands and supports the legal machinery to move forward with charges. ""We do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims. That would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob. What we want is justice. And that's your job. So do it,"" the group said. The group said it took only a few hours to identify the boys who assaulted Rehtaeh. ""This wasn't some high-tech operation that involved extracting private messages from someone's Facebook account. Dozens of e-mails were sent to us by kids and adults alike, most of whom had personal relationships with the rapists. Many recalled confessions made by these boys blatantly in public where they detailed the rape of an inebriated 15-year-old girl,"" the group said. The group said that declarations from police and prosecutors that there wasn't enough evidence for an arrest ""should be viewed solely as an admission of incompetence on their part."" ""These sad little boys had no fear whatsoever about admitting publicly their crimes and even spreading photographic evidence of it. Why were they unafraid? They believed no one was ever going to do anything to stop them and they were right,"" the group said.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- You're sitting in a hip Tokyo cafe, having a fish cake and sake. Your server has been especially attentive, so when the check arrives, you think nothing of pulling out some extra yen and leaving a healthy 20 percent tip. But suddenly things go horribly wrong: the server turns wide-eyed, becomes agitated, and walks away. What happened?! You'll likely come across more people at a hotel that need to be tipped than anywhere else as you travel. Tipping in Japan and many other Asian countries is simply not a way of life. In fact, it's usually regarded as a vulgar display of wealth and a disregard for the culture. The same can be true in Europe and Latin America ... though not always. And in the United States, of course, tipping is expected (and sometimes demanded). With expectations all over the map, it's not surprising that anxiety and confusion about whom to tip -- and how much -- are commonplace for travelers. So we've done the legwork for you, talking with concierges, tourist boards, and other travelers to find out the real protocol on when (and when not) to reach into your wallet and how much of a tip you should give to waiters, sky caps, maids, doormen, and cabbies all over the world. Of course, tipping is confusing enough for Americans traveling domestically. The expectation is to tip not only big but also often, from the kid handing you a Venti coffee at Starbucks to the multiple hotel hands that rush to open doors, carry bags, and offer an escort to the hotel room. Go abroad and the situation changes. The legion of skycaps, cab drivers, bellboys, and waiters may perform the same services as their U.S. counterparts, but they often have radically different expectations of a tip. You can credit different customs, as well as a service industry with a different wage scale. In the United States, tips usually abet low wages. In other parts of the world, service employees are often paid a living wage. If you're taking a taxi in Chile or New Zealand, for example, the driver won't give you the evil eye if you don't tip -- it's not expected. Read Travel + Leisure's guide to tipping around the world . At a hotel, you'll encounter more people who potentially need to be tipped than anywhere else during your travels. In fact, there are so many people it can become confusing. If a doorman opens the door of your cab, another takes your bag, and a third delivers it to your room, who gets the tip? It should be the last person in the chain -- the one who actually brings the bags to your room. And at checkout, only tip the one who loads your bags onto a cart and takes them out of the room. Restaurants can be tricky, too: keep an eye out for the service charge. In many European countries, this charge averages 10 percent, but it's usually included in the price of a meal. If it is, then do as the European do, and leave a few extra coins or round up the bill -- in cash, even if you've paid for the meal with a credit card. And if you're heading to Fiji, Malaysia, or South Korea, be aware that no tip is required in restaurants. Here are some other scenarios: . Spa Therapists: Tipping 15 or 20 percent is common practice in the United States but rare at any spa abroad, where a service charge is typically added to the cost of the treatment. Concierges: Situational. If a concierge gets you theater or train tickets, or has been especially helpful during the course of your stay, then a $10 or $20 tip (in local currency) is in order. Guides: Booking a ski guide to take you off-piste in Switzerland, a golf pro in Scotland, or a fishing guide in Ireland? All should be compensated in the 10 to 15 percent range, as they would be in the United States. A good tip on tipping? Get small bills or coins from your hotel's front desk to make tipping easier. But if you have only large bills, it's perfectly acceptable to ask a hotel porter or even a skycap for change when you give them a tip. After all, tips are a part of their business. They're not embarrassed, and you needn't be either. And if you don't have local currency, U.S. greenbacks can work just as well as a ""thank you"" in London, Lombok, or Lahore. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving wildfire raged across Southern California on Thursday, burning structures and forcing people from their homes. The fire, which was first reported Wednesday, quickly grew from 300 to 11,000 acres and is only 10% contained, the Riverside County Fire Department said. About 15 homes and outbuildings have been destroyed so far, said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Julie Hutchinson. ""It's a bit hotter today. Those winds are really pushing,"" Hutchinson told CNN Thursday. ""The communities that were impacted yesterday were hit very quickly, very early on in the fire. They barely had time to get out of there. Many of them had to shelter in place with the deputies that were out there to help evacuate them because the highway was cut off. ""Today we have got some orders and warnings for evacuation for some new communities closer to Palm Springs,"" Hutchinson said. Control of the fire could take ""probably a couple more days,"" Hutchinson said. ""It's heart-wrenching.

"(CNN) -- I know I'm supposed to be outraged by the Rolling Stone cover that depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a dreamy young man, with its implicit resonances with the famous Jim Morrison photo. When taken with the words that overlay it, the photo presents a mystery that we need to explore. So, I am not outraged. In fact, I am discouraged by the outrage itself. I feel obligated to begin by stating that I have no sympathy for a murderer of children, that I was horrified by such actions, and that I feel deeply for the Boston bombing's victims. I live in Boston and have written about the sense of solidarity Bostonians felt after the attack, and especially on the day we sat still so that suspects could be tracked and caught. I rooted for Tsarenaev's capture, and I hope the alleged killer spends a long time miserable in jail, after a fair trial, of course. But the very fact that we have to gain entry to the conversation by stating our bona fides like this disturbs me. Culture is based on shared values and beliefs. Having to state that you're against the killing and maiming of families and the loved ones they were cheering on creates a rift where there isn't one, as if this value were not a settled part of what binds our culture. Could we even come up with a stance that more quickly and surely means that you're not a part of the lives we share together? The Rolling Stone cover correctly assumes that there is no such rift. It assumes that of course we all hate what the Tsarnaev and his older brother, the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of doing (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings). The words on that cover state what many of us — the ""us"" that covers our culture — believe: He was a bomber. There isn't even an ""alleged"" there, and the premise of the article stated on the cover also denies that qualifier: ""How a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam and became a monster."" In case you were unclear about where Rolling Stone stands on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the words ""bomber"" and ""monster"" should make it clear. But you shouldn't be unclear. That's why we have a culture -- a shared set of values and beliefs. The words are not causing the outrage that the photo has engendered. But when taken with the words, the angelic photo makes exactly the point that needs to be made and that our Culture of Outrage obscures. When a terrorist was raised in a foreign land, and especially when to the mainstream the terrorist looks foreign and repellent — for example, the photo of an unkempt, grim Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that has become so iconic that it's even used at Wikipedia, a site that takes a ""neutral point of view"" as its mantra — we feel safe in simply assigning the person to a category. ""He's a terrorist,"" we say, as if that were a biological species that completely explains the person. Such categories shut down thought. They block understanding. Terrorist? 'Nuf said. But it's not enough. Understanding is important not only so that we can help prevent the sort of despicable Boston Marathon bombers and the KSMs of our fractured world, but also so we can see our human species — and thus ourselves — more clearly. The cover photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev taken with the stark words overlaying it speak to the mystery that was laid bare when the brothers were first identified. The media turned to his friends, interviewing young men and women who were profoundly shocked that someone they knew as helpful, warm, and open to diversity could be accused of so deeply betraying their values. I felt like I knew many of those friends, for they were so like our children and the children they know. That was the mystery that was presented to us when the Tsarnaevs were identified not only as murder suspects, but as a threat to the humane innocence that is the heart of American culture. We need that mystery explored. To counter our natural desire to think that those who attack us so vilely must be totally unlike us, we need not only the words denouncing them, but images that reminds us that they weren't born as what they became. This juxtaposition makes the mystery manifest: Someone like us became someone who hates us. We need to explore that mystery not so we can sympathize with a despicable accused murderer but so we understand better how he passed beyond sympathy. The cover of Rolling Stone -- words and picture -- puts that awful mystery right in front of us. But we seem to prefer the security of outrage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","David Weinberger says he's not outraged about the Rolling Stone cover .

"(CNN) -- Kudos to the FBI and its partners for bringing needed attention to the neglected problem of juveniles engaged in prostitution. On Monday, they announced the results of Operation Cross Country, a coordinated multi-agency campaign in which 150 alleged pimps were arrested in a three-day sweep in 76 cities. But it's a complex problem requiring a lot more than the arrest of pimps. To combat this scourge, the public, the media and policymakers must better understand it. The stereotype is that criminally sophisticated exploiters are luring young girls into their clutches, trafficking them across the country and holding them in captivity through brutal intimidation. Such cases are only part of the reality. There are many teens on the streets and on the Internet selling sexual services on their own without the involvement of any pimp -- 31% of cases in a recent national law enforcement survey fell into this category. There are lots of boys in the trade, in addition to the girls, and most operate without pimps. Although this may not be typical of many cities, one recent massive effort to inventory the problem in New York City found nearly as many boys and girls. Even for the girls with pimps, abduction and intimidation are not always the story. Teens who are prostituted may be attracted and bound to the life for the money, the perceived glamor, out of love for their pimp or allegiance to other girls or for a sense of family and security. They do not necessarily feel ""rescued"" when the law descends, and they often have nowhere else to be. Some go back as soon as they can. We do need more law enforcement pressure on the pimps, on the sex sites and on the casinos, truck stops and motels where this crime occurs, and on the consumers who buy sex from underage youth. But other things are needed as well, programs that are not as compelling and easily funded as dramatic police raids. We need ways of helping gay and transgender youth who are cast out of their families and communities and youth dealing with sexual abuse and other sexual trauma that so often pave the way into commercial sex. It means more mental health and social workers equipped and funded to work with this population. We need better ways of identifying and treating youth with drug addictions, so they don't start selling sex to feed their habit. We need vocational opportunities for marginal youth, so they don't see the sex trade as their only avenue to economic survival. These would be similar to the job skills training programs used with other children mired in the juvenile justice system. We need more shelters for teens who have run away or have been driven out of their homes due to abuse or intolerable family conflict, so they are not hanging out in the places where exploitation begins. Such shelters could look like the transitional independent living facilities in cities such as New York. We need more effective child abuse and neglect intervention programs and therapeutic foster homes since the child welfare system is the staging area for entry into prostitution for so many of the youth. The availability of therapeutic foster homes and highly trained parents, surrounded by intensive services, are proven methods to deal with the high rate of failure among abused teens who are placed in families. We need support groups and rehabilitation programs for those trying to keep themselves from gravitating back to the life. Unfortunately, these are not always easy youth to help. They are often angry, suspicious, traumatized, addicted, impatient, crime-involved, prematurely sexualized young people who do not endear themselves to police and would-be helpers. They may visit a counselor, try to go back home, sign up for help but too often they return to the trade or become entangled in crime. Arrests make great publicity. But it is only through a multidisciplinary comprehensive mobilization of dedicated child welfare, social service, mental health, drug rehabilitation, educational systems -- working together with law enforcement -- that we will find a solution to young people being sold or selling sex for money and survival. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Finkelhor.","David Finkelhor: FBI, partners arrest 150 alleged pimps in child prostitution sweep .

"(Financial Times) -- China has ordered the recall of potentially contaminated milk imported from New Zealand after Fonterra, the world's largest dairy exporter, found in its products bacteria that can cause botulism. With nearly 90 per cent of China's imported milk coming from New Zealand and Fonterra by far the biggest single supplier, Beijing's response to the dairy scare is being closely watched. Tim Groser, New Zealand's trade minister, initially told state broadcaster Television New Zealand that China had banned imports of all milk powder, a move he deemed ""absolutely appropriate"". But later on Sunday a New Zealand official said the actual Chinese measures had been more limited. On its website, the Chinese quarantine authority said it had ordered close inspections of all dairy imports from New Zealand. It demanded that four companies recall products that might have been affected by contaminated milk, including Wahaha, China's biggest beverage producer. It also issued a warning to consumers over three batches of Nutricia infant formula made in New Zealand. New Zealand exports almost $9.5bn of dairy products a year, and nearly a fifth of that goes to China. Even without an outright ban, the image of New Zealand dairy in China is at risk. ""For a long time, New Zealand has marketed its products overseas as being '100 per cent pure,' and this has been especially true of its dairy products,"" said China's state-owned Xinhua news agency. ""However, Fonterra has had a series of problems and this is beginning to shake the confidence of some Chinese consumers in its '100 per cent pure' milk powder."" The quest for safe milk powder has become a top concern for new parents in China after a 2008 scandal in which domestic producers sold melamine-tainted infant formula, killing six babies and making thousands ill. Chinese demand for imported milk powder has soared since that scandal, and places from Hong Kong to the UK have imposed limits on the number of cans sold to individuals after customers loaded up on supplies to resell in China. Fonterra's growth strategy is focused on China, where it is seeking to expand its business with the launch of its Anmum brand infant milk formula later this year. Last year China accounted for 10 per cent of group revenues of almost NZ$20bn ($15.7bn). The latest scare began when Fonterra revealed on Saturday that three batches of a New Zealand-made whey protein had tested positive for clostridium, a bacteria that can cause botulism. The farmers co-operative said the whey concentrate, manufactured in May last year, may have been contaminated by a dirty pipe at a processing plant. Fonterra said the 38 tonnes of contaminated concentrate had been bought by eight customers for use in a number of products including infant formula, milk powder and sports drinks. It was then mixed with other ingredients to produce 870 tonnes of product sold in a number of markets including New Zealand, Australia, China and Saudi Arabia. Mr Groser said New Zealand authorities were working with the company ""to identify and trace all potentially affected products and then inform regulators around the world"". The head of Fonterra has flown to China for a round of meetings with officials. The botulism scare is the second contamination issue involving Fonterra this year. In January the company said it had found traces of a potentially toxic chemical used in fertiliser in some of its products. Fonterra said there had been no reports of any illness related to the whey protein. Gary Romano, head of Fonterra's New Zealand milk products division, said the company was confident all of the affected product had either been recalled, secured or did not pose a risk to health because the bacteria would have been killed in the manufacturing process. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Nearly 90% of China's imported milk comes from New Zealand .

Equally important, the industry is proactively applying lessons learned from Fukushima Daiichi and is making nuclear power, which provides 20% of America's electricity, even safer. The nuclear energy industry is working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the steps to be taken to enhance safety at America's reactors. To further strengthen the plants' ability to withstand extreme events, the commission will require U.S. facilities to install additional instruments to monitor the level of water in used reactor fuel storage pools and add protection from extreme natural events such as floods and earthquakes, no matter how infrequent they may be. Nuclear energy facilities already have multiple emergency generators, battery banks, backup offsite power supplies, extra pumps and other equipment. But companies that operate America's 104 commercial reactors have added or ordered nearly 400 major pieces of equipment to supplement layers of safety at these facilities. Under a commitment made by all U.S. operators, the companies will buy additional equipment, such as portable generators and pumps, which can be used to provide power and water to cool the reactors and used fuel pools under any extreme scenario. Additional backup equipment at America's reactors will add even more layers of protection to deepen the resources that operators can draw upon to ensure power can be delivered to critical safety systems no matter what causes an event. Our industry is committed to continuous learning: checking and rechecking every safety measure to make sure nuclear energy facilities are safe at all times. After global operational or natural events, it is our responsibility to ask again: How can we be even safer? The nuclear industry is, without hesitation, using what is being learned from Japan to improve safety. Within days of the Fukushima accident, the U.S. industry launched intensive inspections to evaluate the readiness of the operators and equipment to respond to events similar to what happened in Japan, including managing an extended loss of power for vital safety systems, and seismic and flooding challenges. Another view: Our reactors are still vulnerable a year after Fukushima . The inspections confirmed assessments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state-based task forces that nuclear energy facilities are safe and have identified key areas for near-term safety enhancements. Important operational and preparedness features at U.S. reactors, different from those in Japan, would have enabled them to maintain safety during earthquakes or extreme flooding. Nonetheless, the industry is forging ahead to make those enhancements. In a recent CNN.com opinion piece, an organization criticized these actions, saying industry is ""getting out ahead of the NRC"" by launching its own safety initiative. We would have it no other way. It's in our industry's DNA to learn safety lessons at any opportunity and apply them where warranted at our facilities. That is why our industry and its own watchdog organization -- the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations -- was held up as a model for safety when the president's commission on the Deepwater Horizon accident was looking at other industries for the oil industry to emulate. Public and worker safety is our industry's top priority. We constantly reevaluate our safety practices to see how they can be even stronger. We have embraced this challenge, and our industry is aggressively seeking out and applying the lessons from Fukushima to our operations. America needs nuclear energy as part of a portfolio of electricity options that will power our economy for generations. It is a vital source of affordable, carbon-free electricity today and for the future. To continue to reap its benefits and move toward American energy independence, we must and we will ensure that nuclear energy facilities operate safely.

"(CNN) -- Just how impatient have air travelers become and how important is it for airlines to don the mink glove and gently stroke the backs of their necks every time they start getting fidgety? For British Airways, apparently important enough to be the first European airline to relax restrictions on using cell phones and other electronic devices while planes are taxiing after landing. The airline has announced that starting July 1, passengers will be able to text, make phone calls, check emails and play with other electronic devices as soon as arriving aircraft land and taxi off the runway. For passengers in Europe, the move means no more having to wait until the aircraft arrives at the terminal before shrieking ""Yeah, I'm at the airport, we just landed!"" into their phones. As anyone who flies knows, many passengers ignore the rules on cell phone use after arrival and use their electronics anyway. But the new BA policy officially allows the practice. The policy will apply to BA flights around the world, not just the United Kingdom and Europe. ""Customers will no longer have the frustration of having to wait until their plane has arrived at the terminal building before being able to use their mobile phones and other hand held electronic devices,"" an empathetic airline spokesperson says. ""Now they'll have that extra time to phone ahead for that important business meeting, check their emails or make sure someone is there to meet them at the airport."" Still short of full phone privileges . The news will no doubt come as welcome relief to all those troublemakers who stand up and start rummaging through the overhead bin as soon as the wheels scrape tarmac. The new policy might represent a minor breakthrough in the ongoing ""Why can't I use my phone on the plane?"" global whinge-fest, but it still doesn't give passengers what they really want -- in-flight, in-your-face, full-on airborne phone privileges. Debate continues over electronic gadgets on planes. In the United States, using personal electronic devices below 10,000 feet is banned on most airlines. While many airlines now offer Wi-Fi access via portable electronic devices, cellular voice and data services on U.S. airlines fall under a federal government ban. There hasn't been any conclusive proof that devices such as phones and e-readers are a danger. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has said it doesn't know of any aviation accidents linked to interference from personal electronic devices, and it released a report this week saying it would consider easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices in flights. Its conclusions are due in September. In 2012, Virgin Atlantic became the first British airline to permit calls on some flights. In-flight phone service seems inevitable. After that, if the airlines could just figure out a way to come around and clear away our empty food trays less than an hour after we're done eating, we might be able to relax.","British Airways first European airline to allow phone usage after taxiing .

"(CNN) -- Felipa Fabon waits outside a local fried chicken restaurant in Manila. Crouching near to feral cats and rubbish bins, she isn't there to meet friends for dinner but to search through the diner's trash bags. ""I'm sorting the garbage, looking for 'pagpag',"" she says. In Tagalog ""pagpag"" means the dust you shake off your clothing or carpet, but in Fabon's poverty- stricken world, it means chicken pulled from the trash. Pagpag is the product of a hidden food system for the urban poor that exists on the leftovers of the city's middle class. Fabon is the merchant and pays the trash dealer just over a dollar for tonight's supply of garbage and scraps. In the dim haze of the street lights, she holds up a half-eaten chicken breast. ""This one, this is meat,"" she says. ""Now what we do at home is clean it, put it in plastic, and then I sell it in the morning. It's very easy to sell because it's very cheap. People in my neighborhood want very cheap food."" ""If it's mostly bones, it's 20 pesos ($0.50) per bag,"" she says. After bagging up the chicken scraps she heads home to Tondo, a neighborhood infamous in the Philippines as one of the poorest slums in Manila. At dawn, about six hours after Fabon first got her trash delivery, she begins to divide up the pagpag. Fabon sniffs the chicken, which she says has a bad, sour smell. She's disappointed that she only has five bags to sell this morning that will sell out in just minutes. ""Pagpag!"" Fabon calls out, as she walks through the slums carrying her small cart. Morena Sumanda, a 27-year-old mother of two, is the first customer. Sumanda lives in a shanty that sits on top of one of Manila's biggest garbage dumps. She doesn't have the 20 pesos to pay Fabon until her husband comes home that evening. For him, 20 pesos is full day's pay, says Sumanda. Sumanda's toddler son, Nino, wails as she first washes the chicken, heats the pot and adds vegetables to the pagpag, which is mostly bones. ""Sometimes it comes from the garbage,"" she says, as she hands a small, half-eaten chicken wing to her son. Sumanda, and others like her, have no other choice but to eat pagpag, says Melissa Alipalo, a social development specialist and a volunteer at the Philippine Community Fund (PCF). ""It is a private humiliation of the poor to have to eat off someone else's plate. But it's a survival mechanism for the poorest of the poor,"" she says. The NGO is based in Manila and has built an elementary school in the heart of the Tondo slums. PCF's school educates 450 of the most poverty-stricken children in Tondo, with the aim of freeing families from poverty. The school survives on donations and provides students with two meals a day. Maria Theresa Sarmiento, PCF's manager of health and nutrition, says that when the school first opened she was treating children with a range of illness and disease. ""Even though they cook the food, the disease is still there,"" she says. Sarmiento says that parents know pagpag is not a good source of food for their children, but that they don't have any choice. ""They're being pushed to do that thing because they don't have enough money to buy the food that they should prepare,"" she says. For Sumanda this is all that she can afford and it's better than nothing. ""By the mercy of God, this is enough,"" she says.","Many in Manila's slums survive on chicken scraps from trash bags .

"Boston (CNN) -- After deliberating for more than 20 hours over three days, jurors in the James ""Whitey"" Bulger trial wrapped up for the day Thursday afternoon and will be back at it for a fourth day on Friday. The eight-man, four-woman federal panel asked Thursday to see one of the pieces of evidence in the case -- a gun with an obliterated serial number. The last charge in the 32-count indictment accuses Bulger of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers. Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year ""reign of terror"" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. Outside the courtroom, Bulger's lead attorney, J.W. Carney, said he was ""very, very proud of the service these jurors have provided to us no matter what the outcome of the trial."" Carney added that it was difficult waiting for a verdict ""because we invested at this point two years of work to get this case ready for trial."" ""The longer the jury stays out the more it shows us they are as conscientious a jury as I have ever seen,"" Carney said. ""I know that the prosecutors also believe that, the judge believes that. We are very pleased at that."" The widow of one of Bulger's alleged murder victims said separately that she believed ""the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us."" Patricia Donahue, who has been at the trial almost every day with her three sons, added, ""We been putting our lives on hold since this trial started -- it's tough ... but it's almost over now."" Still, Donahue said, ""If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."" 'You're a coward!' widow yells at Bulger . On Wednesday, jurors submitted five questions for the judge. One of the questions involved the second count of the federal racketeering charge, with that lengthy count including numerous alleged acts and involvement in killings. Jurors wanted to know whether they needed to vote unanimously on the 33 ""predicate acts,"" including the 19 murders. U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper answered in the affirmative, although she advised jurors that if they were unable to reach a decision on a specific act, they can move on and decide the next act. For Bulger to be found guilty under that racketeering count, one of the major charges against him, jurors must agree that prosecutors proved he committed at least two of the acts within a 10-year period. During the seven-week trial, jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters, bookies, extortion victims, a disgraced FBI supervisor, ex-drug dealers, retired FBI agents and relatives of people Bulger is accused of killing. Prosecutors called 63 witnesses. The defense called 10. Former hit man John Martorano testified for both sides, for a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days. Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify. Questioned by Judge Casper, Bulger called his decision a ""choice made involuntarily."" Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, disappearing after a crooked FBI agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- A gay couple challenging Proposition 8 in federal court Monday said civil unions and domestic partnerships aren't the same as marriages, something they view as a stepping stone toward starting a family. ""[It's] like putting a Twinkie at the end of a treadmill and saying, 'You can only have a bite,' "" testified Paul Katami, one of the plaintiffs. ""And you want the whole thing. ... All I want is to be married."" Katami and his partner, Jeffrey Zarrillo, are among plaintiffs asking Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to issue an injunction against the enforcement of California's Proposition 8, arguing the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. If allowed to marry his partner, 36-year-old Zarrillo said he would finally feel equal and complete. ""I'd be able to stand there as one family, as a married individual,"" Zarrillo said, noting the ""pride that one feels when that happens."" During testimony, attorney David Boies asked Zarrillo why he believed marriage was a better option for same-sex couples when compared with domestic partnerships and other arrangements states have for same-sex couples. ""Domestic partnership would relegate me to second-class citizenship, maybe third-class -- and that's not enough,"" he said. Zarrillo and Katami of Los Angeles, California, are joined by Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier of Berkeley, California, in the court challenge. Zarrillo said he believes it's an important step to be married before having children, saying it would make it easier for the couple and the child and would afford the child additional protections. Being married and wearing a wedding ring sends a message to society, he said. ""It says to them, these individuals are serious,"" Zarrillo said. ""They're committed to one another."" Another attorney for the couples, Theodore Olson, argued to the judge that a ban on Proposition 8 leaves gay couples out of something available to all other people in the United States. ""Marriage is central to life in America,"" Olson said. ""It promotes mental, physical and emotional self. It's the building block of family, neighborhoods and community in our society."" Proposition 8, Olson said, ended the dream of marriage for same-sex couples, which includes hundreds of thousands of Californians. The state, he said, ""has put people into categories."" ""You're different, and we're going to take away that right from you,"" Olson said, interpreting the meaning of the ban. ""... That's discrimination."" However, Charles Cooper, an attorney representing Protect Marriage, the group that came up with Proposition 8, told the judge in his opening statement the purpose of marriage is to promote procreation between men and women. Same-sex marriage ""will likely lead to very real social harm; it's too novel and experimental,"" he argued. Californians ""are entitled to make this critical decision for themselves,"" he said, pointing to voter support of the proposition. Except for the issue of marriage, gays and lesbians have been successful in attaining policy goals, Cooper said, adding that California has some of the most comprehensive protections in the nation. About 100 protesters against the measure and in favor of same-sex marriage gathered peacefully outside the courthouse before the hearing, waving signs supporting equal rights. The case will likely head to the U.S. Supreme Court no matter the outcome. It is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether Americans can marry people of the same sex. In legal circles and across the Internet, it has been dubbed this generation's Brown v. Board of Education, the case that led to the Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in schools. Some say it could be the biggest ruling since Roe v. Wade, which tackled abortion. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. CNN's Mallory Simon and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Gay man testifies partnerships, unions only give part of what everyone else gets .

"(CNN) -- The New Hampshire House majority leader lashed out Friday on his Facebook page at a Roman Catholic bishop, calling the  clergyman a ""pedophile pimp"" who ""has no moral credibility to lecture anyone."" The comments come in the wake of a rally Thursday where John McCormack, who is bishop of the Roman Catholic Manchester Diocese, criticized state budget cuts that he argued would hurt ""the most vulnerable in our society,"" according to a transcript of his remarks posted on the diocese's website. State Rep. D.J. Bettencourt responded with a Facebook post Friday morning that said, ""Would the Bishop like to discuss his history of protecting the 'vulnerable?' This man is a pedophile pimp who should have been led away from the State House in handcuffs with a rain coat over his head in disgrace. He has absolutely no moral credibility to lecture anyone."" Critics called on McCormack to resign as bishop in 2003 when the Diocese of Manchester settled more than 170 lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by priests in New Hampshire, though he stayed put. He was also a top official in the Archdiocese of Boston during its sex abuse scandal. Manchester Diocese spokesman Kevin Donovan said Bettencourt's comment was ""false, defamatory and detracts from the real issue."" ""Bishop McCormack's message to the people of New Hampshire yesterday was the simple message of the Gospels. The Church and our broader society have a fundamental obligation to care for the poor,"" Donovan said in a statement. ""The bishop's message is a challenge to ourselves and our elected officials to never waver in our obligation to care for the most vulnerable of society."" Bettencourt could not be reached for comment.

"Washington (CNN) -- You do not have to be an investor in the stock market or real estate or looking for a job to be alarmed when several highly regarded observers warn that the United States economy is about to be driven ""off the cliff"" by increasing debt, the expiration of tax cuts and the prospect of deep spending cuts. The alarm should concern anyone who cares about our democratic system. The reason we are getting awfully close to the edge is because the Democrats and Republicans are inclined to pull the steering wheel in opposite directions. Granted, alarms are often sounded, but as we shall see shortly, this time there are strong reasons to fear that our gridlocked political system will prevent us from responding before we go over the edge. The most authoritative voice speaking out this time is that of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He stated recently that, ""It is very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal authorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there is, I think, absolutely no chance that the Federal Reserve could or would have any ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy."" Mohamed El-Erian, the highly regarded CEO of the investment management firm Pimco, wrote recently in an article in The Washington Post headline ""The Fiscal Cliff Cometh"" that, ""In the next few months, possibly within weeks, markets here and abroad will be looking for signals that our politicians understand the severity of the situation and are able and willing to act appropriately. If clear signals are not forthcoming, markets could react early to the looming trouble, compounding the uncertainties that weigh on the U.S. economy."" The Economist changed the metaphor but not the point. Under the title ""cliff diving,"" it predicts that Congress is unlikely to pass a ""grand bargain"" before the end of the year and that ""[c]redit-rating agencies may well lose patience"" before lawmakers get their act together. This in turn would lead to higher interest rates that might well push the fragile economy into another recession. The main reason Bernanke and other financial and political observers are worried is that by the end of the year, we will face what might be called a triple witching hour. At that time, the Bush tax cuts will expire and the payroll tax holiday will end. Additionally, Congress has committed itself to cutting spending by about $100 billion next year and more than $1 trillion over the next decade. If the Bush tax cuts and payroll tax holiday are extended, and Congress wriggles its way out of its commitment to cut spending, the deficit will swell to the point where alarmists see us going the way of Greece. If the Bush tax cuts and payroll holiday are not extended, and Congress lives up to its commitment to cut spending, the drag on the economy will be severe. The economy is expected to decline by 3.5% to 5% ; that is, it will be pushed back into a serious recession. No wonder some predict ""Taxmageddon."" Dealing with this dilemma requires political cooperation between the GOP and the Democrats, between both houses of Congress and the president. Few expect the sides to reach a major deal before the elections. That is, under the best of circumstances, we will come close to the edge of the financial cliff because these matters must be settled by the first of the year, and markets often do not wait for the actual date to tank -- they anticipate. Assuming we somehow will be spared until the elections -- what will happen after November 6? While that depends on the election results, people should note that the current power setup will be in place until January 20. Thus, even if Mitt Romney is elected president, Barack Obama will still be in the White House when the master deal must be struck, the Democrats will still have a majority in the Senate, and the GOP will still be able to filibuster and control the House. Ajay Rajadhyaksha of Barclays Capital aptly described the evolving conditions as ""a slow-motion train wreck."" Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, asked, ""How do you plan for chaos? It's almost a unique moment in government because there's so much at stake. And there's nothing that inspires confidence that [a congressional deal] will get done."" Political theorists hold that democracies need crises to focus leaders' and voters' minds and get bickering parties to work together to find a solution. This is not what happened in Greece and may well not be in the cards for several other European nations that are challenged by a similar crisis. I assume we will do better, but investors may do well to pull in their horns, and citizens ought to tell their representatives in no uncertain terms that the time to act in unison is now -- we can't afford to risk waiting until after the November election. Fasten your seat belt, because even if it all works out well in the end, it will be a cliffhanger.

"(CNN) -- Most console video games these days imitate box-office blockbusters with life-like, amazing special effects, dramatic dialog and powerful storytelling. With its blocky cartoonishness, the LEGO franchise flips that convention on its head. Developed by the company Traveler's Tales, the latest in the LEGO series, ""LEGO The Lord of the Rings,"" puts Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn and the rest of the characters from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy into block toy form as they trace storylines from the popular books and movies. This isn't the first time Traveler's Tales has taken aim at a popular movie icon and transformed it into LEGOs. Harry Potter, ""Star Wars"" and Indiana Jones characters have been made into toy-like video games with some success. With the popular Lord of the Rings franchise, however, the stakes are higher, and the company rose to the occasion by staying true to the story as it was presented on the big screen. In ""LEGO The Lord of the Rings,"" the characters' voices are the same as those heard in the movies; the dialog, too, is unchanged. Nicholas Ricks, executive producer for Traveler's Tales, said that true-to-movie setup created some challenges. It was unclear, for instance, if dramatic dialog would translate into lighter, LEGO humor. Fortunately, he said, it worked out well. ""We actually gained quite a lot of humor and, in addition, we can also convey the complexities of the characters a lot more easily than we thought,"" Ricks said. He added: ""It's what LEGO brings to the party. That lightness of touch, that familiarity, that humor brings those darker moments up to a level that seems age appropriate."" Here's an example: In one Lord of the Rings movie, Frodo and Sam look upon Mordor for the first time. Frodo says, ""Sam, I'm glad you're with me."" The LEGO version uses the same scene and the same lines. But, as Frodo delivers his line in the game, he also loads Sam up with gear supplies. ""The inclusion of the dialog allows us to retain the cinematic quality, although it is LEGO-recreated,"" Ricks said. ""It allows us to tell the story a lot better. But we still have bags of humor that plays with that irreverence that you'd suspect from a LEGO game."" The appeal of these two popular franchises combined in a video game is expected to hit a wide audience from older fans who read the J.R.R. Tolkien series in the 1960s and 70s as teens to the younger generation who can quote lines from the movie from memory and who are the target audience for the LEGO toys. The balance between the two audiences is tricky. ""For our youngest gamer, say a 7-year-old lad, we need to ensure they can play this story, have fun and be rewarded and still feel like it is an epic adventure,"" Ricks said. ""But playing through all the game, through the free play sections, collecting the 40 new magical items and finding and discovering new characters -- those kinds of things go for the old gamers."" The game does include some dark moments. Ricks said the company doesn't shy away from characters getting killed, but they do it LEGO style. ""LEGO The Lord of the Rings"" was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC and Nintendo Wii on November 13 in North America. It will be released in Europe on Friday.

"(CNN) -- It's being billed as ""Lego for adults"" and could mean your fondness for construction toys may no longer be just a guilty pleasure. The new robotics kit created by China-based Makeblock provides all you need to relive your childhood, with nearly 100 Lego-compatible mechanical and electronic components. But this time around you're building robots for real, assembling modules that can create walking spider robots, beverage bots, or even your very own Wall-E. ""Makeblock is an aluminum version of Lego bricks,"" explains Makeblock founder Jasen Wang. ""Like Lego, parts can connect to each other easily and flexibly, but you don't need nuts to make the connections, since we have a clever threaded slot design."" All the pieces slot together in a construction process designed to be easy and intuitive, says Wang. ""We've done some work to make the electronics and software more friendly to beginners. We use uniform modular connectors with color tags to help you make the right connections, and we plan to have a smartphone app to let beginners interact with their robots without any programming."" Read: Liquid air future fuels garage inventor . Construction toys like Lego capture the imagination of children and adults alike, says UK psychologist Jon Sutton. ""As children, Lego taught us to follow rules, but also to discard them,"" says Sutton, who has written about the psychology of Lego. ""Lego is a simple, uniform, non-representational material that can be transformed into the most complex, individual objects representing the wildest of fantasy worlds."" The fantasy world of play is increasingly being harnessed in education across the board, not just in robotics, says Jeff Schwarting, founder of SuperFunner, an organization that seeks to aid education through ""gamification."" ""There's a growing belief that play may be tied to learning -- but it's wrong. Play is learning,"" says Schwarting. ""Play provides a safe environment which embraces trial and error, eliminating fear of failure and encouraging experimentation, which leads to greater understanding of how things work and greater confidence in one's ability to confront challenges."" Makeblock appeals to this sense of creativity, but it's not just analogous to Lego, it is Lego-compatible, says Wang. ""The basic hole distance in our platform is the same as the basic dimensions in Lego, both are 8 mm, so it's possible to attach Lego blocks to Makeblock parts. Makeblock is an open platform, compatible with many other parts and systems, we don't put any limit on people's imagination,"" Wang says. Read: Mine Kafon: The low-tech tumbleweed minesweeper . ""Open source means we work closely with a large, smart community, which will help us to improve product designs. Customers will also get additional technical support from the community and other resources such as code."" Building robots is a creative process that should be accessible to everyone, he adds. ""Our goal is to help people turn their ideas into reality, help them to be more creative. Creating is no longer something that just the geeks can do, but also people without professional backgrounds,"" says Wang. Despite having a masters degree in aircraft design and being a DIY and robotics enthusiast, even Wang found available robotics kits difficult to follow. He was also unimpressed with their flimsy design. Read: 'Shutter shades' create new fashion code . ""I don't like plastic kits, because they look like toys, and most of the applications built by plastic kits are just for fun, without practical use,"" he says. Wang resolved to make his own kits, with solid design and an open-source philosophy. ""I wanted to create a platform that is strong, flexible and practical, for people to turn their ideas into success, to build some real things."" Wang believes open-source hardware will follow the popularity of open-source software, as people want to create more physical things. ""The hardware era is coming now. People live in the real physical world, not in the digital world. The popularity of 3D printers is an example of this,"" he says. Wang's kits provide all the components you need to jump-start your home robotics career. Whether you want to build a mini tank or a 3D printer of your own, Makeblock has the parts and just like with Lego, your imagination does the rest.","New robotics kit billed as ""Lego for adults"" gives grown-ups the chance to relive youth using 21st century technology .

"(CNN) -- Noted for his versatility and breadth of achievement, American opera singer Thomas Hampson is one of the most respected baritones performing in the world today. The 56-year-old, who hails from Spokane, in Washington, boasts a discography of more than 150 albums, winning him multiple Grammy Awards, two Edison Prizes and the coveted Grand Prix de Disque -- the highest award for musical recordings in France. The grandeur of opera houses, tail coats and melodramatic librettos is a far cry from the thatched huts and sweltering sun of Durban's traditional Zulu townships. But this is where Hampson chose to land for his Fusion Journey. He was there to seek out famed South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose mix of low rumbling harmonies and ululating riffs gained worldwide appreciation when the group appeared on Paul Simon's seminal Graceland album in 1986. During a 10-day visit, the all-American opera singer was challenged to produce a fusion of sound that blended the diametrically contrasting traditions of Western classical music with Mambazo's distinctive take on ancient Zulu melodies. In his own words, this is the story of Hampson's journey. Thomas Hampson: I come from a very different musical tradition to the members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but I believe that anyone who stands next to another person and sings is somehow a brother, somehow a sister -- and rarely have I felt this more acutely than on my journey to Durban. It was my first time there and what I saw of the city was beautiful. After landing I was struck by the deeply brushed low-lying hills and surrounding tundra, and the bustling atmosphere of the huge port. We traveled to the Clermont township, to the former home of Joseph Shabalala (leader of the group). His old township is on the outskirts of Durban and while, of course, there are many signs of modernization -- like new homes and roads -- the area still carries a distinctive sense of its Zulu roots. The people made a strong impression on me. They are physically very attractive and all seemed to have a wonderful sense of humor and warmth. It was in this spirit that Joseph and the band welcomed me with open arms and a song -- I couldn't have wished for a better introduction! See also: Royal Ballet star takes inspiration from Chinese dance . Mambazo showed me the room where the group gathered to rehearse as young men, and the stage on which they first stood to compete in local singing competitions. We went on to see a traditional Zulu wedding ceremony and I saw the modest village dwellings -- the circular huts -- the likes of which most members of the group would have called home as children. I'm glad we had this experience before we started making music together. I spend so much of my time in life understanding other people's ideas, getting into their language, their music ... their DNA. This is not something you can just imitate. It seemed to me that in the Zulu Nation, music is part of everyday communication. Their speech has a percussive rhythm, the intonation of the words creates a melody. See more: Fusion Journeys . We eventually began rehearsing in the garage of Joseph's current home. We all got in a half circle and sang to each other for a couple of hours. Just that simple: I sang their stuff, they sung mine and we'd say ""how did that go again?"" One of the most interesting parts of this process for me was seeing how all the members of the group would work off each other -- responding and reshaping each other's words as they sang, instantaneously mixing tone and intonation to create new sounds. Of course, as an opera singer I've now sung in 11 or 12 languages, but how many people get to say that they've sung in Zulu? A few hours together and a beautiful melody is starting to take shape. We decided to document this wonderful experience and collaboration against the stunning backdrop of Durban's Valley of a Thousand Hills -- where our final performance took place. We began with a Zulu piece -- and perhaps Mambazo's most iconic hit song -- ""Homeless."" The song is about the violence and displacement of South African Apartheid. What I find enchanting about it, and other Mambazo pieces that speak of pain and suffering, is that it still sounds so full of hope. I can tell you all the members of Mambazo have suffered incomprehensible loss in their lives, and yet none of their music ever feels angry or spiteful, it is always rich with love. I found that very inspiring. For my song, I selected an old American parlor piece called ""Hard Times Come Again No More."" It was enthralling to perform such a melancholy number with Mambazo's deep soulfulness added to it. How would I describe my journey looking back? I just put on their clothes for a period of time, but I won't even pretend that I can now walk in their shoes, make music the way they make music, sing how they sing. It is tempting to contrast the formal, intellectual way that much Western classical music expresses emotion with the mystical, organic way that we hear with Mambazo. But this, I think, is an over-easy simplification. We're musicians, we have different wells but we all draw from the same river. Would I go back? In a heartbeat.","American baritone Thomas Hampson travels to Durban to create musical fusion .

"DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (CNN) -- President Bush gave Tanzania's president, who played basketball as a youth, a pair of Shaquille O'Neal's shoes Sunday, along with millions of dollars to help combat disease and poverty in the east African country. President Jakaya Kikwete, next to President Bush, looks on as Bush greets a boy at a Tanzanian hospital Sunday. The gift of the American basketball icon's size-23 hightops spoke to the lighter side of Bush's visit. President Jakaya Kikwete presented gifts, too -- a stuffed leopard and lion, a Zebra skin and a wood carving for the American president who was enthusiastically welcomed on the second stop of his five-nation African tour. The Tanzanian president later artfully dodged a reporter's question on the potential that the U.S. might elect a black president, Sen. Barack Obama, whose father is Kenyan. Kikwete looked at Bush before demonstrating his political deftness, saying, ""Let him be as good a friend of Africa as President Bush has been."" But there was plenty of serious business to tend to as well, namely the signing of a compact under which the U.S. is to provide a $698 million grant to Tanzania.  Watch how Bush explained what African nations are candidates for U.S. aid » . U.S. funding is intended to help African governments buy mosquito netting and insecticide to prevent the spread of malaria. ""It breaks my heart to know that little children are dying needlessly because of a mosquito bite,"" Bush said. Bush also attended a roundtable on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program, which Kikwete said is saving lives and helping the African continent avert a health disaster. Bush said he has requested $30 billion over the next five years for the program. Though PEPFAR has helped increase accessibility to anti-viral drugs, the program is controversial because there is little focus on distributing condoms -- a staple of the program under President Clinton -- or on sex education, said Joel Barkan, a senior associate for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The program is ""largely pursued through faith-based initiatives,"" he said, adding that it's not clear whether the AIDS-prevalence rates are going down. After their visit to Tanzania, the president and first lady Laura Bush will travel to Rwanda to meet with President Paul Kagame.  Watch why Bush looks to Africa as part of his legacy » . The U.S. has provided nearly 7,000 Rwandan troops with training, and spent more than $17 million to equip the troops and send them to Sudan, according to National Security adviser Stephen Hadley. Ethnic and tribal violence has raged for years in Sudan's western Darfur region, leaving about 200,000 dead and more than 2 million displaced. Arab militias, said to be backed by the Sudanese government, have wantonly attacked Africans, and numerous rebel groups have attacked government targets. ""In Darfur, the U.S. will continue to call the killing what it is -- genocide,"" Bush said last week. The Bushes will go to Ghana then Liberia after visiting Rwanda. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is on the Africa trip, will head to Kenya on Monday to support efforts to reach political conciliation there. The country erupted in ethnic violence after a December presidential vote, in which President Mwai Kibaki kept his post. Opposition leader Raila Odinga blasted the results, saying the election was rigged. He and his supporters declined to recognize the election results. Violence has declined some since former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan began mediating between the two groups. Bush's first stop on the six-day tour was Benin, where he arrived Saturday. There, President Thomas Yayi Boni inducted Bush into the National Order of Benin and gave the American president a sash, cross medallion and lapel pin. He also thanked Bush for U.S. aid aimed at fighting poverty, malaria and HIV/AIDS, and he asked for help for Benin's struggling cotton exports. Boni said it was tough for Benin to compete with Asian cotton producers because of their superior infrastructure and with U.S. cotton growers because of government subsidies. Bush responded that the U.S. is willing to make concessions, but suggested that Benin might be better served to develop a cotton-products industry rather than trying to export raw cotton. Boni said Benin needs international help bolstering its electricity, water, communication and transportation systems before expanding its manufacturing sector. Bush said he chose Benin to start his African tour because its leaders were determined to fight corruption and were careful to make sure U.S. aid dollars were properly spent. ""The United States wants to partner with leaders and their people, but we're not going to do so with people who steal money, pure and simple,"" Bush said. The United States has given Benin $307 million in a five-year grant to fight poverty, part of Bush's Millennium Challenge Account, which provides aid to countries that practice democratic principles and sound economic policy. Bush's trip to Africa is ""basically an effort to celebrate successes,"" said Joel Barkan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Most Americans picture Africa as the ""continent of gloom and doom,"" but the president is saying the bigger picture is one of ""making progress."" Barkan added, ""The question might be asked why he's not going to a number of countries,"" in particular the regional powers of Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. ""If the election in Kenya had gone well,"" the analyst said, ""I'm sure Kenya would have been included. That's not possible now."" The trip marks Bush's second to the continent and his wife's fifth.

"Paris (CNN) -- Daniel Ek founded the music-streaming service Spotify in his native Sweden in 2006 and launched it to the public two years later. The service now has more than 10 million users in 12 countries. It launched in the United States in July and recently announced a platform for third-party apps, allowing outside developers to build new social features into the service. Ek is one of the speakers at Le Web, one of Europe's largest tech conferences. He spoke to CNN ahead of his talk Friday. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: You recently announced you were opening up Spotify to outside developers. Are you hoping that Spotify will become an online music hangout? Daniel Ek: Yes. Look, the way we think about it is that there are 500 million people right now that listen to music online, and out of those 500 million the vast majority of people listen illegally. We just feel that what is missing right now is sort of music across the Web. The other thing we realized is that music is something that is deeply personal to people and curating that experience is definitely a personal experience. We felt that there were so many places around the Web where people were doing a good job curating music, but you couldn't actually hear it. So we felt that what we added to the table was really powering music to all these great experiences. CNN: So what other mid- to long-term plans do you have for Spotify? Where do you see it in five, maybe 10 years? Ek: We kind of look at music as something very natural in people's lives. I mean, most of us can relate to music in some sort of shape and form, and if you think about it, most of us remember the first time we kissed someone, what kind of music was playing or the song that was playing on our friend's birthday. We believe that music should be like water. It should just exist everywhere so if you think about that for a moment. What we are really trying to do (is) making music more accessible. We want music to be everywhere and in every device, in every place. It really doesn't matter where in the world that is or on what device that is or what I'm doing. I should always have music accessible. CNN: How do you think the Facebook integration is working out? You can see users' Spotify choices showing up next to their updates. How is that working out? Ek: The most important thing in converting people from pirate users to legal users has been to get them to engage more in music. And Facebook really helps us with that. We find that our users who are social share a lot more playlists with their friends, and that also means that they are discovering a lot more music, and the more music they are discovering the better it is because they keep coming back to Spotify. But they are also a lot more likely to pay, so I would say that we are incredibly aligned with Facebook in that we want people to engage more. And so far it has been a great partnership. CNN: Has there been any privacy backlash over that sharing? Ek: The way I look at this is every time Facebook has done something historically there has always been a great debate about privacy. But what normally happens is after a few weeks everyone kind of says, ""OK, well, actually this is pretty cool and this is what I wanted."" We take people's privacy very, very seriously. Shortly after releasing the first clients, we had a lot of users that said, ""Hey, I want the opportunity to turn this off at different times,"" and what was so interesting about that process was that we asked our community. I was actually tweeting with our users, and they were the ones that suggested to us that we add this private listening mode that we now have. So our users suggested that and were very specific with ""this is how we think it should work"" and we took that very seriously and implemented it within 48 hours. CNN: Do you see yourself on a crusade to save the music industry? Ek: I don't think we see ourselves as the savior of the music industry. We are passionate about making it so that users enjoy the music that they want to enjoy but at the same time fairly compensates artists. That's not the same as saving the music industry. CNN: How much support do you receive from the record labels in your quest to do that? Ek: Again, this has been a big change. Not for us, but for the entire music industry. Music has moved from being about ownership to being about access, and I think that any major change and a disruption in an industry takes time. But we have great relationships with all of our label partners. And we feel that we are going from strength to strength, and I think our user numbers are showing that but also the fact that we have now, in a very short period of time, become the second-largest income stream for all the music industry in Europe in just shy of three years. CNN: What kind of feedback have you personally gotten from musicians that you've met? Ek: A lot of them are real excited. They just want to know how they can market themselves better with Spotify. They want to figure out, ""How do I get as many people as possible to hear my music?"" And the interesting thing with Spotify is that it is entirely democratic because we don't promote a single artist or do anything else. Actually, the only thing we have here is we have apps now that help curate. Spotify itself does nothing to promote a particular type of music. Thereby, my advice to artists is very simple: ""Make the best music you can and people will share it."" It's really that simple. CNN: And what about you yourself? How do you consume music? Ek: It's actually funny because I have two -- I probably shouldn't even admit this -- but I have two listening modes. One is obviously Spotify, but I've started becoming a bit of a vinyl buff so I actually listen to vinyl. There is something warm, and I just really enjoy vinyl. So I tend to buy a lot of vinyl records. I like it for the artwork but also for the warmness in sound. CNN: What kind of music? What are your music preferences? Ek: I listen to jazz, pop, rock, R&B. It really doesn't matter to me. So it's often easier to talk about specific artists that I listen to right now. And right now I listen to an Israeli artist called Yael Naim, which I know is pretty odd, but I discovered here through some Israeli who was living in London and listening to Spotify and thereafter I have fallen in love with her. There is a pretty cool cover of the Britney Spears song ""Toxic.""","Streaming-music service Spotify has more than 10 million users in 12 countries .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma native Blake Shelton is the first entertainer to announce a benefit for tornado victims in his home state. After Tuesday night's taping of ""The Voice,"" the country music superstar told CNN, ""We are actually putting together a fund-raiser right now with NBC. We'll have more details within the next 24 hours, but definitely something with NBC that is going to happen real fast, and hopefully raise a lot of money."" The revelation came after he and his wife, Miranda Lambert, sang an especially poignant rendition of their hit ""Over You,"" which the couple wrote as a tribute to Shelton's brother, who died when Shelton was a teenager. ""'Over You' was just the perfect song to fit, and maybe help some people heal and mourn and all those things,"" Shelton said. Shelton revealed he had a personal connection to the community with the most devastation. ""(Monday) was a tough day for any Oklahoman,"" he said. ""And you know, Miranda and I are both residents of Oklahoma. I was born and raised in Oklahoma there and Miranda lives there now. It was tough to land here in LA and look at (media coverage) on the phone and go, 'Oh my gosh, we just left there.'"" Celebs who are OK natives speak out on the tornado tragedy . The country singer said he has family very near some of the hardest hit areas. ""I spent three Christmases at my sister's house in Moore, Oklahoma, and some of those helicopter views of the destruction, you could see her house a quarter of a mile away from there,"" Shelton said. ""My nieces and nephews would have gone to that school (Plaza Towers Elementary), and when you start putting it in that sort of perspective, and then thinking, 'Oh my God, I am so glad that they recently moved away from that area.' And then you go, 'What about all those people that didn't?' It's hard to put into words, honestly."" Shelton's fellow coach on ""The Voice,"" singer Usher, said he hopes to be part of the benefit. ""I have family in Oklahoma City,"" he said. ""My little sister, Ashira -- her family is OK. Unfortunately, that is something that you can't -- all you can do is put your best efforts forward, just let those who have been a part of this tragic reality, this natural disaster, know that we are thinking about them and care about them.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Six Maasai warriors have journeyed thousands of miles from their remote village in Tanzania to compete in the London Marathon. Their mission is to raise awareness and money for their village of Elaui, where two out of three babies die of water borne diseases. The Maasai warriors travel on London's tube network. ""We are losing a lot of younger brother and sisters,"" says Isaya Oleporuo, 24-year-old leader of the group, ""we thought that we can get people to help us."" When they heard about the marathon from Greenforce, a non-profit travel company that works in Tanzania, the young men decided to enter the race. They saw it as a way to try and raise the nearly $120,000 needed to set up a permanent water well in their village. ""It's an absolutely amazing experience,"" says Paul Martin, a Greenforce Expedition Leader who helping the runners. ""They were enthralled and amused by the idea that money could be raised by running, and as the Maasai pride themselves on being strong runners it was not long before they asked me if they could take part.""

"(CNN) -- Apple appears to be testing out motion control features that will let people control their iPhones by moving their heads. The feature, first reported by 9to5 Mac, was discovered in the developer version of Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 7, and is not yet publicly available. It is an option in the Accessibility menu that overrides the usual touchscreen controls. It works by using the front-facing iPhone or iPad camera to detect head movements, according to the report. When on, the system automatically runs through every option on the device screen until the user selects the one he or she wants by turning his or her head to one side. The left or right head movements can be assigned to different tasks, including returning to the main home screen, displaying notifications or activating voice assistant Siri. (You can watch a video demonstration here.) The approach appears time-consuming, but being able to navigate the phone interface this way with head movements could potentially be useful for people with limited mobility or other disabilities that make touch or voice interfaces difficult to use. The new version of the iOS mobile operating system is still in beta testing, when its features are used by developers creating new apps while Apple fixes bugs and polishes the interface. Regular iPhone users will be able to upgrade to iOS 7 in the fall. The head-movement feature is meant as an accessibility option, but it's easy to imagine similar motion control features becoming more commonplace on devices in the future. Motion detection technology that lets you control a computer interface has taken off in the past few years. The Microsoft Kinect and a soon-to-be-released device from Leap Motion use powerful depth sensor cameras. The Kinect can detect a person's skeleton, face and even expressions. The Leap detects gestures such as finger movements. In a pinch, regular smartphone cameras can perform some minor motion detection features, but they are still in the early stages and need work before they are good enough to be practical tools. Motion control options are already popping up in smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S4 supports eye scrolling, moving a page when the user's eyes look up or down, and detecting when motion has stopped. If you look away from a video while it is playing, it can automatically pause. It also supports gestures, such as picking up calls when you wave a hand over the device.","A new feature being tested in iOS 7 lets you control the iPhone interface with head movements .

"(CNN) -- Can you remember what you were doing 30 years ago? In 1983, Bjorn Borg retired from a glittering tennis career, the Nazi Klaus Barbie was officially charged with war crimes and the final episode of M*A*S*H was breaking TV records. More importantly, for the purpose of this exercise, millions of black and ""non-white"" South Africans were living -- and dying -- in misery under a brutal apartheid regime. Whatever you were doing back then, I would think it unlikely that any single decision you made has shaped what has become of your life since. That's not the case, however, for the young black cricketers that left the Caribbean to play in South Africa. For them, everything changed the day they boarded a plane for Johannesburg. They are the focus of CNN's documentary ""World Sport Presents: Branded a Rebel."" In 1977, the Commonwealth nations added a sporting ban to their campaign against apartheid in South Africa. By isolating the country's teams and starving passionate and influential South Africans of their beloved sport, it was hoped their government would be forced into changing policies that discriminated against a majority of the population. As a result, cricket's ""Rebel Tours"" were highly controversial, unofficial, international matches that were organized in defiance of those sanctions. It was an issue that split the world's cricket community right down the middle. The invited players that declined, such as England's Ian Botham and West Indian Viv Richards, took a strong moral stance in opposition. Contact 'Branded as a rebel' presenter Don Riddell on Facebook . But, whether from England, Australia or Sri Lanka, the massive financial inducements were often too much even for some of the sport's biggest names to refuse. For each of the seven tours, there was outcry, but it was the West Indies' role that provoked the most outrage. These men didn't steal anything -- they certainly didn't kill anyone -- and they didn't break any laws, but their ""crime"" was almost worse. They were condemned for supporting an abhorrent, racist regime; effectively betraying their own race. Ironically, it was they who were isolated. They were banished from playing international sport and shunned by their peers and communities; many were forced to relocate abroad. Only one ever played for the Windies again. Hardly anything has been written or broadcast about their two tours between 1982-84, a period which has been described as one of the darkest chapters in the history of cricket. Whatever views have been articulated are typically negative, damning and highly critical of the players and those who funded and organized the matches. The common narrative is that they were mercenaries, traitors and rebels. But while the players can't deny that many were influenced by the money -- some were paid in excess of $100,000 for a month of cricket -- some would prefer to be known as missionaries. Pioneers. Crusaders. I knew it wouldn't be easy getting them to talk about their experience, just tracking them down was hard enough. For obvious reasons the West Indies Cricket Board, which had banned them, wasn't much use. Some of the players like Herbert Chang and Richard Austin -- known to have struggled with substance abuse -- have effectively fallen off the grid. Trying to forget . Of those we tracked down, it soon became clear very few had any interest in reliving the experience. It wasn't the tours that they didn't want to revisit, but the judgment and condemnation they had endured since. Some players flatly declined, others wanted to be paid outrageous sums; CNN's policy is not to pay for interviews. Over a period of several weeks, myself and our producer Samantha Bresnahan had a series of exhaustive exchanges with the team's captain Lawrence Rowe, a talented batsman who was forced to leave Jamaica and settle in Miami. We really thought he was close to giving an interview but ultimately he declined. I know he desperately wanted to tell his side of the story, a side which has never been heard before, but he was concerned his involvement would only reignite the controversy. He just couldn't take the risk. I would say that the players who did speak with us had mixed reasons for giving their interviews. Franklyn Stephenson is known as the greatest player never to have played for the Windies, but he is proud of his involvement. He still treasures his tour blazer and the team photo sits proudly on his shelf. He genuinely believes that the tours helped to change attitudes in South Africa, claiming that for the first time in their lives, white fans were able to see that the black race was at the very least equal, if not superior, to theirs. Of all the rebel teams, the West Indies were the only one to win a Test match in South Africa. West Indian society's 'running wound' Collis King, a hero of the Windies' 1979 World Cup final victory, felt the same. He was still angry at his treatment and we didn't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to find the bitterness still simmering. I believe that both men and the former wicketkeeper David Murray talked to us because they didn't have anything else to lose -- whatever the tour had once cost them, being associated with it could no longer hurt them. That's not the case for the likes of Emmerson Trotman. Even if he had wanted to share his story with us and a global audience, he has been ""rehabilitated"" as the current coach of the Barbados national team. That status could have been jeopardized by reminding everyone he was once a ""rebel."" As the regional historian Professor Hilary Beckles put it, the rebel tours still represent a ""running wound"" in West Indian society. Stephenson, King and Murray all told me they had no regrets. King was very clear that he would never say sorry for going to South Africa. Others have apologized, in the hope the controversy would be laid to rest. It will be interesting to see the reaction to our program; whether hearing a different perspective will change perceptions of the fateful decision these players made 30 years ago. And it makes you wonder, if you were ever put in their position, what would you do?","Thirty years ago, a West Indies cricket team took part in unauthorized tours .

"(CNN) -- Rapper DMX has found himself in trouble with the law again, this time with a DUI charge in South Carolina, authorities said Friday. Troopers in Greenville pulled over in a 1978 Plymouth station wagon Thursday night after spotting it traveling erratically, the South Carolina Highway Patrol said. DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was driving, he was given a field sobriety test and failed, the agency said. The rapper was charged with driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, the patrol said.. However, his publicist, Domenick Nati, said DMX wasn't arrested for DUI. ""He was arrested early this morning but quickly released,"" Nati told CNN. ""X was given a breathalyzer test and easily passed it. He is back at his home in South Carolina and we are continuing our focus on his upcoming album and acting roles."" But the state highway patrol responded to a CNN inquiry Friday evening by repeating that the 42-year-old rapper was arrested and charged with driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt. DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty. Maricopa County, Arizona, authorities said he was arrested five times after August 2007. That included a May 2008 arrest on drug and animal cruelty charges, when Simmons attempted to barricade himself inside his Cave Creek home, sheriff's deputies said. Simmons also ran into trouble while in prison, being placed on ""lockdown status"" and forced to eat only bread and water for ""jailhouse infractions."" In February 2009, he threw a food tray in anger at a corrections officer, according to the sheriff's office. In 2010 he was sent to prison after violating his probation. Four days later DMX was admitted to the Flamenco Mental Health unit for an undisclosed disorder.","NEW: Publicist for DMX counters report of DUI arrest .

The panel -- which also included Roger Carr, chairman-designate of defence company BAE Systems, Lee Hopley, chief economist at the Manufacturers Organisation for UK Manufacturers and Sarah Curran, founder of my-wardrobe.com -- was split on whether Europe's manufacturing center was in trouble. Hopley told CNN that European manufacturing had been going through a tough time as debt-ridden nations struggle to cope with harsh austerity measures and a regional debt crisis. However, ""there are industries such as the aerospace sector which right across Europe has been booming and will continue to so for some time,"" Hopley added.

Roger Carr, chairman of Centrica, was also optimistic for European industry. He said: ""No, it's not in trouble.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Eight cadets and staff members were killed in Pakistan during an an eight-hour standoff Monday with gunmen who stormed a police training center in Lahore, said Gen. Athar Abbas, a military spokesman. Police fire into the air after retaking the police training center in Lahore attacked by militants. The militants had been holed up on the top floor of a three-story building, said Rehman Malik, the head of the country's Interior Ministry. Security forces gained control of the first two floors and eventually made their way to the top, finally taking control of it and arresting the gunmen Monday afternoon. Television pictures showed security forces firing into the air from the roof of the building after the firefight. ""The operation is over. Four terrorists were killed and three arrested,"" Interior Ministry Secretary Kamal Shah told Reuters. Malik and Abbas confirmed the figures. Abbas added some of the dead militants blew themselves up. The gang of seven gunmen stormed the academy in the Manawan area of the eastern Pakistani city, said Malik. Abbas had previously said 30 people were killed. He cited the error on wrong information by his sources at the scene.  Watch more about the attack » . At a news conference Monday night, Malik named the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, and his followers as the prime suspect in organizing the attack. Mehsud is also accused of plotting the assassination of former PM Benazir Bhutto. At least 78 people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. Lahore is the same city where gunmen opened fire March 10 on a bus carrying members of the Sri Lankan national cricket team on their way to a stadium for a match. The well-coordinated attack wounded at least eight members of the team and killed a driver and six Pakistani police officers. In Monday's incident, the attackers hurled grenades, then stormed the compound and opened fire while officers were taking part in their morning drill. About 800 officers train at the facility, but authorities could not say exactly how many were inside at the time. The attackers, some in police uniforms, took dozens of officers hostage, said Asim Rizwan, spokesman for governor of Punjab -- the province where Lahore is located. Paramilitary forces and the army descended on the scene. Every few minutes, the gunmen detonated explosives or fired on reporters and police personnel outside, sending them scurrying for cover. Angry onlookers pumped their fists in the air and cheered as police led away a suspect they had captured. He had on him a grenade and a knife, officials told CNN.

"Indianapolis (CNN) -- Indiana voters retired Dick Lugar on Tuesday after 36 years in the Senate, punishing him for the qualities he considered assets: seniority, expertise in foreign policy and a penchant for bipartisan cooperation. Hoosier Republicans overwhelmingly chose to replace Lugar with Richard Mourdock, a longtime GOP operative who benefited from manpower and money from tea party activists and outside groups determined to topple the six-term veteran. Six years ago, Lugar ran unopposed by Democrats, much less Republicans, and cruised to another term. But this time, the 80-year-old was drummed out of office by many of the same voters who sent him repeatedly to Washington but now say they want a change. Analysis: Lugar's grass roots withered . Lugar conceded the race about an hour after the polls closed, telling supporters that he congratulated Mourdock on ""a hard-fought race."" ""I want to see a Republican in the White House,"" Lugar said. ""I want to see my friend Mitch McConnell have a Republican majority in the Senate. I hope that Richard Mourdock prevails in November so he can contribute to that Republican majority."" Mourdock, Indiana's state treasurer, will face Democrat Joe Donnelly in November in a contest the nonpartisan Cook Political Report calls safely Republican. ""This hasn't been about me. This has been about all of you. You got this done,"" Mourdock told supporters during a victory speech in Indianapolis. He thanked his supporters and led them in a round of applause for Lugar. ""When I began this campaign, Senator Lugar was not my enemy,"" Mourdock said. ""He is not now my enemy. He will never by my enemy. He was simply, over the last 15 months, my opponent."" But now, he said, Republicans need ""to get this country back on a course where all can rise and all sense the excitement of the dream that is America."" Follow all of Tuesday's political results at CNN.com's Election Center . In recent years, Lugar had served as chairman, then ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. The panel's current leader, Sen. John Kerry, called Lugar's defeat ""a tragedy for the Senate"" Tuesday. Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said Lugar could be compared to the renowned U.S. Sen. William Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat ""who is remembered today not for one loss, but for a legacy of following the facts and speaking the truth despite the political risks."" ""This is a tough period in American politics, but I'd like to think that we'll again see a United States Senate where Dick Lugar's brand of thoughtful, mature and bipartisan work is respected and rewarded,"" Kerry said in a written statement. ""That kind of seriousness of purpose should never go out of fashion."" Mourdock's move to oust the widely respected senior senator was initially viewed as an uphill battle. Lugar's campaign released a poll in February showing the incumbent up by 25 points. But then outside conservative groups fed up with his penchant for compromise began pouring money into the race, and they turned it into the first stand of so-called Super PACs in a contested primary. As polls started to show the race tighten, tea party groups mobilized grassroots supporters and turned the David vs. Goliath race into a national referendum on the state of the Republican Party. The Club for Growth, a conservative pro-growth group, perhaps played the biggest role, releasing a barrage of ads that framed Lugar as out of step with his own party. The group endorsed Mourdock in mid-February and spent close to $1.5 million on television ads -- close to what Lugar's own campaign spent on TV spots. But it also collected more than $300,000 from donors and gave it to the Mourdock campaign, making their total spending on the race close to $2 million. Chris Chocola, President of the Club for Growth, used the win as a warning to other Republicans who didn't toe the conservative line. ""Richard Mourdock's victory truly sends a message to the liberals in the Republican Party: voters are rejecting the policies that led to record debt and diminished economic freedom, and they will continue to be rejected in elections throughout America,"" Chocola said in a written statement. Lugar focused his pitch on his more than three decades in the Senate as a leading voice on foreign policy. ""I'm still working every day. I'm getting warheads out of Russia. And missiles, things that are of very grave consequence. I would just say that people may not have their eye on the ball, but I do,"" Lugar told CNN after greeting voters in Greenwood. But perplexed Republican strategists say that Lugar's focus talking nukes at a time of widespread joblessness was off-key, and a major factor in his defeat. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who endorsed Lugar, told CNN the ""moral of the story is play offense, not defense."" Unlike Republican colleagues who got toppled by tea party insurgents two years ago, Lugar had time to prepare for his primary challenge and tack right but he chose not to. Instead, he voted for legislation unpopular with the GOP base, such as allowing children of illegal immigrants to have a path to U.S. citizenship. In ads and in the mail, Lugar's opponents repeatedly linked him to the president, calling him President Barack Obama's favorite Republican. Ralph Williams, a longtime Lugar supporter whose grandmother was close to the senator, came out to vote for his opponent this time. ""If he was running for something to do with foreign policy, I'd be all over it,"" Williams told CNN. But he said now, ""I think he's done."" Williams' vote was more about voting Lugar out than putting Mourdock in, he said. Lugar's decision to reside primarily in his home in McLean, Virginia, outside Washington, instead of Indiana played into his opponent's line that he was ""out of touch"" and no longer able to represent the interests of his own constituents. ""He's not been here. He's been absent for a long time,"" Mourdock told CNN after meeting voters in Avon on Tuesday afternoon. After his state residency was challenged, Lugar registered to vote at his son's family farm and repaid hotel bills he said were inappropriately charged to his Senate account. And he argued his choice about staying close to the Capitol was about raising his four sons together with his wife, which he said was evidence of ""family values"" and had no bearing on his job performance. While Mourdock and his allies didn't explicitly argue the 80-year-old senator was no longer up to another six-year term, some voters in Indiana said while they admired his long list of accomplishments for the state -- they just thought it was time for him to step down. But Lugar's supporters say his ability to work with Democrats and his foreign policy expertise earned him their vote for another term. ""I liked the fact that Sen. Lugar isn't a strict party person,"" Vicki Johnson, a voter in Fairland, said Tuesday afternoon. But Johnson also conceded that a defeat this election not be the worst outcome for Lugar. ""If he loses, maybe it'll be a blessing. Because he's older. Maybe he can enjoy life a little,"" she said. What was striking about Lugar's loss is how evident it is Hoosier voters respect him. Many Republican voters told CNN they were voting against him for the first time in decades, and it was clear they felt bad about it. ""I hated to depart,"" David Kitley said. But he quickly added, ""We can't let Obama dictate to us anymore what he's doing."" Kitley spoke in a hushed tone only a few feet away from Lugar, working the polls. Minutes earlier, he approached the senator and thanked him for his service.","NEW: Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts calls Lugar's loss ""a tragedy for the Senate""

"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Anytime anyone learns that I'm a sports columnist, one of two questions is sure to follow. It's either ""What's it like to be a female sports writer?"" or ""Do you go in the locker room?"" The first one is tricky to answer. The second one is not: ""Yes, and it stinks."" Locker rooms are smelly places. They are dank. They are damp. They are really not fun places to be inside. But you know what? That's where the athletes and coaches who I need to interview are, and so, that's where I am going to be. The locker room has been the designated spot for postpractice and postgame interviews for at least a century. Going into one is never glamorous or fun, but it has to be done. My job has taken me inside pro sports locker rooms off and on for the past dozen years or so. While the arrival of the NBA in Oklahoma City several years has increased the frequency with which I'm inside locker rooms, I still remember the first time that I went into a pro sports locker room. My employer, The Oklahoman, sent me to Arlington, Texas, to cover a Rangers game. With Oklahoma City being only three hours away from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, we have lots of readers who are Rangers fans. They were in playoff contention, and they were hosting a weekend series with the Red Sox. I had lots of stories to write and interviews to do, so I had to get there early for the open locker-room period before the game. As I took the elevator down from the press box to the field level, my mind was racing about all the players I needed to interview. But it was also spinning because I wasn't sure what to expect in the locker room. It wasn't the first time I'd been in a locker room to do interviews, but it was the first time I'd been inside a pro locker room. Would it be any different? Would it be hostile? Would it be weird? Would it be like ""Animal House"" except with millionaire athletes? When the clubhouse attendant opened the doors signaling the start of the media availability, empty bottles of Cristal did not spill into the hallway. There were no signs of diamond-encrusted togas either. Instead, there were just a bunch of baseball players getting ready to play a game. Some ended up being knuckleheads. They refused to talk, or they hung out in the training room so they didn't have to talk. Others were great. I remember going to the Red Sox locker room to try to get a minute with Pedro Martinez. This was during the height of his popularity, so I figured there was no way I'd get any one-on-one time. I was wrong. Martinez actually offered me the chair at his locker. I told him that it wasn't necessary, that I didn't mind standing or kneeling, but he wouldn't hear it. He sat on the ledge of his locker, I sat on the chair, and he talked to me for a good five minutes. Whether a player was good to interview had nothing to do with my gender. I believe they treated me the same way they would've treated a male reporter who was in my shoes. That's continued to be my experience in pro locker rooms. I've never felt threatened. I've never been harassed. Frankly, I suspect that's the experience of most female reporters who've been in pro locker rooms. Most of us have never found ourselves in a situation like the recent one involving members of the New York Jets. [The owner of the Jets apologized to a TV Azteca reporter following allegations that Jets personnel harassed her at practice this weekend, and she accepted.] . For that, we are grateful. For that, I am grateful. We have our foremothers to thank for much of the progress that has been made in the past three decades, women such as Lesley Visser, Lisa Olson, Melissa Ludtke, Christine Brennan and Michele Himmelberg. When the Association for Women in Sports Media was founded in 1987, the treatment of female reporters in locker rooms was a huge problem -- if they were even granted locker-room access. Ludtke, then a Sports Illustrated reporter, was prohibited from entering the locker room at the 1977 World Series by Major League Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, which prompted a lawsuit that led a U.S. federal judge to rule that reporters deserve equal locker-room access regardless of gender. Himmelberg battled for equal access from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1979, then was harassed later that season by male reporters when the Minnesota Vikings banned all reporters from the locker room because of her. And while doing interviews in the New England Patriots' locker room in 1980, Olson was surrounded by several players, who made aggressive, vulgar comments. The players were fined, the team's general manager was fired for trying to cover up the incident, and the resulting firestorm led to death threats. Those women were simply trying to do their jobs. They fought for that right to a fair and equal work environment, and it's a fight that we must continue to fight. We have come so far, yet we still have so far to go. Women in sports media today may not face such extreme circumstances, but the harassment continues. There are demeaning comments. There are misogynistic jokes. Sometimes those words or actions may not even be directed to a specific female reporter, but they still create a hostile work environment. One day, I hope all female sports reporters will no longer have to face that environment when they enter the locker room. I hope they can focus on the job that they're there to do. I hope the worse thing that they have to worry about is how much the place smells. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jenni Carlson.","Pioneering women broke the gender barrier in sports coverage, says Jenni Carlson .

"New York (CNN) -- A pizza deliveryman is accused of selling more than $45,000 in cocaine, hidden among pizza boxes, to undercover agents in New York. Ramon Rodriguez, 45, was arrested Wednesday after more than a yearlong investigation by the New York City Police Department's narcotics bureau in Brooklyn. Rodriguez has been charged with multiple counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance, according to a statement released by the Special Narcotics Prosecutor in New York. Undercover agents said Rodriguez sold a kilo of cocaine, worth $27,500, to an agent on Wednesday outside the Papa John's restaurant where he works in Brooklyn. This marked the largest individual sale of the investigation, according to prosecutors. Officials say Rodriguez, while dressed in his Papa John's uniform, passed the kilo of cocaine to the agent in a bag along with a box of pizza and a chicken nuggets box. Rodriguez was arrested as he placed the bag of cocaine inside the trunk of the undercover officer's car, prosecutors said. Rodriguez used his job as a pizza deliveryman as a cover during many of the 19 sales of cocaine he is accused of making to the undercover officer during the investigation, prosecutors said. Rodriguez conducted the sales outside the Papa John's restaurant and at his home a few blocks away, they said. ""On multiple occasions, Rodriguez told the undercover officers that he was interrupting pizza deliveries to conduct the drug transaction,"" according to prosecutors. Rodriguez was expected to be arraigned Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court. When reached for comment, a Papa John's spokesperson said the company was not aware of the case. The manager at the Papa John's restaurant where Rodriguez works had no comment.","Ramon Rodriguez, a Papa John's deliveryman, is accused of selling cocaine while on the job .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams powered her way to the French Open title Saturday with a straight sets victory over defending champion Maria Sharapova of Russia in a compelling final. The top seed from the United States ran out a 6-4 6-4 winner in one hour 46 minutes to clinch her 16th grand slam crown. Sharapova put up a brave fight but could not prevent Williams from claiming her first French Open title since her maiden triumph in 2002. The 26-year-old had not beaten her American opponent since 2004 and despite taking a 2-0 lead in the first set, then found Williams an irresistible force. Serving for the match, Williams took the first of two championship points, clinching it with a thunderous ace, her 10th of a gripping final. ""I was so nervous, I'm just happy to be champion,"" she told the capacity crowd on the Philippe Chatrier Court, speaking in French. ""I had a dream when I was 10 years old that I would win the title here and talk to the crowd in French,"" she admitted after lifting the Suzanne Lenglen trophy for the second time. ""I played a great tournament but ran into a really tough champion today,"" said the beaten Sharapova, whose victory over Sara Errani of Italy in last year's final completed her career grand slam. Williams, who has been in superlative form on the Roland Garros clay, crushed Errani in just 46 minutes in the semifinals to serve notice of her intent ahead of the title match. But Sharapova, herself an impressive winner over Victoria Azarenka in the last four, made a fine start to break early and take the initiative. Williams, who has lost just three matches since her upset defeat to Virginie Razzano in the first round of the French Open last year, immediately hit back and led 4-3 with a second break of Sharapova's service. World No.2 Sharapova refused to bow and claimed Williams' service to level at 4-4 before she was broken for a third time. Williams served it out to go a set to the good in 51 minutes and a single break of service in the second in the end proved decisive. It was her 31st straight win and with it Williams has moved to within two of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, who are tied fourth in the all-time list of grand slam singles titles winners. At 31 years and 247 days, she is oldest woman in the Open Era to win the French Open title, the previous mark held by Evert since 1986. She has now won three of the last four grand slams, a run interrupted by a shock defeat to compatriot Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open earlier this year. Rafael Nadal bids for his eighth men's title at the French Open when he plays fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in Sunday's final and will start heavy favorite after his epic semifinal win over No.1 Novak Djokovic.","Serena Williams wins French Open title .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. ""We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,"" Obama said, adding that Thursday's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. ""The world must stand together,"" Obama said. ""We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise."" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. ""It's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,"" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by ""all nuclear powers."" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for ""locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years"" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. ""The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,"" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya's turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel's, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi's absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. ""I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,"" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. ""Russia's position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,"" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country's nuclear activities ""are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever."" ""In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,"" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia's position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus.","NEW: Libya can serve as example of cooperation, White House spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The village of Iitate in Japan's Fukushima prefecture was once home to 6,000 people. Today, however, it is essentially a ghost town, evacuated after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant just 25 miles (40 kilometers) away following the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011. While former residents can return to Iitate during the day, it's still an eerie scene -- children's toys lie abandoned in yards, bicycles rust on front porches and only an occasional truck passes through its quiet streets. For elderly couple Yukio and Masayo Nakano the last 20 months have not been easy. Yukio lived had lived in his home in the village for more than 60 years, moving in just after World War Two. ""I can't describe it. It's hard living in the temporary housing, and it's very stressful mentally,"" he says. The difficult situation has also taken its toll on his wife Masayo. ""I'm lonely. We're getting old,"" she says. ""I think every day how long I can survive in this situation."" Only one building -- the town's nursing home -- has permanent residents. Following consultation with their families and the Japanese government, the 80 or so people living there were allowed to stay despite the evacuation order. Miyoko Sato, a former Iitate resident who left after the nuclear accident, returns to work there each week for a very simple reason. ""These people will stay here for the rest of their life,"" she says. ""And I cherish them just like a family member. But I don't know if our village will be able to come back anytime soon."" However some are trying to make the village inhabitable for all: crews who have the hazardous task of trying to clean up from one of the worst nuclear accidents the world has ever seen. They perform repetitive tasks -- wiping down buildings with damp cloths, and using high pressure hoses to clean drainage systems along the streets. Workers are also clearing a layer of top soil in Iitate, as well as the numerous other affected areas of Fukushima prefecture. But it's an endless task, as it's a region that's roughly the size of greater Tokyo. So far, it's not clear what the government intends to do with the countless bags of contaminated dirt. Some critics, including experts on radiation, call the government's clean-up efforts ""meaningless"" and say that using high pressure hoses simply spreads the radiation. Others contend that wiping down a building with a wet rag is pointless, particularly when the wind blows from the nearby forest which is still contaminated. Iitate's Mayor, Norio Kanno, has heard those arguments but insists they have to start somewhere. ""We have a responsibility to clean up and decontaminate this land. I can't accept the idea that we give up. And it's hard for some people to just start a new life elsewhere,"" he says. Yukio Nakano remains hopeful that he and his wife can return to their home one day. ""But we don't know when that will happen. It's hard to predict our future,"" he says.","Japanes village evacuated after meltdown of rectors at Fukushima Daiichi power plant .

"(CNN) -- Two Georgia men have filed a lawsuit claiming that prominent Atlanta, Georgia, pastor Eddie Long coerced them into sex. The suits, filed Tuesday in DeKalb County, Georgia, allege that Long used his position as a spiritual authority and bishop to coerce young male members and employees of his New Birth Missionary Baptist Church into sex. A spokesman for Long told CNN on Wednesday that the allegations are ""a case of retaliation and a shakedown for money by men with some serious credibility issues."" Long ""categorically and adamantly denies these allegations,"" said spokesman Art Franklin. ""Defendant Long has a pattern and practice of singling out a select group of young male church members and using his authority as Bishop over them to ultimately bring them to a point of engaging in a sexual relationship,"" the suits allege. Long is considered one of the nation's top black preachers. His church has more 25,000 members, according to the suit, and was the site of Coretta Scott King's 2006 funeral, attended by then-President George W. Bush and three previous presidents. King was the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The pastor took one plaintiff, Anthony Flagg, 21, on overnight trips to a half-dozen American cities in recent years, Flagg's suit alleges. ""Long shared a bedroom and engaged in intimate sexual contact with plaintiff Flagg including kissing, massaging, masturbating of plaintiff Flagg by defendant Long and oral sexual contact,"" the suit says. Long took the other plaintiff, Maurice Murray Robinson, 20, to Auckland, New Zealand, in October 2008 for his 18th birthday and engaged in oral sex with him, Robinson's suit alleges. ""Following the New Zealand Trip, Defendant Long regularly engaged in sexual touching, and other sexual acts with Plaintiff Robinson,"" Robinson's suit alleges. ""It is very unfortunate that someone has taken this course of action,"" Franklin, Long's spokesman, said Tuesday. ""Our law firm will be able to respond once attorneys have had an opportunity to review the lawsuit."" Long frequently denounces homosexual behavior. A 2007 article in the Southern Poverty Law Center's magazine called him ""one of the most virulently homophobic black leaders in the religiously based anti-gay movement."" ""Everybody knows that a bishop or church pastor ... cannot have any sort of sexual relations or sexual relationship with one of your parishioners,"" the lawyer, B.J. Bernstein, said at a news conference Tuesday evening. ""And even worse to have it with two young men who trusted him and got to know him at a very young age."" Bernstein said she has alerted federal authorities about the allegations. In June, Robinson was arrested and charged with burglary in connection with a break-in to Long's office. An iPhone, iPad and other items -- more than $1,300 worth -- were taken from the office, according to the police report. On Tuesday, Bernstein said the theft was Robinson's attempt to retaliate against the pastor. She said that once Robinson began telling others about his experience with Long, ""he realized he wasn't the only one."" ""It made [Robinson] angry,"" she said. Both plaintiffs said the pastor, his church and church employees gave them cash and lavish gifts that ranged from cars to college tuition. The suits also said that Long framed the sexual relationships as religious in nature. The suits allege that Long chose the plaintiffs to be his ""Spiritual Sons,"" a program that allegedly includes other young men from the church. ""Spiritual Sons are taken on public and private jets to U.S. and international destinations, housed in luxury hotels and given access to numerous celebrities including entertainment stars and politicians,"" the suit alleges. Flagg moved into a home owned by another New Birth pastor when he was a high school junior, according to the suit, where Long would sometimes share a bed with him. Flagg was eventually put on the church's payroll, his suit alleges, with Long personally delivering his checks. Flagg's suit says that Long presided over a spiritual ""covenant"" ceremony between the two of them. ""It was essentially a marriage ceremony, with candles, exchange of jewelry, and biblical quotes,"" Bernstein said Tuesday. ""The bishop [told] him I will always have your back and you will always have mine."" Robinson's suit alleges that ""Defendant Long would use Holy Scripture to discuss and justify the intimate relationship between himself and Plaintiff Robinson."" The lawsuits are seeking unspecified amounts of punitive damages from Long on various counts, ranging from negligence to breach of fiduciary duty. The suits allege that various staff members working for Long, his church and the Longfellows Academy -- which the suit describes as an offshoot ministry of New Birth -- ""knew of Defendant Long's sexually inappropriate conduct and did nothing to warn or protect [the plaintiffs].""

"(CNN) -- Last month the Cambodian government announced their plans to build a dam on one of the Mekong River's most important tributaries, the 3-S River Basin, in 2014. This was declared just five days before the government of Laos held their ceremony to launch the construction of the controversial Xayaburi dam, the first dam to be built on the lower Mekong River. Conservation International along with other conservation groups working in the region are extremely concerned by this move and have requested a delay on this decision to allow time for research to better understand the trade-offs between power generation and the dam's impacts, and the opportunity to offer sustainable alternatives for Cambodia's economy. In Cambodia today only about 5% of infrastructure projects go through the Ministry of Environment's Environmental Impact Assessment process, and when they are completed, they often do not include detailed studies of the full range of environmental impacts. Such considerations are crucial for the Greater Mekong region's development pathway and will ensure that these countries are protecting yet utilizing their natural assets for the benefit of their people, their economy and the environment. The 3-S River Basin (Sekong, Sesan and SrePok Rivers), borders Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, and supports 20% of the Mekong River water flows, ensuring food and water security for millions of people living in the basin. It also contains some of the region's most unique and rare biodiversity including yellow cheeked gibbons and Asian arowana (dragon fish), among many other endangered and charismatic species. Principally our concern is for the people who rely on the water flows of the lower Mekong River for their food, health, income and other essential livelihood securities. This includes the people who live in the 3-S River Basin, the 1.1 million people that depend on the Tonle Sap and another 60 million people living on the Mekong Delta. Our economic concern is that dams on the Lower Mekong will likely reduce the productivity of the region's agriculture and aquaculture industries, particularly in Cambodia and Laos, and plunge them back into even more severe poverty then they currently suffer. A recent assessment of the 42 dams proposed for the river basin found that they are likely to produce substantial changes to the natural fluctuation in the seasonal flow. This would have severe impacts on the natural delivery of nutrients and other critical aspects that are required for agricultural and fisheries productivity. In Cambodia fish provide 85% of the population's protein needs and an essential source of fat. Right now the Cambodian per capita in-take of fats is the lowest in Southeast Asia and the most essential of these, the omega-3 fats which come from fish, are the least available. If there was a reduction in fish populations, nutrition and health will decline on a national scale and further deepen Cambodia's current situation of severe poverty. The biodiversity underpinning the ecosystem productivity and life that has thrived for thousands of years is in danger. Of all the various impacts on the horizon as a result of this development, the most serious is the potential for major changes to the migration patterns of fish. A recent environmental impact assessment of the Lower Sesan 2 dam concluded that the impacts on fish populations will be very severe. As approximately 66% of the Mekong fish species are migratory their passage will be blocked by the dam in its current design which will seriously reduce the reproduction rate and overall fish populations downstream will be reduced. If this traditional migration is hindered it could lead to a serious decline in fish reproduction which will unbalance the delicate food chain on which this ecosystem depends. This has already happened in other dam developments globally, due to lack of adequate planning and understanding of the dams effects. Before the construction of the Pak Moon dam in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand, the waterway contained over 250 species of fish. This plummeted over 80% when the dam began operation, and a decade later, through extensive government investment to restock the river, the species number is still less than half the original amount. More than 20,000 people have been affected by this loss of fish. This dam was anticipated to have a production capacity of 136 megawatts, but it can barely generate 20 megawatts during high-demand months. Conservation International support the development of electricity generation for domestic consumption and export as these are critical components of development for Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. We believe that the Greater Mekong region has the potential to become a world leader by pursuing an innovative, low carbon, green development pathway that will foster economic growth and create opportunities for its people, while conserving the natural environment. However, this region needs integrated hydro-power development and conservation planning so that the trade-offs between energy production and other ecosystem services, particularly those vital for the survival of the people that depend on them, are better understood before such dams are developed. A delay will allow for the delivery of decision support tools that can explain how different scenarios, such as variances in the dam location, design and operation will influence their impacts. Careful consideration must be made now of the potential impacts of this, and other dams being considered for the 3-S River Basin, to avoid serious losses and to form a positive solution for the people of the lower Mekong, their energy needs and the environment on which they depend.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- White supremacists, Islamic clerics, a controversial Kansas pastor and a U.S. talk show host are on a list of 22 people banned from Britain for ""stirring up hatred,"" the British government said Tuesday. Jacqui Smith said she did not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views. Britain's Home Office said it decided to exclude the 22 in the last several months. The decision follows measures introduced by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith last year against people ""who have engaged in spreading hate,"" the Home Office said. The Home Office named only 16 of those on the list; it said it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on why the Home Office would not publicly identify six of the 22. One of the most recognized names on the list may be U.S. radio talk show host Michael Savage, who is listed under his real name, Michael Alan Wiener. The conservative's daily show can be heard nationwide in the United States. Savage is on the list for ""seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence."" Savage lashed out at Smith on his Web site, calling her a ""witch"" and asking how she knew of his show when it isn't syndicated in England. He also questioned why six names on the list weren't released and why North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez didn't make the list. In an audio clip on his Web site, Savage said he had seven attorneys working on a defamation lawsuit against Smith and encouraged his listeners to call off any travel plans to England and boycott all British products. ""She has painted a target on my back, linking me with people who are in prison for killing people,"" he said. ""How could they put Michael Savage in the same league as mass murderers when I have never avowed violence?"" Outspoken Kansas Rev. Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for ""engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred."" Phelps and his followers at Westboro Baptist Church oppose homosexuality. They picket the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq, saying their deaths are God's way of punishing the United States for supporting homosexuals. They have expressed similar views about the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The church's slogan is ""God Hates Fags."" Phelps did not issue a response on his Web site. However, he linked to a British news story on the ban and wrote his own headline, calling Smith a ""neo-Nazi dyke"" and ""filthy God-hater."" Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Don Black, who has said he despises U.S. President Barack Obama, is also on the list. Black established the white supremacist Web site Stormfront, which the Home Office called one of the oldest and largest hate group sites. Eric Gliebe, chairman of the National Alliance, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the United States, is on the list for ""justifying terrorist violence, provoking others to commit serious crime and fostering racial hatred."" The Home Office cited Gliebe's ""Web-radio broadcasts in which he vilifies certain ethnic groups and encourages the download and distribution of provocative racist leaflets and posters."" Several Islamic clerics are also on the list, including Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal, Amir Siddique, Yunis Al Astal and Safwat Hijazi. Prolific speaker and writer Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim is also listed. The list includes Mike Guzofsky, the leader of a militant Jewish group. He has ties to Kahane Chai, a group that the U.S. State Department lists as a foreign terrorist organization. Russian skinheads Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky are also on the list. The Home Office says they are ""leaders of a violent gang that beat migrants and posted films of their attacks on the Internet."" Samir al Quntar, a Lebanese man who spent three decades in prison for killing four Israeli soldiers and a 4-year-old girl in 1979, is also on the list. In an exchange with the militant group Hezbollah, Israel freed al Quntar last year for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. Al Quntar is ""engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence"" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said. Nasr Javed and Abdul Ali Musa round out the 16 names made public. ""Coming to the UK is a privilege, and I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life,"" Smith said. ""Therefore, I do not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views, as I want them to know that they are not welcome here. ""The government opposes extremism in all its forms and I am determined to stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country,"" she said. ""This is the driving force behind tighter rules on exclusions for unacceptable behavior.""","NEW: Talk show host calls home secretary ""witch""; reverend calls her ""neo-Nazi""

"(CNN) -- Life is difficult. Death used to be simple. You simply died, and that was it. Now, in the modern era of high-tech medicine, death is difficult, too. The predicament facing Nelson Mandela, who has been critically ill for the past five weeks and turns 95 on Thursday, brings into sharp focus an important question that eventually affects all of us. How do we want to die? Mandela is one of the most influential and important people on Earth, but nothing about his situation is unique or special. Intensivists -- those doctors who specialize in intensive care patients -- will tell you that every day thousands of people all over the world are going through the same thing. Playing out the end game, many of them are stuck on a ventilator with a slim to vanishing chance of ever getting back to the life they knew and loved. Modern society is confronting a tragic, silent epidemic of frail elderly people who suffer needlessly at the end of life because of unwanted life support. These folks are effectively left to die a slow death connected to machines. As a critical care specialist who has seen this process play out many times, it can be agonizing to witness. How did we end up here? Why has death become so complicated? Modern medicine is powerful, but it is a double-edged sword. The way we can bring people back from the brink of death is truly amazing. There is nothing more satisfying professionally than having a grateful patent walk back into the ICU after surviving a near-death experience. But more often, for very old people, aggressive life support doesn't work out so well. Prolonged ICU care often gradually evolves into a checkmate situation. Intensivists know what it usually means when the condition of an elderly person hospitalized for weeks is described as ""critical but stable."" After weeks of aggressive support, the patient still cannot survive off the ventilator. When this happens, the muscles start to wither away from a condition called ICU-acquired myopathy. Little may seem to be happening, but as the body inevitably continues to weaken, a relentless series of secondary complications will ensue, such as pneumonia, delirium and failure of the circulatory system or kidneys. In most cases, patients need to be continuously sedated to minimize obvious pain and suffering. When do you stop? How do you stop? And who decides? These are the wrenching issues that confront the family. The fundamental question is this: When is it time to accept the inevitability of death, change the goal of care to comfort, and let the patient have peace? It used to be that doctors struggled with withdrawing life support, or wouldn't even consider it. At the height of the Jack Kevorkian era in the mid-1990s the chairman of our hospital ethics committee, a good friend and colleague, told me that withdrawing life support should always be difficult and make me uncomfortable. I couldn't have agreed less, but I didn't tell him. Thankfully over the years, his views and those of most physicians have changed. Unlike my generation, medical students are now trained in ethics and palliative care. More patients have advance directives and living wills. Every intensivist will tell you that withdrawing life support and helping someone ""make the transition"" with comfort and dignity is one of the most satisfying and useful things that they can do. But despite this progress, there is still a fundamental disconnect. The epidemic of futile support at the end-of-life persists. The major reason is a perfect storm created by the power of modern medical technology, our cultural emphasis on patient autonomy and the innate human tendency to deny and hide from the reality of death. Death is scary and makes us uncomfortable. Modern culture has insulated us from witnessing death. We are out of touch with the life cycle. We deny death. We also believe that the patient should call the shots and get the care he or she wants. But what happens when the patient can no longer express his or her wishes? Spouses, children and family are forced to make life-and-death decisions that they never volunteered to make, sometimes may not be equipped to make, or unrealistically assumed they would never have to make. But make no mistake: Unless death is sudden, one day you will need to decide when to allow someone you love to die, and someone will have to make that decision for you. Intensivists often hear this: ""I know my dad wouldn't want this, but I just can't bring myself to do it."" Advance directives or a living will do not necessarily mean you will get the end-of-life care that you want. This is because withdrawing life support depends on your decision-makers, usually your loved ones, understanding and believing that you are past the point of no return. It depends on accepting death. Mandela fought for freedom all of his life, and the world does not want to lose him. Now all we can hope for is that he is comfortable, and getting the care that he would want. If and when the day comes that he has fought long enough, it will be OK to let him be free. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephan A. Mayer.","Stephan Mayer: Critically ill for five weeks, Mandela makes us think of how we want to die .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Nestled among the granite peaks of eastern Hong Kong a new, man-made mountain is emerging. It's the Tseung Kwan O landfill, a growing hillside of garbage that stretches over 50 hectares and will be up to 100 meters high when the site is full. Like Hong Kong's three other main landfills, it is filling up fast. The city of seven million people is set to run out of space for its trash by 2018, with the Tseung Kwan O site set to be topped up by 2015. While plans to expand some sites are being proposed and a controversial mega-incinerator project remains a possibility, focus in the city is turning to how to reduce the amount of waste it produces. Infographic: From farm to fork to landfill . One of the largest sources of trash in the city is food waste. According to Friends of the Earth, up to 40% of food in the city goes uneaten, creating around 3,500 tons of unwanted food each day, most of which ends up as landfill. The local government has created a task-force to address the issue of food waste and set a 10% reduction target by 2016. Globally, only around 3% of food waste is recycled. A ""Save Food"" campaign run by local NGO Greeners Action and partnering with local Hong Kong restaurants has been running since 2009, but more practical ways to recycle unwanted food are also being explored. One is using biotechnology to turn binned food into useful products. Carol Lin is an assistant professor at City University of Hong Kong who is developing a process that turns bread products into succinic acid, a compound that can be used to create bioplastics and eco-friendly detergents. Read more: Entrepreneurs see opportunity in trash cans . Partnering with a local Starbucks and an environmental group -- and with government backing until August -- she hopes to secure funding for a scaled-up working pilot operation that can process up to a ton of food waste. ""We do have food waste collection companies in Hong Kong that are really interested to try and upscale this process. I think this is an innovative solution for trying to use biorefinery to tackle food waste in Hong Kong to produce value added products,"" she said. For local designer C.L. Lam, turning food waste into desirable products is already a viable business. From bags to brushes, his company Green & Associates make over 60 household items using up to 50% of food waste, like apple pulp, coffee grounds and milk, together with conventional materials. Read more: Making the most from food waste . Unfortunately for Hong Kong's mountains of trash, Lam has based his factory across the border in mainland China, citing cheaper manufacturing and transport costs, re-using its food waste, rather than his home city's. Ultimately both Lam and Lin are honest when it comes to addressing the real problem: reducing food waste in the first place. ""Hong Kong people like to eat different types of food, but at the same time they generate serious issues that haven't been solved properly,"" said Lin. ""Really, reducing the amount of food that we try to buy that would be another good solution to solve this food waste issue.""","Around 3,500 tons of food waste is produced each day in Hong Kong .

"Washington (CNN) -- Military victims of the Fort Hood massacre will be eligible to receive the Purple Heart if Congress passes a bill introduced Tuesday. Nonmilitary victims could receive the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Defense of Freedom, the civilian equivalent of the Purple Heart. Both military and civilian personnel killed or wounded in the November 5 attack would be granted the same legal status as combatant casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq. The bill was introduced by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who represents the district that includes Fort Hood Army Post in the House of Representatives. ""As far as I'm concerned, this was an attack by an enemy upon American troops on American soil,"" Carter said Tuesday at a Capitol Hill news conference. The bill ""is about giving soldiers the benefits that other soldiers get when they are unfortunate enough to be killed or wounded in a combat zone."" Granting combatant status also would guarantee that beneficiaries of military service members killed in the attack can receive the maximum life insurance benefit, according to Carter's office. Authorities say Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army psychiatrist, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood on November 5, killing 13 people. Dozens of others were wounded. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder, charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. In the wake of the shootings, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are expected to order a sweeping look of how the U.S. military can spot and deal with potential problems ranging from behavioral issues to security, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Two other Pentagon officials confirmed a plan is being formulated for a review, but final details of the investigation's focus remain to be worked out. It's not clear who would conduct the Pentagon review. Officials said one possibility is that retired high-ranking officers would be asked to take charge of a panel of outside experts and perhaps military and civilian authorities. The Army has already begun its own service-wide review, collecting information to begin a ""hard look"" at how to avoid incidents like Fort Hood, according to Gen. Peter Chiarelli, Army vice chief of staff. The Purple Heart is bestowed upon a service member or U.S. civilian serving under the military's authority who ""has been wounded, killed, or who has died or may hereafter die of wounds received"" while in action against an enemy or in a terrorist attack, according to the Pentagon's Manual of Military Awards. It was created by Gen. George Washington in 1782, who then called it the ""Badge of Military Merit,"" the manual says. It was not used after the Revolutionary War, however, until it was revived in 1932, after Washington's order establishing the award was discovered among his papers, according to the Web site of the Military Order of the Purple Heart. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Texas congressman to introduce bill to grant Purple Hearts for Fort Hood victims .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two rival Shiite leaders signed an agreement Saturday to end months of rancor and fighting between the two powerful movements they command, a representative of one of the men said. Muqtada al-Sadr, left, and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim have agreed to promote peace between their rival movements. Muqtada al-Sadr, the populist Shiite cleric, and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the head of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, forged the agreement in the spirit of the current Muslim holy month of Ramadan, said SICI spokesman Haytham al-Husseini. Gestures of forgiveness and mercy are often made during Ramadan. The deal has three main points: stopping the fighting between Iraqis, urging print and electronic media to engender a spirit of friendship and forgiveness, and establishing commissions in each of Iraq's 18 provinces to oversee the peace initiative. Al-Husseini said al-Sadr, who recently returned to Iraq from Iran, signed the agreement in Najaf, the Shiite holy city in the south, and al-Hakim signed it in Iran. The men head movements that are in the middle of a power struggle in Shiite regions across Iraq, particularly in the south. Al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and SICI's Badr Organization militia have squared off in recent months, with Mehdi gunmen many times fighting police who are aligned with the Badr group. Clashes between those groups during a recent pilgrimage in the Shiite holy city of Karbala sparked all-out fighting in that city, Baghdad and Babil province. That fighting, in August, left dozens dead and caused al-Sadr to suspend his militia for six months for restructuring. Meanwhile on Saturday, the U.S. military countered media reports that civilians were among 25 people killed during fighting near Baquba early Friday. The military, underscoring its earlier account of the incident, said it was targeting a Shiite militant believed to be associated with members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force, the entity accused by the United States of providing arms and training to insurgents in Iraq. Troops came under heavy fire in a village in Diyala province, which extends north and east of Baghdad and borders Iran, and a battle ensued, the military said. The military said air power was called in to support ground troops and the strike killed 25 people. But, the military says, they weren't civilians. ""In this instance, we have confirmed that the 25 criminals who were killed were responsible for the attack on our forces and in fact were members of an extremist group operating in the Baquba region,"" the military said. Iraqi authorities told CNN on Friday that the airstrike in the village, a Shiite community, killed and wounded civilians, including women and children. In raids on Saturday, coalition forces killed six insurgents and detained 18, the U.S. military said. The raids, targeting the Sunni-dominated al Qaeda in Iraq, were conducted in the Baghdad area, in Kirkuk, and near Samarra. ""We're on the offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq and the foreign terrorists who help them,"" said Maj. Winfield Danielson, Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokesman. A roadside bomb in southern Baghdad on Saturday killed a U.S. soldier and wounded three others, the U.S. military said. This brings the number of U.S. military deaths to seven in October and 3,808 since the beginning of the Iraq war. Seven civilian contractors for the Defense Department also have been killed.

"(CNN) -- The Pitcairn Islands might only have 55 human inhabitants, but the waters surrounding them are teeming with marine life. A new study by the Pew Environment Group in partnership with the National Geographic Society has revealed the glorious extent of the biodiversity in this remote corner of the South Pacific. A team of scientists led by marine ecologist Enric Sala completed more than 450 dives at 97 locations earlier this year as well as lowering cameras down to depths of 1,600 meters in a further 17 spots. Along with more than 250 species of fish, 70 species of coral and more than 60 varieties of algae were observed around the four islands (Pitcairn, Henderson, Oeno and Ducie) that make up the British Overseas Territory. To date, nearly 1,250 marine species (including seabirds) have been found in the area, but scientists believe many more remain undiscovered. Read: Project to turn desert green trials in Qatar . Given its ""unique and pristine"" environment, the expedition report recommends turning the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) -- an area extending 200 nautical miles from a territory's coast -- around Pitcairn into a ""no-take"" marine reserve. ""There are only a handful of EEZs of the world that remain pristine occupying less than 5% of the ocean,"" the report says. ""These places allow us to know what the ocean was like before heavy human impacts ... and most important, to set proper conservation and management goals for our oceans."" Should the UK government back the plan, the reserve would become the largest of its kind in the world, covering an area of more than 800,000 square kilometers (300,000 square miles), according to the Pew Environment Group. The proposals have received the enthusiastic backing of the Pitcairn islanders, whose tiny population includes a direct descendant of Fletcher Christian -- leader of the mutineers on HMS Bounty who settled on the island in 1790. Read: What is the natural world worth? A National Geographic documentary about the expedition -- ""Pitcairn: The Real Bounty Revealed"" -- recently premiered at the headquarters of the UK's Royal Society in London. Speaking at the event, Pew Environment Group managing director, Josh Reichert said that until recently it was widely believed that the oceans were too vast and abundant to be impacted by humans. ""We now know this is not true. Unless we change our relationship with the sea, we will inevitably bear witness to its collapse,"" Reichert said.","Survey of Pitcairn Islands marine environment revealed a rich biodiversity of fish, coral and algae .

"(CNN) -- In a region known for its towering skyscrapers, the erection of a modestly-sized greenhouse might not appear worthy of much attention. But this small construction site near the coast in Qatar's Mesaieed Industrial City could help transform the landscape forever, says its developers, turning desert land into flourishing centers of food and freshwater production. The $5.3 million, one-hectare pilot plant opens later this month and is a major milestone of the Sahara Forest Project (SFP) -- a concept that has been developed by a Norwegian company since 2008. The facility -- built in partnership with fertilizer companies Yara International and Qafco -- will feature a range of green technologies including concentrated solar power (CSP), photovoltaic panels and a saltwater-cooled greenhouse that mimics the hydrological cycle. Michael Pawlyn, a British architect specializing in sustainable design and founding member of the project, says bringing together clusters of synergistic technologies creates a new paradigm. ""At the start of the project, we were very conscious that a lot of people proposed single solutions addressing one issue at a time, be it water shortage, desertification, climate change. We were very keen to develop integrated solutions that address multiple challenges simultaneously,"" Pawlyn said. Infographic: the price of nature . ""If you compare man-made systems with eco-systems there are some quite striking differences. We tend to create simple, disconnected, linear systems. Ecosystems are complex, interconnected and interdependent."" This interconnectedness is in evidence throughout the plant's design. Electricity from CSP helps power pumps bringing seawater to the site where it is used to condition air inside the greenhouse. The effect is achieved by trickling seawater over porous cardboard screens -- called evaporators -- which cool and humidify the dry desert air, creating a favorable growing environment for crops. Some of the evaporated seawater inside the greenhouse also condenses creating freshwater, which will be used to irrigate plants. Any saltwater that can't be evaporated is put to use elsewhere, says Pawlyn. ""The saltwater going out of the greenhouses will go to the CSP to cool it -- which makes it more efficient -- and then it will go to the evaporator 'hedges' which create good growing conditions for crops outside and revegetate areas of desert,"" he said. The remainder will end up in salt ponds where various compounds -- sodium chloride, gypsum, calcium carbonate -- can be extracted and potentially commercialized. The opening of the pilot plant is scheduled to coincide with the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference (COP18) which this year takes place in Doha from November 26 to December 7. It was three years ago at the U.N.'s COP15 conference in Copenhagen that the SFP presented their first feasibility study to the world. It was one of the high points at talks which were widely viewed to have failed and has continued to gain the enthusiastic backing of environmental and political leaders. Olav Kjorven, assistant secretary-general of the U.N. Development Program has called it ""a gold standard,"" while Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani believes the project could help improve food security in the Middle East. ""I think this will not be important only to Qatar, but to the whole region and elsewhere where they have the same climate as Qatar,"" Al Thani said in a statement. The plant will be open long after U.N. delegates have left town operating for at least a year, possibly two, Pawlyn says, so that all the systems can be thoroughly assessed and optimized. Larger projects look likely to follow the plant in Qatar with a 200-hectare site in Jordan slated for development. Pawlyn believes this is only the start, with certain areas of the world particularly well-suited to the project.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday to allow same-sex couples to marry in California, starting on August 18, handing another victory to supporters of gay rights in a case that both sides have said is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage last week, ruling that voter-approved Proposition 8 violates the U.S. Constitution. Walker had issued a temporary stay on his decision, which on Thursday he said he would lift. The high-profile case is being watched closely by supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage, as many say it is likely to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. If it does, the case could result in a landmark decision on whether people in the United States are allowed to marry others of the same sex. Same-sex marriage is legal in five U.S. states and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. The five states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire. Same-sex couples in California were permitted to marry, briefly, before Proposition 8 passed in 2008. ""Today's ruling means that in less than one week, equality under the law will be restored for millions of loving families across California,"" said Rick Jacobs, founder of the Courage Campaign. Dozens of same-sex couples gathered outside City Hall in San Francisco ahead of Walker's decision, hoping they would be allowed to marry. Many waved rainbow flags and carried signs that read: "" 'I DO' support the freedom to marry."" The crowd erupted in cheers after the judge's decision, though couples there must now wait at least another week or so to get married. Proposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests over the controversial issue of same-sex marriage. Proposition 8 defines marriage as a union between a man and woman and passed in California with some 52 percent of the vote in November 2008. Opponents of same-sex marriage have said their best bet lies with higher courts and have appealed the federal judge's ruling. The case heads next to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before possibly going to the U.S. Supreme Court. By allowing his stay to remain in place until August 18, Walker gave supporters of Proposition 8 more time for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in on the case. The appeals court could allow same-sex marriages to move forward, or it could put them on hold indefinitely as the case winds its way through the legal system. ""Judge Walker is in fact making victims out of these people who might now go get married and then not know what the status of their relationship is,"" said Tom McClusky, a leader of the legislative arm of the Family Research Council, which does not support same-sex marriage. People in the United States are split over the idea of allowing same-sex couples to marry. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they think gay and lesbian couples have the constitutional right to marry and to have their marriages recognized by law, while 51 percent said those rights do not exist, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll.","NEW: Appeals court is next in line to weigh in on the controversial case .

"(CNN) -- My sixth grader has a secret life online. It wasn't so secret about a week ago when I discovered his public profile on Instagram, where he was posting dramatic photos and soulful ""Versagrams"" (graphical text messages), for all the world to see. One moment he was in love, the next full of despair. I was stunned. My 11-year-old son has never let on that he is remotely interested in girls. Not a word. And he's not exactly the middle school kid with swagger. He's a relatively shy guy. Yet, his Instagram avatar was boldly flirting with a girl, prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends, but also from a far-flung social network of kids from Connecticut to New Jersey who I am certain he's never met in person. His phone was beeping nonstop for three days, with a stream of frenzied text messages and Instagram posts. Something big was going on. My son wanted to ask a girl out. Did she like him, too? He wasn't sure, but from what I saw online, this was hardly confidential information. His plan for asking her out was getting circulated in cyberspace and he had several kids weighing in on both the strategy and his likelihood for success. He was fully exposed on multiple virtual platforms, and that was terrifying to me. He clearly didn't understand the full impact of online activity. What should I do? Young people and social media: Docs examine pitfalls . When my son was sleeping, I was checking the text messages and followed the Instagram updates -- after all, this wasn't really sneaking if my son maintained a public profile. But what could I say? Should I tell him that I am monitoring his moves? Was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary? Was I violating my son's privacy and simply making too much of this? My husband told me to back off, that our son was merely a kid with a crush who needed to experience this rite of passage on his own, without a hovering mother. But I wasn't so sure. Like many parents, I am struggling with the boundaries of monitoring my kids' online activities. Is it an invasion of our children's privacy to intercept or check their text messages, or have the rules changed for parents because of the pure power and danger of technology? Am I justified in cyberstalking my own son? A first crush is hard enough, but I am trying to protect him from the embarrassment that can come from exposing this personal experience online. Adults know that a careless e-mail, text message, tweet or photo posting can cost someone not only their reputation, but also their career. The scandal over former CIA Director David Petraeus' extramarital affair apparently started with an e-mail breach. If the CIA director can get sloppy with personal e-mails, how can we trust a kid to handle these tools any better? How to raise a winning child . Experts say that it's important for parents to proactively monitor their kids' online behavior. ""It's snooping only if we don't tell them we're doing it,"" said Scott Steinberg the author of the best-selling ""Modern Parent's Guide"" series. ""You need to have the discussion up front about why you are there and why you are monitoring their online activity. Passively knowing that a parent is present can alter kids' behavior online. Parents won't intrude on their kids' experience if they do it in a way that's upfront and straightforward."" Parenting in a post-Facebook era where a new, must-have, social media app is churned out every two minutes makes monitoring exhausting, if not impossible. But while I believe my son knows not to communicate with ""strangers,"" the way he's exposing his life in cyberspace is making me tense. But he's hardly alone. The photos and messages that his fellow tween friends post on Instagram alternate between silly and provocative. Maybe it's the digital photo-filters, but the girls seem sexy beyond their years. While it's our duty as parents to teach our kids responsibility with technology, how much can we interfere with their freedom of expression? Steinberg says it's important that parents are educated about what's out there and are on top of their kids' online behavior without getting totally crazy. He says that parents can't just hand their kids digital devices and expect that they understand netiquette. But at the same time, parents need to respect boundaries. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons . ""Just because you can see what's online doesn't mean that you should obsess over it and micromanage every text message,"" Steinberg said. ""There are boundaries for parents as well. And at the end of the day, you don't want to become paranoid. You really just want to open an honest dialogue and positive computing. You can't put your kid on a leash, virtual or otherwise."" After agonizing for a few nights over how to handle it all, I told my son that he needed to change his settings to private so pedophiles and other ""creepy people"" can't follow his posts. He's a clever kid and understood that I was on to him. It was an unspoken acknowledgment that I had seen what he was putting out there. So he's gone private. The settings are locked. I asked if I could follow him on Instagram and he immediately said no. Steinberg would say that parents need to ""friend"" their kids or follow them online. But what if they refuse? It's well known that kids can be stealth and may ""friend"" their parents on one site or app, but post on another. Parents can pull the plug on the technology perhaps for a little while, or you can sneak a peak at their phones and devices, like I do regularly now, without any guilt. Like CNN Living on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- It is a side of Mitt Romney the public often does not see -- opening up about his faith, devotion to his family and his work as a Mormon overseas missionary and later church leader at home. In a rare discussion of these topics, he described to CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger his 2Â½ years as a teenager serving as a church missionary in France. He said that period helped ""ground my relationship with God"" and cement his beliefs. When Romney sat down with Borger this summer for CNN's documentary ""Romney Revealed: Family, Faith and the Road to Power,"" it was while he was campaigning and fundraising in Indiana -- and just a day before he secretly met with Rep. Paul Ryan to offer him the No.2 slot on the Republican ticket. 8 ways faith will matter at the RNC . While it might be expected Romney would be guarded and on message as he is usually is on the campaign trail, he was candid on a range of topics -- from his private life to religion to his wife -- areas he rarely has talked about. As he prepares to accept his party's nomination for president, Romney and his team are trying to show the voting public a more personal side of the candidate. On a mission in France . Describing his mission in France, he talked about how he would walk the streets of Bordeaux up to 60 hours a week trying to convince people why they should convert -- in French. Often he would have doors slammed in his face. The shaping of Romney's faith . ""When you're off in a foreign place and you only talk to your parents once or twice a year by phone -- that's all that's allowed -- and you're out speaking to people day in and day out about your faith and your religion and differences between your faith and other faiths... you say, 'OK, what's important here? What do I believe? What's truth? Is there a God? Is Jesus Christ the son of God?'"" he told Borger. My Take: Romney should take reporters to church more often . ""These are questions that are no longer academic. They're critical because you're talking about that day in and day out. And so I read scripture with much more interest and concern and sought to draw closer to God through my own prayer. And these things drew me closer to the eternal and convinced me that in fact there is a God. Jesus Christ is the son of God and my savior, and these are things that continue to be important in my life, of course."" Left for dead . What many people don't know is that during this time he was involved in a car accident as he was driving the mission president and his wife during a six-hour ride between Paris and the south of France. Their car was hit by what was believed to be a drunken driver. The mission president had to return to the United States because of his injuries, and his wife was killed. Initially Romney was pronounced dead. He told CNN this was a time of ""challenge and soul searching."" ""The person sitting next to me died, and others were severely injured. My injuries were not as severe as some might have thought. The policeman on the scene apparently thought I was in worse condition than I was and wrote, in French, 'he is dead' on my passport to distinguish me from others. That made it back to the United States in a press report that I had been killed in an accident. My parents heard it through the media, as did Ann,"" he said in the interview. TIME talks to Romney about business, budgets and beliefs . Romney, who was the president's assistant, was left to help lead the mission, and under his watch the number of converts went up. Back in Boston . After he and Ann were married and they later settled in Boston, Romney became a church leader there. He would serve as head of the Belmont, Massachusetts, congregation and his duties included not only leading the service but also counseling people, comforting the sick and arranging financial help for those in need. ""It's an unusual part of my faith in that we don't have a full-time ministry. There's no one paid to be the pastor and conduct services on Sunday and really no one who is full-time with the church to care for the sick and visit the poor. And so the church comes and says, 'We'd like you to do that, Mitt.' And so for about 10 years I took responsibility for the congregation or a group of congregations, and in that regard I was like the pastor."" This work and his later job of leading all of the Boston congregations will likely be highlighted during the Republican convention this week, in an attempt to show a more personal side of the nominee-to-be. ""Talk about a growing-up experience and a learning experience. You try your very best to align yourself with the Almighty and what God might say, and of course you look to get direction from the church as well,"" he told Borger. Romney and the role of women . His tenure was not without controversy. Some women in the congregation have complained he did not do enough to give women a more prominent role in church activities. He said he worked hard to make the church inclusive. Leading progressive group attacks Romney over women's issues . He also described Ann's diagnosis, in 1998, of multiple sclerosis, a disease that can shut down the nervous system. Family members and friends said that was a moment that rocked the family because Ann was known as the stabilizer of the family. He talked about the time when the couple went to the neurologist after Ann started having serious problems -- not knowing if the cause would be fatal. ""It was very clear that she was flunking the examination. She couldn't stand on her right foot without falling over and things like that. (The doctor) stepped out and she began to cry and I welled up tears as well and we hugged each other, and she said, ""Something is terribly wrong,"" and I said, ""Yes, but Ann, we can go through anything so long as it's not fatal."" ""For me, I love Ann,"" he continued, ""not because she can cook and not because she can fix things around the house. I love Ann because of who she is. And for me, as long as she was able to be alive, our life would be fine."" So with one of the couple's five sons still at home, Romney started doing the household chores, picking up food at the grocery store and doing whatever was necessary. ""She battled through it. She got good help from wonderful physicians and over the course of all the care she got she was able to stop the disease in its tracks. It's relapsing and remitting in her case. It's stopped and she's been pretty solid ever since. But whether it has or not, just having her around makes my life complete."" In a separate and emotional wide-ranging interview, Ann Romney described to Borger how the illness completely frightened her and how supportive her husband was. ""Even when I was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me,"" she said. ""It was like he was gonna do anything he could do just to say I'm here. You're OK. Just stay right there, and we'll be OK.""","Mitt Romney's missionary service in France as a teenager changed his life .

"(CNN) -- ""I hope you have a boy."" These were the words of a well-wisher to Queen Elizabeth II (then Princess Elizabeth) and Prince Philip on the eve of the birth of their first child in 1948. Prospects look considerably brighter for royal girls in 2013. Over the past few weeks, as the craze surrounding the birth of the Duke and Duchess's first-born has reached fever pitch, there's been very little fantasizing of princes per se. If anything, the pendulum now seems to have swung the other way. Perusing the web, I've been struck by how many comments indicate a popular preference for a girl. To quote one particularly enthusiastic respondent to a recent article on the royal birth, ""I'm personally wishing it to be a girl for the good of the entire human race and the sustainability of the planet."" Why the shift in sentiment? In part, the enthusiasm for royal daughters can be attributed to the passage of the Succession to the Crown Act, which became law in late April 2013. The act, greenlighted to save the British government from the embarrassment of denying the throne to William and Kate's first-born -- should that first-born be a girl -- erases the male preference in royal succession. The change in law means that the new royal baby, regardless of its sex, will be third in line to the throne. Thus, the refreshing banality of Kate's recent statement that, ""I'd like to have a boy -- and William would like a girl!"" From a constitutional perspective, the sex of the child no longer makes a difference. There's another reason for the eagerness, at least in some quarters, for a female heir. The very uncontroversial nature of the passage of the Succession to the Crown Act reflects a particular historical reality in Britain. Male preference aside, women have worn the crown there for most of the past two centuries. Queen Victoria reigned for almost 64 years; Queen Elizabeth II has already clocked in 61. That's a lot of time to get accustomed to female sovereigns. And not just accustomed to them, but extremely fond of them in the process. While Victoria's reign (1837-1901) was regarded as an ""accident"" until the very end, it was an ""accident"" that most Britons came to consider a very happy one. As the muckraking journalist William Thomas Stead proclaimed in 1897, the year of Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, ""England indeed has been fortunate in her Queens."" So confident was Stead in queens' abilities to lead the British nation that he would go on to note that, ""Many a time and oft has the idea recurred in these later years whether by some inversion of the Salic law our dynastic line could be made to pass only through female sovereigns. This being past praying for, we shall do well to make the most of our good Queens when we have them."" Surely there was something overly compensatory about Stead's remarks. Queen's reigns, under the terms of the old succession laws, were always understood to some extent as aberrational. As Victoria herself once confided to her prime minister, William Gladstone, ""The queen is a woman herself and knows what an anomaly her own position is."" Yet the ""anomalousness"" of female sovereigns was far more of a problem in the early modern period than in the modern time. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Britain emerged as a constitutional monarchy, with the king -- or queen -- taking on an increasingly ceremonial or ""dignified"" function. Women have shone in this role (both on and off the throne), helping to transform the monarchy into an institution intimately connected with cultural diplomacy, middle-class morality, family life and charity work. (Queen Elizabeth is currently involved with more than 600 different charities.) Historians often describe this as a ""feminization"" process. Whatever it is, it's a role to which women, for a wide range of reasons, are more habituated to playing. The real question we should be asking, then, in the days leading up to the royal birth, is not 'boy or girl?' It's whether we would have the same levels of enthusiasm, or at least complacency, regarding a female heir, if that heir were to inherit a position that had significant executive, legislative or judicial powers. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Arianne Chernock.","Arianne Chernock: Popular opinion prefers that Prince William and Kate have a girl .

"(CNN) -- Every Friday morning 17-year-old Sarel Ramphele puts on his gold-trimmed suit, grabs his trumpet and walks the 6 kilometers from his home in Blood River to the neighboring village. Under a makeshift iron roof in the yard of an unused house he meets with scores of other young people to rehearse for what has become an improbable musical success story in one of South Africa's poorest regions. Based in Limpopo, a rural region whose lifeblood is its eponymous river, Bezzi's Youth Brass Band is one local woman's answer to a distinct lack of youth engagement in the area. ""There are absolutely no entertainment facilities for young people around here,"" says Janet Bezuidenhout, 42, who set up the band just under three years ago. ""The teenagers are just idling around."" Ramphele joined the band when he was just 14 and last year was appointed lead trumpet player. He relishes having something to work towards. ""I used to spend a lot of time on the streets doing nothing. The band keeps my mind fresh and helps me develop,"" he says. Read more: Beethoven in the Congo: Kinshasa's classical orchestra . It was Bezuidenhout's music-loving nephew Rondo who inspired her to start the group. He was looking to join a local band but there was no such thing. As a former drum majorette at school, she shared his passion and decided to buy 10 instruments with her pension fund so he could set up his own group. When Rondo called the first meeting at his late grandfather's empty house in Makgofe village, he would have been delighted to see even one person turn up. But young people in the neighboring towns had caught wind of the new band and that morning there was a group of 30 boys and girls crowding around the yard. Moved by the youngsters' new-found zest, Bezuidenhout was reluctant to send anyone home. ""I heard them playing and it touched me. It touched me so much to see these kids so excited."" Aware of the potential of her project but unable to finance it she applied to a government tender scheme that allows small businesses or individuals to bid for one-off jobs with public bodies, such as cleaning or construction contracts. Bezuidenhout, a retired administrator, won her bid and spent a month installing cabinets in a nearby hospital for a lump sum of 20,000 rand ($2,170). With that money, Bezuidenhout upped her inventory of instruments and bought suits, skirts and blouses for the band. She modifies the uniforms at home with gold thread trimmings and a badge with the group's name. Today, the band has 60 trained members who share 16 trombones, six side drums, four tubas and a bass drum. Read more: Oliver 'Tuku' Mtukudzi -- healing Zimbabwe through music . Training is run by four ""band leaders"" who are slightly older and able to show the younger members how to play. One of them is 26-year-old Nokie Nthoke who got involved so that he could ""get off the streets and stay out of trouble."" Limpopo is plagued by high crime rates and unemployment. ""After 7 or 8 o'clock at night it is difficult to walk around,"" says Bezuidenhout. ""Men lurking on the streets will stab you and take everything in your possession."" With little opportunity for development, Bezuidenhout says it's not unusual for boys as young as 13 to join gangs in the area. But in recent years, a handful have gone from gang member to band member and mellowed under Bezuidenhout's's no-nonsense guidance. If a member misbehaves, even outside the confines of rehearsals, a meeting will be called and Bezuidenhout and a handful of members will quiz the culprit on their actions and agree on an appropriate punishment. ""There is a lot of respect between comrades,"" she says. Both Ramphele and Nthoke speak of the importance of their band's community and count their large pool of friends as one of the best things about being a member. But the popularity of the band is becoming a problem -- Bezuidenhout has a waiting list of 30 under 15-year-olds who at the moment cannot be catered for. Ultimately, she would like 100 in her troop but without donations the future of Bezzi's Youth is uncertain. ""Some of the instruments are broken, the uniforms are getting old and affording transport, even to local events, is a problem,"" she says. Read more: Afrobeats -- the new sound of West Africa that's going global . The band and its unique take on gospel songs have become a favorite for local events such as weddings and the unveiling of tombstones, but paying for the bus trip to the performance is not always possible. ""It's very painful for me"" says Bezuidenhout. ""I cannot tell them that it has to stop because we have no money. Even when there's no rehearsal they'll be there. I'll send 60 messages telling them not to come because it is pouring with rain, but some of them will still turn up."" Many of the band members walk from villages as far as 12 kilometers away just to practice. Despite financial barriers Bezuidenhout remains a source of hope for her young musicians, who share her dream of playing beyond Limpopo. She says: ""I want us to march the main street in Cape Town at Christmas or Easter time when thousands of people line the streets to watch the parades.""

"(CNN) -- The 19 ""hotshot"" firefighters killed in Arizona on June 30 were trained to get close to a blaze, dig barriers and clear out the brush that otherwise would fuel it. But a sudden shift in the Yarnell Hill Fire's direction trapped the group. The deaths are under investigation, but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under blankets meant to protect against flames and heat as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them. Just one member of the elite 20-man wildfire-fighting crew survived. It was the deadliest day for U.S. firefighters since the 9/11 attacks. Now the firefighters' families -- many with small children -- must figure out how to cope, as they mourn their losses. There are organizations that assist the families of lost firefighters, and several are already mobilized for the families of the Prescott, Arizona-based crew. Ronald Siarnicki is the executive director of one such group, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. ""In general, needs end up being the same for fallen firefighters, no matter where it is in the country. The immediate needs are going to be some financial support to help them deal with costs associated with the death. Oftentimes the firefighter is the main breadwinner in the household, so you've got to worry about food on the table, shoes for the kids and those kinds of things,"" Siarnicki says. The foundation also helps with the necessary paperwork for each family as well as providing emotional support. ""We use survivors from other line-of-duty death incidents to be in our survivor support network, and we kind of match survivors up from previous events with the new families, so they have somebody to talk to. Sometimes they just need somebody who understands what they're going through,"" explains Siarnicki, who was a firefighter in Prince George's County, Maryland, for 24 years. Siarnicki's group also helps the children of fallen firefighters cope with their loss, because they often don't understand the spotlight such an event puts them under. There are also long-term needs for the entire family to help rebuild their lives. The foundation holds conferences to teach life skills and financial planning. Siarnicki says the 19 firefighters lost in Arizona were a special breed -- like many others who choose to be firefighters. ""The fire service is a very dangerous profession, whether you're career or volunteer, wildlands or industrial or even military firefighters. We understand the risks to being a firefighter and we accept those. And we try to do everything humanly possible to prevent tragic occurrences, but unfortunately they do occur. And so our families kind of know that."" ""And so there is a bonding effect within the fire service,"" Siarnicki continues. ""There is that fire service family. And I think the uniqueness of that is we function as a team. A fire crew, you know, they live together, sleep together, eat together, laugh together, go home to their families, but when they're at work, there's a secondary family. And both of those have very special unique bonds."" Additional groups also offering support to the families of the Prescott hotshots are: . Prescott Firefighter's Charities . 100 Club of Arizona . Wildland Firefighter Foundation .","The memorial service for 19 firefighters who died in Arizona is on July 9 .

"(CNN) -- A man who evaded the law for 34 years was sentenced to 36 to 40 years in prison Thursday for raping three women in Massachusetts in 1978. Gary Irving, 52, learned his fate in Norfolk Superior Court, the same court that convicted him more than three decades ago. Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey expressed remorse to the women Irving raped and apologized for the long wait for justice. ""I am sorry that so much strength and perseverance was asked of you. That the courage and resolve you showed testifying in 1979 resulted in decades of continuing injustice. Today does not erase that injustice, but does end it,"" he said after Irving's sentencing. Irving will serve two consecutive 18- to 20-year sentences with a 7- to 10-year concurrent sentence on kidnapping charges. He will also serve 20 years' probation for all other charges, said Norfolk district attorney's office spokesman David Traub in an e-mail to CNN. ""We felt that the calculated brutality of these crimes, the repeated nature of these attacks, warranted a very long prison term. We are pleased that the court has now ordered a long prison term,"" Morrissey said in a statement. In 1979, Irving was convicted of three counts of rape with force, unnatural acts and kidnapping, Massachusetts State Police said. In one incident, Irving knocked the victim off her bike and took her to a secluded area, where he repeatedly raped her. During another attack, Irving threatened a victim with a knife if she did not comply with his sexual demands. A 12-member jury found him guilty on all counts. The judge -- new to the job -- offered him a weekend to put his affairs in order before reporting to jail. Irving never returned. Instead, he fled Massachusetts and landed on the state's Most Wanted list, where he remained for 34 years. After he fled, Irving's profile was featured on the TV shows ""America's Most Wanted,"" ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""Real Stories of the Highway Patrol,"" according to the Most Wanted poster. Police found Irving at his Gorham, Maine, home in March, where he had been living under the name Gregg Irving, the name of his younger brother, said Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio in a statement. Police would not divulge what led authorities to Irving. Records show he had lived there since 2002 and perhaps since the mid-1980s, police said. Confirmation of his identity was made via a scar on his chest from heart surgery he underwent as a child and a fingerprint match, police said. CNN's requests for comment from Irving's attorneys were not immediately returned. CNN's Tom Watkins, Rande Iaboni and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.","Gary Irving is sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after 34 on the lam .

"(CNN) -- I was lying in bed on a recent night when I heard a familiar rustle from my son's room. I knew the routine -- the quiet whimper would soon become a wail for Mama or Dada. Pick Dada tonight, I thought. As the whine turned into words, my toddler made a different plea. ""iPad! iPad!"" he cried. Oops. So what did I do next? I gave him the iPad, of course. I tried to justify it -- I had worked 10-plus hours and gone to school for another three. I had to wake up early. The truth is, it was 3 a.m. I just wanted to sleep, and if the tradeoff was letting my son watch another 30 minutes of monster trucks on the iPad, so be it. Like many moms, I often get asked how I ""juggle it all."" For me, ""it all"" includes working full-time, going to law school four nights a week, raising a toddler and preparing for the imminent arrival of Baby No. 2. Work, family and 'leaning in': Seven families trying to make it work . Honestly, it's not always perfect. And while my lifestyle might not work for a lot of people, it works for me. That's been the key to keeping my sanity -- prioritizing what works for my family instead of focusing on whether it would work for anyone else. All parents are busy. It's the nature of raising another person. As my husband and I find our rhythm in an unpredictable schedule, I remind myself of a few things that have helped us make it work. Organizing my time . If multitasking is a skill, compartmentalizing is an art. There is no way I can give 100% of myself to everything I do 100% of the time, but I can give 100% of myself to one thing at a time. I've carved out my schedule so I have time to focus on my priorities. I get up before my son does so I can focus on schoolwork. When he wakes up, I close the books and focus on him. When naptime comes around, I get two to three solid hours to study. The babysitter comes early enough so I can get in another hour of reading. Sheryl Sandberg: Speak up, believe in yourself, take risks . When I'm at work, I focus on my job. There's nothing I can do about looming school assignments or piles of laundry during that time, so there's no point in worrying about them. To help keep these ""lives"" separate, I keep three separate to-do lists. One is for home, one is for work and one is for school. Compartmentalizing doesn't come naturally to me and it doesn't make things stress-free. It just helps me to limit that stress to one manageable area at a time. Share the load . There's been a lot of buzz lately about ""leaning in."" I've been focusing on improving my ability to ""lean on"" -- my husband, family and friends for support. It's hard to ask for help, but it is impossible to balance work, school and family life without it. My husband and I work opposite schedules, and he picks up most of the chores that other couples usually share. My son has lots of sleepovers with his grandparents. Learning to say ""yes"" when people offer to help has been one of the toughest lessons of parenthood, but one of the best things I've done. It's not a competition . In many ways, mommyhood is more competitive than law school. When I first became a mom, I felt a mostly self-inflicted pressure to be the perfect mom instead of just me. I saw pictures of elaborate parties on Facebook. I saw moms planning meticulous arts and craft sessions. I looked at my son's latest drawing, doodles on my textbook. My cupcakes will never be worthy of Pinterest, and my son doesn't know baby sign language. But even if I had all the time in the world, that would still be the case. I don't think any mother would ever claim to know exactly what she is doing, but I am learning to recognize the things I'll never do well. Find time to unwind . I watch ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Walking Dead."" I eat dinner with my husband almost every night (usually around 10 p.m.). I try to squeeze in a mani-pedi every few weeks. I am the happiest when I am productive, so even my version of unwinding might be foreign to others. I watch TV on my phone while I am taking a shower. (Trust me, I've figured out a setup that works.) I fold laundry while I watch TV. This type of multitasking doesn't give any of my priorities less than they deserve. When I don't prioritize a few hours to refuel each week, I can tell, and so can the people around me. Lighten up . The best advice I got before I got married was to know when to lighten up. Not everything is a big deal. I like to think of myself as persistent. My husband would probably choose another word. But I am learning to loosen up and deviate from my plans. I'm at an advantage. The reason I'm busy is not that I am working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Part of what makes my schedule manageable is that I enjoy the things that take up my time. Motherhood is one thing that makes me happy. So does work. So does doing well in school. A happy mom means a happy family. And when that fails, grab the iPad.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The war of words between United States and Tehran continued Wednesday, with President Bush repeating his assertion that Iran is ""a threat to world peace."" President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. The two countries have been trading accusations since a weekend confrontation involving Iranian boats and U.S. Navy warships in the Strait of Hormuz. The United States claims Iranian vessels deliberately sped toward its warships despite warnings to stay away. Bush's criticism of Iran came Wednesday during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem. Bush is in the region to encourage the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Bush called the incident ""a very dangerous gesture"" by Iran and warned the Islamic republic against any escalation. ""We have made it very clear, and they know our position, and that is: There will be serious consequences if they attack our ships, pure and simple."" ""My advice to them is: Don't do it."" Earlier in the day, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said the Sunday incident in the Strait of Hormuz almost triggered an exchange of fire -- and if it happens again there may be a battle. The Pentagon released dramatic video of Sunday's encounter, which occurred in the narrow channel critical to the shipment of oil from the Persian Gulf. Iran's navy said the video was faked, according to state-run media. ""It's the kind of incident that can provoke exchange of fire,"" Hadley said. ""And we think the Iranians need to be on notice that they are fishing in troubled waters here."" Hadley, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush headed to Israel, said, ""It almost involved an exchange of fire between our forces and Iranian forces,"" but he stopped short of saying whether the U.S. Navy would have fired the first shots. ""This is not -- this is a provocative act, not a smart thing to do, and they're going to have to take responsibility for the consequences if they do it again,"" Hadley said. Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff, commander of the Bahrain-based U.S. 5th Fleet, said the U.S. ships received a ""threatening"" radio transmission indicating the boats were closing in on the U.S. ships and that the American vessels would ""explode.""  Watch as the confrontation unfolds » . No shots were fired, and no one was hurt in the incident, which lasted about 20 minutes, the Defense Department said. It began as the USS Port Royal, USS Hopper and USS Ingraham were traveling in formation after having finished a routine transit through the strait, the Navy said. Five boats, suspected to be from the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guard Navy, ""maneuvered aggressively in close proximity of the Hopper,"" the Navy said in a posting on its Web site. On Tuesday, the Pentagon released a four-minute, 20-second videotape shot from the bridge of the USS Hopper showing five fast boats racing back and forth near the convoy. An unidentified Navy crew member says over the radio: ""This is coalition warship. I am engaged in transit passage in accordance with international law. I intend no harm. Over."" The boats continued to race through the water even as the U.S. warship repeatedly sounded its horns. ""I am coming to you,"" a deep, thickly accented voice says in English over the radio. To that, an unidentified sailor aboard the Hopper, speaking into a radio, asks the boats to identify themselves and steer clear. ""Inbound small craft: You are approaching a coalition warship operating in international waters. Your identity is not known; your intentions are unclear,"" he says. ""You may be subject to defensive measures. Request that you establish communications now or alter your course immediately to remain clear."" Immediately afterward, an accented voice says, ""You will explode in a few minutes."" It was not clear, however, that the voice was coming from any of the boats, said Cmdr. Lydia Robertson, the 5th Fleet spokeswoman in Bahrain. It could have come from another ship in the area or from shore, she said. ""We don't have a direct connection, but it's not necessarily a disconnect,"" she said. Nor was it clear that the boats indeed belonged to the Revolutionary Guard Navy, she acknowledged. ""We believe they are,"" she said, adding that ""at least one had an Iranian flag."" But Chris Madden, the Navy's visual news director, said no Iranian flags were visible in the video. Robertson said estimates of the boats' nearest proximity to the warships range from 200 to 500 yards. She called the fast boats' actions ""unsafe, unnecessary and unprofessional."" Though the video does not show it, at least one of the boats dropped about five or six objects that looked like boxes into the water, where they floated, Robertson said. The U.S. naval commanders did not pick them up ""because they did not know what they were,"" she said. Iran's state-run Press TV quoted a spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Navy as saying Wednesday that the video ""had been compiled using file pictures and the audio had been fabricated."" An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman downplayed the incident, calling it ""normal,"" state-run news agency IRNA reported. ""The case ... was similar to the past ones and it was a regular and natural issue,"" Mohammad-Ali Hosseini said, according to the news agency.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Few people have had so much impact on the Chinese attitude towards sexuality and gender equality than Jin Xing. A spritely, sassy cultural icon, Jin Xing (or Golden Star) has sashayed her way to stardom as dancer-choreographer of Shanghai's Jin Xing Dance Theater, one of China's first non-government modern dance troupes. Jin has also emerged as one of the most prominent -- and controversial -- emblem of personal freedom and gender equality in China. Jin was one of the first Chinese to have a sex change operation -- and the first officially recognized by the Chinese government. Jin's story acquires distinct significance in the Chinese context. Although the wall of puritanism built around China's sexual mores has been gradually crumbling, traditional Chinese reticence and sexual stereotypes persist. I first met Jin Xing in 1994, when he was a man. He had just returned to Beijing after spending four years in the United States, learning modern dance from mentors like Martha Graham, and later dancing with professional troupes in Rome and Paris. That time, the 26-year-old was perhaps the best male dancer in China, much admired for his furious pirouettes, soaring leaps and dazzling choreography. A year later, Jin decided to have sex change. ""When I was six years old, I thought I should be a woman,"" Jin said. ""I myself knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what was wrong or what was mistaken. I had a confusing moment. I was wondering maybe I am homosexual, but in the end I said, no, I should come back to myself."" It was a difficult decision. Homosexuality was still considered a crime, tagged as ""hooliganism,"" and was officially listed as a ""mental disorder."" ""That was quite taboo in 1995,"" Jin recalled. ""The country's best male dancer becomes a female dancer -- that's too much for the Chinese society and government."" Fortunately for Jin, the society and government took a laissez-faire tack. ""We Chinese always take the attitude, whenever things are not certain, we step back or stay there, to give it some time and space and let things naturally happen and become right. I was really challenging the boundaries of the society but I had confidence in myself."" Jin's mother was not as sanguine. She worried the surgery would not go well and feared for her son's future. Jin fretted over what his father, a military officer, would say. At age 28, Jin underwent three sex-change surgeries. His final operation lasted 16 hours. Jin recalls sitting in the hospital and telling his father: ""Your son has become your daughter."" The PLA officer was briefly speechless, but after smoking a cigarette, he told Jin: ""Twenty years ago, I looked at you and wondered, I have a son but he looks like a girl. So 28 years later, you've found yourself. Congratulations."" The new woman continued to thrive with even more charm and effervescence. I recall seeing Jin a few times in ""Half Dream,"" a bar she opened in Beijing which briefly became a hub for local artists and expatriates. I remember seeing her driving in a green VW Beetle, rushing from one meeting to another, dressed in mini-skirts, loud colored blouses and high heels. In 2000, Jin's life changed again. She became a mother, adopting three Chinese orphans -- son Leo, daughter Vivian and little boy Julian. Soon after, she married a German man, Heinz Gerd Oidtmann. ""Everything is legal,"" she enthused in her gravelly voice, referring to her sex change, marriage and adoption. ""But how does the society accept you and digest the status matters -- that's up to you to convince them."" Meantime, even though homosexuality has been decriminalized in 1997 and was dropped from the official list of ""mental disorders"" in 2001, China's LGBT community continues to struggle against social stigma and legal discrimination. Because the Chinese government remains largely silent on the issue of homosexuality, they risk official ban or harassment whenever they meet, organize or provide services within the community. There are no applicable laws and regulations governing gay marriage, divorce, child custody, adoption and other related issues. LGBT couples are not recognized as constituting families. Yet, with an estimated transgender community of around 400,000 the Chinese government has granted them civil rights under the law, allowing them to change their national ID cards and passports, and legally recognizing their marriages after sex-change. ""It's still in the struggle period, but it's getting better,"" Jin said. She believes China needs more time. ""The day I came out as a woman to society, I said,` Okay, I give myself 50 years' time, I will tell the society who I am'."" Jin's willingness to reveal -- and revel in -- her sex-change story continues to make waves. When she is not dancing and choreographing, she is acting in films and appearing as a judge in China's versions of ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""American Idol."" Is she a good role model for the Chinese youth? ""I don't want to be a role model,"" she replied, flashing a smile as she tossed back her coiffed hair. ""I just want to be myself. Next month, I will release a book, in which I said, ""I don't want to change the world, but I also don't want the world to change me too much.' I just want to be myself.""","Dancer-choreographer Jin Xing had China's first officially recognized sex change operation in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- The judge in the retrial of deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak recused himself Saturday, referred the trial to a lower court and then walked out of the courtroom. Other judicial officials left the bench with him. Egyptian state TV carried the announcement live. A crowd of people attending the trial erupted in angry shouts, and police stepped in between them and the judge's bench. Mubarak, who had arrived on a stretcher at the country's Police Academy in Cairo for the first day of his retrial, was loaded back onto a helicopter, which flew him back to a military hospital. Judge Mustafa Hassan Abdullah quit the case over a medical condition, Mubarak's lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. Abdullah ""submitted a medical report to the head of Cairo Cassation Court stating that he has medical problems with his eyes,"" El Deeb said. Egyptian law requires a judge to recuse himself publicly. A lawyer for the families of those killed said he believed the judge held a legal bias in the case but also corroborated the medical reason for the judge's move. ""There was also news that he had medical issues related to his eyes,"" Khaled Abu Bakr said. Bakr and El Deeb told CNN that the court of appeals has 60 days to appoint a replacement judge. Mubarak will remain in custody at a hospital, El Deeb said. Mubarak faces charges related to the killing of peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring uprising that led to his ouster in February 2011. Protesters . Dozens of relatives of those killed in Egypt's demonstrations gathered outside the court, state-run Nile TV reported. They were joined by hundreds of pro-Mubarak activists carrying signs of support. Galal Faisal Ali, whose brother Naser was killed in the uprising, said he fears Mubarak will be found innocent. ""The government is not giving us the moral support we need and they're allowing this circus of a trial to continue. We were hoping for a death sentence but the way it's going, we may see Mubarak free, and his sons free, which means my brother died for nothing,"" he said. Magdi Fouda, the main organizer of the pro-Mubarak protest, is a member of a group called ""We are sorry, Mr. President."" She was joined by a second group called ""Sons of Mubarak."" ""We are sure Mubarak will be pronounced innocent,"" she said. State security forces formed a barrier between the opposing protesters. Emotions ran high at Mubarak's original trial in 2012, resulting in scuffles between the two sides inside the courtroom and rioting outside. The accusations . Mubarak's two sons, six of his security aides and his former interior minister Habib al-Adly all face trial with him. The other defendants had also appeared at the criminal court located inside the academy, state TV reported. In addition to the alleged killings, all face charges of financial corruption and abuse of power. Mubarak and al-Adly were both found guilty in the original trial and sentenced to life in prison, but they entered an appeal, which the court accepted. It resulted in the retrial. Prosecutors have added an additional corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value. A judge ordered Mubarak held in custody for an additional 15 days. Morsy pleased about second trial . Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial. ""God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants,"" El-Erian said. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years with the help of the military, was found guilty in June 2012 of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in Cairo to serve his life sentence. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. In December, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported.

"(CNN) -- May the force be with you, even in the airport. We all know that's not always the case, especially when we're carrying something that raises concerns from the Transportation Security Administration.

Mayhew, 69, was heading home from Denver Comic Con when his movie-inspired cane provoked a second look by TSA agents. Mayhew travels regularly to different conventions, meeting fans and tweeting photos. Next stop is London's Film and Comic Con in July. Mayhew quickly took to his Twitter account to protest the inspection of his cane, and credits Twitter for its speedy release.

"(CNN) -- DNA tests confirm that Ariel Castro is the father of a 6-year-old girl born to one of the three women he is accused of keeping in captivity for more than a decade, the Ohio attorney general's office said Friday. Castro's DNA did not match that from any other open Ohio cases, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the attorney general's office. National results are pending through the FBI, he said. Amanda Berry's 6-year-old daughter was among those rescued Monday when Berry escaped from the home where police say she had been held since Castro allegedly lured her into his car on April 21, 2003. Also freed: Michelle Knight, who disappeared in 2002, and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who vanished in 2004. The man accused of abducting them spent Friday in a 9-by-9-foot northern Ohio jail cell with a bed, sink, toilet, steel door and window, through which he is watched around-the-clock, said Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office spokesman John O'Brien. Castro is on suicide prevention -- which is standard procedure for high-profile inmates -- according to O'Brien. A day earlier, a judge ordered he be held Thursday on $8 million bond on kidnapping and rape charges. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he would seek additional charges against Castro for ""each and every act of sexual violence, each day of kidnapping, all his attempted murders and each act of aggravated murder."" The attempted and aggravated murders refer to instances in which Castro allegedly forced miscarriages, according to McGinty. According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Knight told investigators that she became pregnant at least five times while in captivity, and each time Castro would repeatedly starve and punch her in the stomach to induce a miscarriage. Prosecutors are assessing whether to pursue the death penalty, if Castro is convicted. CNN exclusive: Castro's daughter says 'he is dead to me' Meanwhile, questions continue to surround Knight, whose disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of Berry and DeJesus. Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. They did so after ""failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing."" Police said, though, that her missing person's case remained open and was checked on as recently as November 2012. Even as of Friday night, Knight hadn't spoken yet with her mother, Barbara, a family spokesperson said. In fact, Knight's family then had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts. Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, went to the house where DeJesus is staying on Friday, said she'd heard Knight might be there and ""besides, Gina's parents here have been waiting to meet us."" Without delving into specifics, a source close to the investigation told CNN that Knight ""is in a safe place and very comfortable."" Cleveland police have been subject to intense criticism from some quarters over their handling of missing persons cases, but city officials have said they did everything they could to find the missing women. In Friday's statement, city officials said police checked on Knight's case in November. Knight has been discharged from Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Tina Shaerban-Arundel said Friday hours after the hospital said in a Facebook posting that she was in ""good spirits"" and ""extremely grateful"" for the flowers, gifts and the support of the Cleveland Courage Fund. The latter is a vehicle for raising that helps nonprofit organizations provide services to the three women. Berry and DeJesus were released days ago and are now staying with relatives. Woman crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend . According to the initial report, the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement of the home, but later moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor. They were allowed out of the home only twice, and then just briefly, according to the document. Castro would frequently test the women by pretending to leave and then discipline any of them if they had moved, according to a law enforcement source. Storm Pusztay, who lives behind the house, told CNN's Piers Morgan on Friday that he spotted Castro a few times outside with the girl he believes was Berry's daughter. Speakers often blasted loud music from the front of the house, Pusztay recalled, while dogs walked on the property. The neighbor added that Castro's yard was further obscured by tarps he put up, and trees. ""It's so upsetting, because he was so close,"" said Pusztay, who had three daughters living with him. Castro has confessed to some of the allegations aginst him, a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation told CNN on Thursday. Neighbor feels 'fooled' by Cleveland abduction suspect . Authorities have also been reviewing a lengthy document described by a law enforcement source as ""more of a diary"" in which the source said Castro cites being abused by family members as justification for his actions. On Friday, they boarded up his Seymour Avenue home to preserve the crime scene, said Cleveland's deputy police chief Ed Tomba. Authorities plan to later erect a fence around the home. The ordeal has rattled neighbors like Juan Perez, who had viewed Castro as a ""very social, happy-go-lucky ... good guy"" but now think just the opposite. ""We feel lied to and we're ashamed because we couldn't help earlier,"" an emotional Perez told CNN on Friday. ""... I just can't put it all together still.""

"(CNN) -- Nearly four years after the Honduran president was deposed in a coup, the country's congress will add an impeachment process to its constitution, hoping to deter future political crises. A decree to reform the constitution on the matter of impeachment passed Tuesday night with overwhelming support. An impeachment process will help prevent authoritarianism, said Matias Funes, a writer who also is former congressman and presidential candidate. In June 2009, the Honduran military carried out an order from the country's Supreme Court to remove President Jose Manuel Zelaya from office. Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over his desire to to run for another term, and the court determined that the president had violated the constitution. Without a clear interpretation of the constitution, the military ended up sending Zelaya into exile, and the country fell into a political crisis that other nations simply called a coup. The episode was a black eye for the country, and to this day, a minority still question the legitimacy of the current government. The 2009 coup and ensuing crisis could have been avoided if there was a clear impeachment process, Funes said. ""From my point of view there is a hole in this area and as long as this hole is not closed, it can be filled by special interests, whims and authoritarianism,"" he said in a statement posted on the congressional website. The decree, which aims to ""make effective the principal of public servants' responsibility,"" still must pass through some hoops before the constitution is modified. The reform must be voted on again once the next congressional term begins this month. Once ratified, new laws detailing the impeachment process must be written. As written, Tuesday's decree envisions precisely the situation that Honduras faced with the Zelaya debacle. The impeachment process would be used when there are ""grave accusations against a person's post by acting contrary to the constitution or the national interest, and by negligence, incapacity and incompetence,"" the decree states. These are the same things that the Supreme Court and congress accused Zelaya of during his attempt to run for another term. Impeachment would require a three-fourths majority in congress. The measure is not without its critics, who question whether Honduras' legislative branch is mature enough to wield such power without abuse. The first movement toward a decree came last summer, immediately after Paraguay's president, Fernando Lugo, was removed from office through an impeachment proceeding. While Paraguay's solution for ousting a president was legitimated by the country's laws, many cite it as an example of how impeachment can be abused. Lugo was removed from office in a matter of days, with hardly a chance to defend himself. The process that removed him may have been legal, but it caused a stir all the same because it seemed to have been used as a political weapon. An impeachment process for Honduras ""is very risky and is unacceptable,"" a former president, Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, told La Prensa newspaper last year. Knowing the political divide that exists in Honduras and the vengefulness that dominates the traditional parties, the advent of impeachment will generate chaos, he said. But the legislation is popular among the public, and it follows a suggestion made in 2011 by a truth commission appointed to examine the political turmoil of 2009. To avoid a repetition of the institutional fights that led to the capture and expulsion of Zelaya, an impeachment process is necessary, the commission's final report said. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","The Honduran congress passes a decree to create an impeachment process .
Supporters say it is needed to avoid political crises .
A 2009 coup and subsequent fallout could have been avoided with such a law, some say .
Others wonder if Honduran institutions are mature enough to handle such power ."
"(CNN) -- From Brazil to Malaysia, Thailand to Canada, electronic music festivals are springing up worldwide as record labels and promoters push for a dance revolution with a new beat. Major players in electronic music -- an industry worth an estimated $4.5 billion -- are shipping festival brands to emerging markets in Asia and South America in an effort to increase the music genre's following. Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN, superstar DJ David Guetta said: ""We are keeping that scene alive and always exciting."" The french music producer -- who has 45 million Facebook fans -- added: ""I think it's going to grow even bigger because if I look at the history of Hip Hop ... they are 2 musical genres that you can compare because they both came from the underground then became trendy."" Read more: Spotify founder: I'm not music's savior . But he admitted that electronic music has a long way to go before it's as successful as Hip Hop, an urban street genre. Festivals such as Tomorrowland and Sensation White -- a leading dance event which will visit 22 cities worldwide in 2013 -- are rolling out to new markets to give audiences the chance to listen to electronic music. Watch more: Music industry is bullish for 2013 . In July, 180,000 music fans massed on the small Belgian town of 'Boom' for Tomorrowland -- one of world's largest music festivals -- as gig enthusiasts from 214 countries flew in for a 3-day bonanza of electronic dance music.

This unique approach is all part of ID&T's strategy to take electronic music global. After eight successful years, the entertainment company is planning to host its first Tomorrowland festival outside Belgium in Chattahoochee Hills in Atlanta. Speaking at the International Music Summit (IMS) in Ibiza in May, ID&T boss Duncan Stutterheim said electronic music has ""no language barriers,"" adding that the company is going to ""enjoy a nice ride"" in the next 10 years. ""We are talking finally to India, to Japan, to China, to Malaysia. We did a tour in Thailand... They all want to do the festivals so we are in a luxury position,"" Stutterheim said in his speech. Tomorrowland already has 4 million social media followers and over 80 million people watched the after-movie of the concert online. According to a report by industry consultant Kevin Watson, who produced the IMS Business Report, over half the electronic dance industry's value, approximately $2.5 billion, comes from live clubs and festivals. Speaking in Ibiza, he said: ""We've got recorded music, we think that's worth $1.25 billion and we've got a couple of other things, sales of hardware and software, brand sponsorship and everything else linked to Dance is getting ridiculously popular. So we think that's worth at least another three quarters of a billion."" Marc Geiger, head of music at William Morris Endeavor, one of the first agencies to start a dedicated electronic division about six years ago, believes industry growth is providing firms with new resources. But he warns: ''It's big money now and with big money comes a bigger responsibility of growing up.""

"(CNN) -- It wasn't long after TWA Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island on a warm July evening in 1996 that the conspiracy theorists emerged. Seventeen years later, they're still here. I haven't seen a new documentary that purports to repudiate the conclusions of the National Transportation Safety Board, which ruled that the crash of the 747 headed for Paris was caused by a center fuel tank explosion likely ignited by faulty wiring. But I do know that -- despite all the media attention the filmmakers are getting -- their essential claim that a missile hit the plane is not new. And neither are aircraft fuel tank explosions. In fact, they were considered enough of a danger that the Federal Aviation Administration has put in place new regulations to prevent such events. And the FAA, heavily lobbied by airlines and aircraft manufacturers who want to keep their costs low, does not enact new regulations without reason. When I covered the four-year investigation into TWA Flight 800 for Newsday, I spent hundreds of hours interviewing investigators, scientists and experts; I walked around inside the center fuel tank of a Boeing 747 (yes, it's that big) at a plant in Seattle; and I continued to cover the aftermath of the NTSB's final report that culminated in an FAA rule to make airlines pump inert gas into fuel tanks to prevent explosions. I remember being surprised when I first learned of fuel-tank explosions on aircraft, particularly those designed with air-conditioning units below the center tank. At first it seemed unbelievable. But when an aircraft's fuel tank is nearly empty, as is often the case with the center tank, the heat from the air-conditioning packs underneath combined with ambient temperatures can create, well, what seems like a bomb on board. In 1990, the fuel tank of a Philippine Airlines plane exploded on the ground in Manila, killing eight people. In 2001, a Thai Airways International plane blew up on the ground in Bangkok when its center tank exploded. And as recently as 2006, the wing tank of a Boeing 727 exploded on the ground in Bangalore, India. In 2000, the FAA compiled a list of 26 fuel-tank explosions dating back to 1959. I also remember the day l learned that the system that tells pilots how much fuel remains includes electrical components located inside the tank. Although aircraft wiring is made to be strong and durable, it is also subject to the effects of aging and abrasion -- so much so that short circuits can occur. On July 17, 1996, the conditions -- a volatile fuel-air mix of vapors in the center fuel tank heated to the point of being explosive, a likely short circuit in fuel-gauge wiring and 230 people on board -- came together with a tragic result. I can't speak to the motives of the former investigators who are calling for a renewed investigation. But it is important to note that while a poster from the film on epix.com trumpets, ""inside investigators finally break their silence,"" one of the key investigators featured testified about the NTSB's failings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999. It would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago. As for the missile theory, its main proponents were those eyewitnesses who reported seeing a streak of light in the sky on the night of the crash. That streak has been explained as the still-airborne fuselage of the Boeing 747 after the nose of the plane broke off and fell to earth -- and debris recovery patterns confirm this scenario. Metallurgical evidence showed that the fuel tank, the main structural component between the wings, exploded from the inside, with no evidence of a puncture or outside entry. The filmmakers say they have new radar evidence. I don't know why it hasn't surfaced before now, or how it will contradict the physical evidence that shows the fuel tank exploded from the inside. I do know that when the process turns to fault-finding in aviation accidents, there are many competing interests with a stake in the game -- the pilots' union, aircraft manufacturers and airlines, all with lawyers ready to battle their side. When I covered aviation safety, it seemed that the NTSB was the only entity with no conflicts of interest. Even the media want a good story -- and what better story than a missile and cover-up? I imagine the same can be said of people who want to sell an idea for a documentary. Fuel-tank explosions and exposed wiring just aren't that sexy. Conspiracy theories about TWA Flight 800 are a bit like 17-year cicadas. Except they seem to emerge a bit more often. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sylvia Adcock.","Sylvia Adcock: Conspiracy theorists have long sniffed around story of Flight 800 crash .

"(CNN) -- A twin-engine propeller plane crashed into a house in North Carolina on Wednesday, killing two people on board, authorities said. The small plane crashed into a High Point neighborhood -- clipping one home before crashing into a second and sparking a fire, said Capt. Denita Lynch of the city's fire department. The people inside the house at the time of the crash were able to escape unscathed. The fire was extinguished. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was a Hawker Beechcraft BE58 en route to nearby Winston-Salem, but was diverted to nearby Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport due to severe weather.","The plane had been diverted from Winston-Salem to Greensboro .

"(CNN) -- Authorities on Monday discovered a package in a mailroom at the University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus apparently sent by the alleged gunman responsible for the theater shooting that left 12 people dead and scores injured, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said Wednesday. It was sent to the school's campus in Aurora, where the suspect, James Holmes, had recently dropped out of a Ph.D. program in neuroscience. CBS News reported that the package was addressed to a psychologist at the university. ""Sources say the letter was from a pent-up Holmes to one of his professors,"" the news organization reported. ""In it, he talked about shooting people and even included crude drawings of a gunman and his victims."" Warning signs of violence: What to do . School officials said in a statement that a package discovered at the Facilities Services building on Monday had been delivered to the campus by the U.S. Postal Service that same day and was turned over to authorities within hours of delivery. ""This package prompted the building's evacuation at 12:26 p.m. and employees were allowed to return by 3:06 p.m.,"" the statement said. School administrators said that Holmes had taken his preliminary examinations at the school on June 7. A source familiar with Holmes' academic status said the 24-year-old suspect did ""poorly"" on the oral exam. Three days later, Holmes initiated his withdrawal from the program. ""It's very unusual, very unusual for a student to withdraw from our program,"" Dean Barry Shur told reporters on Monday. Holmes did not divulge his reason for leaving the elite program. ""That area of the form was left blank,"" Shur said. Meanwhile, a composite image began to emerge of Holmes as a child; his classmates at Castroville Elementary School in northern California, where he grew up, referred to him as ""Jimmy."" But that picture revealed no immediate answers as to possible motive. ""He was top of the class,"" Adam Martinez said. ""He was ahead of every student academically."" Martinez added, ""He got along well with everybody."" Holmes' fifth-grade teacher there said the matter has led to introspection. ""It's really disturbing to be so close to something like that -- bothers you to your essence,"" Paul Karrer said. ""And particularly, as a teacher, you're thinking, this is one of my kids. And then you also think: Could I have done anything? Or did I see anything? Did I miss anything? You know, could I have done anything to have prevented this? Did I do anything to cause this? The answer is no, but that's what you think and that's how you feel."" Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . As of Wednesday evening, five area hospitals were still caring for 17 patients, six of whom were in critical condition. Several of the hospitals said they would pay for the medical care of uninsured victims out of charity funds. Holmes made his first court appearance Monday. The man who identified himself to police as ""the Joker"" will continue to be held without bond. He is to be formally charged July 30. Meanwhile, families grappling with Friday's carnage were beginning to bury the dead. On Wednesday, a memorial service was to take place for 51-year-old Gordon Cowden, who took his two teenage children to see the midnight premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Cowden's children survived the shooting inside the Aurora theater. Nine miles away, visitation was to take place for Micayla Medek, a 23-year-old woman who had been working toward her college degree. Those who were wounded still face the specter of permanent injury and long recovery periods. In Aurora, actor Christian Bale, star of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" visited a memorial for the dead and met Tuesday with survivors, CNN affiliate KDVR reported. Stories of survival: Newborn a 'silver lining' One of the victims, Carey Rottman, posted a picture of Bale visiting him in his hospital room on Facebook. ""Wow! Thank you so much for the visit Christian! What a great guy! Still in shock!"" Rottman wrote, KDVR reported. Petra Anderson suffered four shotgun wounds, including one to her head. But thanks, in part, to a brain abnormality, she survived, her pastor said. ""The doctor explains that Petra's brain has had from birth a small 'defect' in it,"" Brad Strait of Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church in Englewood, Colorado, wrote on his blog. ""It is a tiny channel of fluid running through her skull, like a tiny vein through marble, or a small hole in an oak board, winding from front to rear."" ""Like a marble through a small tube, the defect channels the bullet from Petra's nose through her brain. It turns slightly several times, and comes to rest at the rear of her brain. And in the process, the bullet misses all the vital areas of the brain. In many ways, it almost misses the brain itself,"" he said. Anderson has started physical and speech therapy and can walk, talk and laugh, said Andrew Roblyer, a family friend. Brain condition saves victim . Shooting victim Caleb Medley's wife, Katie, gave birth to their son, Hugo Jackson Medley, Tuesday morning. Both the mother and baby were doing well, the University of Colorado Hospital said. But Caleb Medley, who was shot in the head, lost an eye and suffered brain damage. ""The surgeon came and talked to us and said he'd be in ICU at least a week,"" said Medley's friend, Michael West, who set up a website to help take care of medical bills and the needs of Medley's family. By Wednesday afternoon, it was more than halfway toward its goal of $500,000. ""I knew it was going to rack up in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions,"" West said of his friend's expected medical expenses. Medley, who had been doing standup comedy routines in Denver and was working full-time at Target, had no health insurance, his brother Seth said. Chloe Anderson has set up a similar fund for her sister, Petra Anderson, an aspiring musician who was also shot in the head. In a video posted Sunday asking for funds, Chloe Anderson notes that her mother was preparing to undergo cancer treatment later this month when Friday's shooting occurred. ""My sister's hospital bills on top of that are making the financial reality look pretty daunting,"" she says. ""So that's why we are reaching out to you -- the people who have already asked us what they can do to help."" By Wednesday evening, the fund had received more than $184,000 with a goal of $250,000. Money is also streaming in to GivingFirst.org, which is accepting donations for the shooting victims and their relatives. By Tuesday, the amount had reached almost $2 million, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. ""The needs will be great and we look forward to seeing the fund grow exponentially,"" he said. ""This money will help those impacted by this tragedy begin to recover and rebuild their lives."" Hickenlooper said donors include Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, co-producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Victims remembered through poignant stories . Sources at Warner Bros. studios told CNN the company made a ""substantial"" donation. Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, would not divulge how much money it was giving out of respect for the victims, the sources said. Shooting suspect Holmes booby-trapped his Aurora apartment with more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline, a law enforcement official who viewed video showing the apartment's interior has told CNN. The sophisticated setup inside the sparsely furnished third-floor, one-bedroom apartment was meant to harm, or possibly kill, anyone who entered -- and tested the skills of bomb squad members charged with clearing it, the official said. Tenants of the three-story, brick apartment building were allowed to return Wednesday night to sleep in their apartments for the first time since early Friday, when police went door-to-door and rousted them. The Holmes family issued a statement Friday saying, ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" It added, ""We are still trying to process this information."" Focusing on the victims, not the shooter . Opinion: Aurora heroes -- Three who gave their lives .

"London, England (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport will begin subjecting passengers to full body scans ""as soon as practical,"" following the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner, its operator said Sunday. ""It is our view that a combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling will help build a more robust defense against the unpredictable and changing nature of the terrorist threat to aviation,"" BAA, which run Britain's largest airport, announced in a statement. The move follows the British government's approval of electronic bodyscanners, which Prime Minister Gordon Brown said was necessary to combat ""a new type of threat."" Speaking on the BBC, Brown said the devices will be put into place gradually, as will checks of carry-on luggage for traces of explosives for passengers boarding flights at British airports. ""We will do everything in our power to tighten up on security that is essential,"" he said. The actions come in response to the unsuccessful Christmas Day plot to bomb a Northwest Airlines jetliner heading from the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan. A 23-year-old British-educated Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, has been arrested after U.S. authorities said he attempted to set off explosives that had been concealed in his underwear. Officials in the Netherlands and Nigeria said last week they would begin using the bodyscanners on airline passengers in the wake of the bombing attempt. Bodyscanners are currently in use at 19 U.S. airports, but U.S. officials said Thursday that 150 new ones are set to be placed in airports across the country. ""We've recognized there are new forms of weapons that are being used by al Qaeda, so we've got to respond accordingly,"" Brown said.","Heathrow to use technology, intelligence, profiling to fight terror, official says .

"(CNN) -- Taiwan's economy slumped 8.36 percent during the last three months of 2008, the government said Wednesday. People line up to receive $108 U.S. dollars worth of shopping vouchers in Taipei, Taiwan, last month. The island's economy spiraled into recession with its second straight quarter of economic losses. For the third quarter of 2008, Taiwan's real gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, slipped about 1 percent, according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. Behind the dismal economic numbers is a global recession that is sapping demand for the products Taiwan makes. ""The types of exports that Taiwan ships to the West -- electronics -- are very severely affected, very sensitive to changes in Western consumer sentiment,"" said Frederic Neumann, a senior Asian economist for HSBC. The GDP numbers are the broadest measure of Taiwan's economic activity. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. Taiwan's central bank, in a move to boost the economy, on Wednesday dropped its key interest rate one-quarter point, to 1.25 percent. Since the end of 2007, the central bank has lowered rates by more than 2 percent. In January, the Taiwanese government offered the island's residents up to $108 each to go shopping, in another attempt to stimulate the economy. More than 90 percent of those eligible took up the offer, pumping about TW $86 billion ($2.6 billion) into the economy and sending shoppers to malls, officials said.","Taiwanese economy now in recession now after second straight quarter of losses .

"(CNN) -- This last week has been chock full of gaffes by our presidential candidates -- a veritable gaffe-a-thon, a gaffe-a-palooza. President Obama and the Republican presidential candidates almost seem to be trying to one-up each other's blunders. This ""March Madness"" started off slowly enough last Monday with a small one by Rick Santorum: ""I don't care what the unemployment rate is going to be. It doesn't matter to me."" But then, just days later, the gaffes started flying fast and furious. On Wednesday, Mitt Romney's communication director Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN that he wasn't concerned if Romney was moving to the right on certain key issues during the Republican primaries because, as he put it: ""You hit a reset button for the fall campaign. ... It's almost like an Etch A Sketch."" Only a few hours later, Rick Santorum, armed with an Etch A Sketch, commented that if voters are offered a choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney in this November's election: ""We might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk with what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate for the future."" And then President Obama joined in. On Sunday, unaware that his microphone was on while he was speaking to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev about missile defense treaty negotiations, commented: ""This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility."" If you were a staff member of any of these campaigns, you must have consumed an industrial size bottle of Pepcid AC over the last few days. But for the rest of us in America, these moments are great -- it's just what we need to accurately assess our candidates. Let's be honest, these comments were not ""gaffes"" as the media dubs them, but rather, rare opportunities for us to have an unfiltered look at the candidates' character and views on issues. A gaffe is defined as a mistake: a misstatement of fact, a mispronunciation of a word, a social faux pas. By way of example, President Obama made a classic gaffe by stating a few years ago that he had campaigned in all ""57 states,"" when obviously he meant to say 50 states. Another gaffe occurred when President Obama was in Austria and commented: ""I don't know what the term is in Austrian"" for ""wheeling and dealing."" The gaffe being that there is no Austrian language. And, of course, George W. Bush was the gaffe-anator. His gaffes are legendary. My favorites were his coining of new words like ""misunderstimate"" or saying, while at an event with the queen of England, that she first visited the U.S. in 1776. But back to 2012. The so-called gaffes in this campaign are not misstatements of facts or mispronunciations. When the words at issue were uttered, they accurately communicated the candidates' views. The reason the statements were later labeled mistakes, and not at all what the candidate meant, was because of the ensuing firestorm of criticism in the media. But what do you think is a more accurate gauge of who a candidate truly is as a person: his or her prepared stump speeches delivered over months or a candid, unrehearsed comment on an issue? The answers at the debates, which are regurgitated to us like a bird feeding its baby, or a spontaneous moment when the candidate speaks his mind? There is not doubt that President Obama meant what he said to the Russian president. Just as Mitt Romney did with his past gaffes like ""corporations are people"" and ""I like being able to fire people who provide services to me."" And does anyone question that Rick Santorum wasn't being sincere when he remarked that after reading John F. Kennedy's 1960 famous speech about the need to have a clear line between church and state, it almost made Santorum want ""to throw up""? Of course he meant this -- after all, this is the same Santorum who has repeatedly stated on the campaign trail that our civil laws and the Bible must be in agreement. These rare, honest moments during the campaign should not be so quickly dismissed by the media or us as simply gaffes. These comments arguably paint a more accurate portrait of the candidate than any prepared speech they can offer us. Indeed, we should applaud and savor these gaffes, because it's these very remarks that may ultimately help us decide if the candidate in question is truly the best suited to be elected or re-elected as president of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Candidates, campaigns have been making lots of gaffes lately .
He says candidates quickly backpedal from gaffes, but the public knows better .
He says these comments are less gaffes than accurate reads of a candidates viewpoints .

"(CNN) -- Something strange happened Monday on the Internet. Facebook -- the once-underdog social network founded by a kid in a hoodie in a dorm room -- may have officially cemented its status as a titan of the tech establishment it once challenged. What changed? Facebook -- no longer a feisty startup but a 3,000-person, soon-to-be-public corporation with $3.9 billion in cash and an $85 billion to $100 billion valuation -- spent $1 billion to gobble up a much-smaller competitor, the photo-sharing app Instagram. When it did so, it stirred up a caldron of ill will that the ""People of the Internet"" have been harboring toward Mark Zuckerberg's once-hip company. Some Instagram users said they were downloading all of their photos and then deleting them from the app just so Facebook couldn't get its hands on them. Pundits weren't kind to Facebook, either. David Horsey of the Los Angeles Times, writing about the Instagram purchase, noted that the company is looking more and more like ""Big Friend,"" a gentler variation on George Orwell's all-seeing Big Brother. Data indicate others share that view, too. A new poll, conducted before the Instagram news, found that 28% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Facebook -- twice as many as disapprove of Apple and nearly three times as many as Google. This backlash highlights a new reality: As a technological juggernaut, Facebook is more Microsoft than Tumblr. To use a musical analogy employed on Twitter, it's the Nickelback to Instagram's Bon Iver. Facebook and Instagram's images couldn't be more different, so it's tempting to say that this Goliath-buys-David event is a turning point for Facebook. But people have been writing about Facebook losing its mojo for years now. In 2009, AdWeek ran this headline: ""Is Facebook getting uncool for 18-24s?"" A year later, mainstream news websites noted the phenomenon of parents and grandparents joining Facebook, scaring off younger people. ""It's official, Facebook is becoming uncool,"" CBS declared. It's hard to pinpoint the moment when Facebook's image problem started. Maybe it was when users realized how much data Facebook was collecting about them. Maybe it was when CEO Zuckerberg started to seem less like that geeky, counterculture college kid and more like a run-of-the-mill billionaire. But it is possible to take a look at the conversation and tease out a few factors that seem to have led to Facebook's current status as an inescapable, perhaps Orwellian, Internet giant. First: Money. Nothing leads to public skepticism quite like a few billion dollars in pocket change. Compare that kind of situation at Facebook to Instagram, which as CNNMoney notes, hadn't monetized its product. It didn't support advertisements and apparently didn't sell its users' data. Facebook, on the other hand, is accused of profiting wildly on the backs of the 850 million people who share personal details about their lives on the social network. For more on that, see The Wall Street Journal's recent feature ""Selling You on Facebook,"" which analyzes the info that Facebook apps collect. View some of the photos, comments from readers . Second: Size. As companies get bigger, people tend to question their motives. Google is a good example of this view. The Silicon Valley company once was the darling of the Internet -- the search engine that didn't have ads on its homepage and declared its company ethos was ""Don't Be Evil."" As the tech blog Gizmodo writes, Google ""built a very lucrative company on the reputation of user respect."" That was easy enough when Google was small. As it grew, however, some people started to lose faith in the company -- and to question its motives. Gizmodo: ""In a privacy policy shift, Google announced today that it will begin tracking users universally across all its services -- Gmail, Search, YouTube and more -- and sharing data on user activity across all of them. So much for the Google we signed up for."" People never talked that way about Instagram, which only had 13 employees and 33 million users. It's the kind of company journalists love to use the word ""scrappy"" to describe. Third: Trust. As the company has grown, some people have come to trust Facebook so little that they're pulling photos from Instagram in advance of the takeover. According to Megan Garber at The Atlantic, 25,000 people visited Instaport's site in six hours on Monday after the news broke, compared with 400 people on a normal day. Instaport is a service that helps people pull photos off Instagram for home storage. ""You could read that spike, on the one hand, as a mass freak-out on the part of users who don't trust Facebook -- despite Mark Zuckerberg's promises -- with their networks and memories,"" Garber writes. ""You could also read it as an insurance play, a just-to-be-safe move on the part of people who want to feel sure that their photos are secure."" Mistrust of Facebook stems in part from concern about its privacy policies, which have been described as overly confusing. Facebook itself acknowledges that privacy concerns could trip up the company in the future. In its initial public offering filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company wrote: ""We have in the past experienced, and we expect that in the future we will continue to experience, media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy or other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brand."" Finally: The cool factor. Maybe it's less that people see Facebook as evil and more that the site just isn't as cool as it used to be -- partly because it's so popular and also because it's not the new kid on the block anymore. Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, which is eons ago in Internet time. MySpace and Friendster -- all of Facebook's predecessors -- didn't survive (or didn't continue to grow) for this long. Instagram, meanwhile, was founded in late 2010 and was only in recent months becoming part of the zeitgist. iPhone-toting hipster types liked the app for its mobility -- you cold post photos easily from your phone -- and filters that gave their pics a retro, vintage vibe. ""Instagram is, in a word, cool. Facebook is losing its 'cool', rapidly,"" wrote Allan Swann at the Computer Business Review. Instagram managed to create a cache in part from its status as an underground hit. Even with tens of millions of users, the app was praised by reviewers as intimate -- a place, true or not, where it was safe to post personal photos and share stories with a relatively small network of friends. (Just to throw in some data: I have 815 Facebook friends but only 67 people whom I follow on Instagram, and I actually know almost all of them.) It's not clear that any of that will change for Instagram. Zuckerberg says the app will continue to operate as a product that's independent from Facebook and that people won't have to post Instagram photos to Facebook just because the company owns the app. But the backlash helped crystallize the idea that Facebook no longer is seen as the always-cool company that everybody implicitly trusts. ""Some Instagram fans are acting as if this is a tragedy,"" Horsey of the Los Angeles Times writes of the acquisition. ""They liked the idea that there was a little corner of the online world where they could gather and be outside the reach of the Zuckerberg empire. ..."" There was a time when people clamored to be part of Zuckerberg's network, which launched at first only for Harvard students. But now, as the Instagram backlash shows, Facebook has long stopped being an exclusive club. It's seen as the big, bland company that the app's users worry will ruin the cool thing they had going.","Facebook buying Instagram for $1 billion, as photo-sharing app hits mainstream .

"(CNN) -- A former vice president of product development at Tiffany & Co. is accused of stealing $1.3 million worth of jewelry from the luxury brand and selling it to an international jewelry company, an unnamed FBI representative said. Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun, 46, was arrested Tuesday. She is accused of stealing 165 pieces of jewelry, including diamond bracelets, earrings and pendants, between January 2011 and February 2013. Officials said Lederhaas-Okun abused her position to check out the pieces and write off or cancel the costs of the jewelry, later reselling the pieces falsely as her own. According to a federal complaint, Lederhaas-Okun was terminated by Tiffany & Co. in February 2013 as a result of downsizing within the company. The day after her termination, Tiffany's conducted an inventory review and discovered the missing jewelry. Lederhaas-Okun then continued to make false statements to the company through e-mail, including that the jewelry could be found in a white envelope at her desk, officials said. A search of her office, however, did not uncover the envelope, according to a news release. Linda Buckley, vice president for Tiffany & Co., said, ""In deference to the U.S. Attorney's investigation, we are not in a position to comment at this time."" Notable diamond heists . According to the complaint, the jewelry store that Lederhaas-Okun sold the jewelry to is a leading international buyer and reseller of jewelry with an office in Midtown Manhattan. More than 75 checks were made to Lederhaas-Okun and her husband, ranging from $7,525 to $47,400, the complaint said. It also states that an unnamed friend of Lederhaas-Okun assisted with the transactions. ""Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun took advantage of the access her employment afforded her to expensive jewelry."" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said in a news release. ""A privileged position in a prestigious company does not insulate a thief from arrest and prosecution."" Lederhaas-Okun is charged with one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property, which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. She was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Bail was set at $250,000 but Lederhaas-Okun was released from custody on her own signature and given a week to post bond, according to the U.S. attorney's office in New York. She was placed under travel restriction, required to surrender her passport and appointed a federal public defender for the time being. Lederhaas-Okun's attorney, Sabrina Shroff, could not be reached for comment. Half a million dollars' worth of jewelry stolen in Atlantic City casino .

"(CNN) -- A listeria outbreak linked to cheese might have killed one person and sickened four others in four states, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. One of the cases was a pregnant woman who suffered a miscarriage. The listeriosis is linked to Les Freres cheese distributed by Crave Brothers Farmstead Classics, a Wisconsin producer, the FDA said. All of those sickened were infected with the same strain of listeriosis, the FDA said. Two cases were in Minnesota, both involving older adults who were hospitalized after eating the cheese, the Minnesota Health and Agriculture departments said. One later died. The other states involved are Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture is testing samples of the cheese and early results indicate the presence of listeria, though confirmation is pending. Minnesota health officials are warning consumers not to consume the Les Freres, Petit Frere and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses. The state's Department of Agriculture has advised grocery stores and distributors to pull the products until it gets further information. The people who became ill ranged in age from 31 to 67 and were diagnosed between May 20 and June 17, the FDA said. One case in a pregnant woman resulted in a miscarriage, the FDA said. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems. A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, the CDC says. They might also have headaches, a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or convulsions. Pregnant women typically experience fever and other nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue and aches, but infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature deliver, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Tiffany Sessions was a 20-year-old junior studying economics at the University of Florida in Gainesville when she decided to go out for a run. She never came back. College student Tiffany Sessions has been missing since February 9, 1989. Sessions left her off-campus apartment about 6 p.m. February 9, 1989. She told her roommate she'd be back shortly and took her Walkman with her. It was the last time anyone would see her. That was 20 years ago, a time when no one had cell phones, Blackberries or Web sites to aid in tracking a missing or abducted person. The only clues came from people who recalled seeing a young woman fitting Sessions' description walking down the main street just before dusk. Sessions' jogging route usually took her down Gainesville's main street to a small dirt trail that cut through the woods. The loop was 1½ miles each way and took her about an hour. Police and family believe that she was abducted near the woods. After extensive searches, no clues were found: not her remains, not her Walkman, not the clothes she was wearing. ""Much of the area in the last decade has been paved over, with new construction, making a search today very difficult,"" said Detective Bob Dean of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. However, investigators are still searching and working this case actively. Searchers were out as recently as late December, seeking clues with newer technologies. ""We have used ground sonar equipment, even,"" Dean said. Over the years, there have been some possible suspects -- people who came forward and confessed -- but police have ruled them out as credible suspects. One potential suspect was a man who was in jail for killing a 5-year-old girl. He'd written a letter to police, claiming he was responsible for Tiffany Sessions' disappearance. But when questioned later by police, he denied writing the letter, even though handwriting analysis indicated that he had. ""Although police don't think so, I still believe this guy could have something to do with my daughter's disappearance,"" said Patrick Sessions, Tiffany's father. According to Patrick Sessions, who has been closely involved with the police investigating his daughter's case, the man who confessed was a sex offender who had been released just a month and a half before Tiffany Sessions disappeared. The cold case unit of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office has taken over this case. Patrick Sessions observed the 20th anniversary of his daughter's disappearance by making renewed appeals through the media. Police and family urge anyone with more information about Tiffany Sessions or information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance to call the tip line at 352-367-4161. A $25,000 reward is offered. Tiffany Sessions was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a white sweatshirt with the word ""Aspen"" on it, a gold Rolex watch and a black Sony Walkman. She was 5'3"" and weighed 125 pounds at the time of her disappearance. She has blonde hair and brown eyes.","Tiffany Sessions went out for a run February 9, 1989, and disappeared .

"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- Kyrgyzstan will investigate allegations that government troops were involved in ethnic violence, an official said Sunday. Col. Kursan Asanov, appointed by the Kyrgyz interim government to run the reconciliation operation in the southern city of Osh, did not say whether the investigation would include independent investigators. Asanov said that a government-imposed curfew in Osh that was due to expire Sunday had been extended to Friday. The curfew stretches from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. (10 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET). Ethnic violence between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks has displaced 300,000 people inside Kyrgyzstan and forced 100,000 more to flee Kyrgyzstan, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated. The clashes, which erupted last week, were the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in Osh. The Kyrgyz news agency Kabar said Friday that 191 people died in the violence but Roza Otunbayeva, the acting president of Kyrgyzstan, said that toll should be multiplied by 10, according to the Russian news website Kommersant. She said many deaths in the countryside were not part of the official total of yet. Refugees fleeing Kyrgyzstan's surge of ethnic violence have accused the central Asian nation's security forces of carrying out some of the deadly attacks. Emerging video and witness accounts point to units of the Kyrgyz military taking part in the violence. Uprooted people on both sides of the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border said they are frightened by the Kyrgyz military. Zuhra Khuchkarova, 48, said her son was killed not by an angry mob, but by the Kyrgyz Army on a killing rampage. ""He was shot in the street by soldiers sitting on top of a tank, surrounded by Kyrgyz men,"" she said. ""He was just 23 and had a pregnant wife. Now he'll never see his child."" She was sure it was the military, she said. No one else has tanks. Hikmat said soldiers protected people at first, but then turned and shot peaceful Uzbek civilians. Ikromjon, too, said he saw Kyrgyz troops spray a crowd with bullets in the southern city of Osh. The two only gave first names because they did not want to be identified. The refugees spoke of homes and businesses burned by rampaging militias, bodies in the streets and how their relatives were killed. And they shared video footage captured on their cell phones. One began with a crowd of Kyrgyz men, facing their ethnic Uzbek rivals. A few seconds in, there are gunshots and cheers. ""Hurray, they're coming,"" someone shouts in Kyrgyz, as an armored personnel carrier drives into the area amid more gunfire. In the pandemonium, a voice can be heard shouting: ""They're using live bullets, not blanks."" An aide to the interim president said he heard reports that Kyrgyz security forces were involved in shooting Uzbeks based on their ethnic background. However, he said he was not speaking on behalf of the government and that he believed the reports were mainly rumors and provocations. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake, who toured a refugee camp near the Uzbekistan border, urged the government to ensure a fair probe into the violence. ""I think that's going to be a very important element. Both a very substantial investigation and also that the perpetrators are held accountable,"" said Blake, the top American diplomat for Central Asia. Blake said he wants Kyrgyzstan authorities to investigate who carried out the attacks on ethnic Uzbeks and to bring those responsible to justice. Many refugees have found shelter along the Uzbekistan border in squalid refugee camps where food and medicine are in short supply. The U.N. World Food Programme planned to airlift food over the weekend to augment ongoing distributions. Starting Sunday, planes will carry 110 tons of high-energy biscuits from the agency's warehouse in Dubai to the region -- enough to provide daily rations for 206,000 refugees and displaced people, the agency said Saturday. The United Nations announced a $71 million emergency appeal for food, medicine and shelter for 500,000 victims of the violence that broke out on June 10. While many are encamped along the border, many are trapped in neighbourhoods in Osh. ""With a huge number of people displaced by the conflict, and thousands more trapped without food, water or supplies, there's not a moment to lose,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the WFP.","Government plans investigation of claims that troops were involved in ethnic violence .

"(CNN) -- It was 1981, and Cindy Morgan was filming what she was told would be a half-live-action, half-cartoon for Walt Disney Pictures on a completely black movie set. The director, Steve Lisberger, came up to her and told her that she was going to be flying a ""solar sailer"" ship, and at another point, she would cross a bridge -- two things that she didn't see in front of her. ""I asked him, 'What the hell is going on?' and he showed me these great Syd Mead graphics,"" Morgan said. Mead, an industrial designer, was in charge of special effects for the movie, called ""Tron."" It would be the first time that an entire world was created with computer animation. Twenty-eight years later, the movie, which cost a reported $17 million to make, has spawned a sequel, ""Tron: Legacy,"" with a much larger budget. What is it about this movie -- considered a box office flop at the time (it made $33 million, according to boxofficemojo.com) -- that made fans at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con go wild to get a surprise look at ""Legacy"" test footage? Interest has certainly remained high through the years. ""Wherever I would go in the world, no matter what language they spoke, the word 'Tron' would come up,"" said Bruce Boxleitner, who played the character of Tron and returns in the sequel. ""The computer culture was just starting up when we did 'Tron.' There was no internet,"" said Jeff Bridges, star of both films. ""I think [the fans are] guys who were raised on video games, and have a fondness for it."" You could certainly say that iReporter David Fike has a fondness for the ""Tron"" video game. ""Anytime I went anywhere with a 'Tron' arcade game, I was begging my parents for quarters,"" he said. Decades later, Fike owns an arcade console of his own, purchased at an auction. ""It had been in a Wal-Mart for most of its life and had some nicks and scratches,"" he said. ""I'm trying to restore the cabinet and get it as close as I can to making it look somewhat new."" And, of course, the movie has a special place in his heart. ""This was the first movie inside of a video game, so something sparked the imagination and fascinated me. It's probably still my favorite movie of all time despite how badly people reflect on it now,"" he said. Fike theorizes that, ""It was so different, and so ahead of its time that people just didn't get it."" Most people even somewhat familiar with the original movie remember the suits worn by characters inside the computer. ""The costumes were unbearable, there was no eating lunch in those things,"" Morgan said. Even so, the original movie's suits are a favorite among fans, no more so than iReporter Jay Maynard, who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and ""Tosh.0"" as ""Tron Guy."" ""What got me interested at the time the original came out was that I had just begun working as a mainframe systems programmer,"" Maynard said. ""I had always been interested in computers. This was the first time anyone tried showing what went on inside a computer."" Maynard isn't alone in being inspired by the movie in that way. At conventions, Morgan said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of ""Tron."" Fellow iReporter Joe Machos, a data processor at an insurance company at the time (not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie), saw the movie on opening day, July 9, 1982. ""I left that theater, as one might say, rapt,"" he said. ""It had taken me to another place."" He noted how, with its use of terms like RAM, ""rezzing,"" and ""end of line,"" it was far ahead of its time. ""It accurately predicted a future. We now have this thing called cyberspace. When you say that now, it resonates with people."" Machos also is a hard-core fan of all things Disney. During a trip to Disney's Tomorrowland, he left a comment with a woman who worked there asking, ""Where's 'Tron?'"" According to Machos, she asked him, ""Wasn't that a box office failure?"" Machos then pointed to an image from ""Fantasia"" -- which didn't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying, ""That was, too."" iReport: A chat with the cast of ""Tron: Legacy"" With the imminent release of the sequel, fans have been clamoring for a Blu-ray version of the original, which is quite difficult to find on DVD (Netflix's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on ""moratorium""). According to Disney, earlier DVD releases are simply out of circulation and a Blu-ray version that Lisberger is personally overseeing will be available early next year. ""What I think Disney is doing is smart,"" said Machos, who thinks it's a good idea to re-establish ""Tron"" for a new generation. He plans to be at the first midnight screening in costume. iReport: Jeff Bridges' ""zen thing"" in ""Tron: Legacy"" Aside from the technological, early cyberpunk aspects of ""Tron"" and other themes (Morgan sees a spiritual component to it; both films have something of a religious subtext), another explanation for its long-standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before. ""The recognizers, those giant staple looking things, I thought those were crazy cool,"" said iReporter Steve Hungsberg. ""I saw the new movie being promoted at Comic-Con and I bought one of each of the recognizer toys there. I also got one for my son. The recognizer was by far the coolest."" Fike hopes that ""Tron: Legacy"" will continue that tradition. ""I hope the disc battles are as epic as everyone that's already seen it is saying."" Just before catching a sneak preview of the movie, Maynard said, ""Everything that I've seen about the new film has impressed me immensely."" No matter the reason, there's just something about ""Tron."" As Morgan put it, ""Technology was no longer something dull and dry, technology became magical. That's the secret of 'Tron.'""","Fan anticipation is high for ""Tron: Legacy""

"New York (CNN) -- It was a busy night for New York Yankees Manager Joe Girardi -- not only did he lead his team to the World Series championship, but on his way home, he also helped the victim of a car accident get out of harm's way. According to Jason Zillo, spokesman for the Yankees, Girardi was heading home after his team's World Series win and celebration Wednesday night when he spotted a car that had crashed along a busy, curving stretch of highway on the outskirts of New York near the suburb of New Rochelle. The car was jutting into traffic. Girardi immediately stopped to check on the driver and help her out of the car, Zillo said. ""He wanted to make sure that if someone was in the car they were OK,"" Zillo said. ""And then he wanted to help her get away from a dangerous position in the highway."" Zillo said police officers arrived at the scene of the accident moments later. According to CNN affiliate WABC, the accident happened around 2:25 a.m. on the eastbound lanes of the Cross County Parkway at the Hutchinson River Parkway, when a woman lost control of her car along a long blind curve and crashed into a wall. Marie Henry, 27, of Stratford, Connecticut, said Girardi sprinted across three lanes of traffic to come to her aid. ""She had no idea who I was,"" Girardi said in a radio interview Thursday. A Westchester County police officer who arrived at the scene described Girardi in the good Samaritan role as ""totally surreal."" ""The guy wins the World Series, what does he do? He stops to help,"" Officer Kathleen Cristiano told local news Web site LoHud.com. The Westchester Police Department did not return calls from CNN. ""A lot of people know him as 'Joe Girardi, the manager of the New York Yankees,' but Joe is someone who puts other people first,"" Zillo said. ""The easy thing would have been for him to just drive by. But I think it shows a lot about his character.""","On way home from World Series win, Joe Girardi stops to help motorist .

"(CNN) -- We're keeping an eye on five high-profile cases this week. We may see a verdict in one (the Whitey Bulger trial), a sentence in another (the Bradley Manning case) and more fireworks in a third (the Nidal Hasan court-martial). Also this week, the lawyer for a teen whose Facebook post landed him in jail will argue that the case be thrown out. And we wait to see if a grand jury indicts former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez. 'WHITEY' BULGER CASE: Deliberations resume . After deliberating for 28 hours over four days, a federal jury broke for the weekend without announcing a verdict in the trial of reputed Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. The eight-man, four-woman panel will resume work Monday morning to process testimony from more than 70 witnesses and more than 800 exhibits compiled during the seven weeks of the trial. Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year ""reign of terror"" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. Patricia Donahue, the widow of one of Bulger's alleged victims, said she believed ""the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us."" Still, Donahue said, ""If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."" -- Deborah Feyerick and Kristina Sgueglia . See all the charges the jury will decide (PDF) Deliberations in 'Whitey' Bulger trial resume Monday . BRADLEY MANNING TRIAL: Awaiting a sentence . Last week, a military judge combined some of the criminal convictions in Bradley Manning's national security leak case, reducing his maximum possible prison sentence from 136 years to 90. But Col. Denise Lind has not indicated when she will sentence Manning. Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks. The leaks dealt with U.S. military strategy in Iraq to State Department cables outlining foreign relationships. They also included a secret military video from the Iraq war. Lind acquitted Manning of the most grievous charge of aiding the enemy, which carried a maximum life sentence. But she found him guilty of other counts that include violations of the Espionage Act. Lind could decide not to slap him with the maximum for each count. She may rule that he'll serve the sentences concurrently, rather than consecutively. The government is still presenting witnesses during the sentencing phase at Fort Meade, Maryland. The defense is expected to present several witnesses as well. -- Larry Shaughnessy .

When the admitted Fort Hood gunman's trial reconvenes Monday, prosecutors will continue their brisk march through the witness list. By the end of Friday, they had called 48 of their 80 witnesses in three days, a fast pace enabled in part by Nidal Hasan declining to cross-examine anyone in the first two days. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in a November 2009 shooting rampage at the Army post near Killeen, Texas. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage, admitted at the start of the trial that he was the shooter at the medical building where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan is representing himself, but has three attorneys as backup. The attorneys have asked to drop out of the case, saying they believed Hasan is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence. But the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, ruled Thursday that they must continue, saying it was ""nothing more than their disagreement with Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense."" -- Josh Rubin .

Justin Carter, a 19-year-old Texas teen, is facing a felony terrorism charge for posting, during an argument about a video game, what he said was a sarcastic comment. According to court documents, Cater wrote, ""I'm f***ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them."" His father said Carter followed the claim with ""LOL"" and ""J/K,"" indicating that the comment wasn't serious. Authorities said someone reported the comment, which came about two months after the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, leading to Carter's arrest February 21 on a felony charge of making terroristic threats. In Texas, that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. On Monday, at a pretrial hearing, Carter's lawyer will ask that the case be dismissed on First Amendment grounds. They say his comments were taken out of context, and that Carter made no real threat because he used the words, ""I think."" ""They need to look at the context of what's put online. Because if they would, they would have seen that it was sarcasm,"" said attorney Donald Flanary. -- Pamela Brown . Teen jailed for Facebook 'joke' released on bail . AARON HERNANDEZ MURDER CASE: Fiance in the spotlight . Investigators want to know if former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez asked his fiance to hide the .45 caliber gun used in the killing of Odin Lloyd. Llyod's bullet-riddled body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park on Father's Day, about a mile from Hernandez's home. He was shot five times. The gun has yet to be found. Prosecutors have accused the former New England Patriot of orchestrating the death. Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty to murder. He is being held without bail. On Friday, his hometown newspaper, The Bristol Press in Connecticut, reported on newly unsealed search warrants that seem to suggest that his fiance, Shayanna Jenkins, took a lock box from his North Attleboro home to a storage facility. Another defendant, Carlos Ortiz, allegedly told police that after the killing, Hernandez put two guns into a lock box. According to surveillance tapes, Jenkins carried a ""rigid object"" the size of a lock box from the home into a car. She returned about a half hour later without it. In the documents, police say Jenkins may either have dumped the gun in the woods or took them to the storage facility in Bristol, where Hernandez had rented a unit. CNN was unable to reach Hernandez's lawyers for comment. There's a probable cause hearing on Hernandez's first-degree murder charges on August 22, unless a grand jury that's looking into the case indicts him first. -- Susan Candiotti .

"(CNN) -- The family of Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national transplant policy, said Thursday her first biopsy shows no rejection of her donor lungs. Sarah, who was born with cystic fibrosis, had the lung transplant June 12 and is still unable to talk because of tubes in her throat. But in a video shared by her family Thursday -- the first one since her surgery -- Sarah waves and mouths ""hi"" and ""I love you"" to her mother, sitting off camera. The family said Sarah had surgery Wednesday to fix her diaphragm to support her new lungs. The biopsy was taken during the operation, they said. ""Sarah had a nice, stable night,"" the family wrote on a Facebook page set up for Sarah. ""Her pain is increased, but they seem to be able to manage it. Overall she seems relieved the surgery is over, sitting waiting yesterday made her very anxious."" The diaphragm surgery was Sarah's fourth in less than a month. Shortly after her lung transplant June 12, the donated lungs failed, and Sarah had emergency surgery to put her on a bypass machine that took over the work of the lungs. Sarah received a new set of lungs three days later. Her family explained later that the first set of lungs was in poor condition when Sarah received them, but they decided to proceed with the surgery because ""Sarah was out of time to wait."" The second set of lungs was infected with pneumonia, but again the family went ahead with the transplant because ""they were Sarah's best and only hope."" Since then, the family says, her lungs have improved with each day and continue to work better and better. Sarah was on the transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months. She wasn't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young; the agency that oversees transplants, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs. The family petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules so Sarah could qualify for adult lungs. They argued the rule was unfair, and several lawmakers also asked Sebelius to act. On June 5, the Murnaghans asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block Sebelius from having the organ network apply the rule. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the network to waive the rule in Sarah's case. The family said they never asked that Sarah be placed in front of anyone on the transplant list who was in a more serious condition. Days later, the organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates. The change is effective for a year, when it must be approved by the board of directors.","A biopsy shows no rejection of Sarah Murnaghan's donor lungs .

"Balcombe, United Kingdom (CNN) -- The fear of fracking has come to Britain, replete with worries about potential earthquakes and tap water tainted with natural gas that bursts into flames at the strike of a match..

Read more: 'Fracking' protesters say drilling jobs not worth environmental risks . The energy company Cuadrilla Resources has not applied for permission to frack, but that has not stopped hundreds of furious protesters from trying to block its work. They fear that if gas reserves are found, fracking will come in short order. Help from USA . Activists Jo and Karen strummed out a folksy tune on their guitars, singing: ""Frack attack.

Proponents: It's safe . And as in the United States, proponents of fracking argue that the boost in energy supply is enormous and the methods are safe. Read more: Opinion: Fracking is a threat to health and well-being . Cuadrilla believes there is about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas under the ground just within one of its local license areas. To put that figure into context, the United Kingdom uses about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a year, chief executive officer Francis Egan said. ""We are able absolutely to protect the environment and protect the way in which fracking is done,"" said Britain's energy minister Michael Fallon. ""If there is any risk it will be stopped immediately."" Read more: UK ministers consider offering communities fracking sweeteners . But the reassurances are not enough for many. A coalition of opponents to the drilling is growing. People who are otherwise political adversaries are uniting over the issue. Conservatives at risk . Concerned local conservatives have joined the ranks of traditional anti-fracking protesters from the radical left. Much of the gas exploration is taking place in rural regions that usually support the conservative party, which is in favor of drilling. Many of their constituents don't like the prospects of what fracking might do to their water supply in spite of potential the gains. ""We can't have an industry rolling into communities like this one and destroying it just for the sake of money,"" said Balcombe resident Katie Dunn.

"Flint, Michigan (CNN) -- A few weeks ago, Nicole Mansfield called her daughter in Flint, Michigan. She tried to calm Triana Jones down, but she had bad news. ""She said, 'I might not be home in a week, somebody stole my ID,' "" Jones recalled of the conversation almost a month ago. ""So she wasn't able to come home."" This wasn't a minor headache, part of the travail of international travel. Jones thought her mother could be in Syria, fighting alongside rebels in the country's bloody civil war. Nicole Mansfield had converted to Islam several years ago, her daughter told CNN Friday. Jones wept as she and Gregory Mansfield -- her mother's father -- talked to CNN about the horror they felt seeing images on the Internet this week of a dead woman they are convinced is Nicole Mansfield. Syrian state-run television aired a story saying that government forces had killed three Westerners. The video package shows a bullet-riddled car, weapons placed on the car hood, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. The camera pans close to bodies arranged in a row, lying on the ground. Mansfield's relatives told CNN they have no doubt she's one of them. Though it's unclear how the family knew to look on the Web to see the images, they say the FBI paid the Mansfield family a visit Thursday to ask them about reports that Mansfield was killed in Syria. ""The first time I saw those pictures I had to look again because I didn't even recognize her. I didn't believe it was my mom the first time I saw them,"" Jones told CNN, choking back tears. ""And then I had to look again and I looked at her body and her feet and her hands and her nose and her mouth. And I knew it was her."" Jones added that she's upset the pictures have gotten out, saying ""I shouldn't have to see my mother's body like that all over the media and the Internet."" She's also hurt by what people are saying about her mother -- like that she was a terrorist or a CIA agent. ""She was just an American woman who was misguided,"" Jones said. ""... And it really makes me sick to my stomach that people post such horrible things."" After showing the bodies, the Syrian television story shows shots of IDs; one of them appears to be Mansfield's. Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad killed three Westerners, an announcer says. The story also shows a picture of a British man. The UK Foreign Office confirmed Friday that a British national was killed in Syria and officials are trying to reach relatives. The United States is aware of the claim that an American woman was killed and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. Citing concerns that the privacy of a family could be jeopardized, the official declined further comment. CNN asked Jones why her mother might have wanted to go to Syria. ""I know that she was talking to people online and that they told her about the project in Syria,"" she answered. ""And that she was interested in going over there to help. But she didn't think it would be fighting. She told me there wouldn't be (guns) or anything. She would never be involved in that."" ""And they lied to her. They misled her and they took her and brought her over there, probably paid for her ticket and everything, and they kept her there.""

Another relative recently got a call from Nicole Mansfield in which she said she was gone, but she'd be back to the United States for a visit soon.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korean officials started talks Saturday on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex, a suspended joint factory that marked a symbol of cooperation between the two rivals. Each side sent a delegation of three members to Tongilgak, the South Korean Unification Ministry said. The administrative building is on the North Korean side of the neutral border village of Panmunjom. Kaesong, which is a bellwether of the two rivals' ties, was closed this spring -- a casualty of increasing tensions between the two sides. The agreement to hold talks came after North Korea conceded a demand by the South that contact between the two governments should precede visits to plants in the complex by business people, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. Timeline: North Korea's war of words escalates . Pyongyang had originally invited business people from South Korean companies to return to the zone to check on their facilities and equipment. The talks ""were in consideration of the damages to the companies operating in Kaesong after three months of suspension and the beginning of monsoon season,"" said Kim Hyung-suk, a spokesman for the South Korea's Unification Ministry. ""The Kaesong issue can only be resolved through dialogue by government authorities."" The operation was completely shut down in May when the last remaining South Korean workers left the facilities, but work had been winding down for about a month amid heightened tensions. In April, North Korea restricted South Korean workers' access to the zone. Workers had to leave when supplies such as food, water and raw materials were cut off. The North-South tensions seemed to be easing somewhat after Pyongyang agreed to high-level talks with the South in June. Those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements over the level of the delegates who would represent each side. On Wednesday, North Korea also restored the Panmunjom communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months. ""North Korea is probably feeling an unprecedented level of diplomatic isolation with pressures coming from the international community. It is also fully aware of the value of the Kaesong industrial complex, which provides a considerable amount of hard foreign currency,"" said Kim Tae-woo, former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""But stirring tensions, then going back to dialogue, is part of North Korea's usual tactics. We don't need to attach too much weight to this easing of tension,"" he added. North Korea already had barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before May. In 2008, access was restricted after a human rights group distributed propaganda leaflets via balloon into North Korea. South Korean workers were blocked again in 2009 during an annual U.S.-South Korean military drill. Some $2 billion worth of goods have been produced in Kaesong between initial operations in 2005 and the end of 2012, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean ministry. North Korean authorities take about 45% of their wages for various taxes. CNN's Diana Magnay and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Talks are held on the North Korean side of a neutral border village .

"(CNN) -- Kay and Mike Alexander's journey to obesity is a familiar road for many married couples. Neither was overweight when they met on a coffee break at work. Nor were they obese when they cut their wedding cake, iced with an image of Star Trek's USS Enterprise. But over time, working and raising foster children in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the pounds added up. ""I put on about five to 10 pounds per year for 20 years,"" Kay Alexander says. At age 55, she says she was ""one blood test away from being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes,"" when she started having chest pains. Remembering that her father died of a heart attack when he was only 55, she went to the hospital. There, a doctor told her she too had had a heart attack -- one that, without medical attention, would have left her with only hours to live. ""That was the big trigger,"" she says. At 5 feet, 4 inches tall, she was closing in on 300 pounds. She knew she had to lose weight, but also knew from experience that dieting wasn't the answer. Her husband, whose body mass index had increased from 23 to 34 since graduating college, agreed. So instead of cutting their portion sizes down to starvation rations, the Alexanders decided to rely on their training as chemical engineers. They began tinkering with recipes to see if they could reduce the calorie counts of their favorite foods. ""We put our food on a diet,"" says Kay Alexander. ""Dilution is the solution to pollution. That (theory) doesn't work for environmental engineering in the long run, but does work for food."" The Alexanders' strategy is a powerful one, says Rachel Berman, director of nutrition for Caloriecount.com, a site Kay Alexander used to calculate calorie totals for her new recipes. Berman, also a registered dietician, uses the Alexanders' approach in counseling and has seen patients experiment with it in their homes. ""Deprivation does not work in the long run,"" she says. ""And Kay and Mike are a great example of how to turn this into a lifestyle change."" It took four or five months of experimenting to re-engineer some of their favorite recipes and start losing weight, according to Mike Alexander. The key to the new recipes, says his wife, was minimizing the amount of carbohydrates and maximizing the amount of vegetables. ""A lot of what we did was kind of tricking the mind and stomach,"" she says. ""For every food we took out, I tried to put one new one in."" They reinvented many of their favorite dishes, such as mashed potatoes, substituting cauliflower for the potatoes. They traded the white rice in chicken stir-fry for high-fiber pita wraps. They even replaced the pasta in baked spaghetti with a self-invented broccoli slaw. Over the next year and a half, Kay Alexander lost more than 130 pounds. Mike Alexander lost 65. ""We're still trying to do cookies and treats that are low-calorie,"" he says. ""She has a meringue cookie that's 4 or 5 calories. We believe food companies should engineer their foods to be low-calorie, like we've done."" By using a scientific approach, the couple turned weight loss into a project they could work on together. Before they started experimenting with recipes, Mike Alexander did most of the cooking from boxed foods. Now they collaborate on recipes; she does most of the cooking and he handles the cleanup. ""It was part intellectual and part doing it,"" he says. ""It was really good for our marriage."" In addition to counting calories, Kay Alexander exercised more. She started out wearing a pedometer. Over time, her steps increased from 3,500 per day to about 17,000. ""(The amount I now walk) almost makes me like an Amish person,"" she jokes. Exercise significantly increased Kay Alexander's energy level, says Taylor Rose, 19, who calls the Alexanders her grandparents. She describes her grandmother as a health nut, and says she enjoys going shopping with her now because the older woman doesn't have to stop every few minutes to catch her breath. ""We can share clothes now,"" she says. ""I love that."" Kay Alexander is retired; her husband will join her in about six years. He's glad he chose to drop the weight slowly because it is more indicative of a successful lifestyle change than a diet. He knows retirement will expose him to more chances to eat poorly and excessively. ""I'm trying to develop how I'm going to keep (the weight) off,"" he says. Have you lost weight?

"(CNN) -- Reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, visibly annoyed, muttered under his breath ""You're a f---ing liar"" Thursday as a disgraced former FBI supervisor testified that there was ""no question"" the Irish gangster doubled as an informant for FBI Boston. Prosecutor Brian Kelly requested that the judge in Bulger's federal trial advise Bulger to ""keep his little remarks to himself,"" which Judge Denise Casper advised shortly after. Both sets of attorneys have spent a remarkable amount of time during the trial of the notorious Bulger, charged with 19 murders and in court after living in hiding for 16 years, trying to prove whether Bulger was an informant during a 15-year period. Even Judge Casper is beginning to question the importance of the issue. During post-court discussion over motions, as the defense was attempting to further it's argument that Bulger's informant records were forged by his FBI handler, Judge Casper questioned, ""How does that address that your client is not guilty of crimes here?"" Bulger's attorney J.W. Carney danced around the question and responded, ""Bulger was not providing information as an informant, he was providing money so that he'd get tipped off about wire taps and search warrants."" Bulger's attorneys have been quick to admit to acts of extortion and racketeering -- charges Bulger is also facing -- to defend their client's position that he was not another ""rat"" from South Boston. ""Why can't both be true?"" Judge Casper inquired. ""The defendant's position is (that) only one is true."" Carney said. ""Why would James Bulger be paying all this money to all these people if the government's theory is he got all this protection because he was providing information. Why would he keep paying everybody?"" Former FBI supervisor John Morris, an addition to the government's long list of cooperating witnesses, testified Thursday that he took bribes from Bulger in the amount of $7,000, along with a silver-plated champagne bucket and two cases of imported wine. Morris said he asked Bulger if he could ""spring"" for a plane ticket for his secretary girlfriend to visit him during FBI training in Georgia, and Bulger obliged. Morris admitted to his acts of corruption in 1997 in exchange for immunity. A sheepish, red-faced Morris, though less than six feet away from Bulger, avoided eye contact with the defendant, who glared steadily at his old confidant throughout his testimony. This is the first time the two have seen each other since they cut ties in 1991 after Morris leaked Bulger's informant status to the Boston Globe. Morris said he first met Bulger at a dinner he hosted his Lexington, Massachusetts, home in 1978 along with Bulger's FBI handler John Connolly, whom he characterized as his ""best friend."" Morris said he met Bulger and later his associate Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi eight to 10 times in various places, including Morris' home, Morris' girlfriend's apartment, a hotel, Bulger's home and even in Flemmi's mother's house for dinner. Flemmi's mother cooked. The defense has previously argued that Bulger was not treated like an informant, and thus did not believe that he was. Morris testified that Connolly preferred to meet Bulger in ""pleasant surroundings, not the type of surroundings you would meet a normal informant,"" like in a hotel or car. ""He wanted Mr. Bulger to be comfortable,"" Morris said. Morris was supervisor to rogue FBI agent Connolly, who is currently serving a 40-year sentence on second-degree murder charges for leaking the identities of witnesses cooperating against Bulger's Winter Hill Gang. Flemmi, serving a life sentence, is set to testify against Bulger later in this trial after agreeing to cooperate with the government to evade the death penalty in 1997. All that Bulger and Flemmi wanted from their handlers in exchange for information was ""a head start,"" as Morris described -- to be tipped off if they were going to be indicted or charged so they could flee. The pair, according to Morris, knew they were ""fair game"" and acknowledged that they were engaging in criminal activity and at some point they might get charged. If that happened, they didn't want their identity as informants disclosed and would rather ""take the risk"" Morris said. Morris admitted to tipping his informants off to wire taps, and keeping their names out of a 1975 horse race indictment. He testified that the Mafia, or La Cosa Nostra, was the main priority of the FBI in Boston and that Bulger and his partner Flemmi were instrumental in the take-down of those mobsters. The two provided the agents with a drawing of Mafia headquarters, and that was used to take down the New England Mafia in a 1983 sting. After being tipped off to an indictment, Bulger went on the run for 16 years and landed himself on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in his Santa Monica. California, home with his girlfriend in 2011. Morris said that he signed off on reports Bulger provided to the FBI that he knew were false lies to protect himself from being implicated as the person to who leaked sensitive information that may have tipped Bulger off to witnesses that were cooperating against him. Those potential witnesses were eventually murdered, Morris said, and Bulger has been charged in their killings. While the defense had little time to cross-examine Morris, who will be back on the stand Friday, defense attorney Hank Brennan painted Morris to be a liar, an adulterer, and a fraud. He was able to fire off a question that is likely to resound with the jury. ""You were corrupt, weren't you Mr. Morris?"" Brennan queried. ""Yes,"" Morris exhaled after a long pause and a deep breath.","A former FBI agents is asked: ""You were corrupt, weren't you?""

"(CNN) -- A legal fight is under way in Pennsylvania that could decide if the socially conservative state legalizes same-sex marriage. A county clerk in suburban Philadelphia has given nearly 100 same-sex couples marriage licenses, even though the state bans same-sex marriage. D. Bruce Hanes, the elected register of wills in Montgomery County, has been doing this for about a month, and the state Department of Health is now taking him to court to try to make him stop. The case could lead to a reversal of the state's version of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, if a judge were to side with Hanes in finding that the ban on same-sex marriage contradicts the state's constitution. In June, in the case U.S. v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key part of DOMA, which defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. Hanes told CNN that about four weeks ago, he was approached by a lesbian couple wanting a marriage license. Instead of immediately saying ""no,"" Hanes and his solicitor reviewed the state's constitution and decided that language about civil rights, happiness and liberty applied to same-sex couples who want to get married. ""We've either got to change the constitution -- permit discrimination on the basis of sex, permit civil rights to be frustrated -- or change the interpretation of that marriage act or change the marriage act. You can't have it both ways,"" he said. Hanes has received dozens of thank-you cards, and his office benches are filling up with same-sex couples driving from across the state to get marriage licenses. But not everyone is on board. The state filed a petition to make him stop, citing a law passed by the state legislature in 1996 that defines marriage as ""between one man and one woman."" At least one lawmaker says Hanes has gone rogue. ""He's a lowly elected official in a county office who is not elected to set policy, but to administer the law as it's been passed,"" state lawmaker Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican, said Friday. ""For a man to start violating the law as he has and commit such a lawless act should be offensive to everyone, no matter what side of the issue you're on."" Metcalfe says he believes the marriage licenses are invalid. ""It doesn't matter how many licenses he issues, they're not worth the paper he's printing them on,"" he said. He also said he's drafting legislation to have the state's attorney general, Kathleen Kane, impeached because she said she believed she couldn't defend the state's version of DOMA. His legislation will be introduced when the state legislature returns in September. Metcalfe is also calling for Hanes to be impeached and says he's gotten a lot of support. The petition filed by the Department of Health states that Hanes is in ""direct defiance"" of that law and that he ""risks causing serious and limitless harm to the public."" Kane is not commenting on the case, since her office isn't handling the petition. But earlier this year, she said she came to the same conclusion as Hanes: The state's version of DOMA conflicted with the state constitution. ""DOMA is wholly unconstitutional. It cannot be fixed,"" she said in early July when the American Civil Liberties Union sued Pennsylvania after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Windsor case. Danny Cevallos, a prominent Pennsylvania civil and criminal attorney, says this is exactly the kind of case that could end up deciding the fate of same-sex marriage in the state. Laws, he said, are made this way all the time. ""The issue is going to be whether or not a reading of the constitution can be read to override the state law ban on marriages,"" Cevallos said. ""The state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania could review this and strike down the state ban."" In the meantime, it's unclear whether same-sex couples with marriage licenses in the state would qualify for benefits. But for now, Cevallos says, Pennsylvania has become the 14th state to have legal same-sex marriages. Hanes says he doesn't see himself as a crusader -- just an elected official doing his job. ""In the ordinary course of business, two people are coming into my office, sitting on a bench, waiting to get a marriage license, and they're getting those marriage licenses regardless of their gender,"" he said. ""This is the way it ought to be, and that's the way I would like it to be."" One thank-you note that arrived at his office reads, ""If possible I would like to have your autograph."" ""That's interesting,"" Hanes said. ""I haven't done that.""","A county clerk has given nearly 100 same-sex couples marriage licenses .

"(CNN) -- Police in Mexico City have detained three people in the mysterious disappearance of 12 people from a nightclub, the city's attorney general said. And for the first time since the disappearance, Attorney General Rodolfo Rios confirmed there is evidence showing that the people who are missing had indeed been at the club. The names of the detainees -- one woman and two waiters from the Heavens After bar -- were not released. Officials said they are looking at the link between the woman and the waiters, but did not say what charges, if any, they might face. Before Tuesday's announcement, the relatives of the missing people -- one of them only 16 years old -- insisted that they had been kidnapped from the after-hours bar in Mexico City's Zona Rosa entertainment district. But police had said there was no proof that that the 12 had even been there. ""There is evidence that the majority of the youths arrived at Heaven in two vehicles, one private and a taxi, but it is unknown how they left,"" Rios said. Still, he said, there is no evidence that an armed convoy snatched the group, as the families say. The attorney general also upped the number of missing to 12 from 11, saying that another family had come forward. The top prosecutor met with the families of the missing to give them an update. ""We are not interested in who took them, we are not interested in any of that, whether they will be punished, or not punished doesn't interest us,"" said Carlos Ruiz, the father of one of the missing. ""Our interest is that they all return alive."" Not all of the 12 people said to be involved knew each other, but most of them hail from the Tepito neighborhood, a place known for its rough character. That alone has added spice to an already sensational story, leading to speculation that gangs could be involved. The young people were taken from the Heavens After nightclub on Sunday, May 26, between 10 a.m. and noon, family members say. They were forced into a van and kidnapped, they claim. A center for missing persons in Mexico will distribute photos and information about the missing young people across the country. A mass kidnapping would be a significant development because even through the years of drug cartel violence, the capital was a relatively safe place. Recently, however, there is evidence that infighting between local criminal groups is on the rise. More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry. Authorities don't have data on how many of the disappearances were connected with organized crime.","Three people have been detained in connection with the disappearance of 12 people .

"(CNN) -- Soccer superstar David Beckham has re-signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy, extending his stay with the team for another two years, the Major League Soccer team announced Wednesday. Beckham, 36, known just as much for being an international sex symbol as a sportsman, had the best season of his five-year MLS career in 2011, helping lead the club to its first championship since 2005. ""I've seen firsthand how popular soccer is now in the States and I'm as committed as ever to growing the game here,"" Beckham said about the deal. ""My family and I are incredibly happy and settled in America and we look forward to spending many more years here."" Despite ""many offers from clubs from around the world,"" the former England captain said he is still passionate about playing in the United States. Who are January's top transfer targets? At one stage he had been expected to return to Europe during the January transfer window as part of his attempt to earn a place in Great Britain's team for the 2012 Olympics in his home city of London. ""David had many options and we are pleased he felt comfortable, not only with our organization but also with Los Angeles, and will remain an important part of our club, our AEG family and our city,"" Tim Leiweke, president and CEO of AEG, said in a statement. The two-time MLS all-star Beckham has tallied 31 assists and 11 goals for the Galaxy in 74 games. He had a league best four postseason assists last year. ""I felt that he was one of the best players in all of MLS last season and we could not have achieved the success that we did without him,"" said Bruce Arena, Galaxy general manager and head coach. ""We look forward to trying to replicate that success this season with David once again in a Galaxy uniform."" Before joining the Galaxy midseason in 2007, Beckham played for Real Madrid in the Spain's top division, where he was one of soccer's most recognizable faces. The former Manchester United star is credited with increasing the sport's popularity in the United States and around the world. A 2002 feature-length film entitled ""Bend it Like Beckham"" paid homage to the midfielder's impressive ability at dead-ball situations. ""We have made great progress over the past five years in raising the profile of soccer domestically and the MLS on a worldwide stage, and we are encouraged by all the results,"" said Simon Fuller, Beckham's business partner and manager. ""His new deal confirms our commitment to continuing our journey and making sure the world's biggest sport, soccer, continues to grow in the world's most passionate sports-loving nation, the USA."" In the five years since Beckham's arrival, the MLS has experienced ""exponential growth,"" increasing from 12 teams in 2006 to 19 teams this season, with average attendance rising to 17,872, a statement from the Galaxy said.","David Beckham's 2011 season was best of his five-year MLS career .

"(CNN) -- Think of the greatest American sports stars of all time and names like Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali and Serena Williams will likely spring to mind. But long before these champions smashed the record books -- and blazed a trail in the public's imagination -- the first generation of black U.S. athletes dominated an unlikely sport. The godfathers of Owens, Ali and Williams weren't stereotypical towering, musclebound men found on basketball courts or in boxing rings. Instead, they were the jockeys of the race track and their dizzying success -- and dramatic fall -- is one of the most remarkable buried chapters in U.S. sporting history. When the country's most prestigious horse race, the Kentucky Derby, launched in 1875, 13 of the 15 jockeys were African-American. Much like the NBA today, black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades, winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies. ""They were the premier horsemen in the world,"" says Joe Drape, author of ""Black Maestro,"" which tells the story of champion jockey Jimmy Winkfield. ""It was the first professional sport for black athletes in America. They were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living."" Decades before Jackie Robinson made history in 1947 as the first black major league baseball player, African American jockeys forged a name as the first sports heroes of post-Civil War America. The son of a former slave, Isaac Murphy was the first jockey to win three Kentucky Derbies -- in 1884, 1890, 1891. He went on to win an unheard-of 44% of all his competitions, becoming the first rider inducted into the National Racing Hall of fame. ""Murphy was the first millionaire black athlete,"" Drape told CNN. ""He even had a white valet."" Many of these jockeys had been slaves in the South, working as stable hands and becoming skilled horse handlers. Plantation owners put them on the backs of horses in informal -- and dangerous -- competitions. When horse racing became an organized sport in the early 19th-Century, black jockeys were already leaders in the saddle. Yet fast forward to today and you'd struggle to find an African-American jockey on a U.S. race track. Just 30 of the around 750 members of the national Jockey's Guild are black, according to the most recent figures available. Winkfield was the last African American to win the Kentucky Derby -- in 1901 and 1902 -- and by 1921 they had all but disappeared. It would be 79 years before another black rider, Marlon St. Julien, competed in 2000. The introduction of the Jim Crow laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like Winkfield and Murphy. Increasing violence against black jockeys forced many to abandon racing and move to northern urban areas, says Drape. ""It became too dangerous to put black riders on horses,"" he added. ""An influx of Irish immigrants were now slugging it out on the track, riding black jockeys into railings and making them fall."" Other riders, such as Winkfield, fled to Russia -- which had a thriving horse racing industry. ""The Russians were colorblind, you had jazz players and heavyweight boxers like Jack Johnson -- it was basically the last place black American sportsmen could go,"" Drape said. Here, Winkfield's career skyrocketed as he won the Russian Derby four times and amassed a fortune. He was treated like a celebrity, socializing with aristocrats in Tzar Nicholas II's court and marrying two white European countesses. Decades later, segregation still ruled America, and when Sports Illustrated invited Winkfield to a reception at the Brown Hotel in Louisville in 1961, he was told he couldn't enter by the front door. Today, Deshawn Parker is perhaps the most successful of the few black jockeys competing in the states, boasting more than 4,000 career victories. The 42-year-old, who won the most U.S. events in 2010 and 2011, entered the sport after his father worked as a racing official. ""Black people aren't on the track like they used to be,"" he said. ""If you don't have someone in your family who's in the business, you don't have a reason to start racing."" Parker, the 54th-ranked jockey of all time, says racing is now dominated by Latinos. Terry Meyock, national manager of the Jockey's Guild, agreed, estimating that 60% of jockeys in the U.S. are Latinos. Of the current top-10 highest earning jockeys, nine are from South America. ""From black to Irish to Latino, jockeys in America tend to mirror immigration,"" Drape said. ""The conditions are the same as 200 years ago -- the best jockeys tend to be from rural countries, they grow up around horses, it's tradition and it's a family business."" For Parker, jockeys like Murphy and Winkfield didn't just change the face of racing -- they paved the way for generations of black American sports stars. ""They got black athletes in the door,"" he said. ""It's an honor to be ranked among them.""","First black American sports stars weren't basketball players -- they were jockeys .
Many became skilled horse handlers while working as slaves in the south .
Today, just a few black jockeys compete on U.S. race tracks .

"(CNN) -- Why would someone allegedly steal a pickup truck and guns in Montana and then go to the University of Washington area with Molotov cocktails and a bullet-resistant vest? Police say they're trying to figure that out. University officers arrested Justin Miles Jasper, a 21-year-old Nevada man, on Wednesday night after finding him near the Seattle school in a truck that had been reported stolen recently from a Butte, Montana, residence, campus police Chief John Vinson said Thursday. Investigators found Molotov cocktails, a ballistic vest and two allegedly stolen guns -- a scoped rifle and a shotgun -- in the truck's bed after getting consent to search it, Vinson told reporters. Vinson said he believed no ammunition was found. Investigators were trying to get a warrant to search the truck's cab Thursday, university police said. ""We have no idea what his intentions were,"" Vinson said. ""... We don't have any information that would suggest any type of attack, but this is an active, ongoing investigation."" Prosecutors said Jasper also had detailed maps of three university campuses -- University of Washington, South Seattle Community College, and Seattle University -- in his possession, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. Bail has been set at $2 million for Jasper, CNN affiliate KING reported. Police said Jasper is not a University of Washington student and that they're trying to figure out whether he has any connections to the area, and why he was in Seattle. Police initially found him sleeping in the truck on campus on Tuesday, a day before the arrest, Vinson said. At the time, a check of the plate found nothing, so they sent him on his way. But on Wednesday, ""the vehicle was entered as stolen from Montana,"" so officers looked for the vehicle and stopped it not far from campus at about 10:30 p.m., Vinson said.

Vinson said he had no reason to believe the university -- which he said had few students or staff heading into the Fourth of July -- is under any threat. But police still have questions. ""Anytime that you have someone who has body armor ... long guns and also incendiary devices, that's a significant concern,"" said Jim Pugel, interim chief of the Seattle Police Department, which is helping university police in the case.

"Naypyidaw, Myanmar (CNN) -- Around seven years ago, a sparse tract of land north of the cluttered chaos of Yangon was anointed Myanmar's new capital by the country's former military leaders. Buildings were hastily erected in the new city of Naypyidaw to cater to an influx of arrivals, and later dozens of hotels moved in to meet demand for foreign visitors. These hotels sit one after the other on the sides of an eight-lane highway lined with newly planted trees. They are all but full this week as more than 900 guests bed down for two days of talks around the typically wordy World Economic Forum theme of ""Courageous Transformation for Inclusion and Integration."" Two years ago, the world watched with a mixture of skepticism and awe as President Thein Sein took office and set about unraveling decades of oppressive military rule. On Tuesday in a national radio address, the Burmese president took another step forward by announcing the imminent release of all political prisoners. Since taking power in 2010, Thein Sein has freed dozens of prisoners of conscience, but activists have been pushing for the release of around 200 more. According to state run newspaper, the New Light of Myanmar, Thein Sein said the prisoner release scheme was executed ""with the sheer intention of forging national reconciliation,"" adding that political gain was not the government's motive. Thein Sein's efforts to rectify the wrongs of the past have scored him political points with foreign leaders and investors, however not all locals are convinced that the country's transformation is doing anything for them. Early Tuesday morning in the busy Bogalay Market in downtown Yangon, traders told CNN that they had seen little change. Change in Myanmar: The market view . Win Shwe stood in a long coat at the market entrance, raising his hand every now and then as if to bless passersby. The 72-year-old was begging for a note or two of the local currency, the kyat. The typically dirty, crumpled notes are worth about 940 to one U.S. dollar. Two hundred kyat gets you a ride on a crowded bus. More buys a decent meal. ""This is a transformation time. But for poor people, nothing's changed. The government mechanism is corruption,"" he said, dropping his hand rolled cigarette onto the floor. Nearby, Khin Than Win, 52, sits with her daughter Yin Yin Htay at their flower stall. ""I agree that this is a transformation time,"" she says. ""But I see that the streets and the roads are wider than before. That's the only change."" Thein Sein said Tuesday that the country's transition from military rule to democracy will take time. ""As the task is huge, there have been tangible changes rather than vivid changes. When there are vivid changes, our national economy will make progress with momentum,"" he said. There are fears though that any progress in the national economy hinges on the country's ability to dampen ethnic tensions that have recently flared in northern parts of the country. At least 50 people have been arrested after rioting in Lashio, which erupted last week after a Buddhist woman was allegedly doused in petrol and set alight, according to the Myanmar Times. A mosque, Islamic school and hundreds of houses and businesses owned by Muslims were torched before the government imposed martial law and sent in troops. It follows the murder of Muslim children and teachers in Meiktila by an angry mob in March. The government has achieved some success in negotiating peace with ethnic rebels around the country, most recently signing a seven-point agreement in Kachin State, but the religious violence is relatively new and poses additional problems for the country's leaders. On Thursday, Thein Sein officially opened the World Economic Forum in Naypyidaw to an audience eager for assurance that problems can be resolved. Myanmar is due to assume the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) next year, giving it once more a leading role in the region after decades in the dark. Over the past two years, most sanctions have slowly lifted and the shroud of fear that kept locals from talking has slipped away. Money has poured in as foreign investors spied the rare opportunity to enter a market long deprived of choice and, in many cases, basic public services. This week, U.S. beverage giant Coca-Cola made its move, opening a bottling plant to meet demand with a local source almost 60 years after it pulled out. ""This is a market of 60 plus million consumers just embarking on a journey to join the world community if you like. In a way the same excitement when we saw the Berlin Wall came down,"" CEO Muhtar Kent told CNN. Excitement over the possibility of new growth is being tempered by very real concerns as the country works to repair years of neglect, cronyism and the deep mistrust of its people.","Two years ago, Myanmar started unraveling decades of military rule .

"(CNN) -- The Cleveland kidnapping drama was unfolding on the airwaves, hour after hour, a riveting spectacle that was overshadowing every other conceivable story. Nothing could possibly bump it from the nation's television screens -- or so I thought. When word came Wednesday afternoon that a verdict had been reached in the Jodi Arias murder trial, the focus of the cable news universe immediately shifted from Ohio to Arizona, where the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. It was a day of anguish and emotion -- and a revealing Rorschach test of media values. In an age of school shootings and marathon bombings, hard-bitten journalists have grown accustomed to reporting on human depravity. But there is something about what happened in Cleveland that tears at the heart. Yes, the story went wall to wall, overshadowing virtually everything else, except for the Fox News coverage of the congressional hearing on the attack in Benghazi. But the crimes in Cleveland deserve to be big news precisely because they border on the unimaginable. Three teenage girls vanish in separate incidents, only to be freed nearly a decade later from some modern-day house of horrors? Ropes and chains, according to city officials, are found in the home? Amanda Berry, who made that anguished 911 call, has a baby ? If you don't think that's a story, you are lacking a heart. The Arias trial, in my view, is very different. It became a national soap opera because many media organizations were drawn to the graphic sexual testimony -- in voice mails, texts and so on -- that could be trumpeted for ratings and clicks. It was hardly big news when the unknown Arias killed her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008 -- such murders are sadly common. The level of savagery -- 27 stab wounds, a slit throat, a gunshot to the head -- may have been unusual, but it was the trial's explicit sexual evidence that provided the hook. Arias was soon slotted into the Amanda Knox/Casey Anthony category of attractive white women in trouble. The Cleveland saga, by contrast, conjures up every parent's worst nightmare: three teenage girls disappearing for years, their fate unknown and, we now know, according to police, raped in captivity. London's Daily Mail scored an interview with the son of suspect Ariel Castro, plus exclusive photos of Castro in the frame house where women were held. Since the British tabloids are known for paying for information, how did the Mail obtain from Anthony Castro what hordes of American journalists could not? ""We did not pay him either for the interview or for the photos,"" Daily Mail reporter Michael Zennie told me. ""He spoke with us because he wanted to have his story represented."" Anthony Castro told the Mail in the interview that his father padlocked the doors leading to the basement, attic and garage where Amanda Berry and two other women were allegedly kept, never allowing his family inside. ""If it's true that he took her captive and forced her into having sex with him and having his child and keeping her hidden and keeping them from sunlight, he really took those girls' lives,"" Anthony Castro was quoted as saying, adding: ""He deserves to be behind bars for the rest of her life."" The fast-moving Cleveland story does have its media circus aspects. On Wednesday the cable news channels, taking their cue from police, were bannering an expected public statement by Berry. But it was her sister, Beth Serrano, who spoke briefly to the assembled media mob, making a plea for the family's privacy. And it was a little much when Berry's grandmother allowed a local station to videotape her first call from Amanda -- a moment that feels like it should have remained private. In a more uplifting vein, Charles Ramsey, a local dishwasher who heard screams from the house and broke down the door, has been making the television rounds. Many people are ""saying you're a hero,"" CNN's Anderson Cooper told him. ""No, no, no,"" Ramsey replied. ""Bro, I'm a Christian, an American, and just like you. We bleed same blood, put our pants on the same way."" Many questions remain, to say the least, about how the kidnapping succeeded for so many years and whether the police fell short. But whatever media excesses unfold in the coming days, the story of the Cleveland women commands our attention as a matter of human compassion. The sooner that Jodi Arias fades from the headlines, the better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Story of kidnapped women in Cleveland is a riveting one .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A volcano that had been inactive for more than 400 years erupted in Indonesia early Sunday, causing thousands of people to flee their homes, officials said. Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province had been inactive since the 1600s, but spewed volcanic ash nearly a mile into the air Sunday, said Surono, head of the country's volcanology and geology agency. ""We don't know the character of this volcano because it's been dormant for so long,"" he said. There were no reports of casualties or injuries. ""The situation is under control. Emergency response teams are already on the scene,"" said Priyadi Kardono of the National Disaster Management Agency. Officials have evacuated 12,000 residents living in 14 villages near the volcano, which erupted just after 12:15 a.m. Sunday (1:15 p.m. ET Saturday), the official Antara news agency reported. ""We felt strong tremors last night. It was a volcanic quake,"" Indonesian Red Cross worker Muhammad Isral told the agency. ""After that, the crater of Mount Sinabung spewed glowing lava. And trees in the mount slopes were burnt. It was followed by thick clouds that caused visibility to be only about five meters."" On Saturday, the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation issued a warning and ordered evacuation of a 6 km (3.7 miles) radius around the volcano. Surano said investigators are monitoring and studying the volcano. Based on the data they have now, he said, a large, destructive eruption is unlikely. No hazardous gas had been detected after Sunday's eruption, he said. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","Officials say there are no reports of casualties or injuries so far .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French Senate early Thursday narrowly passed a controversial law to allow many more shops across the country to open on Sundays, in what would be a significant cultural shift. The law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones. The vote, which followed two days of debate, was expected to happen Friday. But the Senate put the measure to a vote at 2 a.m. Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), when it passed 165-159. The law, however, is not a fait accompli. The opposition Socialist party immediately appealed to the Constitutional Council, asking it to make sure the measure is constitutionally sound. A decision from the council is expected in about two weeks. If the Constitutional Council approved the law, it would mark a significant cultural shift in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century. A 1906 law forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. President Nicolas Sarkozy had pushed for the measure, but the law that passed Thursday contains fewer changes than Sarkozy had originally intended, because he has had to give in to opposition from the left and the right. Socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays.  Watch how new law will change a way of life in France » . Members of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances that it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day. The law would permit shops, department stores and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called ""exceptional commercial"" centers in and near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles and Lille. Those centers are malls or clusters of shopping centers often located just outside major cities. Additionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays. Among other things, the new law would straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores manage to obtain exceptions from the old law and others don't, and in which some stores find it makes sense to accept fines for breaking the existing law, because the income from Sunday sales more than makes up for the penalties. Opinion polls in France showed slightly more than half the population wanted shops to have the freedom to open on Sundays, according to Time magazine. CNN's Jim Bittermann and Niki Cook contributed to this report.","French Senate passes new law allowing more shops to open on Sundays .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in New Orleans on Wednesday ordered BP to put up nearly $130 million for the next three months of Gulf oil spill settlements despite the oil company's complaints about excessive costs. BP has alleged the Court Supervised Settlement Program has been approving excessive or false claims from people or businesses that say they were damaged by the Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010. The company balked at providing the $128 million-plus budget program administrators presented it with in July, telling the court Monday that it had ""significant concerns"" about the program's ""poor productivity and excessive costs,"" according to court papers.

""The CSSP also acknowledged that the information BP sought is readily available,"" Morrell said. ""BP offered interim funding to cover currently payable invoices while it reviewed that information. Nevertheless, the Court declined to order the CSSP to provide that information and instead ordered BP to fully fund the CSSP's nearly $130 million budget.""

"(CNN) -- Whether it is Nairobi, Dubai or London, a major airport is the heart to an economy -- especially one dependent on exports and tourism. Kenya is dependent on both, after it worked over the last decade to become, in particular, a major tea and flower exporter. A third of all flowers in Europe come from Kenya, with a special emphasis on rose production. And nearly everyone has come across Kenyan green beans, whether you live in Europe, the Middle East or Asia. Read more: Kenya airport resuming some flights after massive fire . Jomo Kenyatta is the busiest airport in East Africa and the fourth busiest in sub-Sahara Africa, with six and a half million passengers. Kenyan authorities are working to normalize operations as quickly as possible, with a sizable effort to shift international traffic into the domestic terminal so flights from outside Africa can re-start Thursday. Watch more: Firefighters battle huge blaze . Jane Ngige, CEO of the Kenya Flower Council, told CNN this is the low season for flower exports, and therefore there is not a warehousing overflow yet. She has advised growers to hold back the cutting of their products until there is clarity at Kenyatta airport. The other two airports -- Mombassa on the East coast and Kisumu in the West -- don't have the refrigeration capacity to manage Kenya's export requirements, she told CNN. Kenya is East Africa's largest economy and has made a big push to carve out its space in the global market. Tea, horticulture and tourism all bring in about $1 billion in revenue each year.

The Kenyan Tourism Board says the country attracted 1.78 million visitors last year, with revenues of just over $1 billion, but the ambitious target to three million may need to be re-worked depending on how long the rebuilding of the terminal takes and what a follow up investigation uncovers. President Uhuru Kenyatta will need to move swiftly to allay fears of on-going disruption to tourism or commerce. The major Gulf carriers have not hesitated to blaze new trails into East Africa using Jomo Kenyatta as their hub. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways are all running daily flights, trying to tap not only the tourism market but to forge new trade ties into one of the fastest growing regions of the world. In statement, Dubai's carrier said, ""Emirates is closely monitoring the situation and regrets the inconvenience caused to customers."" It has suspended its flights until further notice. Etihad is hoping to fly Thursday with a larger plane to accommodate those stranded on Wednesday.","Kenya is East Africa's largest economy and has made a big push to carve out its space in the global market .

"(CNN) -- Union workers for San Francisco's transit system ended their four-day strike and returned to work Friday, even though contract negotiations aren't over. Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman Rick Rice said things were running smoothly since service resumed at 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET). ""We pretty much have a normal number of cars on the track at this point,"" he said. After negotiations between BART and the unions ended late Thursday, workers returned at 12:01 a.m. Friday and worked through the night and morning to have trains running by 3 p.m., he said. ""People are glad to be going back to work, and I know the riders are thrilled to be able to have the trains running,"" said Josie Mooney, a spokeswoman for Local 1021 of the Service Employees International Union, one of the two largest union representing the striking workers. The two sides had three days of negotiations over new contracts, wrangling over the issues of pay and benefits, before deciding Thursday night to allow another 30 days to reach a deal and resume BART service in the meantime. The talks will pick up again next week. About 400,000 people use the service daily. With no trains running, BART ran limited charter bus service to accommodate commuters. BART riders said Friday they were relieved the service was back on line. ""I want to also make sure that the BART workers get their fair share too,"" rider Tracey Roth told CNN affiliate KGO. ""I want to recognize their struggle in it, but also know that it's been tough for everyone."" Commuter Eric Westland told the station he got chills when he learned the trains would be running again. ""The newspaper this morning said it was still on strike, and when I saw the thing in the bus booth that said trains (would be) running at 3, I got goosebumps,"" he said. Unions asked for a 21% pay increase. BART initially offered to increase salaries by 4% over four years, but later proposed an 8% increase; that was on top of a 1% increase scheduled to go into effect at the start of the week. Mooney said part of the problem was that contract negotiations began much later than normal. That didn't allow the two sides a lot of time to reach a deal before the union contract expired June 30. The extension agreed to Thursday expires at midnight on August 4, she said. ""We hope that we will be able to use the next 30 days to come to a fair and equitable contract for the workers,"" Mooney said. ""Yesterday was spent primarily on extending the (union) contract in order that we have more time to deal with what are extremely complicated issues."" BART is the nation's fifth-largest train system in the United States, with 44 stations in 26 cities that make up the Bay Area, according to the transit authority. It handles more than 40% of Bay Area commuters, according to CNN affiliate KPIX.","NEW: BART says service is now running smoothly .

"(CNN) -- Here's hoping Yeiner Garizabalo wears more to court Tuesday than he did in a San Francisco subway station in May. When last we saw him, the 24-year-old appeared in a bizarre video where he, sans clothing, performed acrobatics off subway equipment, then went after commuters trying to catch a train. Garizabalo faces seven charges following the outrageous May 10 incident at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station, a spokesman for the San Francisco District Attorney's office said Monday. A video of the incident surfaced last week and quickly went viral. In it, a glistening man with a wild mane of hair turns fare gates into balance beams, doing splits and back flips buck-naked. Startled commuters flee as he dashes across the station, attacking people at random. Last week, police said Garizabalo had been arrested, given a mental evaluation, charged with battery and released. He now stands accused of two felony counts of false imprisonment, four misdemeanor counts of battery and one misdemeanor count of sexual battery in the incident, spokesman Alex Bastian said. California defines false imprisonment as ""the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another."" A judge set Garizabalo's bail at $100,000 after he was re-arrested Monday. He will be arraigned Tuesday afternoon, Bastian said. Garizabalo, who is also known as Yeiner Perez, was, until recently, a member of the ClownSnotBombs Circus. The group posted a statement on its website saying he was no longer affiliated with the group. ""To our knowledge, Mr. Perez never exhibited this type of behavior previously and this episode came as a complete surprise to us,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- China took its latest powerful toy, a new stealth fighter jet, out for its first test spin Tuesday, leading U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to wonder whether the flight was scheduled to coincide with his visit. ""I asked President Hu (Jintao) about it directly,"" Gates said at a briefing with reporters in Beijing. ""And he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and had been a pre-planned test. And that's where we left it."" Images and videos of China's latest generation fighter, being called the J-20, hit the web in a frenzy of excitement in late December. Onlookers outside the airfield base have been allowed to use cell phones to snap pictures and record low resolution video, a decision that many experts point to as a move by China to pump its chest in advance of Gates' trip to China and Hu's visit to the United States next week. Tuesday's test flight appeared to be no different in regard to the viral marketing. Videos and pictures have hit the web, some showing crowds of people lined up alongside the airfield gate in southern China, cheering and jumping up and down as the fighter lands. Gates however, who made the trip to discuss military relations between the United States and China, said he believes the Chinese president's assurance that the test flight had been previously planned. ""I take President Hu at his word that ... the test had nothing to do with my visit,"" Gates said. One China watcher is skeptical. ""It was planned this way, a classic exercise in power projection,"" said China military scholar Richard Fisher. ""They want President Obama and the new Congress to view Hu Jintao, who visits next week, as the leader of the next military superpower, whose demands must be accommodated."" Analysts believe the J-20 stealth fighter will have the radar-evading capability of fifth-generation fighters produced by the United States, like the F-22 and F-35. And while the jet isn't supposed to be operational until at least 2017, Fisher said that after Tuesday's test flight, China has the potential to deploy the fighter at an earlier date using a less-powerful engine than the one currently in development. Gates conceded that fact on his flight over to China last weekend. ""I think that what we've seen is that they may be somewhat further ahead in the development of that aircraft than our intelligence had earlier predicted,"" Gates said. Still, Gates downplayed the technical advancements in the plane, questioning how ""stealthy,"" or radar evading, it actually is. In 2009, Gates said that no nation comes close to the United States' air power, and he expected the Chinese to have only ""a handful"" of fighters that could challenge the U.S. advanced fleets by 2025. Despite Tuesday's air show by the Chinese, Gates said he would not revise that assessment and added that another Asian power, Japan, is considering purchasing its next generation of fighter aircraft. ""And I might have a few suggestions for them,"" Gates said.","Gates says the Chinese president said the timing of the test was coincidental .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton rode a wave of patriotic support to claim pole for his home grand prix Saturday as Mercedes occupied the first two places on the grid at Silverstone. Hamilton produced a lap of one minute 29.07 seconds, described as ""phenomenal"" by three-time defending champion Sebastien Vettel, who was third fastest for Red Bull. The 28-year-old Englishman was fully four tenths of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg in claiming the 28th pole of his career and second of the 2013 season. It was the first pole by a home driver at the British Grand Prix since Hamilton himself achieved the feat back in 2007. Vettel, leading the title race yet again, paid compliment to Hamilton in the post race press conference, but appeared to reference the controversial Mercedes tire test earlier this season which Red Bull were particularly outspoken about. ""I don't know if Lewis found a short cut or he just found something special here -- it was a phenomenal lap,"" he said. ""It is always nice to position well in qualifying here. I am looking forward to the race tomorrow and we will see how we are with looking after our tires,"" he added. Hamilton, in fourth place in the championship, will be hoping his Mercedes can find more race pace to capitalize on their qualifying speed. ""It's an incredible feeling,"" he said. ""The crowd have been great -- such a great turnout -- that was a lap for them. ""I hope we can do something special in the race. It's phenomenal because I haven't been feeling 100 per cent comfortable in the car."" Vettel's teammate Mark Webber took fourth on the grid. Initially Scot Paul Di Resta occupied fifth for Force India, but was later relegated to the back of the grid when his car was ruled to be under the minimum weight. Australian Daniel Ricciardo of Toro Rosso and German Adrian Sutil in the second Force India were next fastest . Frenchman Romain Grosjean, Lotus teammate Finn Kimi Raikkonen and two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Ferrari initially filled out the top 10 before Di Resta's demotion. Alonso, looking to mount a sustained challenge to Vettel as per last season, was left frustrated by the lack of pace in qualifying. Visit: CNN's special F1 interactive .

Teammate Felipe Massa will move up to 11th just behind McLaren's Jenson Button, who had missed out on the final phase of qualifying to the disappointment of home supporters. But Hamilton's stellar performance left them plenty to cheer although with warmer conditions forecast for Sunday he may struggle to take full advantage if the lessons of previous races this season are any guide.","Lewis Hamilton on pole for British Grand Prix at Silverstone .

"(CNN) -- The holder of one of three winning tickets in last week's record $656 million Mega Millions drawing came forward Friday to claim a share, Kansas Lottery officials announced. The winner -- a single ticket holder -- has chosen to remain anonymous, state lottery director Dennis Wilson said. ""The person looks forward to retirement,"" Wilson said. Kansas was one of three states where three tickets matched the winning numbers -- 2, 4, 23, 38 and 46, with a Mega Ball of 23 -- amounting to an equal share of roughly $218.6 million, before taxes, under the annuity option. The Kansas winner, who bought the winning ticket at a Casey's convenience store in Ottawa, chose the cash option to collect the winnings -- $157 million. ""They were still just in awe that they had won it,"" Wilson said of the winner, who didn't know the ticket was a winner until Monday. The other winning tickets were purchased in Maryland and Illinois. The Kansas winner is the first to officially come forward, just a week after the winning numbers were picked. Meanwhile, Maryland lottery officials have been responding to a flurry of questions from the media this week after a Baltimore-area woman told the New York Post that she had one of the winning tickets. However, in a bizarre twist of the story, Mirlande Wilson, a 37-year-old single mother of seven who works at McDonald's, told the Post on Friday that she isn't sure where she last had the ticket. ""I'm still looking for it. I haven't even looked in my uniform pants yet,"" the Post quoted Wilson as saying. ""I'm still looking everywhere to find it, in my purse, everywhere."" The state's lottery director said Thursday he hasn't seen the ticket, but he also says no one else has come forward saying he has it. Carole Everett, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Lottery, said Tuesday she doesn't ""put much stock in that story."" ""She claims she won,"" Everett said. ""She can't produce a ticket. ... In our opinion, until they walk in that door, hold that ticket, produce valid identification and our security people can process and validate it, it doesn't matter."" If Wilson is determined to be a winner, a showdown could be brewing with her McDonald's co-workers. They are demanding a share because they say they pooled their money to buy several tickets. Wilson has said the ticket she bought was separate from that. CNN's Tom Laabs and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: The Kansas winner chooses to remain anonymous .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The most emotionless society is Singapore's despite its reputation for being among the world's richest, a new survey has revealed. Gallup looked at 150 countries where about 1,000 residents were asked whether they experienced five positive and five negative emotions a lot during the course of a day. The results were based on interviews taken over a three-year period. Questions included whether people felt well-rested or enjoyment, smiled and laughed or felt worry, sadness, stress or anger. The 36% in Singapore who reported feeling anything is the lowest in the world, the Washington-based research and analytics organization found. This figure is an aggregation of data from 2009-2011; in Gallup's latest measure taken last year, just 30% of those surveyed in Singapore felt anything at all. The findings belie Singapore's 1.9% jobless rate in the third quarter and per capita GDP of more than US$50,000 -- among the highest in the world. ""The implications for an emotionless society are significant,"" wrote Jon Clifton, a partner at Gallup and director of the Gallup Government Group. ""To continue to be competitive in today's world, Singapore must begin focusing on behavioral-based indicators that move beyond GDP. ""The bottom line is that Singaporeans are productive, highly disciplined citizens who are not enjoying their lives much,"" he wrote in an accompanying article for the Gallup Business Journal. ""This culture has won historically, but it will not move to the next level until its leadership takes wellbeing seriously."" Trailing right behind Singapore were nearly half of the 15 former Soviet republics: Georgia and Lithuania, with 37%; and Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, with 38%. Tying at 38% were Madagascar and Nepal. The Philippines, meanwhile, registered as the most emotional nation, with 60% of those interviewed responding ""yes"" to experiencing a lot of feelings daily. Also scoring high were Latin American nations, with 10 of its nations -- led by El Salvador -- sharing top spots with Bahrain, Oman, Canada and the United States. Absent from the list is Bhutan, whose 4th king first coined the term ""Gross National Happiness,"" declaring in 1972 that it was more important than Gross National Product. The country now has a Gross National Happiness (GNH) Commission with a mandate to pursue that objective. The country's latest GNH Index measures happiness based on 33 indicators grouped among nine domains: psychological wellbeing, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards. Reflecting the growing need to address happiness, The Earth Institute at Columbia University published the first ever World Happiness Report commissioned for the U.N. Conference on Happiness in April. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today, the causes of happiness and misery, and policy implications. The report was in answer to a resolution adopted last year by the U.N. General Assembly declaring ""the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal"" embodying the spirit of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. This year the U.N. declared March 20 of each year as the International Day of Happiness. Last month the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents 34 countries, dedicated its fourth forum in New Delhi, India, to measuring well-being. The OECD's Better Life Index compares well-being across countries based on 11 topics identified as essential. It's another indication that there's more to life or success than wealth, and that measuring a nation on GDP alone can go only so far. Still, the Economist Intelligence Unit has named Singapore one of the best countries to be born in 2013. Ranked sixth on an index topped by Switzerland, Singapore was cited along with Hong Kong, ranked 10th, as being ""well-known for their wealth, stability and relatively low levels of corruption,"" said Susan Evans, an analyst. ""One determining factor of future life satisfaction for their residents, which is less easy to predict, will be the trajectory of civil freedoms,"" she added in a press release. The index looked at as many as 11 indicators, including GDP per head, life expectancy at birth, quality of family life, the state of political freedoms, job security, climate, safety, community life, governance and gender equality. Among the 80 countries covered, Nigeria ranked last.","NEW: Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Singapore high on ""where-to-be-born"" list .

"(CNN) -- It's official: It was a great white shark that bit a man's legs last week just off the coast of Truro, Massachusetts. ""This conclusion was reached after examination of the injuries and testimony from (the victim),"" said Reginald Zimmerman, a spokesman for the office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. Chris Myers and his teenage son were swimming toward a sandbar about 500 yards off Ballston Beach. They wanted to body surf where the waves were breaking. ""Apparently I was the only one on Cape Cod who hadn't heard of the shark sightings,"" Myers told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. Reports of shark sightings have gone up off the coast of Massachusetts in recent years, especially around areas where seals congregate. Shark-bite victim: 'Only one option, which was swim' But just after the pair decided to turn around, something bit the man's leg. ""I figured it was either an elephant ... or a polar bear ... or a shark. So pretty quickly I got to shark,"" Myers jokes. ""It felt like I was in a very, very heavy vise."" The great white shark then surfaced between father and son, who were about 6 feet apart, arching its back as if intentionally showing itself to them, he said. The shark slipped under the waters, and the men swam back to shore where they were helped by a doctor and a nurse who happened to be on the shoreline. Myers was composed until he realized he had survived a great white shark attack. He had only one word to describe that moment: ""euphoria."" The physical damage caused by the shark was far less than it could have been. Myers has a cast on his left leg because his tendons were severed and 47 stitches on his right leg, where the teeth of the shark left several puncture wounds. Great white sharks range from 12 to 21 feet and weigh nearly 3 tons. They are believed to live longer than 30 years. Increased shark attacks: Is 'Jaws' back?

"(CNN) -- Do you use a passcode to protect access to your smartphone? And if so, do you do that consistently? Every day, many smartphones get lost -- and found, not always by their owners. What happens with those missing devices? Security software provider Symantec recently conducted a test to answer that question. It deliberately ""lost"" 50 Android phones in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, New York and Ottawa. These phones were loaded with identical apps, files and data -- and none of them was secured by a passcode or swipe unlock pattern. Symantec found that in the vast majority of cases -- more than 95% -- the people who found these missing cell phones tried to access personal or sensitive information, or services such as online banking or e-mail. Being honest doesn't mean people won't snoop either. Even though about half of the finders made some attempt to return the lost phone (a contact e-mail and phone number for the ""owner"" was listed in the contacts app on each decoy phone), the vast majority of these people also tried to access data on the phone. ""We did get some nice e-mails from people who said they found the phone, sometimes expressing remorse for using it for a while,"" said Kevin Haley, Symantec's director of security response. ""And some of them actually tried to arrange to return the phones. We weren't trying to research people's motives and guilt -- that would be a project for a sociologist. But we did learn a lot about the kind of stuff people try to do with phones they find."" On 72% of the lost phones, finders looked through stored photos. Attempts were made on 60% of the phones to access social media. More than 40% of finders tried to access corporate e-mail and online banking. Symantec also placed text files containing a list of passwords for services on the phone (57% of finders accessed those) and a fake list of employee salaries (accessed by 53% of finders). Dubbed ""Project Honeystick"" (the name is an homage to the ""honeypot"" lure of attractive data or access often employed by cybersecurity practitioners), Haley emphasized this project was not trying to trap people who breached the privacy of others. Symantec configured the fake apps to appear to have a stored user name and password, so all the finder would have to do was hit ""login."" Two-thirds of phone finders tried to do this. When they got an error indicating that there was a technical problem accessing the service online, ""many people then would look at the 'passwords' file planted on the phone and then would try again,"" Haley said. Obviously, Symantec has a stake in this problem. The company wants to sell mobile security software (which it offers for businesses and also for consumers under the Norton brand). And software from this and other vendors (such as Lookout Mobile Security and McAfee) can help users track the location of a lost phone and remotely lock it or wipe the data. Haley noted that Symantec software was not installed on the decoy phones, and it was not used to track snooping and access activities by finders of the lost phones. But even if you decide not to buy and install mobile security software, there are some basic steps you can take in advance to protect your phone. First, set a passcode or swipe pattern to lock your smartphone and keep it on there. It's tempting to disable the passcode if you're at your home or office, where you might be alone or only around people you trust -- but it's too easy to forget to re-enable the passcode when you're heading out the door. Also, you could avoid storing passwords in your mobile apps. But that makes it tempting to use the same password for several services -- a significant security risk not just for your phone but online in general. You might try a password management service such as 1Password or KeePass -- just be aware that these services can get hacked. If you don't take these precautions and end up losing your phone, it's a good idea to find a computer quickly and log on to your e-mail, online banking and other services that you access from your phone and change your passwords. Whoever has your phone could change your passwords and hijack your accounts. If you can't find your phone, you might want to notify your carrier that it's been lost, to shut down the service until you can get another phone. People who find or acquire your phone may use it to make a lot of international phone calls, running up your bill. This happened to a friend of mine -- when she reported her lost smartphone, AT&T found that over two days it had been used to place dozens of lengthy calls to Yemen. (Fortunately it waived the bill; she didn't have to pay for those calls.) Losing your phone isn't the only risk to the data it contains. Some police departments are warning citizens that smartphone thefts are a growing trend. Often muggers or snatch-and-run phone thieves just try to sell stolen phones for cash -- but the people who buy them may try to access your data or services. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","In an experiment, a security firm deliberately ""lost"" 50 Android phones in certain cities .

"(CNN) -- They've already dropped him from the team, but now the New England Patriots are trying to reel in Aaron Hernandez's jerseys this weekend. A week after the former tight end was charged with murder, the Patriots are encouraging parents to swap any No. 81 jersey for that of any other team player. ""We know that children love wearing their Patriots jerseys, but may not understand why parents don't want them wearing their Hernandez jerseys anymore,"" New England Patriots spokesman Stacey James said in a statement. ""We hope this opportunity to exchange those jerseys at the Patriots ProShop for another player's jersey will be well received by parents."" The exchange program applies only for Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com. While the Patriots try to scrub Hernandez's jerseys from the public eye, the same shirts are fetching big bucks on eBay. Official Hernandez jerseys are selling for as much as $1,300 online as former fans try to cash in on the athlete's fall from grace and others try to snatch a bizarre collectible. Hernandez was arrested June 26 and charged with murder. Prosecutors said he had a falling out with his friend Odin Lloyd at a nightclub last month and planned his execution-style killing in the following days. Who is Odin Lloyd? Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment on June 17. Surveillance cameras captured their car at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day, authorities have said. Hernandez, 23, is now being held without bail at the Dartmouth House of Corrections in a 7-by-10-foot jail cell. He is allowed outside of his cell for three hours a day, but has no access to television, the Internet or a weight room, Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said. He also won't be able to marry his fiancee while in jail. CNN's Alison Kosik, Kevin Conlon and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The Patriots are offering other players' jerseys in exchange for Hernandez's .

"(CNN) -- Since it was revealed this week that the National Security Agency is collecting the telephone and Internet data of millions of people, this is the question most people have asked me more than any other: ""Why should I care that the government has all this information?"" On Thursday, as we were learning that the NSA has been storing the so-called metadata of millions of Verizon customers, a woman told me that she was less concerned about the intelligence agency knowing her phone number than she was the local CVS, which has been calling her at inconvenient times and pressuring her to renew prescriptions she was filling at another pharmacy. Maybe it's because we don't feel the surveillance state bearing down on us the way we do pushy marketers that many people aren't that concerned about the government compiling enormous databases on our digital activities. Indeed, we already knew that intelligence agencies have been doing this for years. In 2006, shortly after the revelation that the NSA was monitoring some Americans' phone conversations without warrants, a poll showed the public was evenly divided on whether it was a good or a bad practice. If it helped catch terrorists or prevent attacks, roughly half of the people responding were willing to give up some measure of privacy. Inherent to that calculation is our understanding that the definition of ""privacy"" has changed. It doesn't have remotely the same context as it did in the late 1970s when the law restricting the government's authorities to monitor Americans -- authorities that had been scandalously abused -- was enacted. Back then, our expectation of privacy extended to our relationships with our family and friends. To things like phone calls or the mail. Today, these personal connections, and the information we willingly share about ourselves, are the foundations of our increasingly public social networks. We know that complete strangers are looking at our Facebook pages. Should we be surprised that the government is too? Probably not. But you might be surprised to find out that all this information the NSA and other agencies are collecting is not very useful for stopping terrorists, which is why it's being collected in the first place. To date, there have been practically no examples of a terrorist plot being pre-emptively thwarted by data mining these huge electronic caches. (Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that the metadatabase has helped thwart a terrorist attack ""in the last few years,"" but the details have not been disclosed.) When I was writing my book, ""The Watchers,"" about the rise of these big surveillance systems, I met analyst after analyst who said that data mining tends to produce big, unwieldy masses of potential bad actors and threats, but rarely does it produce a solid lead on a terrorist plot. Those leads tend to come from more pedestrian investigative techniques, such as interviews and interrogations of detainees, or follow-ups on lists of phone numbers or e-mail addresses found in terrorists' laptops. That shoe-leather detective work is how the United States has tracked down so many terrorists. In fact, it's exactly how we found Osama bin Laden. Now, electronic data does play a crucial role in those investigations. But only when it is narrowly searched, with specific criteria at hand -- a name, say, or a phone number. Officials have said that this is how that metadatabase is used. Analysts can only look at it when they have the number of a suspected bad actor, and they want to search for his connections. That may offer some reassurance, however slim, that there are at least some controls on how that information is being searched. But we've also learned about a separate collection program, known as PRISM, that reportedly lets analysts tap directly into the central servers of top U.S. Internet companies, and then siphon off e-mails, photographs and audio and video files. We're told that U.S. individuals' information is routinely swept up in these searches, and that it's subsequently segregated from information about foreigners. But according to training manuals for PRISM examined by The Washington Post, analysts are told that when Americans get caught in the net, they should just file a quarterly report about the incident, and that ""it's nothing to worry about."" This looks a lot like that big data mining that analysts have told me doesn't produce solid leads. What it does do is implicate potentially innocent Americans in a vast sweep of some of the most ostensibly private information there is, particularly your e-mails. Reasonable people can come to different conclusions about how comfortable they are with the government building all these databases. But we shouldn't accept officials' broad claims that these searches, and the information they're based on, are protecting the nation's security. If we're going to hand over so much information about our once-private lives, we should have some assurance that the trade is worth it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shane Harris.","Should you care that the government is collecting telephone and Internet data?
Shane Harris says attitudes to privacy have changed .
Massive quantity of data is unlikely to yield evidence of terrorist plots, he says .

"Cameron, Arizona (CNN) -- His high-wire walk didn't start well. Perched on a 2-inch-thick metal cable, 1,500 feet in the air, daredevil Nik Wallenda spat on his hands and wiped the soles of his moccasins. ""These shoes feel slippery. There's dust on this cable,"" the lifelong tightrope walker said Sunday as he was just beginning his quarter-mile trek across the Little Colorado River Gorge near the Grand Canyon without the aid of a safety tether. But an agonizing and an anxiety-filled 22 minutes and 54 seconds later, Wallenda had crossed to the other side, running the final steps to become the first person to traverse the gorge near Grand Canyon Park in Arizona. The wind was worse than he anticipated, he said at one point. And twice he stopped, knelt and regained his composure. ""I was fatigued until I was three-quarters of the way across, and then it was all adrenaline,"" he said. The feat was watched by a worldwide audience, according to the Discovery Channel, which televised the event in the United States. At the end, the seventh-generation aerialist threw down his balancing pole, kissed the ground and hugged his wife and three children. ""I can finally breathe again,"" Erendira Wallenda said. When asked how he planned to celebrate his successful walk, Wallenda mentioned eating a rib-eye steak. He is a member of the famous Flying Wallendas, founded by his grandfather Karl in the 1920s. But the family's circus roots go back further than that, Nik said. ""My family has done this for seven generations and 200 years, and I'm carrying on a legacy.

"(CNN) -- A spate of fireworks debacles and tragic parade accidents wrecked Independence Day celebrations across the country. The mishaps Thursday left 20 people hospitalized in Southern California, two people dead in parades nationwide, two people seriously injured in Chicago and $1.5 million in damage in Seattle. Two people killed in parades . In Oklahoma, an 8-year-old boy on a parade float was killed when his father accidentally ran over him, Edmond police said. The boy was on a martial arts float that was driven by his father, police spokeswoman Jennifer Monroe said. It's unclear whether the boy jumped or fell from the float before he was run over by the trailer's tires. Another tragic parade accident took place in Bangor, Maine, when a man driving a tractor in the Independence Day parade died after a vintage fire truck struck him from behind, authorities said. Bangor police Sgt. Paul Edwards said the parade had been rerouted because of a four-hour standoff with a gunman who fired several rounds at police from an apartment window. The parade participants ""would not have been on that street normally,"" Edwards said. Fireworks shows gone awry . A display in Simi Valley, California, turned disastrous when fireworks exploded low to the ground and injured at least 26 people. Twenty-three of the 26 people who were treated at Simi Valley Hospital were released by Friday morning, said hospital CEO Kim Milstein. One person was transferred to a burn center and two people were admitted to the hospital and were in fair condition. Among those who were treated and released was a 17-month-old child. Injuries involved burns and shrapnel wounds, she said. Witness Annisa Wynn told CNN affiliate KTLA that fireworks suddenly began shooting sideways into the crowd instead of up into the air. ""The fireworks were so close, you could see them on the ground,"" Wynn said. ""It never happens this way. People were screaming."" The show, carried out by a pyrotechnics company, was part of an annual series of fireworks displays that began in the city in 1970, police Chief Mitch McCann said. Investigators were collecting evidence Friday, and the main investigation probably will begin Monday, Ventura County Deputy Fire Chief Mike LaPlant said. Another show in Windsor, Colorado, sparked flames that rose 10 feet high over parched land, witness Kami Gilmour said. ""The first embers dropped and looked like it might have started a small tree on fire,"" Gilmour said. ""Then we realized there were six or seven fires all along the field, and then a gust of wind came and blew the fire all over the place. ... Our car was about 50 yards from it and covered in soot."" There was no immediate word of injuries from the Colorado fire. 6 die in Fourth of July Pennsylvania house fire . Fireworks sever woman's foot in Chicago . An apparent near-ground fireworks explosion severed a woman's foot and also seriously injured her sister-in-law in Chicago's West Lawn Park on Thursday night, CNN affiliate WGN reported. The explosion severed the left foot of Kristina Perez, 32, and left fourth-degree burns on the left leg of Lorena Perez, 34, WGN said. ""One of the firecrackers, instead of going up, went to the ground and hit Kristina,"" her father, Eleuterio Carmona, told WGN. The women said they were watching a fireworks display at the park when the explosion happened. Both were in serious condition at a hospital Friday, WGN said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two weeks after a severely disabled Marine reportedly was ""humiliated"" by his treatment at a Phoenix airport security checkpoint, the details remain in dispute, but the government took steps Wednesday to prevent a similar encounter from happening. The Transportation Security Administration said it is greatly expanding a program that expedites screening for active-duty and inactive ""wounded warriors,"" giving them the same expedited screening now available to active-duty, uniformed military personnel. Wounded warriors who call or e-mail the TSA in advance of their trips will get benefits similar to those in the TSA's PreCheck program. They will be allowed to use dedicated screening lanes where available, leave on light outerwear, belts, shoes and hats, and keep laptop computers and 3-1-1 compliant liquids in carry-on bags. The TSA said it wants to provide ""curb to gate service"" for the wounded troops. ""In recognition of the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, we have revised our screening requirements to allow expedited screening for this trusted group of citizens,"" John Halinski, TSA's deputy administrator and a 25-year U.S. Marine Corps veteran, said in a statement. The move comes after a March 13 encounter between a small group of Marines and TSA screeners at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport sparked a spat between members of Congress and the TSA. In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, said the incident involved an active-duty Marine who had lost both of legs to an improvised explosive device, and was in a wheelchair, with limited or no mobility. A TSA officer asked the Marine to stand or walk, Hunter wrote, ""despite the fact that he physically could not stand or walk on his own."" The TSA screener then made the Marine remove his prosthetic legs, only to have them put back on so he could move to another area, where he was again asked to stand so that his wheelchair could be examined, Hunter wrote. Hunter -- basing his account on a person who had escorted the Marines -- described the Marine as ""humiliated"" by the encounter. The TSA disputes the account, saying that surveillance camera video and interviews with its officers showed that the man never removed his legs. The agency also said the two screeners involved both had extensive military careers -- one of them with the Marine Corps. Both screeners acted appropriately, the TSA said. The TSA said it hopes to assist wounded warriors in the future though its Wounded Warrior/Military Severely Injured Joint Support Operations Center Program. It gave this account of the process: . -- Once flight arrangements are made with the airline, the severely injured service member, or family member, or other representative can contact its operations center with travel details. The TSA prefers an e-mail to MSIJSOC@dhs.gov to protect accuracy of the information, but will also accept calls to its toll-free number, (888) 262-2396. The operations center will acknowledge the request by reply e-mail, or over the telephone . -- The operations center will then notify appropriate TSA officials at the involved airports. Those officials are responsible for ensuring that necessary security screening is conducted ""with empathy and respect, to make the overall experience for the Wounded Warrior as simple and trouble-free as possible,"" the TSA said. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the program ""changes greatly"" the process in which wounded warriors are screened, without creating a security vulnerability. As with all travelers, the veterans will be vetted against government watch lists of suspected terrorists, he said. A congresswoman who had introduced a bill requiring the TSA to give PreCheck privileges to wounded warriors applauded the TSA announcement Wednesday, but said she would press forward with her bill. ""I'm pleased to see this action being taken by the TSA,"" Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said in a statement, adding that passage of her bill will ""ensure that these changes are permanent."" Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, D-Louisiana, also issued a statement applauding the move.","The new TSA program comes in the wake of an incident involving a Marine .

"(CNN) -- Floodwater in Oklahoma swept away and killed a man who was trying to save his daughter from a stranded vehicle early Friday, adding to the toll from flooding and storms plaguing a number of states this week. The 60-year-old man was washed away by fast-moving floodwater that had rapidly appeared in Oklahoma City overnight, city police Lt. Gamille Hardin said. The man's body was found Friday morning. His daughter had been stuck in a vehicle surrounded by rapidly rising water, Hardin said. Storm systems continue to hammer states with drenching rain and significant flash flooding. Of particular concern Friday are parts of southeast Kansas and southern Missouri, which have seen up to 10 inches of rain this week, with more expected over the weekend. These areas are at extreme risk for flooding into Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. In all, parts of 21 states in the Northwest, Plains, Midwest, Southeast and Northeast were under some sort of flood warning or watch Friday morning. They include parts of Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky, where forecasters say more than 2 inches of rain may fall in a short period of time Friday. One to 2 inches of rain are on the way to an area from Pennsylvania to Maine in the Northeast, where 1 to 3 inches of rain already have fallen this week. In Nashville, authorities have conducted more than 200 water rescues, and surrounding communities have reported several more, Mayor Karl Dean told CNN affiliate WSMV. in nearby Mt. Juliet, rushing water lifted a business off of its foundation and carried it 30 feet away, as area residents reported waist-high water and other locals were stranded on their roofs. ""I called 911 and said, 'Can you get over here?' They couldn't get here because it was too choppy. It was like a lake in my front yard,"" flood victim Calvin Hooch told WSMV. Another resident, Sara Mickelsen, said she saw ""a lady and a baby floating by on a mattress."" Waynesville, Missouri, was another hard-hit locale. As residents tried to clean up after Tuesday's and Wednesday's heavy rains, Thursday's flooding interrupted their efforts, and authorities ordered evacuations as Roubidoux Creek rose, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. ""Everything in this living room was soaked, as it all came in through the door,"" resident Andy Anderson told the station. Deaths in South Carolina, Missouri . The death in Oklahoma was one of several storm-related fatalities reported over the past few days. In South Carolina, Logan Dale Evans was found dead in floodwater on his family property Wednesday night near the town of Central, Pickens County Coroner Kandy Kelley said. Evans, 23, was found outside his vehicle, which ended up about a mile downstream, said Kelley, who added that Evans is believed to have drowned. At least two people were reported killed in Missouri this week, including a driver who was caught in rapidly rising water in McDonald County on Thursday, said Gregg Sweeten, the county's emergency management director. The woman, thought to be in her 60s, had been trying to drive over a bridge when the water overwhelmed her vehicle, Sweeten said. On Monday, Elijah Lee, 4, died after 6 inches of rain fell on Pulaski County, about 140 miles southwest of St. Louis. The boy was found in a vehicle swept up in floodwater that caught the community along Mitchell Creek off guard, said Sgt. Dan Crain, a Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman. CNN's Dave Hennen, Shawn Nottingham, Jason Hanna, John Branch, Sherri Pugh and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Nashville flooding prompts many rescues, lifts business off foundation .

With his wedding gowns highly sought-after by Nigerian brides, he attends about 15 of his clients' weddings in Nigeria each year, and his London-based label, Kosibah, is at the heart of that country's booming wedding industry. Last month, it was one of 129 businesses exhibiting at Lagos' Wed Expo exhibition, which drew 10,000 attendees over two days. ""I would say weddings are one of the fastest growing industries in Nigeria right now,"" said the event's organizer, Akin Eso. ""A lot of people term it that they're 'going into events' -- but the money is really in the wedding industry."" The publisher of Wed magazine, a wedding-focused title that launched in Nigeria last year, Eso said the typical Nigerian wedding has evolved in recent years into a high-concept ""production."" Up close with Rwanda's endangered mountain gorillas . ""There's always been this joy around weddings, but now there's also this whole creativity: It's more like a production, and nobody knows where it's going to stop,"" he said. ""People just imagine it and make it happen."" Themes such as a ""snow wedding"" would involve decorating the entire hall to match the concept, he said. ""Ten years back, you would normally do all the arrangements for the wedding yourself or with your friend,"" he said. ""Now, for every aspect of the wedding there's a vendor that can help you."" The trend has been driven by the many young Nigerians living overseas, who had introduced ambitious ideas for wedding themes, along with the concept of the wedding planner: a professional event organizer who could realize the happy couple's vision for their big day, typically at their parents' expense. Osunkoya said families typically put much effort and expense into the event, as a wedding was an important status symbol -- although ""not in a negative way."" ""It's showing how well you've done, and for the bride and groom, this is their time,"" he said. ""Most times in Nigeria, the parents take care of the wedding -- and there are many weddings where it's just a blank check,"" he said. ""It s a thing of joy to have your children married, so most of the time, the parents want to go all out. That's where you see total creativity."" UK-based makeup artist Lola Ibekwe caters specifically to Nigerian weddings and has been hired by brides who fly her, all expenses paid, to Nigeria for their weddings. She said, ""Nigerian brides really know what they want and demand the very best. Some of them have been influenced by the big weddings of Hollywood stars and don't mind spending big to achieve the perfect look on their big day. Most of the brides I work with reserve a big part of their budget for makeup because the pictures will last a lifetime."" Timbuktu's treasure at risk from armed uprising . There are two parts to a Nigerian wedding, Osunkoya explained. The first ceremony was the ""traditional wedding,"" sometimes also referred to as the engagement. This was typically attended by fewer guests -- only family and close friends -- and may be held in area that one of the couple originally hailed from. The couple would wear traditional dress, with the bride usually wearing a traditional fabric gifted to her by her new parents-in-law, sometimes sewn into a modern Afrocentric design. The second, ""white wedding"" -- with a guest list at the reception potentially running into the thousands -- could follow days or even months later. For this, the bride would wear a white bridal gown and the bridal party formal attire. The most popular time of year for weddings was in December, when expatriate Nigerians return from abroad and can face a schedule of weddings seven days a week. Another distinctive feature of the Nigerian wedding was the wearing of ""aso-ebi."" The phrase, which translates from the Yoruba language as ""clothes of the family,"" refers to the garments of matching fabric worn by the bride's family and friends at the ceremony. ""You've got 2,000 people there, so it's a way of spotting people you're meant to be with,"" said Osunkoya. Although, in recent years, it is not uncommon to see the entire party wearing the aso-ebi. While there are occasional grumbles that the trend for elaborate weddings had gone too far, nobody seems to mind on the day. ""Not everyone is equal or has access to the same amount of wealth, but everyone aspires to it,"" Osunkoya said.","Nigeria has a booming wedding industry .
The trend is driven by the desire for extravagant themed weddings .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two years after it was sent up to the International Space Station, a giant particle physics detector has provided its first results in the search for the mysterious ""dark matter"" believed to be a major component of the universe. The international team running the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer released its initial findings Wednesday at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, in Switzerland. The scientists are studying flux in cosmic rays, the charged high-energy particles that permeate space, for evidence of the invisible dark matter particles colliding with each other, leading to what is termed ""annihilation."" A result of this would be a higher presence of the charged particles known as positrons, the antimatter counterpart of electrons. According to a CERN statement, the results announced Wednesday ""are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space, but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations."" How particle smasher and telescopes relate . Over the last few decades, scientists have come to the conclusion that the universe's composition is only about 5% atoms -- in other words, the stuff that we see and know around us. That means the rest is stuff we can't see. About 71% is something called ""dark energy,"" and another 24% is ""dark matter."" Research is ongoing to figure out precisely what these ""dark"" components are, because they do not interact with ordinary matter and have never been directly detected. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer project is being jointly run by scientists from 16 countries, under the leadership of Prof. Samuel Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The cosmic ray particle physics detector was carried to the International Space Station on the final flight of the space shuttle Endeavour and installed under NASA direction. Since May 2011, the detector -- which is mounted outside the space station -- has been sifting through matter, antimatter and other particles as it circles the Earth, with the data sent to hundreds of scientists on the ground for analysis. Their initial conclusions are based on some 25 billion recorded events over the course of 18 months. ""As the most precise measurement of the cosmic ray positron flux to date, these results show clearly the power and capabilities of the AMS detector,"" Ting said, according to the CERN statement. ""Over the coming months, AMS will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter, or whether they have some other origin."" Opinion: How the Higgs can lead us to the dark universe . Physicist Robert Flack, a senior research associate at University College London, told CNN the results from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer are significant because they've ""thrown up a question which may have an answer in dark matter."" Dark matter remains a mystery because there has been no direct observation of it, he explained. ""We are fairly happy that it exists, we are fairly happy about the kind of shape -- that it envelops galaxies and is much wider than the galaxies themselves,"" he said. ""But what we don't know yet is what it's made of -- and that is hampered by the fact that we cannot see it and cannot detect it,"" he said, because the detectors are made to measure matter as we know it. ""In this case, it will always be an open question until we can pin down what dark matter is made of,"" he said. The scientists involved in the project say the results coming from the spectrometer -- which are much more accurate than in past experiments -- are consistent with a fairly basic dark matter model, Flack said. At the same time, they are right to be hesitant about rushing to make claims that might later prove to be unsubstantiated, he added. The state-of-the art detector, which weighs 8,500 kilograms, is expected to stay in operation through the lifetime of the space station, until 2020 or longer. The results ""could help foster a new understanding of the fields of fundamental physics and astrophysics,"" NASA administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement Wednesday. ""I am confident that this is only the first of many scientific discoveries enabled by the station that will change our understanding of the universe,"" he said. CERN director general Rolf Heuer said the findings so far were ""a great example of the complementarity of experiments on Earth and in space."" Searches for dark matter are also being carried out at CERN using the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, and other laboratories. ""Working in tandem, I think we can be confident of a resolution to the dark matter enigma sometime in the next few years,"" Heuer said. Better 'baby picture' of the universe emerges .

"(CNN) -- Syrian military airstrikes killed more than 20 people in a province bordering Turkey, an opposition group said Saturday. Warplanes carried out the attacks in the mountainous Latakia province in the overnight hours, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on its Facebook page. The group estimates Syria's civil war, now in its third year, has killed more than 106,000 people and created more than 1.8 million refugees. Syria was high on the agenda in a meeting Friday between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Shoygu. But no concrete commitments emerged from the talks at the State Department. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the leaders had ""exchanged views on Syria and the importance of supporting a political process to end the violence."" ""Our goal is the same. We need to start a political process,"" Lavrov said before the four met. He urged the holding of a second conference on Syria in Geneva, saying the priority must be to ""fight terrorists and force them away from Syria."" The Syrian government also refers to the rebel fighters as terrorists. Rebel fighters . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday that at least 62 Syrian rebel fighters had been killed in an ambush in the Damascus countryside. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said that Al-Nusra Front ""terrorists"" had been ambushed and killed in the same region and that non-Syrian fighters were among the dead. The Al-Nusra Front, or Jabhat al-Nusra, a militant Sunni Islamist movement, is one of the rebel groups taking up arms against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. A day earlier, the Observatory reported that Syrian rebels and an al Qaeda-affiliated group had captured a government air base near the key city of Aleppo. Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and various rebel battalions destroyed several tanks and killed a number of regime soldiers as they fought for control of the Menagh air base, the Observatory said. At least 10 rebel fighters, including foreigners, also died, the group said. The Islamic State of Iraq is the rebranded name for al Qaeda in Iraq. The group changed its name after its founder, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed by a U.S. missile strike in 2006. The Menagh air base is north of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and financial hub. For many months, rebels have tried to wrest control of the city in their attempt to end four decades of rule by al-Assad's family.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Sitting down with the protesters in Gezi Park, the message to the government from demonstrators, young and old, seems simple enough: Don't try to control us. Incinerated cars, desecrated monuments and homemade banners now litter Istanbul's commercial hub, Taksim Square, after demonstrations at the weekend turned violent when police moved in to scatter protesters. ""They are trying to decide whether we drink alcohol,"" industrial design student Ozgsa Bertag-Apunaman, 20, says calmly: ""Telling us how many children we should have and if a woman should have an abortion or not."" He recalls how he was left breathless after being struck on the back with a tear gas canister fired by police. ""They're aiming at us. A shell exploded on my backpack. Luckily I had it on."" The clashes were sparked following a peaceful demonstration against the government's proposal to uproot Gezi Park and erect in its place a shopping mall styled like a 19th-century Ottoman barracks. But for many Turks now massing in the park and on Taksim Square, a new mall is more than just another eyesore; it is a symbol of autocratic rule from a government that, in their view, is harking back to bygone days when this city -- once considered a gateway to Asia -- was ruled by emperors. Gozde, 19, a university pupil studying genetics, joined the protests with her mother and is worried for the future of her country under the leadership of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""Everyone thinks he's a dictator,"" she tells CNN. ""He is acting with his ego... We're not terrorists but that's how he wants to show it."" Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted party Justice and Development Party further infuriated demonstrators by labelling them ""a few looters,"" adding that the protests in Istanbul and Turkey's capital, Ankara, are the work of opposition extremists trying to challenge the government. The prime minister has said that he could bring large crowds of his supporters onto the streets should he chose to do so. He has also attacked speculation about his position online, criticizing Twitter for helping people spread ""lies"" and saying that social media ""is the worst menace to society.'' A more conciliatory tone from the government emerged Tuesday, when Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc apologized ""for the police aggression against our citizens who were involved in the initial protests and acted with environmental concern,"" Anadolu, Turkey's semi-official news agency, reported. Metehan, 19, a university student studying English literature, believes the government's latest policy initiatives and the ""brutal"" measures taken by police are a true reflection of the state of Turkish democracy. ""Democracy is not just voting but protecting the voices of the minorities,"" he says. ""Istanbul is a historical city and many cultures existed here and we want to protect this history."" Istanbul -- a metropolis of 12 million people -- is famed as a melting pot of cultures where Christianity and Islam heritage are fused into one city. While the protests rage on in Taksim Square, much of the city remains peaceful. In the tourist hub of Sultanahmet, across the Bosphorous, it's business as usual. But according to Ayean, 33, a fashion designer, the ""beautiful"" mix that exists in Istanbul, along with people's way of life in the city, is under threat. ""He [Erdogan] is starting to define people as alcoholics if they drink,"" she said in a reference to the recent enactment of stricter alcohol controls. ""It's just against freedom whatever your background."" Modern-day Turkey was founded in 1923 under secular laws which replaced traditional religious legal codes. Under Erdogan and his ruling AKP party, Turkey has lifted curbs on public expression of religion, including strict limits on women wearing Islamic-style headscarves. Rock star and environmentalist Haluk Levent, 44, believes it's about time that Erdogan listened to the concerns of the country's young people. ""It does not surprise me that the police have been so brutal. The government is turning Turkey into a police state and this worries me.""","Anti-government protests have swept Turkey for over a week .

"(CNN) -- An American from Alabama wanted for aiding Somalia-based terrorists was added to the FBI's ""most wanted terrorists"" list Wednesday. Omar Shafik Hammami, 28, was indicted in Alabama five years ago for traveling to Somalia to assist al-Shabaab, which the U.S. has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Hammani, a U.S. citizen, is believed to be in Somalia now and should be considered armed and dangerous, the FBI said. The FBI also added Raddulan Sahiron, a Filipino wanted for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of an American in the Philippines in 1993, to the ""most wanted terrorists"" list. Sahiron allegedly worked with Al Harakat al Islamiyyah, also known as the Abu Sayyaf group, to kidnap an American from his home in the Philippines on November 14, 1993, the FBI said. The hostage was taken to the terrorists' jungle camp on the southern Philippine island of Jolo until he was freed 23 days later, the agency said. Sahiron became the overall leader of Abu Sayyaf in 2005 and is believed to be in the area of Patikul Jolo, Sulu, Philippines, the ""most wanted"" poster said. The United States is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to the arrest of Sahiron. The FBI also added a name to its ""Seeking Information -- Terrorism"" list, which includes people sought in connection with designated terrorist organizations or possible terrorist activity against the United States. The newest addition is Shaykh Aminullah, a 50-year-old believed to be in Pakistan.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Tribesmen killed five Yemeni soldiers guarding Yemen's strategic Balhaf gas terminal Sunday, two security officials said. Earlier reports from the officials indicated the attackers were suspected al Qaeda militants, but authorities later said the suspects were not linked to al Qaeda. The attack took place at a military checkpoint in al-Rowaik district in the southwestern province of Shabwa. Local security officials told CNN the gunmen escaped unharmed after opening fire on the soldiers from windows of their vehicle. The motive for the attack is not known. ""The attack happened at dawn when soldiers were searching cars passing by. The soldiers were armed but were not able to defend themselves as the attack happened quick and sudden,"" a security official in the province said. The official said government authorities are in contact with tribal leaders in the area as they search for the gunmen. ""The next checkpoint was not aware of the attack because all five of the security men were killed before they were able to report it,"" the added. This is the first attack on a Shabwa security checkpoint in more than a year. Shabwa has been a stronghold for al-Qaeda for more than two years. Last week, an airstrike killed five suspected al Qaeda militants in the province, where the Defense Ministry says at least 100 suspected terrorists are hiding. Four western embassies in Yemen have been closed since August 4, after U.S. intelligence intercepted information that al Qaeda may target American interests in the region. A senior Defense Ministry official told CNN that 34 people have been killed by 12 drone strikes since July 28. A heightened security presence has decreased over the last two days in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.

"(CNN) -- If the last several years have taught us anything, it's that the world is in constant flux. Regimes topple, borders are redrawn, whole countries are born anew. While the fighters are remaking their world, however, the lovers are evidently stuck in the 1800s. Ask anyone what the world's most romantic cities are and they'll likely reply in kneejerk fashion, ""Paris..."" ""Venice..."" ""New York...""

Dispensing with the typical fairytale travel planning, we've opted for a more results-oriented approach to crowning the world's most romantic cities. Because while a romantic city should grab hold of your heart, it shouldn't stop there. Sure, there's an element of magic to a romantic city, but that magic is supposed to beget love or at least the making thereof. And these cities are municipal Viagra. New Orleans, Louisiana . Place: This former French colony on the Mississippi River offers all of the ornate architecture, rich food and freely flowing booze of Paris, without the Parisians. But belying the carefree geniality of its gumbo of assorted peoples is a dark mantle of sinful abandon and occult worship that makes the Crescent City colorful, crass and occasionally creepy. 7 under-the-radar cultural destinations . People: Once the fifth-largest city in America, New Orleans has been content for decades to rest on its leisure laurels, promoting an atmosphere of laissez faire inhibition that provokes many visitors to spontaneous fits of nudity. Adjust gazes accordingly. Things: The charm, fun and filth of the French Quarter; the mist and mystery of the bayou; the pomp and botany of the Garden District; the majesty of the mighty Mississippi. Moscow, Russia . Place: Seldom included on lists of romantic things: fear. But it's an exciting feeling all the same, just one among many aroused in the former capital of communism. It's all here: the derelict and the opulent, the authoritarian and the lawless, the oligarchic and the proletarian. Generations of strife and triumph abound: a Tzarist palace beside a Stalinist square beside a capitalist Starbucks. People: Loving is romantic but fighting can be too, and Muscovites are historically adroit at both. For those who find romance in power, there's always plenty on display, as well as a notorious live-for-today attitude that has yet to find the envelope. Things: The intellectual arousal of its late night bookstores; the metamorphosed grandeur of Gorky Park; old factories and warehouses transformed into galleries, clubs and performance spaces; countless monuments to lovers; vanishing vestiges of the Soviet era. Victoria, Seychelles . Place: You know what's romantic? A beach. You know what's not romantic? Barf-discharging college kids, shrill children (shrilldren?) and sunburnt albinos in socks and sandals, making coastal mainstays like Phuket, Honolulu and the Bahamas as enchanting as hair on soap. There's nothing more romantic than being as far from other people as possible, and no other capital city offers this kind of isolation with this kind of beachfront. Travel on the cheap: 5 times to go . Plus, the architecture of this former British colony often mimics that of its former empire. It's like they put England somewhere good. People: It's 80 degrees (27 C) almost every day of the year -- warm and cool enough to keep clothes and sweating respectively minimal.

Buenos Aires, Argentina . Place: Assimilating generations of native Argentines, German expats and Italian and Spanish immigrants, Buenos Aires is a petri dish of fiery European and South American culture. But, contrasting their showier Brazilian brethren to the north, the flash and passion of Porteños simmers without boiling over, yielding a city renowned as much for art and architecture as it is for spherical backsides. People: Porteños are an amorous lot, with some of that Parisian poutiness, only supplemented by actionable desire. It's a sentiment that often transfers osmotically to visiting tourists. Things: The electrostatic sensuality generated by tango -- watched or danced; the lawns full of frisky youth at Tres de Febrero Park; the unparalleled showcase for the city's passion and potency that is soccer at La Bombanera. Also: always order the steak. Amsterdam, Holland . Place: The canals of Venice. The art of Paris. The laws of Gomorrah. Even if you don't partake of the Dutch capital's approved vices, there's a romance that accompanies the freedom to do so. You know what's not romantic? Bus fumes. Which is why anything in this city is accessible by boat, bike or boot. People: The town is to professionals what Vegas and Bangkok are to amateurs, offering at the front door the sex and drugs everyone else keeps in back. Amsterdammers are the sinful world's grown-ups. Things: The titillation of women twisting in the windows of the Red Light District; the puritanical eye of the RLD's carnal storm that is Oude Kerk (""old church""); 10 p.m. summer sunsets; a kiss under the Magere Brug (""skinny bridge""), ensuring fidelity. Havana, Cuba . Place: Think old stuff is romantic? Well, it's still 1959 in the capital of Cuba, where the development -- and commercialism -- of the outside world has yet to sneak past the bouncers. The resultant sensations of risk and antiquity in this forbidden time warp make romance unavoidable. So if you ever wanted to have sex in the 1950s, here's your chance -- but time's running out. 7 ways to go local while traveling . People: Just about everyone in Havana is an artist of some kind, underscored by live music -- and dancing -- everywhere. While not as outwardly sexual as some Latin American capitals, this populace is as carnal as they come. Things: The bars 'n' cigars of Hemingway's Havana; the intimacy of dinner at an in-home paladar; the unspoiled virginity of the Eastern Beaches; the fear- and awe-inspiring Plaza de la Revolución. Barcelona, Spain . Place: If having nowhere to be is your idea of romance, the capital of Catalonia wins on two counts: it's easy to get happily lost and no one wakes up until 8 p.m. Like Los Angeles or Sydney, Barcelona is dense, cultured and cosmopolitan, and is also a beach town, offering fickle lovers a broad romantic spectrum. One avenue that's no longer available to paramours? Public nudity. It was finally -- in some cases, mercifully -- banned in 2011. People: Trend-centric, cocksure, proud and partying, Barcelonans will steal your heart if not your wallet. Things: The weird feeling in one's pants upon beholding Gaudí architecture; the corpuscle of seemingly endless branching alleyways housing the galleries, cafés, bars, restaurants and museums of the Born neighborhood. No two trips are ever alike. Paris, France . Place: OK. Fine. Hard as it is to admit, even the laziest ""romantic cities"" lists are right -- the Big Baguette is still among earth's most enchanting municipalities. Paris is an urban engineering conundrum: its architecture all differs vastly, yet simultaneously adheres to a singular, uniform vision, making the world's most visited city also probably its most beautiful. There, we said it. People: Pouty, self-righteous, indolent, aloof, tempestuous, hot. The contemptibility of Parisians is exceeded only by the self-hatred among those of us who lust for them. Things: The stupid views of the entire city from Montmartre; the lousy majesty of the Champs-Élysées; the crummy uplifting Wall of ""I Love You's""; the idiot engineering marvel of the Eiffel Tower; the rotten eroticism of Pigalle; the insufferable grandeur of the River Seine.

"(CNN) -- During a recent trip to South Sudan, I was reminded of my childhood and the challenges I have had to overcome. I grew up in western Africa, in the Republic of Benin, where I distinctly remember the atmosphere of unrest that came with two coups d'etats. In flashbacks, I remember my mother carrying me on her back as we fled Cotonou, the capital of Benin, while gunshots and screams filled the air. South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, is facing many challenges. After three generations that have known only violence, the country still has unresolved conflicts with its northern neighbor Sudan. But the internal conflicts and civil unrest fueled by readily available weapons are raging at the borders of this young and largely ignored nation. Basic needs the developed world takes for granted are hard to come by in South Sudan. Too many kids can't afford to go to school -- especially the girls -- and there are not enough trained teachers for the few kids who are able to get an education. Clean water and food are hard to obtain. On top of that, the lack of security and protection makes it a struggle for families to fend for themselves. I visited villages where cows are like money in the bank, an indication of status and wealth. They are offered as the price for marriage when men are looking for a wife. This has led to a cultural tradition of cattle raiding by men who want to increase their herd. Cattle raids have been going on for generations between communities, but now, with an ever-expanding and unchecked arms trade, the men are using guns instead of spears for their raids. With not enough police, and inadequate or nonexistent medical facilities, you can imagine the devastation. It felt like a Hollywood movie set to see young boys carrying AK-47's, and girls not much older than my own daughters nursing their own babies. I heard stories of young girls who were raped and then forced to marry their rapist. How can this be real? If my family had not exhausted their limited finances to send me to Europe to receive an education, would I have also picked up an AK-47? There are no easy solutions, and ultimately, the government of South Sudan has to take responsibility to protect its people. But there is something we all can do right now. A strong Arms Trade Treaty will help restrict the flow of weapons and bullets to conflict-riddled countries like South Sudan. Negotiations are taking place right now at the United Nations to bring such a treaty to fruition. Such a treaty would make it harder for cattle raiders to attack communities like the ones I visited, and harder for small disputes between villages and tribes to end in bloodshed. The government of South Sudan has been conducting campaigns to disarm civilians, but this will not be effective if weapons are still easily accessible. Weapons have been flooding into nations like South Sudan for decades. Although the situation might seem hopeless, there is hope. I saw unbelievable strength and dignity in the eyes of the people I met in South Sudan. I was surprised by this in every village I visited. After all they have endured, they press on for a future they fought and bled for. A future that they believe in. A future that all of us can help support. A future that we have an inherent obligation to support. It's time for governments around the world to stand up for whatÂ¹s right and make the world a safer place by agreeing to a robust Arms Trade Treaty.

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury Thursday charged two friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with obstructing justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev -- 19-year-old roommates and Kazakh nationals who began attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth the same semester as Tsarnaev -- were charged in May with conspiracy. It is not clear whether Thursday's indictment represents a second conspiracy charge. Thursday's indictment accuses Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev of helping Tsarnaev after the April 15 bombing by taking items from his dorm room to keep them from investigators. Photos of Tsarnaev released after Rolling Stone complaints . If convicted, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev could be sentenced to a maximum 20 years in prison on the obstruction count and up to five years on the conspiracy count, the U.S. attorney's office said. They also could be fined $250,000. Arkady Bukh, Tazhayakov's attorney, said his client is not discouraged. He also said that Tazhayakov did not touch any of Tsarnaev's items. ""He feels very strongly he'll be able to be able to convince a jury that's he's innocent,"" Bukh said. ""There's no evidence of intent, no incentive to help (Dzhokhar), no motive to destroy anything."" The three students socialized and texted each other, the indictment says. On April 18, three days before the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev allegedly went into the dorm, took Tsarnaev's laptop and a backpack containing Vaseline, a thumb drive, fireworks and a ""homework assignment sheet"" and took them back to their New Bedford apartment, the indictment states. ""The fireworks container has been opened and manipulated,"" the indictment says. ""As a result, some of the explosive powder was visible."" Boston Marathon Terror Attack Fast Facts . Kadyrbayev told his roommate that he believed Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" the indictment states. That day, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text message from Tsarnaev that read, ""If yu want yu can go to my room and take what's there (smiley face emoticon) but ight bro Salam aleikum."" Either that night or early the next day, Kadyrbayev tossed the backpack in a Dumpster, according to the charges. ""Over the course of two days,"" the indictment continues, ""more than 30 federal agents searched (a New Bedford) landfill for the evidence Kadyrbayev had placed in the trash."" The indictment further says the roommates watched April 18 news reports about the bombing that featured photos of Tsarnaev. A federal grand jury earlier this year returned a 30-count indictment against Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the bombings, that alleges he used a weapon of mass destruction. Tsarnaev is charged with killing four people -- three spectators who died in the bombings and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later -- and ""maiming, burning and wounding scores of others,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said.

"(CNN) -- This week's devastating crash of a high-speed train in Spain, which left nearly 80 dead, has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the Obama administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links. These trains whisk passengers between city centers at speeds of 200 mph or more. European and Asian riders have enjoyed such service for decades. But such fast trains are still largely unknown to Americans thanks to decades of minimal government support for track improvement. As a result, intercity trains in the United States are mostly limited to about 110 mph. So far, the Obama administration, thanks to support from congressional Democrats, has distributed more than $10 billion to begin investing in faster train service. Construction on the first phase of a link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, which will be the country's fastest rail line, will begin over the next few months. As recently as this spring, then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood suggested the government planned to connect 80% of Americans to such trains by around 2040. The trains will be fast. Will they also be safe? Indeed, there have been a number of high-profile rail crashes over the years. In 1998,101 riders were killed in Germany when a train crashed in Eschede. And in 2011, two of China's newest, fastest trains slammed into one another, killing 40 people. But those are exceptions to the rule, caused by poor maintenance and monitoring. Rail, high speed or not, is one of the safest ways to get around. According to a National Safety Council review of 10 years of transportation fatalities, for every mile traveled, car drivers and passengers are more than 10 times as likely to die in accidents as passenger rail riders. In 21 years -- between 1990 and 2011 -- the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that nearly 900,000 people died in highway crashes, while fewer than 15,000 died in train collisions. Other countries' experience shows that high-speed rail can be even safer than the much slower U.S. trains. The bullet trains that zoom through France and Japan, for instance, testify to the astonishing safety offered by well-managed rail services. Each nation's system has been in operation for more than 30 years and provided billions of rides. Yet thanks to advanced safety systems and extensive maintenance, no passengers -- zero -- have died as a result of a high-speed train crash in either country. Improvements in the design of German trains and a review of maintenance operations in China have also prevented repeats of previous train accidents in those countries. Early reports suggest that the train crash in Spain could have been avoided. The train may have been traveling at more than twice the allowed speed limit. Modern train control equipment is designed to brake trains automatically when they travel too quickly or come too close to another train. Unfortunately, that train in Spain did not use that system. The good news is that the United States, whose rail system already has a strong safety record, is becoming safer thanks to investments being made by public and private entities. The Federal Railroad Administration mandated last year that by 2015 all intercity track be equipped with train control systems that would prevent crashes such as this week's accident in Spain. These realities should relieve the concerns of those uncomfortable about investing billions of dollars in American intercity train networks. The international record shows that high-speed rail is very safe to use. An equally urgent question is whether such trains would provide a significant upgrade to the nation's transportation network, and here again the evidence is clear that they would. High-speed rail offers the option to travel at fast speeds across hundreds of miles between downtowns in many of the country's largest metropolitan regions. Hopping on a train to travel between Chicago and St. Louis, Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, or New York and Washington in two hours or less would aid economic development by easing business trips. It would also lessen the stress of travel for millions of Americans. No more sitting in traffic, grinding teeth at the wheel. No more long airport security lines and shoe removals. The environmental benefits would also be significant. California's system, the only one already set for construction in the United States, will operate on renewable energy alone. Train service similar to that already offered in European and Asian countries would require a significant investment, but for many routes, an improved rail system is a worthy endeavor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yonah Freemark.","Yonah Freemark: High-speed train crash in Spain draws new attention to rail safety .

"Gilroy, California (CNN) -- A trip to the grocery store used to send James McQuoid into a panic. When the Iraq War veteran heard a child crying, he remembered kids screaming in Fallujah. Coins jingling in the register reminded him of ammunition carried around a soldier's neck. He would be in a store aisle, but not remember how he got there. The movements and sounds put his mind back in Iraq, back in a war zone. Calling it ""a mesh of realities"" McQuoid said ""it's enough to make your mind fracture."" McQuoid, 27, has post-traumatic stress disorder, a severe anxiety disorder commonly characterized by flashbacks, nightmares and a heightened state of alertness. Of the more than 2 million U.S. troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since October 2001, it's estimated that one in five is likely to be afflicted by PTSD or major depression, according to the RAND Corp. These are often referred to as invisible wounds, and for veterans like McQuoid, the suffering runs deep. By the time he returned home from his second combat tour six years ago, McQuoid was having nightmares every day. He had a hard time communicating with his wife. Paranoid of everything, he isolated himself. ""I'd stay in my house all the time,"" said McQuoid, who was in the Marines from 2003-2007. ""Windows were blacked out. I had cameras on the outside so I could monitor the surrounding area. ... The outside scared the hell out of me."" Fortunately, things started to change for the better about a year ago when he was matched with his service dog, Iggie, through Operation Freedoms Paws. The nonprofit, started by Mary Cortani, helps veterans train their own service dogs in northern California. ""It's hard enough to come out of the service and get back into civilian life,"" said Cortani, who served in the Army from 1975-1984. ""But now they have an injury that people don't understand. They have to find a way to balance what they're feeling, what they've experienced, with everyday life."" ""Service dogs are but one tool, but they're a very important tool, in the healing process for our veterans."" Dogs can be trained to assist veterans in a variety of ways. For example, Iggie wakes McQuoid from nightmares, turns off lights and helps create space between McQuoid and others in public places. The dog also helps McQuoid keep his anxiety level down in stressful situations. The veterans ""are taught to focus on the dog, read the dog's body language, not to worry about the environment,"" said Cortani, 55. ""If they start to have a panic attack because they're getting overwhelmed or the anxiety is so strong, they'll actually stop and kneel down and hug the dog."" Through her program, Cortani can match veterans with dogs from shelters or rescue groups. Then she helps them train the dog. ""When a veteran trains their own service dog, there are immediate benefits right off the bat,"" she said. ""They have a mission and a purpose again. It gives them something to focus on and to complete. It gives them a sense of security and safety. ... They know they're not alone. They've always got their buddy at the end of the leash."" There are many groups across the country that provide veterans with service dogs, but the methods in which they work vary. Typically, organizations breed, raise and train dogs before pairing them with veterans, a process that can take months or years. Some, like Cortani's group, use a train-the-trainer approach. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Cortani started training dogs more than 30 years ago while she was in the Army, and she translated that to civilian life, where she runs a canine obedience school. It was only recently that she started focusing on war veterans. In 2009, she received a call from a Marine who had been waiting more than a year for a service dog. He was looking for a trainer who would help him train his Rottweiler puppy instead. Cortani did extensive research about PTSD and service dogs, and in January 2010 she started working with the young veteran to train the dog for his individual needs. Within a month, two other veterans contacted Cortani, and she matched them with dogs from shelters. ""The more veterans that started asking for help, the more I realized this is what I was supposed to do,"" she said. Since then, Cortani and her group have worked with more than 70 veterans from all over the United States. ""I connect with these veterans because I am a veteran,"" she said. ""I understand the military culture. I understand, to a certain extent, what they've gone through even though I haven't walked in their shoes."" Cortani has personally worked with every veteran and dog that has gone through her training program, which lasts at least eight months and can take as long as a year. ""The dog is with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's a constant,"" she said. ""Every day, everything is a training opportunity. They get to work and move forward. So as they progress, they see the success."" For McQuoid, training Iggie has given him the opportunity to build a strong bond. ""Just like your combat buddies watch your back, this dog has got to have that same kind of trust,"" he said. ""And that trust isn't something that's built up in a short amount of time."" To participate in Cortani's program, veterans must be under some form of professional treatment for their disabilities and they must provide a prescription or doctor's letter stating they'll benefit from a service dog. Before they start training, Cortani spends several hours getting to know the veteran, which helps her find them the right dog with the right temperament. ""I try to get a sense of ... who they are, what they're struggling with ... what they liked to do before they got injured,"" she said. Operation Freedoms Paws, which runs on donations and community support, provides veterans with vests, leashes, collars, bowls, food and initial medical care and vaccines for the dog. The training is also free. After a veteran has completed the program, Cortani follows up with them weekly for the first 90 days, and then at least once a month for a year. But she said a lot of the veterans stay in touch even after that. ""You start to see them getting their confidence back, communicate differently,"" she said. ""They venture out. And they're beginning to participate in life again. In some cases, they're actually able to go back to work. They're able to communicate with their families ... have a conversation with a stranger."" McQuoid said that because of Iggie, his nightmares have decreased and he's able to take his family out to restaurants and movies. ""Without Iggie, I would still be in my house ... probably divorced from my wife and very estranged from my son,"" McQuoid said. ""And everything would continue to just fall on me until eventually I either decided it was time to end it and die, or just give up."" Recently, Cortani started a mentoring program to teach some of the veterans how to train new participants. Ultimately, she hopes to employ these veterans in several new locations throughout the country. ""My life is blessed every day that I get to spend time with these amazing men and women who've served our country,"" she said. ""Being able to help them find that joy back in their life ... it's priceless."" Want to get involved?

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Fourteen people, most of them children, have been killed in a stampede during a Hindu festival in eastern India, police said Tuesday. The crush occurred Monday on a bridge along the banks of the river Ganges in Patna, the capital of Bihar state, according to authorities. The site was packed with hundreds of thousands of devotees celebrating the annual festival of Chhath, Patna's police chief Jayant Kant said. During Chhath, one of the biggest festivals of eastern India, worshipers gather along river banks to offer prayers to the sun. An electric short circuit generated sparks from power cables, triggering the panic that led to the stampede, Kant said. About eight people were initially reported Monday to have been injured in the crush. But Kant said Tuesday that authorities no longer had anybody recorded as injured after some people died from their injuries.","The stampede occurred near the river Ganges in Patna, the capital of Bihar state .

"(CNN) -- A man arrested with a stash of fake military, law enforcement and medical paraphernalia -- including badges and uniforms -- has told investigators he ""lives in a fantasy world,"" a police official said Tuesday. But authorities still aren't convinced the man, Roy Antigua, 52, is telling the truth. They intend to dig deeper to make sure nothing more sinister was at hand, New Port Richey Police Chief James Steffens said. ""Best case scenario: fantasy gone wild. Worst case scenario, you can draw your own conclusion,"" Steffens said. ""I'd be very surprised and relieved if I was proven wrong, but there's just too much here,"" he said. Police arrested Antigua in the coastal Florida city of New Port Richey August 1 for a traffic offense and parole violation. An officer noticed that the identification card Antigua provided seemed strange and had plastic where it shouldn't have been. This launched the investigation that led to the stash, Steffens said. The materials found in Antigua's two homes and Cadillac Escalade included diplomatic license plates and dozens of fake identification cards from the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Defense, CIA and NASA. The suspect also had access badges to hospitals around Florida, doctor and nurse scrubs, a respiratory technician badge, police blue lights and access stickers to Coast Guard bases around Florida, Steffens said. It was unclear if the badges and access stickers would have allowed Antigua entry into any restricted areas. During questioning, Antigua admitted that he had fabricated most of the credentials and items that police seized, Steffens said. The only legitimate identification was a badge identifying Antigua as a member of the Coast Guard auxiliary, a volunteer group. Antigua has denied any criminal wrongdoing, Steffens said. ""His explanation is that he was remorseful and this is his personal collection that he lives in a fantasy world and he wishes that he were these people,"" Steffens said. ""I'm not accepting that it's a fantasy at this point,"" Steffens said. ""I think there's something here. We just have to figure out what it was and deal with it."" Since a news conference Monday about Antigua's arrest, authorities have received more than 100 tips, Steffens said. Many came them from residents who said they had encounters with Antigua passing himself off as a law enforcement officer or member of the military. Steffens said he does not yet know if the tips are legitimate, but he said he had one such encounter himself. Steffens said he met Antigua during a memorial service in May. The man was wearing the blue uniform of a lieutenant commander of the U.S. Coast Guard, Steffens said. ""I never even raised an eyebrow,"" Steffens said of the encounter. Authorities have confirmed Antigua is not in the Coast Guard. He last worked for a health care company, Steffens said. While Steffens said investigators from his department plan to pursue the case further, one law enforcement agency has bowed out. The U.S. Secret Service said it is not concerned about one of the man's patches, which contains references to the agency and Air Force One. The patch isn't a real Secret Service item, and Antigua doesn't appear to be a threat to President Barack Obama, said John Joyce, special agent in charge of the Secret Service field office in Tampa. ""Nothing that we saw by either interviewing him or by what he had in his possession, we felt had anything to do with our protective mission,"" Joyce said. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","NEW: A man with a cache of badges, uniforms, denies wrongdoing, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's tennis shoes turned into dancing shoes when he returned to action at the Rogers Cup. The world No. 1 polished off Germany's Florian Mayer 6-2 6-1 in under an hour on Tuesday and then boogied on center court to the hit song, ""Get lucky"" by Daft Punk. Djokovic hasn't always had the fans on his side -- the crowd was firmly against him at the Madrid Masters in May -- but his silky moves endeared him to the spectators in Montreal. ""It was a little agreement I had with my friends when we had vacation time a few weeks ago,"" Djokovic was quoted as saying by the ATP's website. ""We listened to that song quite a lot. ""We had a lot of dancing going on. I said, 'Why not? I'll do it after my first match in Montreal.' If I keep winning, I'll do it after every match. If I win the next one, you can expect the same song but maybe a little different dance."" Djokovic wasn't the only grand slam winner to contest his first match since Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal, stunned by Belgium's Steve Darcis in the opening round at the All England Club, won a doubles thriller with fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar. Djokovic fared better than Nadal in southwest London but lost the final to Andy Murray as Britain celebrated a first men's singles winner at the tournament in 77 years. World No. 50 Mayer slumped to 0-12 in sets played against Djokovic. After Djokovic saved break points in two different games early in the first set, the two-time defending champion in Canada cruised and improved his hard-court record in 2013 to 21-2. The lone blemish was receiving a warning from the chair umpire for taking too much time between points. ""As the match went on, I felt more comfortable on the court,"" said Djokovic. ""That's something that makes me happy."" Nadal and Andujar edged David Ferrer and Feliciano Lopez 6-7 6-1 12-10 in an all-Spanish battle. He begins in singles against Canada's Jesse Levine on Wednesday. Murray opens play on center court against Spain's Marcel Granollers, who is coming off a clay-court title in Austria. When they last met at the Italian Open in Rome in May, Murray retired with a back injury that later forced him to skip the French Open. The Scot recovered in time for the grass-court campaign and arrived in Montreal after a training block in Miami. ""I will have to be patient with myself, not expect too much, just try to fight for every point,"" Murray was quoted as saying by the ATP's website. Venus Williams ousted in Toronto . At the women's Rogers Cup in Toronto, Venus Williams' return didn't last long as she was bundled out by Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens 0-6 6-4 6-2. Williams missed Wimbledon with her own back injury and hasn't won a match since April. ""I wasn't expecting to play that well in the first set, so in the second set I just didn't handle it well,"" the seven-time grand slam champion was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. ""Then I got down in the third. ""I think I just sprayed a few balls and got a little tentative. I definitely didn't make the best of choices out there, but in general it was really fun to be back out there again.""

"(CNN) -- Several Syrian rockets landed early Wednesday in the Mount Hermon area of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, on the border with Syria, the Israeli military said. ""Initial reports indicate that the rockets are a result of (the) domestic situation in Syria,"" a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces said. ""As a result the Hermon side of the mountain will be temporarily closed for visitors.""

A chair lift runs up the mountain, part of which is a designated military zone. The Golan Heights, formerly Syrian territory, were seized by Israel in 1967. The two countries signed an armistice in 1974, following the Yom Kippur War, and U.N. forces have been stationed there since. Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict? It's not the first time Syria's civil war has spilled over into the Golan Heights area. Four U.N. peacekeepers were released Sunday, five days after they were seized by armed men while patrolling between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. In March, 22 peacekeepers were held for four days by rebels. The United Nations called on Syrian and rebel troops at that time to honor the impartiality of the U.N. troops stationed in the Golan Heights. Tensions in the area have been heightened recently and Israel has twice conducted strikes against Syria.

"(CNN) -- Last week, Barack Obama went on record as the first American president to support same-sex marriage, but he doesn't appear ready to take his commitment beyond the endorsement stage. In an interview that aired Tuesday on ABC's ""The View,"" Obama wouldn't commit to fighting for the the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act -- a federal law that defines marriage as the legal union between one man and one woman. ""My Justice Department has said to the courts, we don't think the Defense of Marriage Act is constitutional,"" the president said. ""This is something that historically had been determined at the state level and part of my believing ultimately that civil unions weren't sufficient."" But pressed further about whether he would fight to repeal DOMA, Obama would only say, ""Congress is clearly on notice that I think it's a bad idea."" More than 30 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that defend the traditional definition of marriage as a heterosexual union. The president does see the issue looming large in the 2012 election. ""This is going to be a big contrast in the campaign, because you've got Gov. (Mitt) Romney saying we should actually have a constitutional amendment installing the notion that you can't have same-sex marriages,"" Obama said in the interview, recorded Monday. Last week, Romney reaffirmed his position on gay marriage, saying marriage ""should be a relationship between a man and a woman."" ""Let me make it very clear, that my preference is to have a national standard that defines marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,"" Romney said. ""That would then allow states to determine what rights would be provided for people of the same gender that wanted to have a relationship."" While the full political implications of the president's same-sex marriage statement remain to be seen, Gallup released a poll Friday showing 51% of Americans approve of Obama's support for allowing gay couples to marry, while 45% disapprove. The survey was conducted entirely after he announced his endorsement in an ABC News interview on Wednesday. And a new Gallup poll out Monday gave further details into American attitudes on the topic. While 50% approve of same-sex marriage, a further breakdown of the numbers shows a significant gender gap: 56% of women say couples of the same gender should be legally allowed to marry, while 42% of men feel the same way. This is Obama's fourth appearance on ""The View"" and his second since taking up residence in the White House.","Poll: 51% of Americans approve of President Obama's support for same-sex marriage .

"Butte, Montana (CNN) -- Five years ago, Leo McCarthy lost his 14-year-old daughter, Mariah, when a drunken driver hit her and two of her friends as they walked down a sidewalk near her home. But he refused to let her tragic death become just another statistic. Knowing that the driver was 20 years old -- not even old enough to drink legally -- McCarthy made an unusual promise to the teenagers attending Mariah's memorial service in Butte, Montana. ""If you stick with me for four years,"" he said during her eulogy, ""don't use alcohol, don't use illicit drugs but give back to your community, work with your parents and talk to your parents, I'll be there with a bunch of other people to give you money."" McCarthy has lived up to his end of the bargain. Along with Jimm Kilmer and Chad Okrusch, the fathers of Mariah's two friends who survived the accident, McCarthy has given $1,000 scholarships to more than 140 high-school graduates who have taken Mariah's Challenge. ""I wanted to give them encouragement and to tell them that ... you can be better and always be greater in the situation,"" said McCarthy, whose nonprofit raises the money through private donations. Mariah's Challenge is simple. Teens can go online and sign a pledge to not drink until they are 21 and not get into a car with someone who has been drinking. Toward the end of their senior year, if they have not been convicted of underage possession of alcohol, they are eligible to submit a scholarship application, which includes a 300-word essay explaining how Mariah's Challenge has affected their life. Recipients are selected by McCarthy, Kilmer and Okrusch based on the essay and an interview. ""Mariah's Challenge stands for integrity, character and honesty and living a life of simple self-respect,"" said McCarthy, 52. The message is something that is sorely needed in Butte, he said, one of a few places in the country where people can drink in public. ""Butte has an apathetic attitude in some ways to underage drinking,"" McCarthy said. ""And it has a somewhat acceptance of drinking and driving. ... It's generational."" The city's drinking culture dates back to its history as a major mining town in the late 1800s, when it attracted boatloads of Europeans seeking better opportunities and a new life. Miners often went as deep as one mile underground to dig iron ore. It was tough work, and many of them often liked to drink at the end of the day. ""This town has such a hard history of living,"" McCarthy said. ""It's a humbling town ... a town of integrity and character. But Butte allows certain things to continue, and drinking underage and drinking and driving is a situation that's continued. It has to be acknowledged, and it has to be stopped."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . It's not just Butte, however, that is struggling with the problem. Nationwide, Montana routinely ranks in the top five per capita for drunken-driving fatalities. Those troublesome statistics, along with Mariah's story and other high-profile deaths, have led legislators to seek more aggressive ways to address the issue. One example is the 24/7 Sobriety Program, which has been implemented in 16 counties, including Butte's, since last year. It requires anyone arrested for a second drunken-driving charge to submit to two alcohol breath tests daily. ""Montana finally has had enough,"" said Steve Bullock, the state's attorney general. ""Tired of opening the newspaper, reading about somebody getting their sixth or seventh DUI. Tired of community losses. We're addressing it both through law enforcement, through legislation and through awareness. ""One of the great things about Mariah's Challenge is changing people's behavior and the positive awareness of it."" Courtney Cashell, a recent scholarship recipient, says she has noticed the culture starting to change in Butte. ""People are coming up with alternatives,"" she said. ""I know of a group of kids that got everyone together and said, 'Just bring soda. We're going to have pizza and music. Don't bring any alcohol.' ... It's changing gradually, in little steps."" Josh Panasuk, one of 42 students to receive a scholarship this year, said Mariah's story inspired him to do something with his life other than just drink and party it up. He works two jobs, plays sports and plans to attend Montana State University Billings this fall. ""I kind of looked around and saw a lot of people I knew -- a lot of friends, for that matter -- just going down that path, and I never wanted to,"" he said. ""It never appealed to me."" Mariah's Challenge started in Butte, but it has expanded over the years to other parts of Montana as well as four other states: Washington, Idaho, Iowa and North Carolina. About 8,000 young people have accepted the challenge. But they're not the only ones. ""I have parents taking Mariah's Challenge. I have grandmothers taking Mariah's Challenge, not because they have a drinking problem or anything else like that, but they understand what it's about,"" McCarthy said. ""They have the opportunity and the sage advice of looking back to people and looking at their future and their grandkids and saying, 'Hey, I'm the first one to acknowledge I've done some goofy stuff. But you know what, Mariah's Challenge is a great way for you to enjoy life ... to be something, to be somebody unique.' "" For him, seeing kids make responsible choices means Mariah's memory will live on. ""Mariah is forever 14,"" McCarthy said. ""I can't get her back, but I can help other parents keep their kids safe. ""We save one child, we save a generation, and that makes me encouraged to continue what we're doing every day.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Six people, including two children, died Saturday morning after a volcano erupted on an island in south-central Indonesia on Saturday, government officials reported. Mount Rokatenda erupted at 4:27 a.m. Saturday (5:27 p.m. Friday ET), spewing ash clouds of up to 2000 meters from its peak, said Indonesian National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. The volcano is located on the island of Palue, in East Nusa Tenggara province. Nugroho said the victims died in a cloud of ash released by the volcano, and those clouds were still being reported hours after the initial eruption. Indonesia's volcanology agency ordered people to stay at least 3 kilometers (2 miles) away from the summit. Palue is more than 2,000 kilometers east of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. The island has about 10,000 residents. Indonesia is located on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The last major eruption in the country was in October 2012, when the Mount Lokon spewed fresh lava and ash in northeastern Indonesia. CNN's Kathy Quiano-Castro reported from Jakarta; Stephanie Gallman reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Mount Rokatenda was still spewing clouds of ash late Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of acres of a Southern California forest are going up in flames for the second time in less than three weeks. Together, the two blazes have scorched a large hole out of the wooded mountains near Palm Springs. More than 1,400 firefighters are struggling to contain the current ongoing wildfire as a steady wind blows it toward the east. ""You can imagine, on the side of the hill with the rocks and the terrain, how hard it would be, with 40 pounds on your back, trying to put in a hose or cutting lines with hand tools,"" Lucas Spelman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told CNN affiliate KTLA. The blaze has scorched more than 16,000 acres, or 25 square miles, and is 25% contained, fire officials said Friday. ""This fire ... was one of the most quickly spreading, rapidly spreading, dangerous fires I've ever seen,"" Riverside Fire Chief John Hawkins told KTLA. California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency in Riverside County, authorizing the help of all state agencies in fighting the blaze. The weather forecast in the drought-stricken area offers no hope. The sun will blaze through dry, clear skies, the National Weather Service says. It will push high temperatures to near 100 degrees, keeping the forest flammable, while crews try to douse raging flames with the help of 169 engines, eight helicopters, 16 bulldozers and 13 water trucks. One civilian and five firefighters have been injured, California Fire reported. The cause is still under investigation. Flames have consumed 26 homes and one business. About 1,500 people have fled from their path and seven communities have been ordered to evacuate, fire officials said. Evacuation centers have been set up at area high schools. ""It's heart-wrenching. It's very heart-wrenching,"" Joanne Trosper told CNN affiliate KTLA, after watching the fire consume some of her neighbors' homes in Poppet Flats. ""Anytime the fire comes, it's bad memories, but this is the worst one yet."" July's wildfire, just a few miles away, was even worse. It devoured more than 27,000 acres and 6,000 people were ordered to evacuate, before 3,400 firefighters could get the flames under control. Luckily, rain came to their aid.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't the best day for Trekkers. After a successful online campaign that propelled ""Vulcan"" - the most well-known planet from ""Star Trek"" - to the top of a poll to name two moons orbiting Pluto, fans found out on Tuesday that the moons would be named ""Kerberos"" and ""Styx"" (which placed second and third) instead. The SETI Institute explained that despite the popularity of ""Vulcan"" (in large part due to a Twitter campaign by ""Trek's"" own William Shatner and endorsed by castmate Leonard Nimoy), the name was not new to the world of astronomy. ""The (International Astronomical Union) gave serious consideration to this name, which happens to be shared by the Roman god of volcanoes,"" SETI stated in a press release. ""However, because that name has already been used in astronomy, and because the Roman god is not closely associated with Pluto, this proposal was rejected."" (IAU rules state that the moons must be named after characters from the underworld of Greek or Roman mythology.) The name was given to a hypothetical planet, which was believed to exist near Mercury, but that theory has since been discredited. Shatner made no bones about his displeasure with the decision on his Twitter feed. ""I'm sad,"" he tweeted. ""So they name a moon Kerebus because there's already a Cerebus asteroid but a mythological planet knocks out Vulcan?"" He went on, ""Star Trek fans have had it rough. First JJ (Abrams) blows up Vulcan and now SETI finds a loophole to deny it from coming back!"" Whose tech is better: 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars'? He also said, ""I think they used us for promotional purposes! They're probably Star Wars fans!"" ""Are you out of your Vulcan mind?!"" tweeted Nicole Motillaro. ""My poor Pluto doesn't get its Vulcan moon."" However, others cheered the decision. ""Hurray for the preservation of astronomical history!"" wrote astronomer Mike Brown, who is so famous for helping to downgrade Pluto below planetary status that he goes by @plutokiller on Twitter. In the meantime, the members of the band Styx were positively giddy. ""Styx is proud to accept this new heavenly chart position as we add orbiting Pluto to our ever expanding touring map,"" guitarist and songwriter Tommy Shaw told Ultimateclassicrock.com. ""As always we have our fans to thank for it and I predict a new Styx T-shirt in the making!"" So there must certainly be mixed feelings for those who enjoy ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""Mr. Roboto"" equally. Shields up!

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, during the inauguration ceremony, and followed by endorsement of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani presented Majlis [the Iranian parliament] with a list of proposed cabinet members. A look at candidates shows that after eight years of the chaotic and catastrophic presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, things are getting back to normal. This could also mean that the old guard is in charge again. Senior ruling elites (the average age of Rouhani's new cabinet is 57) are celebrating their victory after surviving Ahmadinejad pressures to uproot them. Read more: Rouhani takes over as Iran's president . After nearly two months of heated discussion and wild speculation about the makeup of Rouhani's cabinet, the list of the proposed ministers can finally predict Iran's future. A close aide to Rouhani, Hesamodin Ashna, wrote on his public Facebook page: ""This cabinet has been designed to return peace to the government of the country. The presence of veterans indicates difficult crisis that must be resolved. It takes at least two years to find out what in the past eight years has caused this country to fall apart."" The economic orientation of the new administration is clear. The appointment of Mohammad Nahavandian -- head of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines -- as the presidential Chief of staff, sends the message that the new government will be relying on the private sector. And the composition of the cabinet seemingly shows Iranian liberals will be at the helm of the economy. However, there is still speculation about the political proportions of the new administration. A mistake that many political critics make is trying to determine the political weight of the cabinet based on the overused dichotomy of principlist-reformist, neglecting that such a categorization can no longer describe the political arena of Iran, particularly in the post-election era. Read more: Rouhani feels limits of office . Now, let's look at a few facts. All 18 proposed ministers have good relations with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the head of the Expediency Council who became known as the kingmaker in this election. Some of these candidates are even considered Rafsanjani's apostles. Sixteen of them have held prominent positions in the administration of Mohammad Khatami, the former reformist president who is out of favor with the hardliners and was not even invited to Rouhani's inauguration. More interestingly three of these proposed ministers, Mohammad Akhoundi, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and Ali Rabiei, were three of the most important members of the Mir-Hussein Mousavi campaign in 2009. (This candidate is still under house arrest with his wife after protesting the vote result and leading the Green Movement). Naturally such a makeup of the cabinet drew criticism from the radicals in the principlists' camp. But more interestingly, radical reformists, particularly the activist and journalist body associated with them, have criticized Rouhani for his cabinet picks. Why? Because the position of the three sensitive ministries of culture, intelligence and interior were not given to pure reformists. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance was offered to Ali Jannati -- the son of 87-year-old head of the Guardian Council Ahmad Jannati -- who unlike his father has good relations with Hashemi Rafsanjani and during the presidency of Khatami was Iran's ambassador to Kuwait. In an interview conducted less than a week ago he uttered almost everything that a reformist would say. Jannati said he did not believe in censorship before publication of books. Censoring has been the standard procedure in the past three decades of publication in Iran. He also promised that if a newspaper criticizes the administration it would not land in hot water. Read more: Presidential elections without buzz . Despite being a principlist, Seyyed Mahmoud Alavi, the candidate minister of intelligence has mostly trodden his own path. Less than two years ago he was disqualified from running for Majlis by the Guardian Council for ""lacking practical commitment to Islam and the regime."" In a recent interview, Alavi had the courage to openly say ""there is a security atmosphere in the country at present and individuals are not at ease to speak [their minds]"" and promised that the situation would change. Unlike the candidates for culture and intelligence ministries, Abdolereza Rahmani Fazli, the proposed interior minister whose job description includes appointing the 31 governors, has not revealed his view points. A principlist, Rahmani Fazli is very close to the speaker of Majlis, Ali Larijani. Therefore, many radical reformists have criticized Rouhani for giving a share in his cabinet to Larijani. An unofficial campaign has also started lambasting the speaker of Majlis as the sole obstacle to reforms in the country. It appears that certain political currents in Iran are repeated like short cycles. About 12 years ago, the reformists launched a campaign against Hashemi Rafsanjani and his cohorts including Hassan Rouhani to blame him for all the country's problems in order to prevent his election to the sixth parliament. Demonizing Rafsanjani actually turned out to hurt reformists most as they lost a powerful ally, who could have helped them in furthering their agenda and paved the way for the victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election. Portraying Larijani as the new wicked could have similar sequels. Larijani has already shown that he wants a relationship based on give and take. In the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election, despite pressure by hardliners to condemn popular protests, he remained silent as long as he could. In the beginning, he even tried mediating between the defeated candidate Mousavi and the supreme leader. It is only natural for the new president whose campaign slogan was ""solving things with prudency"" to choose negotiation to strengthen the position of his camp instead of resorting to confrontation and exclusion. The boldest step Rouhani has taken is nominating Mohammad Javad Zarif as foreign minister. Zarif's candidacy has been heavily opposed by the hardliners who insist this choice means that the new administration is serious about reducing tensions with the West, particularly with the U.S. Some have claimed that Rouhani's cabinet does not create strong hope of a political opening in Iran. But the reality is that the winds of change began blowing two months ago immediately after the election by the republication of two highly circulated reformist magazines that had been banned. And even though Mohammad Khatami was not allowed to attend the inauguration ceremony, his pictures have once again found their way to the front page of the newspapers. However, it appears that the threat of the radicalization of the supporters of change is stronger for the new administration than the pressure from extremists. Two weeks ago, one of the most prominent anti-regime figures in the country, 81-year-old Ebrahim Yazdi -- who has been sentenced to eight years in prison -- stressed in an interview with a reformist paper that Rouhani's administration should not be expected to perform miracles: ""He has to arrange the melody of desired change with the increasing tolerance and endurance levels of the opponents of reform,"" he said. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Reza Eshraghi .","President Hassan Rouhani has presented Iran's parliament with a proposed cabinet list .

"New York (CNN) -- The first time I held a premature baby was nearly two decades ago during medical school. The baby weighed just 3 pounds, and I remember being so afraid I might drop her. While I stared into her eyes, it gave me goose bumps. The parents hadn't yet given her a name because they worried she wouldn't survive. The neonatal ICU (NICU) nurses were truly remarkable, taking care of these preemies, and making it all seem so effortless. I do remember the most anxiety-provoking times surrounded the transport of these babies. Even if it was just one floor away, there was a plan laid out with clear communication and a defined role for the half a dozen NICU nurses who would accompany the baby. There was a commander of the transport, and several contingencies for worst-case scenarios. I remember asking one of the nurses, ""What is the safest way to transport this baby?"" Her reply: ""In the womb."" She was right, and if you consider the number of risks to a premature baby, you understand why. The heart rate of tiny babies can suddenly drop, and they can even develop a complete heart block. They require oxygen, but not too much because they are at risk of oxygen toxicity to their lungs. They can barely regulate their temperature, and they have a larger body surface area to mass ratio, which makes the problem even worse. They can lose fluids rapidly, and they don't yet have glycogen stores in their liver. So, not getting a timely meal could prove fatal. Imagine any of these things happening outside of the ICU, and now compound that by 100. That is what took place Monday night at NYU's Langone Medical Center. As you watch the video of these babies being rushed through the streets of New York, you now have a better idea of just how involved all of this really was. At about 10:30 p.m. Monday, with generators failing and widespread internal flooding, hospital staff called the CEO of Mount Sinai, Dr. Kenneth Davis, and asked for help. He immediately approved the transfer of 64 patients, including three mothers in labor and seven newborn babies. One of them was Emma, just 13 days old and weighing only 2 pounds. Emma's parents were in New Jersey, watching in horror as they learned the hospital was being evacuated. Shortly thereafter, they lost power and had no way of driving back into the city of Manhattan. As a parent myself, that part of their story really got to me the most. They were completely in the dark, stranded and helpless. I met Emma just a few hours after she arrived at Mount Sinai. She was in the NICU, and was perfectly stable. There were lots of tears of joy in the hospital, as families were reunited for the first time. Resilient, was how one of the nurses described little Emma. Still gives me goose bumps.","Transporting premature babies can be anxiety-provoking, Gupta says .

"Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- When a 12-day-old boy died in her arms, Catalina Escobar was devastated. She was working as a volunteer in the maternity clinic at one of the largest hospitals in Cartagena, Colombia. At that time -- October 2000 -- such incidents weren't that unusual; on average, at least one infant a day died at the overcrowded and underfunded facility. But when Escobar learned that the baby's teenage mother had not been able to raise the money for treatment that would've saved his life, she was crushed. ""His mother [needed] $30 that I had in my pocket. I will never forget that,"" she said. ""It was a preventable death."" Less than a week later, Escobar endured another, more personal loss: her second son, 16-month-old Juan Felipe, died in a tragic accident when he fell from the balcony of her home. She was overwhelmed by grief. ""It was agony,"" said Escobar. ""I didn't want any mother to feel the same pain, so ... I took action."" The successful businesswoman sold her international trading company and dedicated herself to helping the city's most impoverished children and their young mothers. In the last 10 years, her Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation -- named for her late son -- has brought health care to tens of thousands of children in Cartagena and provided more than 2,000 teenage mothers with counseling, education and job training. At first, Escobar focused on lowering the infant mortality rate at the hospital where she'd volunteered. It was more than double the national average. She built a state-of-the-art neo-natal unit, brought in experts to train the clinic's staff and established a program to cover the medical costs for babies born to impoverished mothers. Five years later, the rate of infant deaths at the hospital had dropped 67%. From the start, Escobar noticed that 70% of the mothers she was working with were between the ages of 14 and 16. Most lived in the slums outside of the city, which have grown during the last decade as people have fled violence in the northern areas of the country. ""You see these girls, [with] their tiny faces ... they're babies holding babies,"" said Escobar, 42. She realized that the only way to ensure the long-term health of the children was to enable these teenage girls to break the cycle of poverty. ""When a girl gets pregnant, she drops out of school. ... Next year, she's going to be pregnant again,"" Escobar said. ""She's repeating the same patterns of the mother, the grandmother."" The Colombian government reports that nearly 20% of girls between 15 and 19 years old are or have been pregnant -- nearly triple the U.S. rate. In Cartagena, where one-third of residents live at or below the poverty line, it's an equation that means these young mothers have very little chance of improving their lives. Escobar is hoping to change that through her teen mothers program, which aims to teach young women how to support themselves and their children. It started with just 30 girls in 2002, but it has expanded in the last decade. With the opening of her foundation's new center last year, 400 pregnant teens and young mothers now enroll every year. Built in one of the city's many slums, the center is an elegant, modern structure, equipped with a daycare, medical center, cafeteria and classrooms. It's light years away from the impoverished world of these teen mothers. For Escobar, that's the whole point. ""When they come here, this is a piece of heaven [on] Earth,"" she said. ""They deserve the very best."" For the first year, young mothers come to the center every weekday, leaving their babies at the daycare while they attend classes. They receive instruction on basic hygiene -- many have never encountered indoor plumbing before -- and learn how to care for their infants. Because food is often scarce at home, the girls also receive a hearty hot lunch. During the first six months, the teens take part in therapy sessions to help them understand their new reality and responsibilities. Escobar says that many of the teens she's worked with have been victims of rape and sexual abuse, so counselors work intensively with each girl. The goal is to help them come to terms with their past so they can focus on the future. The center also teaches teenage mothers about reproductive health and contraception. ""Girls tell me they don't understand how they got pregnant. They think it's from a kiss,"" Escobar said. ""They don't know that the option of using condoms exists."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . While the program aims to prevent future pregnancies, Escobar also wants to give these young mothers the tools they need to change their lives. The girls can finish high school on site, take computer classes or learn vocational skills like sewing or jewelry-making. The teens also make and sell products at the center's bakery, which helps fund the program, and the foundation offers micro-loans to help them start their own businesses. The program also helps mothers find jobs or provides them scholarships to help them continue their education at a trade school or university. The teens return to the center every week so Escobar's staff can track their progress and assist with any problems. Within two to four years, Escobar wants her girls to be providing for their families and be on their way to a better life. She says that two-thirds of those who've completed the program have gone on to find jobs. ""I want my girls to be empowered,"" she said. ""Earning money provides them with independence and allows them to gain back control of their lives."" That's exactly what Yerlis Bautista has been able to do. She dropped out of school when she got pregnant at 16, but through Escobar's foundation, she enrolled in a beauty salon course. She recently earned her diploma, an accomplishment that makes her glow with pride. ""I feel great, since I was able to accomplish a goal that I had wanted,"" Bautista said. ""Now I am working in the best beauty salon ... earning a good salary."" She said Escobar and the program gave her a new outlook on life. ""It is better to go forward with my future, to not just sit around like other girls,"" she said. ""Because I have been a fighter, I have found a better future for my child. ... I will keep fighting so he can have everything."" Escobar believes that attitude change is what will help these young mothers have long-term success. For her, each girl she helps is cause for celebration. ""These teen mothers are my own daughters,"" Escobar said. ""When they get here and they make it through, I feel so proud of them."" Escobar is always looking for more ways to have more impact. In 2005, she established a medical clinic that has provided health care to more than 84,000 low-income residents of the community -- mostly young mothers and their children. And she's planning to build an early childhood education center where the girls can bring their children ages 1-5. In the coming years, she is hoping to expand her program throughout Colombia. While Escobar has accomplished a great deal in the last decade, one thing is clear: Her personal war on poverty has just begun. ""I'm so passionate about it because we are seeing progress. ... We are changing the lives of these girls,"" Escobar said. ""I wake up every single morning thinking, 'What else can I do to help them?' "" Want to get involved?

"(EW.com) -- Over the extended 4th of July weekend, a lot of Americans lit up the grill and spent time with family. A lot unfolded lawn chairs and watched a fireworks show. And a whole lot bought tickets to see Despicable Me 2. The $76 million animated film from Universal and Illumination Entertainment crushed the competition in its first five days in theaters, earning a jaw-dropping $142 million — $82.5 million of which came in during the traditional Friday-to-Sunday frame. In fact, Despicable Me 2, which features the voice work of Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig, led the box office to the best July 4th weekend of all time. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, the Top 12 movies grossed $220.7 million, which marks the 10th-strongest weekend in box office history. Despicable Me 2's $82.5 million start just barely beat Monsters University's $82.4 million debut (though that film opened on a Friday, not a Wednesday), and its $142.5 million start stands as the best ever five-day opening for an animated film ahead of Shrek 2's $128.9 million haul in May 2004. Like that film, Despicable Me 2 earned an ""A"" CinemaScore grade from audiences. Universal reports that crowds were 60-percent female and 55-percent below the age of 25 — the studio adds that 27 percent of viewers were Hispanic. ""We knew it was going to be hugely successful,"" admits Nikki Rocco, Universal's president of distribution, who says family business was ""phenomenal"" and made up ""the bulk of business"" She also points to the film's prime summer release date and the fact that families were together for the July 4th holiday as contributing factors. Internationally, Despicable Me 2 topped the box office in 36 of the 38 countries it played in this weekend and has earned $151.1 million overseas, which brings its very early worldwide total to $293.2 million. Notably, only 27 percent of Despicable Me 2's domestic weekend gross came from 3-D ticket sales — a low for the format. Still, that doesn't take away from the sensibly budgeted film's incredible success. At this point, it's already a lock for $300 million. It was a very different story for Disney's $225 million western The Lone Ranger, which only lassoed a dismal $48.9 million — $29.4 million of which poured in during the Friday-to-Sunday period. The film, which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, joins Cowboys and Aliens and Wild Wild West as films that attempted (unsuccessfully) to turn the western genre into widely-appealing, popcorn-munching spectacles. For director Gore Verbinski and Depp, who previously collaborated on the ultra-successful Pirates of the Caribbean films, the terrible opening is particularly distressing. Depp's last two films, Dark Shadows and The Rum Diary, also severely under-performed. The reality is, though, that westerns have always been a tough sell at the box office. The highest grossing western of all time, Dances with Wolves, earned $184.2 million in 1990. The Lone Ranger's budget (which does not include substantial marketing and distribution costs), was a full $41 million more than that — so the bar for success was set incredibly high. And the financial setback for Disney will likely be incredibly high as well. ""Obviously you're always hoping that your movies are going to connect with the broadest audience possible,"" says Dave Hollis, Disney's president of distribution, ""so when it doesn't, it's disappointing."" The exec acknowledges that young people were largely unfamiliar with the 80-year-old character of the Lone Ranger, as evidenced by the fact that audiences were 68 percent above the age of 25. Those crowds issued the film a fair ""B+"" CinemaScore. In third, Fox's $43 million buddy-cop comedy The Heat fell 36 percent in its second weekend to $25 million, giving the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy title a strong $86.4 million after ten days. Fourth place belonged to Monsters University, which took a whopping 57 percent hit due to the arrival of Despicable Me 2. Still, the film grossed $19.6 million this weekend, which gives it $216.1 million total and makes it the 11th Pixar film (out of 14) to surpass the $200 million mark domestically. Worldwide, Monsters University, which likely cost about $200 million to produce, reached the $400 million milestone. World War Z rounded out the Top 5, dipping 39 percent to $18.2 million. The Brad Pitt zombie thriller has now earned $158.8 million after three weekends and could reach $190 million total — the same amount that Paramount says World War Z cost to make. 1.

"(CNN) -- Facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful, especially for those who have been away for a long time. Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27. Dugard was 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from a bus stop in South Lake Tahoe, California. She allegedly was kept in a series of backyard sheds by a convicted sex offender and gave birth to two children in captivity. A bail review hearing is scheduled for Monday in El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California, for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who face charges related to Dugard's kidnapping. In Illinois, Shannon Wilfong is charged with child abduction, allegedly having forced 6-year-old Richard K. Wilfong Chekevdia to live in seclusion and be hidden, at times in crawl spaces and the attic, for nearly two years, according to court documents. In concealing the boy, Wilfong violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to Michael Chekevdia, the documents said. The boy is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, according to CNN affiliate WSIL. The situations of Dugard and Chekevdia are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world. The people who have been away often feel conflicted about leaving the situation they've acclimated to in order to rejoin the loved ones they've left behind, experts not connected to the cases tell CNN. Photos: Missing children who were found . Sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother, and ""extreme tactics"" may be used, although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces, said Jay Lebow, psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University. ""While this case is obviously the rarest of things, other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this,"" Lebow said. The case of Dugard . Dugard is spending time in ""a secluded place, reconnecting"" with her mother and younger sister, said her aunt, Tina Dugard, in a statement on behalf of her family. ""This is a joyful time for my family,"" she said. ""Jaycee remembers all of us."" But a person in Dugard's situation would most likely have both positive and negative feelings about leaving the only environment she's known for 18 years and coming back to her family, psychologists say. ""She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family,"" said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California. After allegedly being confined for 18 years, Dugard probably would find the outside world frightening, Lebow said. ""You get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world, but it's the world you know,"" he said. Experts say Dugard may have developed what is known as Stockholm syndrome, in which kidnapping victims identify with their captors. Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family. ""It's a concept that explains why a kidnapped victim would stay with a perpetrator even though they had an opportunity to leave,"" she said. ""They opt to stay because it's their comfort zone."" But Johanna Tabin, a psychologist in Glencoe, Illinois, said Dugard's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity. Police said Phillip Garrido, one of her alleged abductors, is believed to be the father of her two daughters, and his relationship to Dugard -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation, Tabin said. It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said. ""Did she secretly mourn them?"" Tabin asked. ""Did she feel she stepped on a different planet where she was all of a sudden a grown-up 11-year-old and wasn't being treated anymore like a child?"" Her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping, Tabin said. At the same time, someone in Dugard's situation may have asked herself at the outset, ""Why did they let me get kidnapped?"" Lebow said. There is an infinite range of responses, but more information about Dugard's feelings growing up and in captivity would inform how she adjusts to her new life, Tabin said. The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said. ""It's basically like a wild child who may have had some contact with civilization, but basically is having to start life all over again, and that may be overwhelming to them at first,"" she said. Napoletano said she would suggest to a family like Dugard's to be accepting and supportive, and not ask a lot of questions. ""Go about your daily life as usual for the most part, and take the lead from the therapist, one small step at a time,"" she said. Lebow advises them against looking for some sudden moment of reconnection, but rather to be loving and patient. Coming back from combat . Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a ""hellacious war,"" Lebow said. A recent survey of military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful, according to three-quarters of respondents. Reunification brings excitement and relief, which is sometimes accompanied by emotional conflict, the surveyors said. Read more about the study . In the military, bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together, Tabin said. When service members come home, they may find life ""shallower,"" and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said. In a case where a husband has been away at war and returns to his wife, the desire to understand one another's feelings is fundamental, she said. ""She wants to be understanding, he wants to be able to shove it aside, then he has nightmares, and she says, 'you're not setting it aside,' "" Tabin said. ""Well, consciously he is -- he's not awake when he dreams."" Don't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences, Napoletano said. She also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war. Waking up in the morning, going grocery shopping, washing clothes and doing other day-to-day activities help create a stable, comforting environment, she said.","Jaycee Dugard, found August 27, is reuniting with her family after 18 years .

"(CNN) -- Children playing in a Texas suburb made a gruesome discovery Monday -- the decomposing body of a child on a residential street. Authorities aren't sure who left the body under a tarp in Saginaw, a northern suburb of Fort Worth. So far, police have very few clues. ""We are looking for a red truck. We don't have a model or a make,"" Saginaw police spokesman Damon Ing told CNN. He said the truck has green paint splattered on its right rear quarter panel. Police said they don't know the child's identity and would not disclose the child's gender. CNN affiliate KTVT said no children from the area have been reported missing.

""He's doubled down on a lot of things."" ""In his State of the Union he didn't even say the word 'poverty,' "" said Damon. ""You've got millions of people languishing in it."" Damon, who backed the Obama campaign in 2008, said he appreciates that the president is a ""deep thinker."" The actor called Obama brilliant, but said he ""definitely wanted more."" When questioned about what he'd do about Afghanistan, Damon said, ""I don't think the mission there has been very well articulated. And I think it would help to kind of reframe the way we're thinking about being there and why we're there."" Damon also said there has not been a meaningful reform of Wall Street. He said he believes that is ""dangerous"" and ""shameful"" and that the financial crisis is ""just going to happen again,"" because ""they don't make anything. They don't build anything."" Morgan asked about Damon's well-known disapproval of Sarah Palin and the fact that he has spoken out against her since she was announced as John McCain's running mate in 2008. Damon said he still feels it was reckless to have someone who was ""a complete mystery to everybody"" be ""literally a heartbeat away from the presidency."" Damon also said he disagrees with Palin politically. ""She's not somebody who I would vote for."" Damon said, though, that while he is passionate about politics, he has no political aspirations. ""I feel like the work I do now allows me to change things,"" he said. Damon said he puts most of his free time into the nonpartisan Water.org movement, which is dedicated to getting clean water to people.

"(CNN) -- The roadblocks went up on a Friday at several points in two Alabama towns, about 40 miles on either side of Birmingham. For the next two days, off-duty sheriff's deputies in St. Clair County, to the east, and Bibb County, to the southwest, flagged down motorists and steered them toward federal highway safety researchers. The researchers asked them a few questions about drinking and drug use and asked them for breath, saliva and blood samples -- offering them $10 for saliva and $50 to give blood. It's not just in Alabama. The roadblocks are part of a national study led by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is trying to determine how many drivers are on the road with drugs or alcohol in their systems. Similar roadblocks will be erected in dozens of communities across the nation this year, according to the agency. It's been going on for decades. Previous surveys date to the 1970s. The last one was run in 2007, and it included the collection of blood and saliva samples without apparent controversy, sheriff's spokesmen in both Alabama counties said. But this time, it's happening as the Obama administration struggles to explain revelations that U.S. spy organizations have been tracking phone and Internet traffic. Against that backdrop, the NHTSA-backed roadblocks have led to complaints in Alabama about an intrusive federal government. Gov. Robert Bentley complained that his office had not been notified that the surveys were going to be conducted. Speaking on a Birmingham radio show, Bentley, a Republican, said the stops were ""bad timing"" after the NSA revelations and in light of recent complaints about the Internal Revenue Service subjecting conservative groups that applied for tax exemptions to additional scrutiny. Bentley spokesman Jeremy King said the governor's office ""is working to find out exactly what took place during those surveys."" ""We just want to make sure the rights of our citizens are protected,"" King said. And Susan Watson, executive director of the Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the use of deputies to conduct the survey an ""abuse of power."" Even though the survey is voluntary, people still feel they need to comply when asked by a police officer, she said. ""How voluntary is it when you have a police officer in uniform flagging you down?"" Watson asked. ""Are you going to stop? Yes, you're going to stop."" The agency said in a statement that the survey provides ""critical information"" to reduce drunken or drugged driving. ""Impaired driving accounts for more than 10,000 deaths per year, and findings from this survey will be used to maximize the impact of policy development, education campaigns, law enforcement efforts and other activities aimed at reducing this problem,"" it said. The program costs about $7.9 million over three years, from planning the study to analyzing the results, it said. ""The survey provides useful data about alcohol and drug use by drivers, and participation is completely voluntary and anonymous,"" it said. ""More than 60 communities across the country will participate this year, including two Alabama counties, both of which also participated in the previous survey in 2007. NHTSA always works closely with state safety officials and local law enforcement to conduct these surveys as we work to better inform our efforts to reduce drunk and drugged driving."" The agency said the 8,000 drivers expected to take part will do so voluntarily and anonymously, and researchers follow ""a highly scientific protocol and complex statistical design in order to accurately reflect the problem nationwide."" Supreme Court rules DNA swabbing after arrest is legal . In the 2007 survey, about 7,700 drivers gave saliva samples and 3,300 gave blood at survey sites run during both day and night. Among drivers who were interviewed at night, 12.4% had alcohol in their systems, while about 16% had used marijuana, cocaine or over-the-counter or prescription drugs. Cliff Sims, publisher of the Alabama conservative blog Yellowhammer Politics, said the complaints are mostly because of the bad timing Bentley mentioned. But, he added, ""I think it's also that it has a lot to do with a larger distrust of government and people feeling more and more like their privacy has been invaded. ""When you see that taken out of the online space, where it's not quite as tangible, and into the real, physical world, that's the kind of visible and tangible thing that people can latch onto,"" he said. Sims said he doesn't believe that the roadblocks are the result of ""some sort of sinister conspiracy."" But, he added, ""I think it's inappropriate to have uniformed police officers on the side of the road taking people's saliva samples, whether it's voluntary or not."" The off-duty sheriff's deputies who took part this year set up traffic signs notifying motorists that a national traffic survey was being conducted, said Bibb County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Lawrence, who worked at one of the five sites around Centerville. The next half-dozen drivers who came by were flagged down and asked whether they wanted to take part in the program. If they did, they were steered into a spot where researchers from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, which conducted the survey for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, began asking them questions. Once they drove off, deputies flagged down another car to take their place. ""It was all voluntary. Nobody was made to participate or anything like that,"" Lawrence said. ""They could just answer the little 10 survey questions and then leave, or they could answer the questions and give the mouth sample, or they could do it all."" Deputies were told they were not to make arrests, he said. If a breath sample indicated that a driver was legally intoxicated, ""The organization would handle them as far as a ride home."" Lawrence said most motorists opted in, although several at the roadblock he worked bowed out. ""I had mostly traffic of folks going to and from work,"" he said. ""We had several that would say, you know, 'I don't have time' or 'I'm on my way to work, I can't.' "" Lawrence said Bibb County had no complaints about its role in the 2007 survey. Nor did St. Clair County, said Lt. Freddie Turrentine, a sheriff's spokesman there.","Alabama sheriff's deputies erect roadblocks for a federal drug and alcohol survey .

"(CNN) -- As a rehabilitation physician, I've supported many of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act since before Barack Obama's presidency began. During the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009, I wrote an essay called ""Standing up for Obama's health plan,"" and I have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us, most especially disabled Americans, stand to share under the ACA. But when the Obama administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the ACA, they lost my faith in their political wisdom. There was a practical necessity to many of the president's other compromises in order to get the ACA passed. Regrettably, it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state-based social services. It allows states to eviscerate Medicaid in ways that don't make sense. In some states, Medicaid pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital, but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person's ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social-service safety net. The vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers, although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000, and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. Low-quality insurance, like so-called ""mini medical"" plans, is common. Employees won't know their coverage is insufficient until it's too late. If you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma, the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply won't be enough. I've seen this gut-wrenching situation time and again. True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace, where health care is centered. But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA's requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2,000 to $3,000, the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. It is delaying a critical national debate on what the ACA minimums should be. How did this happen? The administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists, who, according to Politico, ""mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior White House officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical."" It's too bad patients and health care providers didn't get their counterbalancing message out. Without it, the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses weren't ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer (or don't). Without that critical information, the rest of the already heavily compromised ACA apparatus starts to tilt precariously. How can the government enforce the individual mandate, which requires people to buy insurance if their employers don't offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced? Without information from businesses, the government won't know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not. The federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits. American business lobbyists don't gripe so much about the nearly $200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer-offered health benefits nontaxable. You'd think businesses would be pleased that the Congressional Budget Office projects that businesses that don't offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $10 billion in penalties in 2014. Now they'll be paying zilch. In its notice announcing the ACA delay, the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. But so what? The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it. America's employers, left to their own devices, have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long. Peachtree Hotel Group, which owns a variety of chain hotels, mostly in the South, recently disclosed to The Wall Street Journal how much it nickle-and-dimes the health of its 550 employees. The company's chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan, and now that the ACA is delayed for a year, it may increase the employee contribution on the full-benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law. The next time you stay at Peachtree's Courtyard by Marriott in Gulf Shores, Alabama, know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that Peachtree can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees. But if a Peachtree employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury, every taxpaying citizen of Alabama would be paying a few cents more to provide the Medicaid coverage and social services the patient needs. Why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit? These are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the ACA should combat. The retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act's wounded carcass. Republicans are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the ACA is unworkable. They're using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law. They're right to do so. The ACA represents a large, painful change for a number of American institutions. Hospitals, doctors, patients, insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society's many layers. Handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us, and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections. The administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned. Mortally wounding the ACA before the coming battle isn't compromise -- it's foreshadowing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ford Vox.","Ford Vox says the new delay in employer mandate has made him lose faith in Obama's wisdom .

"(Mental Floss) -- Eight trailblazing scientists who are about to change your life. Japan's Osaka University professor Hiroshi Ishiguro checks a humanoid robot 'Actroid Repliee' in June of 2005. 1. Erich Jarvis, neurobiologist . When Duke professor Erich Jarvis wanted to find the key to human communication, he turned to birds. Strange, but true. Jarvis has been studying songbirds' brains for insight into human linguistics, and his research has led to a startling discovery: Birds use two distinct neural pathways to learn songs -- one in the front of the brain and one in the back. Guess what? Humans learn to speak in the same way. Jarvis believes this is an evolutionary clue suggesting that, when we shared an ancestor 300 million years ago, our brains were hardwired for language. Theoretically, once Jarvis and other neuroscientists fully understand this genetic blueprint, they can alter it and, in the process, make it easier to learn new languages and possibly even repair brain damage. 2. Emily Oster, Economist . A few years ago, as an economics PhD student at Harvard, Emily Oster chose to focus her attention on the AIDS epidemic in Africa. Traditionally, that was the turf of sociologists, anthropologists, and public health officials. But the 26-year-old Oster wasn't afraid to hop the scientific fence and join the other side. She also hasn't been afraid to suggest things we haven't heard before -- namely, that treating herpes and other STDs (instead of AIDS) can significantly reduce HIV transmissions. Oster also believes that while the HIV numbers commonly used by the UN, popular press, and researchers are about three times too high, the disease is spreading faster than ever in Africa. By casting her economist's eyes on the issue, Oster has forced the old turf-guarders to reevaluate their approaches to AIDS in Africa and come up with new solutions. 3. Hiroshi Ishiguro, roboticist . Most robots look like, well, robots, but Ishiguro's robots look remarkably human. To many people, this is discomforting -- creepy even. To Ishiguro, it's essential. As director of Osaka University's Intelligent Robotics Lab, Ishiguro believes robots' main role in our future will be to interact naturally with people -- to pitch in as the workforce shrinks or to do necessary, unpleasant tasks. And because Ishiguro contends that people respond better to his humanlike robots (aka, androids) than other machine-like ones, he's taken a no-holds-barred approach to studying cognitive behavior and human activity. In addition to nearly perfecting his silicone molds and metal skeletons, he's figured out how to mimic even the most minute human movements, such as breathing, blinking, and even fidgeting. The result is ""android science."" The idea is that by using robots that are indistinguishable from humans in scientific experiments, researchers can still elicit natural responses from their subjects but also have more control over the environment. So far, Ishiguro has already learned plenty about his students using the Geminoid HI-1, an android version of himself, which he operates via remote control to teach class. 4. Pardis Sabeti, biological anthropologist . Pulling a typical all-nighter in med school, Pardis Sabeti achieved a not-so-typical feat -- she confirmed the effects of genetics on the evolution of human diseases. By inputting different DNA sequences into an algorithm she created, Sabeti was able to find genes still linked to their neighbors -- suggesting that their success within the gene pool is due to natural selection, not pure chance. Sabeti now plans on using her algorithm to deconstruct the malaria parasite. By seeing how the parasite has evolved to develop drug resistances, she hopes to detect genetic vulnerabilities in malaria's makeup. If she's successful, future cures will be designed to attack those weaknesses. Meanwhile, Sabeti isn't your typical lab rat. She's the lead singer of the alt-rock band Thousand Days and sounds more than a little like Liz Phair. And did we mention that she's a Rhodes Scholar who just graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 2006? 5. Thomas A. Jackson, aerospace engineer . Piloting a real-life Luke Skywalker X-wing fighter is every aeronautical engineer's fantasy, and Thomas Jackson is helping make it a reality. A scientist for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Jackson is setting the direction for the supersonic combustion ramjet -- aka, the scramjet. By scooping up oxygen from the atmosphere as it ascends, the scramjet eliminates the need for the heavy liquid oxygen and solid oxidizer used by a typical space shuttle. And once it catches on, it will revolutionize air travel. How does a 2-hour flight from New York to Sydney sound? Or a layover on the Moon? And the best thing is, it'll all happen sooner than you think. In April 2007, NASA successfully test-powered a hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engine to Mach 5. 6. Sebastian Thrun, probabilistic roboticist . Sebastian Thrun is a Stanford professor who drives a Volkswagen -- but not just any Volkswagen. Thrun's Touareg is autonomous, and its name is Stanley. The VW drives itself thanks to state-of-the-art road-finding and obstacle-avoidance software, along with radar systems, video screens, and laser range finders. Like every driver, Stanley makes mistakes, and Thrun programmed him with that in mind. Stanley's decisions are based not on absolutes, but on probabilities, which results in more natural and realistic driver reactions. But Thrun isn't so sure people will immediately hand over the keys to a bunch of Stanleys. It may take up to 30 years, he says, ""simply because we don't know how to insure a car where no one is at the wheel."" 7. Nima Arkani-Hamed, particle physicist and applied string theorist . Nima Arkani-Hamed thinks big. He has a theory that our universe is one of an infinite number of universes -- meaning the largest thing we can wrap our minds around is actually pretty tiny . He didn't pull the ""multiverse"" out of thin air, though. After becoming a Harvard professor at age 30, Arkani-Hamed first made a name for himself by suggesting that our universe is five-dimensional. Then he moved on to the multiverse, theorizing that our own universe has a hidden feature called ""split supersymmetry,"" which means that half of all particles have partner particles. The theory will be tested soon in Switzerland's brand-new Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and if the LHC finds Arkani-Hamed's partner particles, it could prove that the multiverse is real -- and that our place in it is that much smaller. 8. Margaret Turnbull, astrobiologist . Hunting for aliens isn't necessarily the most respected academic endeavor in the world, but Margaret Turnbull pursued it anyway. More precisely, she set out to catalog the stars most likely to develop intelligent alien civilizations. Turnbull's system was painstakingly tedious. She started with the 120,000 cataloged stars, narrowed down her list to 17,129 (excluding the ones that were too hot, too close together, or too erratic), and then parsed that list down to 100 candidates. Her final criteria? An ideal star would be at least 3 billion years old and have a high iron content (the better to spin off life-yielding planets with). Turnbull's mind-blowing patience has paid off. In 2015, NASA will be launching its Terrestrial Planet Finder, which will use space telescopes to look for planets beyond our solar system, and it'll start with the stars on Turnbull's short list. In other words, nobody's laughing at Turnbull's search for aliens now. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- As a giant red backhoe gouged into the Florida home where a massive sinkhole swallowed a man, pieces of the family's lives were pushed into public view. Walls with picture frames on them came crashing down. Baby toys and clothes on hangers were raked across the ground. A woman wept as an official handed her a framed portrait. Others lovingly salvaged military awards, a pink teddy bear and an American flag that hung near the house's front door. The family Bible bore claw marks from the backhoe's bucket. Workers demolished the blue, one-story home as carefully as they could Sunday and Monday to try to protect family belongings. By Monday afternoon, all the walls of the house were gone and ""a lot of the debris"" had been removed, Hillsborough County spokesman Willie Puz said. ""What we're going to be doing now is to try to stabilize the hole with gravel,"" Puz added. Officials have said Jeff Bush's body won't be recovered. It remains buried somewhere in the sinkhole that stretches 20 feet wide and more than 50 feet deep. Authorities made the heartbreaking decision to stop the search for Bush, 36, after his odds of survival became abundantly clear. ""We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush, and so for that reason, the rescue effort is being discontinued,"" Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill told reporters Saturday. ""At this point, it's really not possible to recover the body."" Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . A deafening noise . The family's nightmare began Thursday night, just as everyone was about to go to sleep. A deafening noise shattered the peace in the house in the Tampa suburb of Seffner. Jeremy Bush heard his brother scream and ran toward Jeff's bedroom. ""Everything was gone. My brother's bed, my brother's dresser, my brother's TV. My brother was gone,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" Jeremy Bush jumped into the hole and frantically shoveled away rubble. But as the house's floor further collapsed, a sheriff's deputy pulled him to safety and his brother remained trapped below. ""I couldn't get him out,"" Jeremy Bush said, weeping. ""I tried so hard. I tried everything I could."" Jeremy Bush and four others, including a 2-year-old child, were uninjured. 'One step at a time' After the search for Jeff Bush ended, attention turned to razing the house because officials warned it could collapse at any time. The demolition crew worked for only a few hours Sunday to give the family time to sift through their belongings, Merrill said. Once officials get a better view of the sinkhole, ""they can get a sense of what the next step is,"" Merrill, the county administrator, said Sunday. ""This is one step at a time, because we really don't know what we're dealing with here,"" he said. A common problem in Florida . Sinkholes are a common problem in the state, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Florida lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater, forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what's above it. Hillsborough County, on Florida's west coast, is part of an area known as ""sinkhole alley"" that accounts for two-thirds of the sinkhole-related insurance claims in the state, according to a Florida state Senate Insurance and Banking Committee report. A sinkhole opened up Monday afternoon about three miles from the Bush home. The hole was between two houses, one of them vacant, and caused no structural damage, Hillsborough County Fire Rescue said. The hole measures 12 feet across and four to five feet deep, said Puz, the county spokesman. He said there is no reason to believe the holes are related. 'So many memories' The crater that suddenly caved under the Bush house devastated a family that had lived there for generations. After officials called off the search for his brother's body, Jeremy Bush told Bay News 9 the family was despondent. ""It's not just I lost my brother. There are so many memories in this house,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""My wife and her brother and the whole family. ""Every holiday, we gathered at this house. Her grandmother passed away. All the stuff to remember her by is in this house, and we're losing it all. You can't replace that. You can't replace a life being gone."" Check out the latest news on CNN.com .

"(CNN) -- Tomatoes are again safe to eat, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday, weeks after the food was blamed as a source of a salmonella outbreak in the United States and Canada. The federal agency lifted its warning about tomatoes but left in place a warning about raw jalapeño and serrano peppers, having previously said those foods also may be linked to the outbreak. The source of the outbreak still isn't known -- and 20 to 30 reports of the illness are coming in per day -- but the FDA said the epidemic is ""waning."" The FDA hasn't determined whether tomatoes were a source of the outbreak, but it has determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for food protection, according to The Associated Press. Salmonella Saintpaul -- a rare form of the bacteria -- has infected more than 1,190 people in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Canada since April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 370 of those people became ill on or after June 1, the CDC said. At least 224 people have been hospitalized. Two elderly men with pre-existing conditions died while infected with Salmonella Saintpaul, and the FDA said the infection could have contributed to their deaths. Investigators initially thought that certain types of tomatoes were the source of the outbreak, and further investigation also cast suspicions on raw jalapeño and serrano peppers.  Samonella sleuths still on the trail . Many of the infected people were thought to have eaten tomatoes from farms in south Florida and parts of Mexico, but inspectors haven't found the outbreak strain on those farms, Acheson said, according to the AP. The scare prompted grocery chains nationwide to pull tomatoes from their shelves and some restaurants to stop offering them as ingredients. Tommy Thompson, former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said earlier this month the scare had cut $450 million from tomato growers' income. Federal health investigators have visited farms in Florida, Texas and Mexico to try to determine the source of the outbreak, according to the CDC. The FDA has said that because raw jalapeño and serrano peppers may be linked to the outbreak, people at risk for developing severe infections -- infants, elderly people and people with compromised immune systems -- should avoid eating them. Food borne illnesses result in more than 300,000 hospitalizations in the United States every year, according to the CDC. About 76 million cases of food borne disease occur annually in the United States, the CDC said. Salmonella can lead to infections involving diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and sometimes a low-grade fever. In most cases, an infected person will recover within a week without medicine simply by staying hydrated, doctors have said. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report . Copyright 2008 CNN.

"Madrid (CNN) -- A gang that smuggled Chinese citizens into the United States and Europe, sometimes forcing them to work as prostitutes, has been busted with 75 arrests in Spain and France, authorities announced Saturday. The trafficking ring was based in -- and directed from -- China, but its two suspected leaders in Europe were arrested in the operation, in Barcelona, Spanish national police said in a statement. Besides the two main suspects, Spanish police arrested 49 others carrying forged passports at the airports in Barcelona, Madrid, Palma de Mallorca and five other cities. In France, there were 24 arrests. The smugglers charged 40,000 to 50,000 euros ($53,000 to $66,000) to transport Chinese citizens, assigned with false identities, to the United States, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Britain, Ireland and Turkey, the statement said. Spain was the next-to-last stop for many before they went to the preferred locations of the United States and Britain, the statement said. Twins rescued as China hospital trafficking probe continues . The arrests were made last June and the case, at Spain's National Court, has been under seal until now, a national police spokesman told CNN on Saturday. All of the suspects are Chinese, or from elsewhere in Asia. All have had initial court appearances and have been ordered to remain in prison while the investigation continues or have been released by the judge, with conditions, said the spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The suspects include those who allegedly formed part of the smuggling ring and also those who paid for the forged documents, the spokesman said. Police seized 81 forged passports, ostensibly from Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan -- but all made in China, they said. Investigators also found three laptop computers, printers and 22 rubber stamps used to forge documents at homes they said the gang used in Barcelona, police said. The probe began two years ago. Investigators said the trafficking ring was intricately structured, divided into independent and virtually isolated cells to avoid detection, police said. The smugglers used their own set of trustworthy travel enforcers, well-versed in the airports and cities where the Chinese were taken. They kept the travelers under control, sometimes trying to pass them off unnoticed among groups of legitimate Chinese tourists. The ring was quick to react to security changes on the ground at a given airport, swiftly changing to another destination where it would be easier to have their people slip past security controls, the statement said. Once a delivery of smuggled Chinese citizens had been completed, the travel enforcers would return to their bases in China and Malaysia to await further instructions, and to avoid detection by Western police forces, police said. Spanish police have been active in recent years in fighting human trafficking rings that lured citizens from Asia, Africa or Eastern Europe to Spain. The victims are often promised a better life, but then subjected to harsh forced labor conditions in clandestine factories or forced them into prostitution.","Smugglers charged up to $66,000 to bring migrants into Europe and the U.S., police say .

"(CNN) -- On North Halsted Street, between Buckingham and Roscoe in Chicago, a monument stands with a plaque in honor of a brilliant thinker who is as responsible for the way we live our lives today as any person who has ever lived. His name is Alan Turing, a Brit, and among his many credits and accolades, many historians refer to him as ""the father of computer science."" When Time magazine listed him among its 100 most influential people of the 20th century, it said ""that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine."" A pretty high honor to say the least. And yet in 1952, while filing a robbery report with the police, Turing -- the man whose algorithms cracked the Enigma code used by the Nazis in World War II -- found himself arrested at his home in England. His crime? Being gay. Turing was convicted of ""gross indecency,"" a felony in Britain at that time. He was forced to choose between prison and being injected with female hormones, a form of chemical castration. He reluctantly chose the latter. Despite his accomplishments, he lost his job. And in June 1954, he lost his will to live. He was 41. If the Western world is somewhat haunted by what Steve Jobs might have accomplished had cancer not taken him from us, we should be downright tormented by what we lost from the senseless excommunication of his predecessor. Turing's plaque is one of 18 that make up the city's Legacy Walk, which honors LGBT people who have made a contribution to history. It's a reminder of where we were and how far we've come. But as much as it seems the nation is talking about this topic, the fact remains that in much of the United States, it is still legal to fire someone for the same reason that Turing was fired 60 years ago in Britain. Perhaps the prejudices in our rear view mirror may appear farther away than they actually are. June is Gay Pride month. So if you find yourself exhausted from all of this gay rights talk and want to leave a not-so-kind comment on a story, remember it's because of an openly gay man that you even have the technology to do so. If you're a black person who gets offended whenever the Civil Rights Movement is mentioned in the same sentence as the fight for gay rights, remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s close confidant and most influential mentor was an openly gay black man by the name of Bayard Rustin. And if you ever find yourself wondering ""How come there's no Straight Pride month?"" I say the day being straight becomes a crime -- as being gay still is in many parts of the world -- start one. Gay Pride was not born out of a need to celebrate not being straight but our right to exist without prosecution. Just as Stokely Carmichael's ""Black is Beautiful"" became the rallying cry against racism in the 1960s; just as ""I am woman, hear me roar"" was the anthem against sexism in the 1970s; ""gay pride"" is the banner that flies over a people whose dignity continues to be put to a vote in 2013. News coverage in June may focus on the celebratory nature of Gay Pride parades, but it cannot rewrite the history that made these parades an integral part of our survival. Why isn't there Straight Pride? Because Congress has yet to pass a law requiring people to hide the fact they are straight. Because the streets are not filled with children who have been kicked out of their homes for being straight. Because there seems to be a lack of stories in which someone has been beaten, tied to a fence and left to die or shot in the face at point blank range because they were straight. For this Gay Pride month, Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said he expects to take up legislation to address workplace discrimination ""soon."" This month, the Supreme Court may make a ruling on whether or not same-sex couples can marry. This month, 11-year-old Marcel Neergaard wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed that ""during my first year in middle school, I experienced severe bullying. I was called terrible names that were quite hurtful. At that time, I had just realized that I'm gay, and the bullies used the word 'gay' as an insult. ""This made me feel like being gay was horrible, but my parents told me otherwise. Their support was tremendous. But as powerful as their love was, it couldn't fight off all the bullying. I don't want anyone else to feel the way I did. No one deserves that much pain, no matter who they are."" Yeah. So maybe instead of wondering why there isn't a straight pride month or movement, straight people should be thankful they don't need one. I'm sure Turing would have rather filed the police report and stayed home. I'm sure Marcel would prefer going to school in peace.

"(CNN) -- The sinkhole first opened up in August of 2011, a relatively small thing, 2 feet wide and 5 feet deep. But in the 15 months since then, Florida couple John and Tina Furlow have watched helplessly as the sinkhole expands, threatening to swallow their bedroom. ""Now it's approximately 8, 9 feet long,"" John Furlow told CNN affiliate WFLA last month at their home in Hernando County on Florida's west coast. ""Every day, in our bedroom, we lay down and look up and there's more and more cracks. We're just, 'hey look, there's another one,'"" said his wife. The growing cavern underneath their bedroom is reminiscent of another sinkhole in nearby Hillsborough County that claimed the life of Jeff Bush. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . Authorities demolished the house after they couldn't recover Bush's body from the massive hole that opened up under his bedroom. That sinkhole was about 20 feet wide and 50 to 60 feet deep, and the suburban Tampa house was in danger of collapsing. For the Furlows, the nightmare has developed much more slowly. Cracks have begun to appear on walls and floors, and the couple now sleeps in a different bedroom. They removed heavy furniture from their bedroom in hopes of buying more time. The couple told WFLA that they made a claim with their insurance company, but that a year and a half later there has been no resolution. A sinkhole can be catastrophic, as the incident that took Bush's life showed. New video obtained by CNN affiliate Bay News 9 shows the inside of the sinkhole that claimed his life. The video was taken by Hillsborough County officials before the house was demolished. It was recorded by attaching a camera to a pole that reached into Bush's bedroom through a window. The video shows a cavernous hole that left just the edges of the floor around the bedroom. Bush's brother, Jeremy, had jumped in the hole to try to rescue his brother, but only after he saw the video did he understand how large it was, and why officials pulled him out. ""It is totally different than what I thought it was,"" he told Bay News 9. Sinkholes are common in the state, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Florida lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater, forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what's above it.","A sinkhole slowly grows under Florida home .

"(CNN) -- The world's top two players will battle it out for the French Open title on Saturday, but their route to the Roland Garros final could not have been more different. Relief was evident on the face of defending champion and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova who survived a third-set comeback from Victoria Azarenka to nail down a hard-fought 6-1 2-6 6-4 victory. Conversely, Serena Williams, the world No. 1, was so dominant against Sara Errani that the Italian ironically celebrated the only game she won in a match that lasted just 46 minutes and ended 6-0 6-1. Sharapova must now try and arrest her poor record against the American, having won just two of their 15 encounters. Saturday's meeting will be the first time since 1995 that the top two seeds have faced each other in the final. Sharapova, from Russia, had been coasting in the first set but her Belarusian opponent battled back to exert similar dominance over the second. But a delay for rain allowed Sharapova to regroup and when she returned to Court Philippe Chatrier the 26-year-old fought off a late Azarenka charge to book a second successive final. ""I really had to play to the end today and I am extremely happy to be back in the final,"" Sharapova told reporters at a press conference. ""(The rain delay) gave me a little bit of time to think of what I did well in the first set and try to get that back again for the third."" Azarenka agreed the short rain break had stalled her comeback and played into her opponent's hands. ""I think the break kind of changed the momentum, for sure,"" she said. ""When we got back out I kind of didn't start the same way I was playing in the second set. ""I was just trying to make things happen too quick and started missing the ball. You know, it was a little bit unfortunate and inconsistent in that particular moment."" There were no such twists and turns in the other semifinal as Williams punished Errani, the No. 5 seed, right from the first point to reach only her second final in Paris. Williams hit 40 winners while Errani could only manage two. The Italian managed to claim just five points on Williams' serve. ""I told myself: 'Serena, just concentrate' and that's what I did,"" Williams, who beat sister Venus to win the 2002 French Open, said in an on-court interview. ""Against Maria, I will have to prepare slightly differently. She's a great player. But it's magnificent to be back in the final after 11 years."" Errani, a losing finalist to Sharapova last year, was philosophical after her sixth straight defeat to her American opponent. ""I enjoyed it,"" she told reporters. ""It was a great court, great weather. What she did today was unbelievable. She is so strong and is an unbelievable player."" ""It was a great day. I tried but that's sport. Sometimes you lose, but you have to stay in there and try until the last point. I gave it my all, but there was nothing I could do.""","Maria Sharapova will face Serena Williams in the women's French Open final .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Maj. Nidal Hasan's three standby attorneys made clear Friday they're still trying to leave the case, despite a military judge's earlier ruling keeping them on the job. As the admitted Fort Hood gunman's trial reconvened Friday morning, two of the attorneys asked to be excused so they could work on asking a higher court to overrule Judge Col. Tara Osborn's decision. Osborn allowed Maj. Christopher Martin and Maj. Joseph Marcee to leave the court while the third attorney, Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, remained with Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in a November 2009 shooting rampage at the Army post near Killeen, Texas. The three attorneys had asked on Wednesday to drop out of the case, saying they believed Hasan -- who is representing himself but has the three attorneys as backup -- was trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence. But Osborn ruled Thursday that they must continue, saying it was ""nothing more than their disagreement with Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense."" With Martin and Marcee away from the courtroom Friday, prosecutors continued a brisk march through the witness list, planning to call 17 more people for testimony -- among them, a number of wounded survivors of the massacre. By the end of Friday, prosecutors had called 48 of their 80 witnesses in three days -- a fast pace enabled in part by Hasan's declining to cross-examine anyone in the first two days. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage, admitted at the start of the trial Tuesday that he was the shooter at the Fort Hood medical building where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors allege the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case, said during opening statements. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Investigations that followed the Fort Hood killings found Hasan had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. The case was first set to begin in March 2012 but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved. Soldier on Soldier Attacks: Fast Facts . Prosecution witnesses have painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside the deployment processing center on the morning of November 5, 2009, as soldiers and civilians prepared to leave for Afghanistan and Iraq. Spec. Logan Barnett told the court his initial thought when he heard the shooting and the screams was that it was a training exercise because of a deadly shooting earlier at a mental health clinic at Iraq's Camp Victory. ""As the shots continued being fired repeatedly, the room filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood,"" Barnett said. Barnett dropped to the ground for cover, and then saw a friend, Staff. Sgt. Shawn Manning, take a shot to the chest and fall. ""Chaos. Horror. There was nothing but people falling down,"" he said. Barnett began to crawl toward nearby cubicles for cover. ""I was crawling over the bodies of people who weren't moving,"" Barnett said. ""There was a soldier with the back side of his head blown off."" Amid the killing, there were moments of heroism. Barnett told the court how he saw Capt. John Gaffney get up from the floor with a folding chair to attack the shooter. ""He was shot and killed in front of me,"" said Barnett, who picked up a folding table to throw at the shooter as he reloaded. ""I stood up, charged and prepared to throw the table."" But by then the shooter had reloaded and pointed his gun at Barnett, shooting him in the head. Barnett told the court he managed to crawl toward the cubicle, even as Hasan shot him three more times. Two soldiers hiding under a desk offered him aid. ""I told the two soldiers, 'We can't stay here and die,'"" he said. ""I told them to go, to run through the south entrance and not look back until they found help."" Barnett used his body to act as a shield as the two soldiers made a run for it. Then, according to Barnett, he started to crawl over broken glass and bodies toward another exit. Barnett made it out of the building on his own before being grabbed by the collar and dragged to safety. Fort Hood witness on Hasan: 'His punishment will come' The court-martial was scheduled to resume Monday at 9 a.m. local time. CNN's Josh Rubin reported from Fort Hood. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Josh Levs and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Maj. Nidal Hasan's standby attorneys are appealing order to stay on case .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration finally got it right when it decided to stop fighting to put age limits on who can buy morning-after pill Plan B without a prescription. The fight started a year and a half ago, when apparently for the first time in history, the secretary of health and human services overruled a Food and Drug Administration decision. The FDA said Plan B should be sold the way aspirin is sold -- with no restrictions. The Obama administration wanted age limits; a coalition of reproductive rights groups sued the government, and on Monday, the Justice Department backed down and ended the legal wrangling. Plan B One-Step is a form of emergency contraception. It works like other forms of birth control pills, by preventing an egg from being released from the ovaries. Feds drop 'morning-after pill' appeal . It has secondary effects as well. It may work to prevent fertilization of an egg if one has already been released. It may also stop an egg that has been fertilized from implanting in the wall of the uterus. But it does not cause an already implanted, fertilized egg to be aborted. In other words, it only works to prevent pregnancy, not to end one. The difference between this drug and conventional birth control pills is that it can be taken right after sex instead of daily. Plan B is safe. Long before HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA, adults could buy it without a prescription. If you were 17 and could show identification proving your age, you could also buy the drug without a prescription. If you were 16 and younger, you needed one. This is not the way drugs are normally treated. Usually, there are prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs. Few fall into this prove-your-age category. Pseudoephedrine does, for instance, because people are concerned you might take it and make crystal meth. But the vast, vast majority of medications do not. To enact this kind of pre-authorization, you'd need a compelling reason. Some argued that allowing the drug to be sold so freely to kids would be implicit consent for them to have sex. I hate to break it to you, but they're having sex already. Don't take my word for it as a pediatrician -- lots of research shows that kids are having sex before they are 16. Whether or not Plan B is sold in pharmacies without a prescription isn't going to change that. Moreover, this is the same argument people have made about the HPV vaccine, that it would make girls more promiscuous, and research shows that isn't true. Others, including the Obama administration, argued that it was too dangerous for girls to be allowed access to this drug because they couldn't understand its proper use, and they might abuse it. This might be a compelling argument, if it, too, hadn't already been studied. As the FDA conducted the review that informed its decision, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research specifically evaluated whether Plan B was safe and effective in younger girls, whether they understood its proper use, and whether they appreciated that it wouldn't protect them from sexually transmitted infections. The center found that girls did understand all of these points, and that's why it ruled that it could be sold to them without a prescription. This argument seems to be applied only to Plan B, and not any other drugs. For instance, in 2011, more than 117,000 calls were made to poison control centers for kids under the age of 5 because of exposure to pain medications. More than 44,000 calls were made for small children exposed to antihistamines. Even more calls were made for adults. These drugs cause thousands of problems a year, and sometimes even deaths. Yet no one thinks about making those medications harder to get. President Barack Obama said that the reason a 10- or 11-year-old should not be able to buy Plan B ""alongside bubble gum or batteries"" was because if they didn't use it properly, it ""could have an adverse effect."" From 2008 till 2011, 10 children died in the United States from ingesting batteries. Plan B killed no one at all. This decision matters. Although Plan B is legally available to girls age 17 with proof-of-age right now, misinformation, and sometimes pharmacists' views, can prevent girls from obtaining the drug in time. Research proves this. If you don't take the medication soon after sex, it becomes less effective. Delays -- such as needing to get a prescription, or being denied it by a pharmacist -- could make it useless. When Obama took office, he promised to shield science from politics. Yet in ignoring the findings of the FDA, he did the opposite. Science shows Plan B is safe and effective, and meets the standards for over-the-counter use. Science shows that other drugs are far more dangerous, yet they receive none of the consideration Plan B does. This drug is controversial because it involves sex and pregnancy. In deciding not to pursue the case, the Department of Justice has chosen to side with science. Those reasons, unfortunately, appear to be more pragmatic than scientific. It seems that even now, a senior administration official told The Washington Post, Obama still opposes over-the-counter access to emergency contraception for young girls. Some believe that this move is a political decision -- that he really isn't opposed but gets to appear like he is while still getting the decision he wants. If that's the case, it's a bit too cynical for me. I'd rather see an administration that is consistent in its reliance on science, data and evidence. In this case, the administration got it right, even if it's for the wrong reason. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Administration stopped fighting to put age limits on buying morning-after pill Plan B .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Bloodshed intermingled with blood oaths early Wednesday in Egypt. Opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsy clashed violently at Cairo University, killing at least 16 people and wounding 200 more late Tuesday and early Wednesday, according to the state-run EgyNews agency. Egypt's army ""will sacrifice our blood,"" its leaders vowed Wednesday to defend the country just hours after President Mohamed Morsy refused to bow to an ultimatum they issued two days before: Find a solution to the deadly unrest sweeping the country or be pushed aside. The statement posted on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces came as the clock ticked on the military's plan to suspend Egypt's constitution, dissolve the Islamist-led parliament and sideline the president, if Morsy does not find a way to end the unrest, military sources told Arab media and Reuters. ""We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist, extremist or fool,"" said the statement, which was titled ""The Final Hours."" The military has given Morsy until 4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET ) to come up with a power-sharing agreement or face a military solution, the sources said. Morsy refused to bow to the ultimatum, setting the stage for a possible showdown. In a televised speech late Tuesday, Morsy declared he was elected president in balloting that was free and representative of the will of the people. ""The people of Egypt gave me the mandate for president. They chose me in a free election. The people created a constitution which requires me to stay with the constitution,"" he said. ""I have no choice but to bear responsibility for the Egyptian constitution."" The conflict pits Morsy's supporters -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- against an opposition angered by what they say is the president's failure to take steps to improve conditions more than two years after a popular revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Morsy gave no indication of stepping down, sharing power or calling early elections, saying he was calling on the military to withdraw its ultimatum and return to its rightful work. In Morsy's place, the military has said it would install an interim council, made up mainly of civilians, until a new constitution can be drafted and a new president elected, the sources said. It was unclear what steps the military would take given Morsy's refusal to meet its Wednesday evening deadline. The military has previously stopped short of saying that it was suggesting a coup. The ultimatum was meant to push all factions toward a national consensus; the armed forces aren't looking to be part of the political or ruling circles, a spokesman, Col. Ahmed Ali, said Monday in a written statement. While insisting they want no direct role in national politics, the military leaders appeared to be pressuring Morsy to restructure his government. The steps could include reducing the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in his Cabinet and calling early presidential and parliamentary elections, a source close to highly placed members of Egypt's leadership told CNN. Violent clashes . The news came as reports surfaced of clashes between anti-Morsy protesters and Morsy's supporters in Cairo where anti-government demonstrators took to the streets for the third consecutive day calling for the country's first democratically elected president to step down. Conflicting casualty reports Tuesday afternoon and into the evening put the death toll across Egypt anywhere from two to seven people killed and 144 wounded, according to Arab media and sources. CNN could not confirm the casualty counts. The growing unrest prompted U.S. President Barack Obama's administration to urge Morsy to call early elections, while warning the Egyptian military that it risked losing U.S. aid if it carried out a coup, senior administration officials told CNN. Opinion: Egyptians are fed up with Morsy . On Facebook, Morsy's Islamist-backed Freedom and Justice Party called for several nationwide rallies to support the leader. Thousands of his supporters poured into the streets in a Cairo suburb and at Cairo University. Clashes were reported in at least one Cairo suburb between anti-government demonstrators and pro-Morsy protesters, according to Arab media. Anti-Morsy protesters have gathered in huge numbers outside a presidential palace where Morsy has been working in recent days. They also have taken to other main squares in cities nationwide. It was not clear whether Morsy was in the palace. The anti-government group Tamarod, or ""rebel,"" said in a posting on its Twitter account that Morsy ""has no option but to leave"" along with the prime minister and the Shura Council, the upper house of parliament. In the face of the anti-government protests, which began over the weekend, five ministers announced their resignations Monday. The latest was Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported. Governments issue warnings against travel to Egypt . Thousands demonstrate . Demonstrations continued Tuesday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where thousands of anti-Morsy protesters had massed, cheering as Apache helicopters buzzed the crowd. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo, which has been closed since June 30, will remain closed on Wednesday. The UK was warning against all but essential travel to Egypt, and Canada said it was closing its embassy until further notice ""for security reasons."" Although the U.S. is urging Morsy to call new elections, it did not say Morsy should step down immediately, the senior Obama administration officials said. ""We are saying to him, 'Figure out a way to go for new elections,'"" a senior official said. ""That may be the only way that this confrontation can be resolved."" The officials said nothing in the Egyptian constitution gives Morsy the authority to call for new elections but said that may be the only way to end the crisis. Opinion: In Egypt, rage must lead to game plan . A State Department spokeswoman, however, denied the assertion. ""The reports that we have been urging early elections are inaccurate,"" Jen Psaki told reporters. The officials said the United States has also warned the Egyptian military that a coup would trigger U.S. legislation that calls for cutting off all American aid. Psaki acknowledged that ""there are conditions on aid,"" but said, ""That's way ahead of where we are in the process."" Rand Paul: Stop using U.S. taxpayer money to aid Morsy . On Monday, Obama encouraged Morsy in a telephone call to ensure that his government represents all Egyptians, ""including the many Egyptians demonstrating."" Morsy's government has insisted that its decisions are legitimate, because it was democratically elected. Obama addressed this argument directly in his conversation with Morsy. ""He stressed that democracy is about more than elections,"" the statement said. Obama reiterated to Morsy that the United States does not support any party or movement in Egypt, it said. He called for an end to violence on all sides and expressed particular concern about sexual assaults on women. State-funded Egyptian daily Al-Ahram has reported 46 sexual assaults during anti-Morsy protests in Egypt since Sunday, citing the volunteer group Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment. A Dutch journalist was reportedly raped Friday while covering protests, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. She was hospitalized and underwent surgery before flying back to the Netherlands. Over the weekend, an Egyptian journalist died in a bomb attack on a Muslim Brotherhood office; four other local journalists were beaten and their camera equipment destroyed or stolen. Two Egyptian journalists were wounded by shotgun fire. Morsy has few friends as deadline looms . Morsy's failings . Morsy, a U.S.-educated Islamist, was elected Egypt's president in June 2012, but critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian during his year in power. And he has failed to revive Egypt's economy, which crashed when the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak drove tourists away. That has disaffected many of his supporters among Egypt's poor and middle classes, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ""That some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized Egypt is a year after the election of Morsy,"" Gerges said. ""Think of the millions of people who cheered Morsy after his election. Think of the millions of Egyptians who pinned their hopes on Morsy. ""A year later, now, the millions of Egyptians who cheered for Morsy are saying he must go."" Gerges questioned Morsy's ability to continue to lead but said he doubted the military would depose him. Such a move ""would plunge Egypt into a greater legal, political and institutional crisis,"" he said. The military will want to see the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood reduced in government and in the constitution, Gerges said. Mubarak had long repressed the Islamic political movement, but it is now the nation's most powerful political force. Anti-government demonstrators say they have collected 17 million signatures -- 4 million more than the number who voted Morsy into the presidency -- calling for him to go. The opposition comprises various groups and loose coalitions, some of which are loyal to the ousted Mubarak government, while others want the army to intervene. AbdulMawgoud Dardery, a former member of parliament and a Muslim Brotherhood representative, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" that the military could be an ""honest broker"" in a national dialogue. He said Morsy has reached out to opposition leaders many times, but the opposition ""is afraid of democracy."" ""It failed in the previous five elections we had in Egypt since the revolution, and they don't want to fail a sixth time,"" he said. ""That's why they're going to street politics."" U.S. student killed in Egypt was enthralled with region .

"(CNN) -- Several months ago, Meaghin and Jonathan Jordan were strolling through a shop near their home in Kiln, Mississippi, when they spotted a box of high-powered magnets that could be arranged and rearranged into various shapes. ""We said, 'These look neat. This would be something fun for us to do,'"" Meaghin recalls. So the couple bought the magnets. It ended up being the worst purchase of their lives. Even though they say they put the magnets up on a high shelf, their son Braylon, almost 2 years old, somehow swallowed eight of them. If they had been just little balls, it wouldn't have been much of a problem; he would have just passed them. But because the magnets were attracted to one another, they formed a clump and bored a hole through his intestines. Braylon has been in the hospital for nearly two months, most of that time spent in intensive care. He's had more than six surgeries. He developed a bloodstream infection and had to be completely sedated for three weeks. More than once, doctors thought he would die. He's scheduled to leave the hospital this week, but he still needs to have an intestinal transplant because much of the tissue had to be removed. There are no recent studies on how many children have ingested high-powered magnets, although the Consumer Products Safety Commission has received reports of 200 cases since 2008. CPSC animation shows how magnets twist the intestines . One of Braylon's physicians, Dr. R. Adam Noel, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Heath Science Center in New Orleans, surveyed his fellow pediatric gastroenterologists to get an idea of how often this occurs. The 33 physicians who responded to Noel's survey had altogether seen 82 young patients who had swallowed magnets. Most of these kids, like Braylon, had bowel perforations. Tuesday, Noel and other pediatric gastroenterologists will meet in Washington with the CPSC to ask what they can do to help make sure more children don't suffer. ""I'm surprised by how little protection there is,"" Noel says. Product recalls, even bans, are 'on the table' Magnets have a long and not very happy history with the CPSC. In 2006, the agency and Mattel announced a voluntary recall of more than 4 million sets of Polly Pockets, plastic dolls whose clothes and accessories contained magnets. A spokesman for the CPSC says the agency might do something similar with adult magnet toys. ""We're an agency with a history of a few bans,"" says the spokesman, Scott Wolfson. ""All options are still on the table."" Companies that make magnetic ""adult desktop toys,"" such as Buckyballs and NeoCubes, argue that the products would be safe if consumers used them correctly. ""You have to keep them up high, like scissors, or prescription drugs,"" says Alan Schoem, a lawyer for the company that makes Buckyballs, the leading adult magnet toy on the market. ""You tell kids not to touch the stove. It's no different with a product like Buckyballs."" There are five warnings on the packaging and instructions for Buckyballs, he says, and the company won't sell them in stores that cater exclusively to children. Plus, he says, they have an education program for stores, physicians and schools. But some doctors wonder if warnings and education are enough. If there are hundreds of magnets in each set, parents might not notice that a few roll away. Since magnets are fun to play with and they look like candy, young children will likely try to eat them. ""Is there really any truly safe way of keeping these products out of the hands of children?"" asks Dr. Maria OIiva-Hemker, chief of the division of pediatric gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who plans on attending the Tuesday meeting in Washington. 'Not your grandfather's magnets' Noel's presentation to the CPSC is titled ""Not Your Grandfather's Magnets."" Called ""rare earth"" or ""neodynium"" magnets, they're much more powerful than their regular counterparts. Dr. Steven Schwarz, a professor of pediatrics at Downstate Medical Center in New York, knows how strong these magnets' attraction really is. He recently removed a bracelet made of 29 high-powered magnets from the stomach of a 13-month-old girl. ""It's not easy to pull them apart,"" he says. ""You can feel the resistance."" Since these magnets are more powerful, they're more likely to clump together inside the body. ""Normally, who cares about little round balls? But these are little round balls that can twist your intestines,"" Oliva-Hemker says. The Jordans, after their horrific experience with Braylon, are all for a recall. ""I would love to get them banned,"" Meaghin says. ""I don't want this to happen to anyone else."" If you suspect your child has swallowed a magnet, please seek immediate medical attention.","Magnets, if swallowed, can cause major problems in a child's digestive system .

"(CNN) -- Kenya ruled out terrorism after a blaze left its main airport in charred ruins this week, describing the incident as a ""simple fire gone bad."" There were no reports of casualties in the Wednesday blaze at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The fire destroyed large parts of the international terminal and brought East Africa's largest aviation hub to a standstill. It occurred on the 15th anniversary of the near-simultaneous terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which left 224 people dead and thousands injured. The nation's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said the blaze was not an act of terror. ""We can now confirm that there was no element of a terror incident in this fire,"" the president said in a statement Friday. ""There is no evidence of an explosion or an improvised explosive device. This was a simple fire gone bad. If anyone is culpable, including for gross negligence, they will be dealt with by the full force of the law."" International flights gradually resumed Thursday. The effects of the fire reverberated worldwide; Kenya distributes a third of all flowers in Europe through the airport with a special emphasis on rose production. The airport also offers connections to Europe, the Middle East and other African nations, with about 16,000 passengers passing through daily, officials said.","Fire at the main Kenyan airport this week destroyed the international terminal .

"(CNN) -- It's a warm day in West Des Moines, Iowa, a small town in America's heartland. Off a main thoroughfare, an unassuming gym sits in a strip mall. People come and go, passing a young woman sitting in a desk chair just inside the gym's front door, getting her hair and makeup done. She is Gabby Douglas, and when the women's gymnastics all-around gold medal was placed around her neck at the London 2012 Olympics, she became an instant superstar. When we met her at the gym her host family owns, she was busy smiling, jumping and posing for a photo shoot with Seventeen Magazine. Here, in the middle of Iowa, Douglas continues to work and train, and balance new-found celebrity with everyday life. One year after the 2012 Olympics, it is just one example of how everything and nothing has changed. The London event was heralded as ""the Women's Games"" and for good reason -- for the first time, every country and every event allowed women to compete. Exactly a century after the founder of the modern Olympics said ""an Olympiad with females would be impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and improper,"" the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, celebrated the most equal Olympics to date. Some countries, like the United States and China, actually sent more women than men. And for the first time ever, Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had women on their national teams. Saudi Arabia was long seen as the last holdout, its hand eventually being forced by the IOC, which delivered an ultimatum: send women, or face a ban from all Olympic competition. In a country where women can't vote until 2015, can't play sports in public schools, and can't even drive, the Middle East country had to find female athletes to represent it. The search turned up two women -- Sarah Attar and Wodjan Sharkhani. Attar, a dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the U.S., grew up in California. Normally a marathon runner, she was told less than two months before the Games began that she would be running the 800-meter race in London. ""It was definitely a big thought process going into it,"" Attar told CNN's ""An Uneven Playing Field"" documentary in her first television interview since the Olympics. ""It wasn't something that I'd been working for, for so long, which so many Olympians do, and essentially it came down to, how could I not go?"" The sight of Attar on the running track dressed in leggings, long sleeves and a special head-covering brought international attention to an otherwise routine 800m heat. And while she finished dead last, she was celebrated around the world for her historic accomplishment. But not everyone was pleased with Saudi's compliance. Back in the kingdom, Attar and 16-year-old teammate Sharkhani faced criticism and threats. On Twitter, someone started the hashtag ""prostitutes of the Olympics"" in Arabic, and many wondered if Attar and Sharkhani -- who lost her first judo match in less than two minutes -- were truly trailblazers, or token entrants. ""It really was a brilliant moment,"" says Alison Kervin, sports editor of The Mail on Sunday, and the UK's first female sports editor of a major British newspaper. ""But when those girls went back to Saudi Arabia and all these other countries, whether that led to girls in their countries suddenly putting on trainers and throwing off their burkas and getting out on the running track, I'm not sure. ""One Games, over two weeks, however wonderful it was, isn't enough to change the face of women's sport."" While the IOC also admits more needs to be done, particularly in getting more women into leadership positions in sport, there is no doubt London 2012 was worth celebrating for most -- but not all. English athlete Samantha Rippington disputes the claim that all the events included women. She is a canoeist, competing at world championships but not at the Olympics -- because her sport is not included. The event of ""canoe and kayak"" is grouped -- allowing the IOC to say all events include women, when technically they don't. ""It's very frustrating,"" said Rippington. ""There's 36, 37 countries competing or developing women's canoe around the world, so I know there are athletes who are at standard, who want to race, and are very much capable of racing at the Olympics."" It shines a light on another inequality at the Olympics -- the medal count. At London 2012, men had the chance to compete in 163 events, while the women had only 131 events. Some events, like boxing, had fewer weight classes available to women, even though women's international boxing recognizes more than the three chosen for the London Olympic program. Rippington filed a discrimination claim against the London Organizing Committee last year. And while she wasn't able to get women's canoe added to the London 2012 program, she continues the fight for the next Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. But the women who did get their chance last year took full advantage. Many of the most memorable faces of the 2012 Games were females -- like the UK's Jessica Ennis, Douglas and her ""Fierce Five"" teammates, the U.S. women's football side and Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen. Despite the challenges that remain, London 2012 provided a foundation for gender equality in sport. It produced countless female role models, heroes, and champions -- and for 17 days in time, leveled the playing field. ""It's the start isn't it,"" said Kervin. ""Hopefully we'll look back in 20, 30 years and remember that first Olympics when it started and then go, 'Gosh you wouldn't imagine an Olympics not full of women.' ""So it's just a start of a very big process, and it was a fantastic start.""","A year on from the Olympics have attitudes towards women's sport changed?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors hearing the Michael Jackson wrongful death case seem to be enjoying themselves after 15 weeks of testimony, even after the judge told them they could be in court through September. They've leaned forward, taken close notes and often laughed while watching lawyers for Michael Jackson's mother and children spar with attorneys for concert promoter AEG Live. ""I'm not going to be babysitting you two,"" Judge Yvette Palazuelos told Jackson lawyer Brian Panish and AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam this week as the attorneys traded barbs in court. Several jurors even applauded famed choreographer and director Kenny Ortega at the end of his lengthy testimony Thursday. While some of the 65 days of testimony has covered tedious medical and legal ground, Jackson's music and intimate home videos are often shown on two big screens in the tiny Los Angeles courtroom . The jurors were getting an inside look Friday at how Jackson's family tried to intervene in the singer's prescription drug use as AEG Live's lawyers showed them video of their questioning of Randy Jackson, Michael Jackson's youngest brother. The jury will eventually have a billion-dollar decision to make: Is AEG Live liable in Jackson's death and, if so, how much should the promoter-producer of his comeback tour pay the family in damages? Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- contend AEG Live negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician now serving a prison term for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Murray told investigators he gave the entertainer nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals while preparing for his ""This Is It"" shows set to debut in London in July 2009. The coroner ruled Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was caused by an overdose of propofol. AEG Live argues Jackson, not the company, chose and controlled Murray. A contract the company negotiated with Murray to work as Jackson's personal tour doctor for $150,000 a month was signed by Murray and returned to AEG Live on June 24, 2009. With Jackson's death the next day, no AEG Live executive ever signed it. The company also argues its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous and unusual treatments Murray was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. AEG Live lawyers are using Randy Jackson's testimony about his family's attempts to intervene with the pop icon's use of painkillers to bolster their contention that he was a secretive drug addict. AEG lawyer testifies in Michael Jackson death trial . Red flags missed? The Jackson lawsuit accuses AEG Live executives of ignoring a series of red flags signaling that the artist was at risk in the weeks before his death -- including warnings from Kenny Ortega and others working on the production. ""He was like a lost boy,"" Ortega wrote in an e-mail to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips days before Jackson's death. ""There still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if we get him the help he needs."" After a poor rehearsal on June 13, 2009, and a missed rehearsal the next day, Ortega expressed his concern in an e-mail to AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware: ""Were you aware that MJ's doctor didn't permit him to attend rehearsals yesterday? Are Randy and Frank (DiLeo, another Jackson manager) aware of this? Please have them stay on top of his health situation without invading MJ's privacy. It might be a good idea to talk with his doctor to make sure everything MJ requires is in place."" The AEG Live executives later told Ortega they met with Murray and put him in charge of getting Jackson to rehearsals, Ortega said. The director said he was told that if he needed to know whether Jackson was coming to a rehearsal, he should call the doctor. Ortega was given Murray's cell phone number, which he said he programmed into his own phone. When Jackson finally showed up for a rehearsal on June 19, ""he appeared lost, cold, afraid,"" Ortega said. It is a day he will never forget, he testified. ""I saw a Michael that frightened me, a Michael that was shivering and cold,"" Ortega testified. ""I thought there was something emotional going on, deeply emotional, and something physical going on. He seemed fragile."" When AEG Live's lawyer asked Ortega if Jackson could've just had ""a really bad flu,"" the show director said that was ""not the best way of describing it."" A sleep expert hired by the Jacksons' lawyers testified earlier that he believed the singer was suffering from long-term sleep deprivation caused by two months of nightly propofol infusions. The drug interrupts crucial REM sleep cycles, depriving the brain of real rest and repair, the expert said. Ortega persuaded Jackson not to go onstage that night because he was afraid he would hurt himself, he testified. Instead, Jackson agreed to watch the rehearsal with choreographer Travis Payne dancing his parts. Jackson's ex-bodyguard testifies about singer's drug use . Jackson appeared paranoid and afraid, Ortega said. ""He was repeating for me not to quit or to leave him. He was afraid that I was going to quit or leave him."" With just a dozen days left for rehearsals before the touring company moved to London for the opening, Ortega testified, he was worried ""that all that we had worked for together, Michael and I -- this dream, this desire -- was going to fall away."" Ortega testified that on June 19, he ""felt that we should stop"" the production, but he was ""torn because I did not want to break Michael's heart."" Ortega sent a series of e-mails that night and the next morning to AEG Live executives warning that they needed professional help for Jackson. ""There are strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior,"" Ortega wrote. ""I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP. It's like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state."" A contentious meeting . Ortega testified that he was called to a meeting with AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips, Jackson and Murray at Jackson's home on June 20, hours after he sent those e-mails. Murray angrily confronted him, Ortega testified. ""He said I had no right to not let Michael rehearse, that Michael was physically and emotionally capable of handling all his responsibility as a performer and I should be a director and not an amateur doctor or psychologist. I should stick to my job and leave the rest to him."" Phillips watched Murray's attack on him in silence, Ortega testified Thursday. Jackson died while under Murray's care five days later, in a bedroom just upstairs from the parlor where the meeting took place. ""A different Michael"" showed up for the next rehearsals on June 23 and 24, Ortega testified. Jackson ""seemed healthy and ready and happy. There didn't seem to be any leftover issues."" ""I was feeling that we were back on track and grateful and believing that we were now in a new chapter,"" Ortega said. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Ortega what he thought caused the ""metamorphosis"" he witnessed in Jackson. ""Maybe a lot of rest,"" he said. ""He seemed rested, stronger."" ""I assume sleep had to be a part of it,"" Ortega added. ""He just looked rested. Deep sleep, real sleep."" Murray told investigators he stopped using propofol to induce Jackson's sleep for the two previous nights -- after 60 nights of it. Jackson lawyers contend that is why Jackson was revitalized. Jackson lawyers argued that Murray was influenced by a conflict of interest -- created by his arrangement with AEG Live -- to continue dangerous propofol infusions to help Jackson rest for rehearsals. He was $1 million in debt and had abandoned his medical practice two months earlier to serve as Jackson's personal physician for the tour. If he failed to get Jackson to rehearsals, the shows might be postponed or canceled and he would be out of a job, they argue. Blame game . Lawyers for both sides used Ortega's appearance in court to argue over who was responsible for Jackson's death -- the promoter or the artist. ""At the time, did you think Mr. Jackson was responsible for his own health?"" AEG Live's Marvin Putnam asked. ""I didn't think he was being very responsible, but it was his responsibility, in my opinion,"" Ortega answered. ""I wanted to take care of him, you always want to take care of someone if they're not feeling well, but you can't be responsible for them. They have to be responsible for themselves."" When Jackson lawyer Brian Panish had a chance to again question Ortega, he focused on AEG Live's responsibility in retaining Murray. Panish: ""You would expect a responsible concert promoter and producer to make sure anyone they hired to be checked out as fit and competent?"" Ortega: ""Yes."" Panish: ""Check them out to make sure they had no conflict?"" Ortega: ""Yes."" Panish: ""It would be irresponsible not to do that?"" Ortega: ""Yes."" As Ortega stepped off the witness stand Thursday afternoon, several jurors applauded. Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael Jackson's two oldest children, may finally appear in court next week as a witness called by AEG Live. She was married to Jackson for several years and traveled with him on tour in the 1990s.","The jury will watch a video deposition of Michael Jackson's youngest brother Friday .

"(CNN) -- Northern Ireland's top police officer on Saturday condemned violent clashes that left 56 of his officers injured as ""mindless anarchy"" -- and warned that many arrests will follow. The disorder broke out in central Belfast as loyalists held counter-protests Friday evening against a nationalist march. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Friday that 26 officers had been injured, with five of them needing hospital treatment. But that tally more than doubled on Saturday. Seven arrests have been made so far, police said. Warning of more to come, Chief Constable Matt Baggott said, ""Significant custodial sentences will be handed down in the weeks and months that follow -- the prisons will be bulging, sadly."" He said ""intense violence"" had been directed toward the police, and that they had shown ""immense courage"" in standing their ground to stop the anarchy spreading. ""I know the majority of the population will stand with me in condemning those who scarred the reputation of our beautiful city last night,"" he said. ""Those people had no intention of peaceful protest. They lack self respect and they lack dignity."" Police were braced for further trouble on Saturday. More parades are scheduled to take place across the country, organized by the Apprentice Boys, a Protestant group. The main demonstration is in Londonderry. The disorder broke out in Belfast's main shopping district, as loyalists blocked the intended route of the nationalist march, which was eventually redirected. Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton, who led the policing operation, said about 1,200 people had gathered ""and it was evident that many of them had violent intent."" His officers were pelted with whatever came to hand, he said, including paving slabs pulled up from the street, bricks and lengths of scaffolding. ""There was nothing lawful about this protest. There was nothing peaceful about it. It was sheer thuggery,"" he said. Plans for peaceful protests had been registered with the Northern Ireland Parades Commission, which rules on which marches are allowed to take place and which are banned, in an effort to keep friction to a minimum. Friday's pro-Irish nationalist march followed heightened tensions during some loyalist marches this summer. Hundreds of parades take place across Northern Ireland each year, the majority involving the Protestant Orange Order and associated organizations. Most parades pass off peacefully, but when members of one community march near or through neighborhoods dominated by another, violence sometimes results.","NEW: ""Those people had no intention of peaceful protest,"" says top police officer .
