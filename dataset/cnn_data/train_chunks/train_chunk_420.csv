"(CNN)At least 21 people died and one more is missing after a survey tugboat sank on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, state media reported Saturday. Three passengers -- all Chinese citizens  -- have been rescued and the search operation continues, an official from the search and rescue office of the Jiangsu Maritime Administration told CNN. Those rescued included an interpreter and the suppliers of some of the equipment on board. The boat , which had 25 people aboard, was ""testing water"" in the Hubei channel, China's Xinhua state news agency said. Among the 25 on board were eight foreign nationals, the China News Service reported. Rescuers said their efforts were hampered by strong currents and cold water, Xinhua said. As many as 23 vessels were involved in search and rescue operations, including a crane that is being used to lift the boat -- which turned over as it sank -- out of the water. Rescuers believe that there are several people trapped in the boat's cabin. One of the rescued passengers, identified as translator Wang Chenkai, told Xinhua that he tried to hold onto one of the Japanese engineers but the current broke his grip. ""Only the two of us were in the cockpit,"" he said. ""We have just finished the host load test of the main engine of the boat, when the vessel suddenly slid over. Water immediately filled in."" Xinhua reported that the owner of the boat had not followed procedure for the water-testing operation and had not filed a route. Harvard Zihao Zhang in Beijing contributed reporting to this report.","Three passengers -- all Chinese citizens  -- have been rescued .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was successfully transferred Friday to a Houston hospital from Tucson, Arizona, and physicians described the brain-injured congresswoman as ""doing great."" ""I'm very pleased to bring the news that the transfer of Gabby from the University Medical Center in Tucson to Memorial Hermann Hospital here went flawlessly,"" Dr. Randall Friese of the UMC Trauma Center said at a Houston news conference. While saying an assassin's bullet ""did damage some portions"" of Giffords' brain, Dr. John Holcomb of Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center said Giffords is ""doing great."" ""She could have been a lot worse,"" Holcomb said. ""This was a tangential gunshot wound. Fortunately, it didn't go crosswise"" through her brain, he said. Dr. Dong Kim of Memorial Hermann said a 30-minute exam of Giffords found that she has ""very good movement on the left side of her body."" He added that her physical therapy and rehabilitation will be a four- to six-month process. ""We tested her vision and she didn't like us shining the light in her eyes and wanted to keep them closed, and these are all very good signs,"" Kim said. ""She also had pretty good tone in her leg,"" he said. ""She just looked spectacular."" But, he said, ""there are varying stages of what we call paralysis or weakness"" on her right side. ""In her arm, we are not seeing much tone and we're not seeing much movement,"" Kim said. But he noted that Giffords did show movement in her arms during her hospitalization in Tucson, so results could change. ""We really think over the next few months she's going to do remarkably well,"" Kim said. ""There's no question that she is aware of what's happening."" Giffords is able to move her lips, Kim said. ""Whether she can mouth words, we'll have to wait and see,"" he added. Portions of Giffords' skull that were removed are still frozen in a sterile bag, and it could be weeks, if not months, before those portions are surgically returned to her head, doctors said. ""The transfer of that is not a big deal,"" Kim said of such surgery. Giffords has been in intensive care for the past 13 days since she was shot in the head January 8 during a meet-and-greet outside a Tucson supermarket. Physicians expressed concern Friday about infection, saying they will be monitoring that over the next few days. Friese, who accompanied Giffords in the ambulance ride in Tucson from the hospital to the airport, said that Giffords could hear the cheers of well-wishers from the sidewalks Friday. ""She smiled and actually began to tear a little bit,"" Friese said. Giffords left the Tucson hospital where she had been treated since alleged assassin Jared Lee Loughner, now in custody, shot her in the head. Loughner, 22, is accused of killing six people, including a judge, and wounding a total of 13, including Giffords. The congresswoman arrived at Houston Hobby International Airport shortly after 1 p.m. and was flown in a helicopter to Memorial Hermann. Although previous reports had indicated she would move directly to a rehabilitation facility affiliated with the hospital, she instead was taken to the hospital's trauma center for evaluation and treatment, Kim said. ""She's not quite ready for rehabilitation yet,"" he said, citing concerns about ongoing medical issues. He declined to elaborate. The hospital said in a statement that she will be transferred to the rehabilitation facility, TIRR Memorial Hermann, when her health allows. Giffords left the Tucson hospital in an ambulance escorted by police and a group of motorcyclists from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The procession traveled to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, where she was carried aboard an airplane for the flight to Houston. The move is the latest in a string of milestones for Giffords since the 40-year-old congresswoman was shot in the forehead. On Thursday, she was able to go outside for the first time since the shooting. ""Today, actually, we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy,"" Dr. Peter Rhee told CNN's John King. ""We gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine,"" said Rhee, speaking from outside University Medical Center. ""She was able to see the Arizona mountains."" Giffords' husband, Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, described his wife's progress as ""remarkable"" Thursday, saying he is hopeful she will make a full recovery. ""I've told her that,"" Kelly told reporters at University Medical Center. ""She recognizes it. ... She is a fighter like nobody else that I know."" Giffords is able to stand with assistance, but is not yet able to take steps or walk, said Rhee, adding that therapists are helping Giffords with ways to express her thoughts and, eventually, speak. ""(We are) holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up,"" Rhee said. ""She is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted."" On Wednesday, the public learned that Giffords was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance. Kelly said he believes she has tried to speak, although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck; and he believes she is aware of her surroundings, saying he can look into her eyes and tell. She will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting, he said. ""Every time I interact with her, there's something quite inspiring,"" he said. A federal grand jury indicted Loughner on Wednesday on three charges of attempted murder. The indictment charges Loughner with attempting to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Legal experts said that more federal charges against Loughner are likely. He is next set to appear in court Monday in Phoenix. ""I don't think we're ever going to fully understand the whys and the how and, you know, the reason for what happened on the 8th of January,"" Kelly told reporters. ""It's a loss of innocent life. The injury of a dozen people, the death of a 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and the serious traumatic injury to my wife Gabrielle -- we'll never fully understand that."" CNN's Paul Vercammen, Susan Candiotti and Roni Selig contributed to this report.","The flight of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords to Houston went ""flawlessly,"" physician says .

"(CNN)Yaya Toure has all the trappings of a English Premier League footballer. There is the reported $334,000-a-week salary, the luxury homes and cars, not to mention the silverware from last season when Manchester City won the Premier League and the English League Cup. Yet despite that success, including a fourth straight African Player of the Year title, the City and Ivory Coast talisman describes 2014 as ""a horrible year."" No wonder -- it's barely six months since his younger brother Ibrahim died while Toure and his brother Kolo were on World Cup duty in Brazil. As for what lies in store during 2015, he's no idea. Asked if he wants to stay put at City, Toure says, in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Amanda Davies: ""That's a big question and that's an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer ... we'll see."" Pressed on whether he plans to still be at the Etihad Stadium for the 2015-16 Premier League season, he says: ""I don't know. I'm at City. City is a great club where I've achieved lots of things."" Those less than equivocal answers bring us to Toure's Marie Antoinette ""Let them eat cake"" moment. After City's title triumph last season, his agent Dimitri Seluk said Toure was upset that the Ivorian's birthday hadn't been properly ""acknowledged"" by the club. ""He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos's birthday, the president of (Russian side) Anzhi (Makhachkala) gave him a Bugatti,"" Seluk reportedly said. ""Sometimes it makes you disappointed when the story is going wrong,"" says Toure looking back on the episode. ""I don't want to open my heart up again and open my mind to the newspaper [reports] again because there have been such disappointing things running in the newspaper that have hurt me a lot. But I'm a guy who is very strong mentally."" Toure says he felt let down by certain individuals over how the story unfolded, though he's not divulging any names. However, he is quick to credit the City supporters as well as chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and manager Manuel Pellegrini for ensuring he felt loved again. Though it's playing that provides the greatest solace. ""It's only football that keeps me peaceful,"" adds Toure. ""It's only the feeling of going after the ball that makes me happy. It's only once I see the City fans singing my name and the manager told me I want to cover, to take more space, it makes me feel happy and it's all I want."" Toure is very much a player who wears his heart on his sleeve, and that becomes very apparent as he reflects on the highs and lows of  2014. The biggest low came while in Brazil when news of Ibrahim's death was broken to him over the phone by another of his brothers. For Toure, the tragedy still remains raw: ""2014 was, I think I can say, a horrible year for me. ""It was disappointing in the World Cup. Of course, we won the Premier League and the cup this year but I think with the death of my brother it was a hard one, the hardest one because I was not preparing to support such a situation. ""In the family you have one who you love, one who you care about above all the rest and I think Ibrahim was this guy. When he passed away ... that time was quite difficult because we have the beginning of this season in the Premier League and to manage that was difficult."" Amid the tragedy, Toure and sibling Kolo, who plays for Liverpool, opted to stay in Brazil and represent their country. It's a decision that he still regrets to this day. Playing the ensuing game against Greece, he admits, ""In my mind, I was thinking that after the game I was calling him [Ibrahim]. I was still asking 'How do you feel about the game I played against Greece?' But he passed away before the game."" Perhaps the memory is in some ways just as raw now, with the brothers back in international action for their country for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)  in Equatorial Guinea. At this time the loyalties of all African players are tested, given so many play for top European club, which are often fighting for titles and cups. ""It's difficult because your country and club is always our hardest divide especially the City fans, the chairman, the boss as well, they're good with me and I want to give 100% when I'm there,"" said the 31-year-old. The Elephants are undeniably one of the strongest teams in the continent of Africa given they can call on the likes of the Toures, recent City signing Wilfried Bony, Salomon Kalou and Cheick Tiote. But the nation have not always shone at international level -- especially at Africa's most prestigious tournament -- winning just one AFCON title back in 1992, and finishing runners-up in 2006 and again two years ago. ""I think it's the lack of concentration or maybe it's because we fear our own team. We think we are the best but ... you have to have desire, you have to have determination,"" says Toure, reflecting on his country's relative under-performance at the tournament. ""We have to be mentally ready for the hard battle because in Africa it's not only the opponent we have to fight. We have to fight the temperature as well, we have to fight the field."" The tournament had been due to take place in Morocco but, amid fears of the Ebola crisis, the North African nation withdrew as hosts and Equatorial Guinea stepped in as hosts. Ebola remains a talking point among players and Toure has no qualms that it's something that concerns him ahead of an opening game against Guinea, where the disease has taken hold. ""It's difficult when you feel like your family can maybe contract this infection, you're a little bit afraid,"" he says. ""Yes, we fear but we can't say we don't want to go because it's a situation we need to educate people because people don't understand how to protect themselves against this infection."" There was talk of perhaps scrapping the tournament for a year due to the threat posed by Ebola, but Toure believes organizers are right to go ahead. ""January is the time when the African people can enjoy,"" he says. ""The African player coming from Europe is like a moment in a dream for the African because, when they see us coming, they are always happy. ""It's going to be like a big fiesta where people can enjoy, they can dance, they can love and they can do what they want."" After Toure's tumultuous 2014, he's hopeful it will prove the perfect start to 2015.","Toure says 'we'll see' when asked if he expects to still be at Manchester City next season .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama was trying to make a broader point when he uttered ""ISIL is not Islamic,"" but the four-word phrase could still come back to haunt him. Critics on Twitter quickly fired off on the President for making the assertion, with many noting that ISIL in fact stands for the ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."" (CNN refers to the group by the acronym ISIS in its news reports. The group recently started calling itself the Islamic State). In full context, here's what Obama said in his prime-time speech Wednesday night: . ""ISIL is not 'Islamic.' No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state; it was formerly al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria's civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government nor by the people it subjugates."" ""ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple, and it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.""

"He is the face of terror. A ruthless leader with a twisted ideology. And the sadistic architect of a campaign of mayhem and misery. And yet, very little is known about Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram. He operates in the shadows, leaving his underlings to orchestrate his repulsive mandates. He resurfaces every once in a while in videotaped messages to mock the impotence of the Nigerian military. And he uses his faith to recruit the impressionable and the disenfranchised to his cause. He's a religious scholar . Shekau was born in Shekau village that borders Niger. He studied under a cleric and then attended Borno State College of Legal and Islamic Studies for higher studies on Islam. That's why he's also known as 'Darul Tawheed,' which translates to an expert in monotheism, or the oneness of Allah. He's a polyglot . He speaks several languages fluently: Hausa, Fulani, Kanuri and Arabic. But English isn't one of them. After all, he heads a group that rejects all things Western. He's elusive . Even his age is unknown -- estimates range between 38 and 49. The U.S. State Department has Shekau's year of birth listed as 1965, 1969 and 1975. He's a loner . Analysts describe Shekau as a loner and a master of disguise. He does not speak directly with members, opting to communicate through a few select confidants. He uses many aliases: Abu Bakr Skikwa, Imam Abu Bakr Shiku and Abu Muhammad Abu Bakr Bin Muhammad Al Shakwi Al Muslimi Bishku among them. He was an unruly No. 2 . Boko Haram was founded by Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic, well-educated cleric who drove a Mercedes as part of his push for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. He wasn't too effective as a leader and had a hard time keeping his second-in-command in check. Shekau was more radical and had grander designs. ... And merciless as No. 1 . Mohammed Yusuf was killed in a security crackdown in 2009, along with about 700 of his followers. That left Shekau in charge. He vowed to strike back, and his group has spared no one: government workers, police officers, journalists, villagers, students and churchgoers. Human Rights Watch estimates that in the past five years, more than 3,000 people have been killed. He's come back from the dead . The Nigerian military has touted Shekau's death several times, only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos. They almost got him in September 2012 when they raided his home, where he had snuck in for his six-day-old baby's naming ceremony, according to the International Crisis Group. He managed to get away with a gunshot wound to the leg; his wife and three children were taken by the military. He uses Islam to recruit and radicalize . The northeast, where Boko Haram has been most active, is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in Nigeria. Shekau has done a good job of convincing residents that the powers in Abuja are corrupt and a better system of government would be a strict enforcement of Islamic Sharia law across Nigeria. And his promise, coupled with a weapon and a license to plunder, has been enticing to hundreds of young men. ... and the government's response isn't helping . The central government's heavy-handed and frequently untargeted anti-terrorism campaign has just helped create more members to sustain Boko Haram. The country's own Human Rights Commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings, torture and rape in its campaign against the group. This makes for fertile territory for Boko Haram. He's exporting his brand of terror . There's no firm evidence as yet that Boko Haram has ambitions beyond Nigeria. But its campaign of terror has spilled into remote parts of Cameroon and it appears to have informal links with militant Islamist groups in Mali and Niger. He's made good on his brutal threat . It was in May 2013 that Shekau first announced in a video that Boko Haram would start kidnapping girls. The kidnappings, he said, were retaliation for Nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members. The most horrifying instance was last month's abduction of 276 girls from a girl's school. ""I abducted your girls,"" he taunted with a chilling smile in a new video that surfaced this week. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell."" There's a $7 million bounty on his head . Shekau has been on the radar of U.S. officials since he came to power in 2009. Last June, the United States put a bounty on him, offering a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his location. ... But that's yet to yield results . Here's why, says CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour: ""(African warlord) Joseph Kony's had a bounty for years and years. Even with the 'Stop Kony' video that went viral, nothing has happened to get Joseph Kony -- even though it's about the only thing in Africa that the United States has committed some forces and some intelligence to. ""Osama bin Laden was not given up because of the $25 million bounty. And who knows whether this will be the case."" In Nigeria, the mass abduction of schoolgirls isn't shocking . Why terror group kidnaps schoolgirls, and what happens next . 6 reasons why the world should demand action .","Analysts describe Shekau as a loner and a master of disguise .

"(CNN) -- The strongest earthquake in 25 years in Northern California's Bay Area struck early Sunday, injuring dozens of people, damaging historic buildings in downtown Napa and turning fireplaces into rubble. The 6.0-magnitude quake struck just six miles southwest of Napa, California's famed wine country. ""Everything and everyone in Napa was affected by the quake. My house, along with everybody else's, is a disaster. It looks like somebody broke in and ravaged the place, room by room,"" said CNN iReporter Malissa Koven, who was awakened by the shaking at about 3:20 a.m. ""Anything and everything that could fall, did,"" she said. One child was hurt when a fireplace collapsed and was airlifted to UC Davis Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier told CNN. Nearly 160 were treated for minor injuries at the emergency room at Queen of the Valley Hospital, though hospital CEO Walt Mickens could not confirm that all of those patients were injured in the earthquake. Thirteen people were admitted for orthopedic issues and medical conditions, according to Mickens. By Sunday night, only one patient was still in critical condition. Assessing the aftermath . The damage in Napa is ""fairly significant,"" said Glenn Pomeroy, the CEO of the California Earthquake Authority, who surveyed the area Sunday afternoon. At least 15,000 customers in and around Sonoma, Napa and Santa Rosa lost power, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Roughly 7,300 were still without power as of Sunday evening. In historic downtown Napa, the bricks and beams that once made up buildings' facades lay splayed in the street. Shattered glassware covered the floor of a local restaurant. One home had visible charring from a fire that occurred in the aftermath of the quake. Gas leaks and downed power lines were also reported. ""The post office building had cracked, the local hardware store was destroyed with layers of shelves that had fallen over and busted the windows, multiple buildings had fallen apart, and all the local businesses looked trashed on the inside and out,"" Koven said. Pomeroy said that downtown was particularly hard hit ""probably because of the age of construction."" However, the damage ""is not as bad as it could have been,"" Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said at a news conference Sunday. Putting out the fires . To help with the recovery Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. ""We're here for the long run,"" Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN. ""Not just when we're putting out fires -- literally."" The earthquake triggered six major fires that destroyed several mobile homes, said Napa Division Fire Chief John Callanan. Napa Public Works Director Jack Rochelle said it might take up to a week to get the water system back to normal after dozens of water main breaks were reported. The water that is still flowing is safe to drink, he said. How did it feel? Sunday's earthquake struck four miles northwest of American Canyon, six miles southwest of Napa and nine miles southeast of Sonoma, according to the USGS. The USGS estimated that based on their locations, 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, 106,000 people felt very strong shaking, 176,000 felt strong shaking and 738,000 felt moderate shaking. For those in Napa, close to the epicenter, the quake jolted downtown residents such as Karen Lynch. ""It was not like other quakes we have felt,"" Lynch told CNN. ""This was a violent quake."" Although the quake has not resulted in any deaths so far, many residents were surprised by how strong it was. ""Honestly it felt much worse than the '89 earthquake,"" CNN iReporter Garret Gauer said. ""The refrigerator relocated itself to the other side of the kitchen"" Farther south of the epicenter in San Francisco, CNN producer Augie Martin felt the quake differently. ""It was a fairly good shake, about 25 or 30 seconds. It was a softer rolling type earthquake,"" he said. The quake struck about seven miles deep and was considered ""strong"" by the USGS. Major quakes start at a 7.0 magnitude, according to the USGS scale. More than 60 aftershocks struck in the hours following the quake, according to the USGS, ranging from 0.6 to 3.6 magnitude. The economic loss is likely to be more than $1 billion, according to USGS pager data. Wine country hit . ""I've got a lot of broken wine, being here in Napa,"" said Emily Massimi, who was woken up by the quake. ""We tend to collect wine, so I have wine all over my kitchen, and glass, and pictures off the wall and books off of bookshelves,"" she told CNN. At Silver Oak Winery, owner David Duncan spent the morning cleaning up hundreds of broken wine bottles that fell off the shelves. ""Those bottles were very unique,"" he said. They were part of his private collection and worth hundreds of dollars. Duncan said he plans to open the winery today. But it's not just the wine economy that will feel the pain. ""There's a mythology about Napa, that it's all fancy wineries,"" Newsom said. ""But underneath that there are a lot of folks here -- very low income -- that are going to need support."" 25 years later . The quake was the strongest to hit the Bay Area since 1989, when a 6.9-magnitude one struck during the World Series. The Loma Prieta earthquake caused 63 deaths, 3,757 injuries and an estimated $6 billion in property damage, according to the USGS. The damage from Sunday's earthquake was relatively minor compared with the buckled highways and destroyed homes that scattered the Bay area in the aftermath of the quake 25 years ago. The 1994 Northridge earthquake in Southern California was nearly as deadly -- 60 people were killed and more than 7,000 were injured. The USGS says 20,000 people were left homeless in its aftermath.

"The next time your teen turns on MTV's ""16 and Pregnant,"" avoid any disparaging remarks. The show may actually encourage him or her to practice safer sex, according to a new study. The study, released Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, says ""16 and Pregnant"" ultimately led to a 5.7% reduction in teen births in the 18 months after its premiere on TV. This would account for about one-third of the overall decline in teen births in the United States during that period, researchers Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine concluded. In 2011, a total of 329,797 babies were born in the United States to girls between the ages of 15 and 19; that's a rate of 31.3 births per every 1,000 girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC does not have rates available for 2012; Kearney and Levine say that number dropped to 29.4 per every 1,000 that year. The declining teen birth rate is a well-documented trend in the United States. Between 1991 and 2008, the rate dropped steadily at an average of about 2.5% a year. In the past four years, it has dropped even more dramatically at a rate of about 7.5% per year. ""We were really curious as to what was going on,"" said Kearney, who has been studying teen pregnancy interventions alongside Levine for more than a decade. When the researchers learned that Sarah Brown, CEO of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, thought MTV's shows may have something to do with it, they thought: ""Could that really be true?"" U.S. women having fewer children . ""16 and Pregnant"" premiered in June 2009 and has been on for five seasons, with a total of 47 episodes through October 2013. The show features one teen every episode and follows her through several months during and after pregnancy. The documentary-style show inspired several spinoffs, including the popular ""Teen Mom."" Both ""16 and Pregnant"" and ""Teen Mom"" have experienced their share of controversy. The shows are often criticized for glamorizing teen pregnancy. ""Instead of really helping viewers understand the day-to-day responsibilities of attending to a new infant -- scrubbing poop stains or spit-up out of clothing -- or dwelling on the 'mundane,' MTV chooses to focus on the girls' volatile relationships with the babies' fathers or their new body piercings and tattoos,"" Parents Television Council Director Melissa Henson wrote on CNN. ""That makes for better TV."" Kearney and Levine looked at Nielsen ratings as well as search data from Google Trends and Twitter to determine the show's potential impact on teen birth rates. They recorded spikes in Google searches and Twitter mentions about the show when new episodes aired and looked specifically for searches on terms such as ""birth control"" and ""abortion"" alongside those spikes. Photos: When teens want to have children . They then analyzed geographic data to see whether locations with higher search activity and tweets about ""16 and Pregnant"" showed higher levels of searches and tweets about birth control and abortion. They did. The researchers also looked to see whether high viewership in certain areas corresponded with a bigger drop in teen births. It did. ""The results of our analysis indicate that exposure to '16 and Pregnant' was high and that it had an influence on teens' thinking regarding birth control and abortion,"" the researchers write. That's all well and scientific, but could a TV show really have that big of an impact on teen birth rates? ""It's an extraordinary study done by two very cautious economists,"" said Bill Albert, chief program officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. ""I jokingly refer to them as Drs. No because they generally set out to say, 'That doesn't work.' For that reason alone, we take it very seriously."" Kearney said that while she and Levine did a lot of ""fancy economic work"" to make sure their conclusion was right, the most compelling evidence came from the teens' social media language. ""The text of the tweets are phenomenal: 'This reminds me to take my birth control.' 'Watching 16 & Pregnant, going to take my birth control,' "" she remembered reading. Of course, no one, including the study authors, is saying that MTV alone is responsible for the declining teen birth rate. Pediatricians support condoms for teens . About half of the recent dramatic decline can be attributed to the recession, Kearney says. Research shows that all birth rates fall during slow economic times, including teens'; those who were once ambivalent about using birth control often become more conscientious when they realize that finding -- or keeping -- a job to support a baby would be difficult. Kearney believes TV shows like ""16 and Pregnant"" work to deter teens in a similar way. ""Shows that make it clear how hard it can be ... affect girls who might not care otherwise,"" she said. ""You see she's fighting with her boyfriend on a daily basis. She's gaining weight. Her friends are partying without her."" Making the immediate cost clear seems to get through to teens more than statistics that show what happens to teen parents when they're 25, Kearney says. Teens may turn to TV shows about sex because they're lacking other options, Albert says. A recent study published in the medical journal JAMA showed that doctors certainly aren't spending a lot of time talking about the important topic: The average conversation about sex between doctors and teens in the study lasted less than two minutes. Doctors don't talk to adolescents about sex . And parents, Albert says, are often shocked to learn that teens say their parents have a major influence on their decisions about sex. ""I think the takeaway here is that media can be, and often is, a force for good,"" Albert said. ""We have always viewed these particular shows as sex education for the 21st century.""","MTV's ""16 and Pregnant"" may encourage teens to use birth control .
Teen births in the United States have been steadily declining since 1991 .
Part of the decline can be attributed to the recession, expert says ."
"Anniversaries are useful moments to pause and reflect. For the 70th anniversary of D-Day and subsequent campaign in northern France, it is also an opportunity to look at the past in detail and ask how much of what we think we know is true and how much is well-entrenched myth. Not only is it more interesting, it is also of greater worth as we plan for the future and pray there will never be a conflict like World War II again. 1. MYTH: D-Day was predominantly an American operation . REALITY: For many people, D-Day is defined by the bloodshed at Omaha -- the codename for one of the five beaches where Allied forces landed -- and the American airborne drops. Even in Germany, the perception is still that D-Day was a largely American show; in the recent German TV mini-series, ""Generation War,"" there was a reference to the ""American landings"" in France. But despite ""Band of Brothers,"" despite ""Saving Private Ryan,"" despite those 11 photographs taken by Robert Capa in the swell on that morning of June 6 1944, D-Day was not a predominantly American effort. Rather, it was an Allied effort with, if anything, Britain taking the lead. Yes, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme Allied commander, was American, but his deputy, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder was British, as were all three service chiefs. Air Marshal Sir Arthur ""Mary"" Coningham, commander of the tactical air forces, was also British. The plan for Operation Overlord -- as D-Day was codenamed -- was largely that of Gen. Bernard Montgomery, the land force commander. The Royal Navy had overall responsibility for Operation Neptune, the naval plan. Of the 1,213 warships involved, 200 were American and 892 were British; of the 4,126 landing craft involved, 805 were American and 3,261 were British. Share your family's D-Day stories . Indeed, 31% of all U.S. supplies used during D-Day came directly from Britain, while two-thirds of the 12,000 aircraft involved were also British, as were two-thirds of those that landed in occupied France. Despite the initial slaughter at Omaha, casualties across the American and British beaches were much the same. This is not to belittle the U.S. effort but rather to add context and a wider, 360-degree view. History needs to teach as well as entertain. 2. MYTH: American forces were ill-prepared . REALITY: By the end of World War II the United States had the best armed services in the world. The 77-day Normandy campaign did much to help them reach this point. Northern France was a showcase for American tactical and operational flexibility. At the start of the campaign, the Americans found themselves fighting through the Norman ""bocage,"" an area of small fields lined with thick, raised hedgerows and narrow, sunken lanes. They hadn't trained for this; instead they expected that the Germans would quickly retreat after a successful Allied landing. For the Germans, the bocage offered cover and ambush opportunities for mortar teams and machine guns. Even the American 30-ton Sherman tanks couldn't get through these hedgerows. Then a U.S. sergeant came up with the ingenious solution of attaching a hedge-cutting tool built from German beach obstacles to the front of a Sherman. Gen. Omar Bradley, the U.S. First Army commander, was impressed; within a fortnight, the device had been fitted to 60% of all U.S. Shermans in Normandy. This was but one example. During the campaign huge developments also were made in close air support, as well as in coordination between infantry, artillery and armor. Medical services advanced so much that one in four casualties returned to the battlefield after treatment, remarkable for 1944. 3. MYTH: The Allies became bogged down in Normandy . REALITY: In the pre-invasion estimates for the Normandy campaign, the Allies expected to be roughly 50 miles inland after 17 days, based on German retreats in North Africa and Italy. But Adolf Hitler ordered his forces to fight as close to the French coast as possible and not give an inch. On paper it seemed that the Allies weren't making much progress, but in reality the German strategy worked to the Allies' advantage as they pounded the enemy with offshore naval guns. For by 1944 the Allies had realized that German tactics -- which dated back more than 100 years -- were rigidly predictable. Striking back once the enemy had overextended itself was central to German DNA throughout World War II. The Allies soon realized that this penchant for counterattack meant that the Germans would eventually move into the open and get hammered. By the end of the Normandy campaign the Germans were hemorrhaging men and machines, with two armies all but destroyed. True, a handful of Germans did escape the attempted encirclement around Falaise, but it was still a massive Allied victory. In the rapid advance that followed, the Allies moved more quickly than Germans had in the opposite direction four years before, during the invasion of France. 4. MYTH: German soldiers were better trained than their Allied counterparts . REALITY: At the start of World War II the best German units were more than a match for their Allied opposition -- but by 1944 that had changed radically. There were a few exceptions, such as the Panzer Lehr, but come D-Day most German units were not as well trained as the Allies. Some Allied units in Normandy had been preparing for four years for this campaign. In contrast, many German troops had had little more than a few weeks' notice. The German ad hoc battle groups known as kampfgruppen are traditionally regarded as showcasing tactical flexibility, but even these were borne of extreme shortages and desperation toward the end of the war. The German paratroopers, or fallschirmjäger, were acknowledged to be among the best of their armed forces, yet one veteran I interviewed recalled how he had barely any training, save a few route marches and practice at laying mines. He never trained with a tank, had no transport and had to march 200 miles from Brittany when sent to the front. His case was not atypical: All infantry divisions in Normandy were expected to move by either foot or horse-drawn cart. The veteran I spoke to reached Saint-Lô, a major Normandy town, on June 12 with a company of 120 men. When he was captured on August 19 he was one of just nine men still standing. The Germans had a doctrine during World War II called auftragstaktik -- best described as the ability to use one's initiative -- which has been hailed as what set their soldiers apart. But the paratrooper I spoke to knew nothing of it. By that stage of the war, German training was so skimpy that it was impossible to implement. 5. MYTH: The Germans had stronger tactical skills . REALITY: The dogged determination of the Germans to fight during D-Day is often confused with tactical skill. It shouldn't. The best analogy is with more recent conflicts like Afghanistan or even Vietnam, when Western forces had the best training and kit yet struggled to defeat a massively inferior enemy. As the Taliban have shown, it is very difficult to completely defeat your enemy if they don't want to be defeated. The only way to do that is to kill them all. This is why the Germans took so long to be defeated in Normandy and, subsequently, despite a lack of training, they were still a very dangerous and deadly enemy with plenty of powerful weapons and a fierce determination to keep fighting. This was for a number of reasons: Nazi indoctrination, a profound sense of duty and the threat of execution for deserters. In World War I the Germans executed 48 men for desertion; during World War II that figure rose to 30,000. 6. MYTH: America and Britain got off lightly in World War II . REALITY: Allied frontline troops suffered horrifically during World War II. Democracies such as Britain and America tried to achieve victory with as few casualties as possible. For the most part, they did this very successfully using technology and machinery to shield lives wherever they could. However, short distances still had to be won by the infantry, tank units and artillery. Although technology meant the Allies needed fewer forces than a generation earlier, those in the firing line still pulled the very short straw. Losses to frontline troops were proportionally worse during the 77-day Normandy campaign than they were during the major battles along the Western Front during World War I.

"(CNN)Terrorism is nothing new to Europe. But there are new, pressing questions tied to the latest threats -- ones that authorities are trying to answer in their quest to get the upper hand and keep the continent safe. European security services in recent weeks have received indications that the extremist group ISIS may have started directing European adherents in Syria and Iraq to launch attacks back in their home countries, a senior European counterterrorism official told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Separately, a Western intelligence source told CNN national correspondent Deborah Feyerick that the threat appears to involve as many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The source said that European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium, and possibly also to the Netherlands. Last week's attacks in France are proof that these threats could become reality at any time. Assessing how close Europe is to another such attack, and doing whatever possible to prevent it are top priorities now for European authorities. What is the nature of the threat? Beyond what has emerged about Thursday's raids in Belgium -- which ended with two suspects dead -- details remain sketchy. The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that there were indications that returnees from Iraq and Syria had been directed by ISIS leadership to launch attacks on European soil in revenge for airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. ""That would be a game changer because ISIS up to this point has not orchestrated any terrorist plots in the West,"" Cruickshank said. ""There have been some ISIS fighters who have come back, but they have launched plots on their own steam."" The official named France, the United Kingdom and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat and said counterterrorism agencies in Germany are also on high alert. Several European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that the suspected terrorist cell that was raided is believed to have received instructions from ISIS. German authorities, meanwhile, said they had arrested three men on suspicion of links to ISIS. A 26-year-old man suspected of having trained to fight in Syria and trying to recruit others to join ISIS was detained in Lower Saxony on Thursday; and two men in their early 40s suspected of supporting ISIS in Syria were taken into custody in Berlin on Friday. But none of the men appear to have been planning attacks in Germany, authorities said. Are there concerns about any other groups? Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the deadly shooting at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week. U.S. authorities said they thought the video was authentic. But they weren't ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. ""We're not there yet. There are good indicators"" that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. At least a dozen people were detained in the Paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings, the city prosecutor's office said Friday. The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that there was also significant concern about Khorasan, an al Qaeda affiliate group, plotting attacks against Europe. Last week, Andrew Parker, the head of the British security service MI5 warned that a group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria was planning mass casualty attacks against the West, an apparent reference to the Khorasan group, according to Cruickshank. Are ISIS and al Qaeda working together in Europe? That doesn't seem to be the case, despite the apparently mixed affiliations of the Paris attackers. Cherif and Said Kouachi, the two brothers who French authorities say carried out the Charlie Hebdo attack, are believed to have had links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. But Amedy Coulibaly, who attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris and demanded that police end their siege of the Kouachi brothers, pledged allegiance to ISIS. In Syria, ISIS and al Qaeda have become fierce rivals since they severed ties early last year. ""I think the leadership of the two groups is not working together. And indeed, in many cases in Syria, they have fought each other,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a senior member on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. ""But outside of the theater of war, it certainly appears that those collisions and conflicts are less important to some of the people who are radicalized."" ""In France, as in probably the United States, Europe and elsewhere, you have people that have a closer affinity to one or the other,"" he told CNN. ""Some have been just radicalized online, and maybe the message of ISIL and the caliphate resonates more,"" Schiff said, using another acronym for ISIS. ""Others may have actually received training or support from AQAP, as may have been the case with the Kouachi brothers. And plainly, they don't have a problem working together overseas to attack Western targets."" The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that the possible shift by ISIS to direct attacks in Europe was partly the result of increased competition between ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates, including Khorasan, to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad. Are the Belgian raids connected to the Paris attacks? CNN affiliate VTM reported that the terrorism investigation in Belgium started weeks ago, and there has been no connection established with the Paris attacks. The three people targeted in the raid in the city of Verviers, in which two of them were killed, had been under surveillance for some time, said Belgian prosecutors' spokesman Thierry Werts. A Western intelligence source told CNN that the Paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the Belgian operation. That included the arrest of a Belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to Coulibaly. Belgian investigators questioned the arms dealer and searched his possessions, the source said. Through him, the investigators got a number of ""positive hits"" on suspected extremists already known to authorities. After the Paris attacks, the source said, investigators stepped up the urgency. How big is the challenge facing security agencies? European officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by fighters returning from Syria. More than 3,000 Europeans have left to fight in Syria in recent years. The total number who have returned to Europe is now estimated to be over 500, according to Cruickshank, including 250 who have returned to the United Kingdom, almost 200 to France and around 70 to Belgium. An indication of the potential threat came last year in the deadly shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium. The suspect in that case is Mehdi Nemmouche, a French citizen who has also been accused of helping to guard ISIS' Western hostages in Syria. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to Belgium to face trial over the museum shooting. He has denied the charges. But the sheer number of Europeans returning from Syria, as well as those suspected of other jihadist activities, makes the task of identifying who is a threat very difficult for law enforcement agencies. ""If there are literally hundreds of people going back to Western Europe, the ability of the police to literally sit on everybody becomes problematic from the standpoint of having the manpower,"" said Michael Chertoff, who was secretary of homeland security under President George W. Bush. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","European authorities are busy after last week's terror attacks in France .

"(CNN) -- Standing in the shadow of the Burj Dubai Kye Ho Kim of Samsung Construction rattles off the list of records the building will break. Standing about a half mile high, it will be the world's tallest building, with the most floors (164) and the world's highest and fastest building. ""This building is going to break so many records,"" said Kim, whose company is building the $4 billion tower, scheduled to open later this year. ""This is kind of a project like the first exploration of the moon. Nobody can challenge it."" It may not rank with manned missions to the moon, but right now there is nothing else like the Burj Dubai on Earth. As the project is metaphoric for the strength of Samsung Construction, the company itself symbolizes the growth of South Korea onto the world stage. A country once devastated by war and still divided by north and south has rebuilt itself into a modern capitalist democracy with companies with a global reach such as Samsung . Samsung has cornered the market in giant building construction, building the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and Taipei 101 in Taiwan -- both previous world-record holders. ""Think about the Americans when they constructed the Empire State Building in 1931,"" Kim said. ""So have we ... in a very short period of time we are now the leading company in the world."" Some of Korea's more impressive building projects are happening at home. In the midst of the recession, construction of Songdo -- a 1,500-acre new free trade zone built on reclaimed land two hours out of Seoul -- continues apace, with a projected cost of $35 billion. Developers hope it will be the eventual home of 75,000 people. It's considered one of the world's largest private real estate development ventures in history, a joint project with South Korea's Posco and Gale International, a U.S. real estate developer. ""Under construction today is about $10 billion"" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International. ""The project we're building has been able to attract multinational companies, investors as well as residents."" Postwar South Korea was based on a ""growth at any cost"" model, but the South Korean government has pledged 2 percent of its GDP for the next five years dedicated to green development. The country, already the world's most wired, plans to develop next-generation Internet connections that use less computing power. Indoor lighting initiatives are replacing traditional bulbs with lower energy LED lights. ""Green growth is not a plan B, it is plan A,"" said Kim Sang Hyup, executive director of the Green Growth Committee. ""We are going to contribute to the global community by action, not talk.""

"Rep. Kevin McCarthy's election to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the House was expected by politicos, but this Californian's back story is full of plot twists. Here are five things you might not know about him: . 1. Role model: Actor Kevin Spacey reportedly shadowed McCarthy to prepare for his role as Majority Whip Frank Underwood in the Netflix series ""House of Cards."" Unlike the duplicitous and murderous Underwood, McCarthy is considered by colleagues to be an affable guy who often invites members to his office to discuss their woes and share takeout food. Still, there are a few similarities. McCarthy once told reporters at the Sacramento Press Club that Underwood's office knickknacks and dÃ©cor look quite familiar. 2. Funding his future: McCarthy married his high school sweetheart and opened a deli with $5,000 he won in the lottery. According to the Orange County Register, an old menu shows the future politico once served up ""fresh Dutch Krunch white rolls every day."" He used the money to help pay his way through California State University, Bakersfield. 3. Rapid rise: His political ascent has been meteoric. His boss, former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, endorsed the young staffer to replace him in 2006. Since then, he's cruised through every re-election and used his charm, intellect and savvy, friends say, to climb through the House GOP's leadership ranks. Seven years after he first took office, he's now considered the front-runner for the majority leader's job. 4. Workouts and flip-flops: He's a workout buff who, in his spare time, dons the West Coast casual look. At Wednesday's annual softball game between women members of Congress and the media, McCarthy was spotted wearing linen slacks and flip-flops. He reportedly enjoys riding his bike along Rock Creek Park's trails in Washington or working up a sweat to P90X, much like Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. 5. Immigration views could be problematic: Like Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, the outgoing House majority leader, McCarthy has a nuanced position on immigration that could lead to some showdowns with both conservatives and pro-immigration reform advocates. Businesses in his district depend heavily on immigrant labor to work the fertile farmland. His district is also 35% Hispanic, and pro-immigration organizations have vowed to ramp up the pressure on McCarthy to address reform. Complete coverage of the 2014 midterm elections .

"The hundreds of theatergoers who packed into Central London's historic Apollo Theatre on Thursday night were expecting to watch a mystery. But about 40 minutes into the play, shortly after 8 p.m., they got a drama instead. ""One of the actors said, 'Watch out!'"" said one woman. ""We thought it was part of the play."" It wasn't. Instead, it was part of the century-old structure's ornate plaster ceiling, which tumbled five stories onto the theatergoers, injuring scores of them, seven seriously, officials said. ""We heard a creak, somebody screamed, somebody from over there said, 'Look out!' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed,"" said Hannah, who with her  husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775-seat theater. Though she said she herself felt ""slight panic,"" she credited those around her for keeping their calm. ""It wasn't every man for himself,"" she said, noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them. ""Everyone was looking out for each other, and in a couple of minutes, everyone was out."" The London Fire Brigade's Kingsland Station Manager Nick Harding said about 720 people were inside when a section of the ceiling collapsed on the theatergoers, taking parts of the balconies with it. An ambulance official said a total of 76 people had been injured, though many of them were treated at the scene and released. ""It was like slow motion,"" said one girl, who initially thought the sound of the falling ceiling was sound effects, but soon learned otherwise. ""It just kinda came down."" Harding said what fell was a 10-meter-by-10-meter square section of the ceiling, and that it dragged down balconies with it. ""You initially thought it was part of the play and then you could feel things on you,"" said an older woman. ""The dust that came down -- you couldn't see in front of you."" Metropolitan Police said those who were seriously hurt had been taken to hospitals in central London. None of the injuries appeared life threatening, one official said. Within an hour, a spokesman for the fire department said everyone, including those who had been hurt, had been evacuated from the building. Martin Bostock, who was with his wife and two children, said he thought the cave-in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted. ""You couldn't see across the room because of the dust, which we were all breathing in,"" he told CNN. ""It was absolutely horrific and very terrifying. I was with my wife and two kids. Thank God, we got out."" The Apollo is located next to Piccadilly Circus in the Soho district, which is usually packed with tourists, shoppers and diners at theater time. Within minutes, paramedics arrived carrying stretchers as police cordoned off the area. A few minutes later, some of the paramedics emerged from the theater, their stretcher full; others helped someone limp out of the building. Many of the injured were taken initially to the nearby theaters for an initial assessment of their condition by medical workers. The initial police assessment of the collapse was that it was an accident. ""There is no suggestion at this stage that this was as a result of a criminal act, however, at this stage we are keeping an open mind,"" Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Outside the Apollo, the street was packed with dozens of police, fire and ambulance vehicles as well as well-dressed theatergoers, some of their faces darkened with dust. ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" which was adapted to the theater from the 2003 mystery novel by British writer Mark Haddon, is about a 15-year-old boy's investigation into the death of a neighborhood dog. Ticket prices at the four-level theater, which opened its doors in 1901, included a £1 ($1.64) ""theatre restoration levy,"" the theater's website said. It was not immediately clear whether the ceiling was part of the restoration of the building, which is owned and operated by Nimax Theatres. In a statement, a spokesman said the company would ""continue to cooperate fully with the authorities to establish exactly what happened tonight.""

"(CNN) -- Writing in his will in 1895, Alfred Nobel designated who should determine the winners of the annual prizes which he intended to be established after his death. Alfred Nobel's statue in Stockholm. Nobel laid down who should nominate prizewinners in his will. Since its inception in 1901, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize has been chosen, in accordance with Nobel's wishes, by a five-member committee of lawmakers elected by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, and assisted by specially-appointed expert advisers. The 2009 committee is headed by Thorbjørn Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister and the current president of the Storting. The decision-making process starts in September, more than a year before the winner of the prize is announced, when the committee sends out letters to qualified individuals inviting them to nominate contenders -- either individuals, joint individuals or organizations -- for the peace prize. Qualified individuals include members of national assemblies, governments, international courts, heads of universities and academics and previous Nobel laureates. The names of nominees and other information about the deliberation process are kept secret for 50 years. No-one can nominate themselves. The deadline for nominations closes in February when the committee begins its work whittling scores of contenders down to a shortlist, typically of between five and 20 names. Expert advisers are then recruited to provide additional information about the remaining candidates and evaluate their merits. The winner of the prize is decided by a majority vote of committee members at the start of October.

"A self-proclaimed animal rights activist in Ohio has been charged with soliciting a hit man to kill a random person wearing fur, either by shooting the individual or slitting his or her throat. Meredith Lowell, 27, of Cleveland Heights, is accused of creating a phony Facebook profile with the intention of contacting a would-be killer, according to the affidavit filed in an Ohio district court. Lowell allegedly posted on the social media website the following request: ""I would like to create an online community on facebook which would allow me to find someone who is willing to kill someone who is wearing fur toward the end of October 2011 or early November 2011 or possibly in January 2012 or February 2012 at the latest."" An undercover FBI agent then contacted her, posing as a hit man after the agency subpoenaed Facebook to uncover details about her profile. She then allegedly requested that the murder take place at a local library and that she be present so that she could then hand out documents about animal cruelty after the homicide. ""Bring a sharp knife that is at least 4 inches long, it should be sharp enough to stab someone with and/or to slit their throat to kill them,"" Lowell allegedly wrote in an e-mail, according to the affidavit. The individual should be at least 12 years old, but ""preferably 14 years or older,"" Lowell allegedly wrote. ""I want the person dead in less than 2 minutes (under 2 minutes or 1 minute or less would be better.)""

"Taking on allegations that he leads a playboy lifestyle, the son of embattled former Chinese Communist leader Bo Xilai denied rumors Tuesday that he used to drive a Ferrari. But he was driving a Porsche when he received three traffic tickets over the past two years, according to an official with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Bo Guagua, a graduate student at Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, received two citations for failure to stop at a stop sign, records from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation show. He also received a speeding ticket for going 58 mph in a 30-mph zone in February 2011. The car he was driving when he received all three tickets was a 2011 Porsche Panamera, according to the official, who declined to be named due to the intense media coverage of the story. ""I have never driven a Ferrari,"" Bo said this week in a statement to the Harvard Crimson, the university's newspaper, denying a report that he picked up a date in the car in Beijing. In the letter, which was laid out in a series of bullet points, Bo also addressed allegations that he did poorly academically and spent much of his time partying. The Porsche is not registered to Bo, according to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation official. The car is instead registered to James Jun Cui, whose relationship to Bo was not immediately clear. Efforts to reach Cui were unsuccessful. Rumors of Bo's allegedly flamboyant college lifestyle have played poorly in China, where his father, a former kingpin in the metropolis of Chongqing, promoted a revival of Maoist-style ""red culture"" while pursuing a widely publicized -- but brutal -- crackdown on organized crime in the city. One family associate said there was little sympathy in China for what many regard as the typically spoiled offspring of the Communist Party elite.","Former Chinese official's son denies reports that he used to drive a Ferrari .

"Gary Oldman has written a letter apologizing for statements he made in a Playboy interview that have been slammed by Jewish groups. In a letter to the Anti-Defamation League, Oldman said he was ""deeply remorseful"" for the comments about Mel Gibson, which the ADL said put forward anti-Semitic stereotypes. ""I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people,"" Oldman said. ""Upon reading my comments in print -- I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype. Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter."" Gary Oldman goes off on hypocrisy, political correctness, Gibson and Baldwin . In the interview, on newstands Friday and already published online, Oldman wades into the controversies involving Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin, though to be fair, he does so in the context of ripping hypocrisy and political correctness. Gibson was pilloried for anti-Semitic remarks he made in 2006; Baldwin was criticized for lashing out at paparazzi with an anti-gay slur last year. ""Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough,"" Oldman said in the interview. ""But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn't turned and said, 'That f***ing kraut' or 'F*** those Germans,' whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me. It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone."" Oldman's longtime manager, Douglas Urbanski, defended Oldman in a statement to CNN. ""I have looked at the Playboy interview a few times now -- in fact I was in the room during the entire 8 or 9 hours. I am unaware -- as I have seen reported -- of Gary Oldman defending any anti-Semitic remarks in the interview, or, for that matter, anyplace!"" said Urbanski. ""He would not do so, and in fact he finds any kind of bigotry, homophobia, anti-Semitism, racism or sexism unacceptable and disgraceful. Period. If you read the Playboy piece correctly and entirely, and in context, it is the hypocrisy of political correctness that Gary is addressing, nothing else."" The ADL, however, was not placated by Oldman's apology. ""We have just began a conversation with his managing producer.  At this point, we are not satisfied with what we received.  His apology is insufficient and not satisfactory,"" ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said. The Playboy interview appears in the magazine's July/August issue. Oldman stars in the forthcoming film ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.""","Gary Oldman apologizes for remarks in Playboy interview .

"(CNN)A year ago at the Australian Open, Stan Wawrinka achieved something not done in five years. He became the first man outside tennis' ""Big Four"" to win a major since Juan Martin del Potro in 2009. The women's champion was less surprising, in the form of the now retired Li Na. With this year's opening grand slam starting Monday, here are seven things to watch as the tennis season bursts into life. Rafa's comeback . If Rafael Nadal wins in Melbourne, he might cherish his second title more than his first. That's because after beating Roger Federer in a thrilling five-set final in 2009, Melbourne Park has been less than kind to the 14-time grand slam champion on the health front. Check out this list: In 2010 he retired with a knee injury, a year later he suffered a hamstring injury in his quarterfinal and last year a back problem surfaced while warming up for the final. It was the clear turning point and Wawrinka took advantage. It was his long-time rival Federer who wept after losing to Nadal in 2009, but it was the Spaniard's turn to cry in 2014. Nadal hasn't competed at a grand slam since Wimbledon, having skipped the U.S. Open with a wrist complaint, and his buildup has been marred by two bad losses in the Middle East. But Friday's draw for 2015's first major was kind to Nadal. He appears to have a smooth path to the semifinals. Should Nadal somehow be the last man standing, only two triumphs would separate him and 17-time grand slam winner Federer. Serena's quest for 19 . If it was an odd-numbered year over the last decade, chances are that Serena Williams won the Australian Open. She took home the title in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009. But Williams' recent appearances mirror Nadal's. There was the ankle she hurt at a warm-up tournament in 2012 that led to a fourth-round exit in Melbourne. In 2013 a back injury was probably to blame for a quarterfinal loss and last year the back flared up again in the quarterfinals. Williams' play early in 2015 is sure to have worried her fans, too. The 18-time grand slam singles winner complained of a lack of energy at the Hopman Cup in Perth and subsequently split two of her four singles matches. Like Nadal, Williams' longest grand slam drought now happens to be in Melbourne. She won the U.S. Open in September by topping her BFF, Caroline Wozniacki, but they can't face off in the Australian Open final since they're in the same quarter. Roger's bid for one more major . With Nadal's performances patchy, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic getting off to a less than stellar start in 2015 and Andy Murray struggling for grand slam form, the 33-year-old Federer can't be discarded. While Federer didn't have to face any of his fellow ""Big Four"" members as he shone in Brisbane -- where he collected his 1,000th match win -- he defeated two players thought of as outside grand slam contenders in 2015. He dispatched Milos Raonic in the final having routed Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals. Aiding Federer would have been a kind draw, but unfortunately for him, it didn't happen. He found himself in the same quarter as Murray and same half as Nadal. Eugenie Bouchard and the Genie Army . Can the ""Genie Army"" propel Eugenie Bouchard to glory? Although she showed flashes in 2013, last year in Melbourne was when the tennis world truly took note of the 20-year-old. Her semifinal showing wasn't an anomaly, with Bouchard then reaching the last four at the French Open and the final at Wimbledon. But Bouchard couldn't duplicate her success from August onwards, the low point perhaps coming at the year-end championships where she failed to win a set in her three matches. Fatigue no doubt played a role. Bouchard arrives in Melbourne this year without a permanent coach, and you wonder how high her confidence is. The return of Juan Martin del Potro . Only The Grinch wouldn't be happy that del Potro is back playing tennis. Skipping most of last year with further wrist troubles, his supporters must have been holding their breath when the Argentine pulled out of Brisbane. But he returned in Sydney this week -- unsure of how his left wrist would cope -- and made the quarterfinals. The pain hasn't gone away yet, he said. None of the contenders would want to face del Potro early, though only the very optimistic would suggest he could win a second major over the coming fortnight. Maybe claiming a few rounds and coming through the tournament unscathed would be enough for him. He doesn't face a top-10 player in his opener but it's still an enticing -- and imposing -- encounter. The 6-foot-6 ""Tower of Tandil"" plays 2013 Wimbledon semifinalist Jerzy Janowicz, who stands 6-foot-8. Simona Halep's opening major? In an era where players on the women's tour all seem to be towering 6-footers, Simona Halep -- 5-foot-6 -- is an exception. She still packs a punch from the baseline, but it's her use of angles that so often gets her into winning positions in rallies. Her backhand is one of the best around. If Halep's breakthrough was in 2013, she went one better last year by making the difficult jump into the top 10 and top five. How close was the Romanian to winning the French Open? Very. She extended one of the game's top competitors, Sharapova, to 6-4 in the third set of the final. Halep -- the most clicked on player on the WTA's website last year -- began this year with a title in Shenzhen. A high-profile home hope . Who is the top Australian hope? The rankings will tell you it's Samantha Stosur, who like del Potro is a U.S. Open winner. She's the world No. 20 on the women's tour. But Stosur has never really flourished at the Australian Open, and she hasn't been shy to admit that nerves have been a huge factor. Only once since 2007 has Stosur -- armed with arguably the best second serve in the women's game -- exceeded the third round. Australians are probably banking on Nick Kyrgios, the athletic 19-year-old who stunned Nadal at Wimbledon, to have an extended run. Kyrgios chose to take a break in September, saying he was ""burnt out,"" and injuries have crept up.  He missed the Hopman Cup with a sore back. So expecting too much from Kyrgios may be a mistake.","The Australian Open starts Monday in Melbourne .

"A U.S. Army infantryman who lost all four limbs in a 2009 roadside explosion in Iraq has undergone radical transplant surgery that may help him regain use of his arms. Last month, the 26-year-old infantryman had successful surgery -- a rare double arm transplant -- at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ""It feels amazing,"" Marrocco told reporters Wednesday. ""It is something that I was waiting for for a long time, and now that it happened, I don't know what to say, because it is such a big thing for my life."" The last thing Marrocco remembers before being hit by an explosion in 2009 was that he was driving an armored vehicle. When he woke up at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, Marrocco was alive, but missing all four of his limbs. ""When it happened, I didn't remember too much,"" Marrocco said. ""I was still alive, so that's really all that mattered to me at the time."" Marrocco is one of only seven people in the country to successfully undergo the surgery, and the first quadruple-amputee soldier, according to Johns Hopkins. The surgery, which took 13 hours and 16 orthopaedic and microvascular surgeons from five hospitals -- was also the first bilateral arm transplant performed at Johns Hopkins. All of the surgeons volunteered their services; the surgery and rehabilitation costs were paid by the Department of Defense's Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine and Hopkins. The team of surgeons rehearsed the procedure on cadaver arms four times over the past 18 months, said lead surgeon Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins. ""On his right side we did an above-elbow transplant by connecting the bone, muscles, blood vessels, nerves and skin between the donor and recipient,"" Lee said. On Marrocco's left side, ""in order to preserve the elbow joint, we transplanted the entire donor forearm muscles over his remaining tissues, then rerouted the nerves to the new muscle."" While Marrocco is doing well, his recovery will be long and risky, the doctor said. ""The nerves regenerate at the maximum speed of 1 inch per month. The therapy will continue for a few years, first at Johns Hopkins, then at Walter Reed. The progress will be slow, but the outcome rewarding."" Marrocco is taking anti-rejection medication, which can lead to side effects like infection and organ damage. But he's received an infusion of the donor's bone marrow cells to further prevent rejection of his new arms. That infusion allows him to take only one anti-rejection drug instead of the usual three-drug cocktail. Doctors call his recovery so far remarkable. Watch: Mom eyes double arm transplant . ""Now, I can move my left elbow,"" Marrocco said. ""This was my elbow, the one I had before. I can rotate a little bit. This (right) arm is pretty much not much movement at all -- not yet at least. Hopefully, we are hopeful for the future to get some pretty good function out of it, out of both of them."" Doctors said rehabilitation therapy is an integral part of the healing process. ""The next two to three years, Brendan's full-time job is doing hand therapy, six hours a day, every single day, once nerves grow in,"" said Dr. Jaimie Shores, clinical director of hand transplantation at Johns Hopkins. ""He's going to be working very hard."" Marrocco said he's up to the task. The thing he's looking forward to most? ""Driving. Absolutely, driving. I used to love to drive and it was a lot of fun for me. So, I am really looking forward to getting back to that. And just becoming an athlete again. One of my goals is to hand-cycle a marathon."" Lee hopes the new anti-rejection regimen performed on Marrocco will become the new standard of care for limb and face transplants. Marrocco will participate in a anti-rejection regimen study that's being funded by the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine. For his family, the surgery means moving forward with their lives. ""Our lives have been on hold for the last almost four years waiting for this surgery, getting him through Walter Reed and getting to the point where he was pretty independent,"" said mother Michelle Marrocco. ""And now he will be independent, and when he comes home, he'll be the Brendan we've all been looking for."" Marrocco's message to other's facing similar challenges? Don't give up hope. ""Life always get better. You're still alive ... just be stubborn. Work your ass off."" Lee agreed. ""Advances in medicine are being made every day in different areas, whether it's tissue transplantation or tissue regeneration,"" he said. ""Research is being performed throughout the world with different ways of regenerating tissues and replacing arms, so they should be optimistic, as we are that there will be new treatments and modalities currently not available."" Marrocco said he's is very optimistic about his future. ""I just want to get the most out of these arms and just as goals come up, knock them down, and take it as absolutely far as I can. So really, I just want to get to the point that I can be completely on my own and just get back to enjoying life.""","Brendan Marrocco says after roadside bombing, being alive was ""all that mattered""

"Escalating violence in the Central African Republic is posing a threat to children, with at least two beheaded and thousands recruited as soldiers, the United Nations said. The United Nations says it verified the deaths of 16 children since violence broke out in the capital of Bangui on December 5. Dozens of others have been injured. ""We are witnessing unprecedented levels of violence against children. More and more children are being recruited into armed groups, and they are also being directly targeted in atrocious revenge attacks,"" said Souleymane Diabate, UNICEF representative in the nation. Number of child soldiers doubles . Late last year, the U.N. said the number of child soldiers in the nation had doubled to 6,000 as violence escalated. ""Targeted attacks against children are a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and must stop immediately. Concrete action is needed now to prevent violence against children,""  Diabate said. In the capital, 370,000 people -- about half the population --  have been displaced, the United Nations said. More than 935,000 people have been internally displaced nationwide, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. Chaos, violence . The nation plunged into chaos after a coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. They accused him of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. Months before his ouster, both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the President. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Fears of genocide . Since then, political turmoil raged and violence became the order of the day. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks, vigilante Christian groups fought back. The country descended into anarchy, and the United Nations has warned that a genocide is brewing. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis as rapes, killings and other horrors grow in the nation.  An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access. Others have fled into forests. Aid agency Doctors Without Borders said Thursday it will reduce medical activities at the airport in the capital because of insecurity.","Internally displaced number exceeds 935,000, U.N. says .

"Sudan's foreign ministry denied published reports that a woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christian faith is expected to be released. Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court. Ibrahim was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a Muslim, the religion of her father. Sharia law considers her a Muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a Christian. She is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison, says her husband Daniel Wani, who also is a Christian. Some Western media outlets have reported that Ibrahim would be released in a few days, but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife. ""I'm not aware that any release is imminent,"" Wani told CNN. Technically, the president of Sudan cannot pardon her, so the judiciary might be the only way out for the government, which is coming under increased international pressure to release Ibrahim. The court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago. At the time, she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl this week at a Khartoum prison, where she's detained with Martin, her 20-month-old son. Despite languishing in prison with two infants, she's holding firm to her beliefs, according to her husband. ""There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith,"" Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive. ""She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim? Yes, my father was a Muslim, but I was brought up by my mother.' "" Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian, more so than him, and even had their son baptized. ""I know my wife. She's committed,"" he said. ""Even last week, they brought in sheikhs and she told them, 'I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change my mind.' "" Wani, who is a U.S. citizen, said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth doesn't hasten his wife's death sentence. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, Sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence. Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth. CNN sought comment from the Sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry. A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued. An attempt to contact Sudan's foreign affairs minister for comment was unsuccessful. Woman raised as Christian, husband says . Ibrahim, 27, was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion. Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her attorney, Mohamed Jar Elnabi. Wani said he'd never met the relatives who made the accusations. His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6. ""These people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared,"" he said. At first, Ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian. The apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a Christian, according to her husband. ""The police originally called for the case to be dismissed, but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery, by saying she was their sister and a Muslim. It is illegal for a Muslim woman to marry a Christian man, therefore we were brought before the court."" She's been detained since January 17, he said. In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said. ""An illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring, which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine,"" he said. Wani's physical condition makes the ordeal even harder. He uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends"" on Ibrahim, according to her lawyer. ""He cannot live without her,"" he said. Wani said he's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added. ""She's in a bad mood,"" he said of his wife. ""She's frustrated."" More punishment . In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced Ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction. The court had warned her to renounce her Christianity by May 15, but she has steadfastly maintained she is a Christian and will remain so. Sudanese Parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said claims that she was raised as a non-Muslim were untrue. She was raised in an Islamic environment, and her brother, a Muslim, filed the complaint against her, according to Al-Deen. 'I'll stand by her' Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned. ""I'm hoping that, given the way people have come together around the world -- which I want to thank them for,"" he said. ""All the rights groups, all the broadcasters ... It's looking like it had an effect. Perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned."" But until it's done, the mother of his children has his support. ""I'm standing by her to end. Whatever she wants, I'll stand by her,"" he said. Worldwide condemnation . Rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide have condemned the verdict. The ruling also created shock waves in Sudan, where activists are defying the government and criticizing what they consider an overly harsh implementation and interpretation of Islam . ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the Sudanese government to reverse course. There's no timetable on when the judicial process will be over, but the couple isn't giving up. The appeals court's ruling could come within the next week, their attorney says. Until then, they're grasping at small signs of hope. The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.","Foreign ministry denies reports that Meriam Yehya Abrahim would be released .

"Justin Bieber got some unexpected visitors Tuesday morning: sheriff's deputies with a warrant to search his home. Investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were looking for video from Bieber's security cameras that might show what happened Thursday night when eggs were thrown at a neighbor's home, according to a sheriff's statement. A judge gave deputies a felony search warrant, which they carried out Tuesday morning, the sheriff's statement said. Bieber and several house guests were asleep in the home when deputies arrived at 8 a.m., according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson. He was cooperative with the dozen deputies, but he did not answer questions about the alleged vandalism, Thompson said. Justin Bieber's bad year: A guide . Bieber hasn't spoken to investigators about last week's incident, and his representative had declined comment to CNN. Bieber house guest arrested . One of Bieber's house guests, rapper Lil Za, was arrested when deputies allegedly found illegal drugs during their search, Thompson said.  Although the drugs were initially reported to be cocaine, Thompson later said they are believed to be Ecstasy and Xanax, but lab tests will be needed to confirm it. The suspect was identified as Xavier Smith, 20, who performs under the name Lil Za, Thompson said. He was set to be released later Tuesday after posting a $20,000 bond, Thompson said. But while in the booking cell, he allegedly broke a telephone while trying to arrange that bond, and then he was charged with felony vandalism for the phone incident, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. Chad Waters, the watch commander at the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station . Smith was kept in custody on the newest charge. Video clues sought . ""The purpose of the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014,"" the sheriff's statement said. Deputies seized video from computer hard drives on the ""extensive"" security monitoring system on Bieber's estate, Thompson said. Cameras capture just about any movement on the property, he said.  Detectives will spend the next days scouring through the video for clues about who hurled eggs toward the neighboring mansion last week, Thompson said. If investigators find enough evidence that Bieber, 19, threw the eggs that splattered against his next-door neighbor's home, they could refer the matter to the district attorney's office for possible prosecution, he said. The vandalism damage to the house of Bieber's neighbor was about $20,000, Thompson said. The cost of repairing the damage to the house is a key factor in determining the severity of the charge. Any damage of more than $950 would qualify the charge as a felony. Bieber's Brazil adventures: Truth or idol gossip? Bieber lives in the Oaks, an exclusive gated community, in Calabasas. He moved into a $6.5 million mansion there two years ago. An impressive list of the rich and famous -- including Michael Jackson's mother and children -- live in the neighborhood, about 30 miles west of downtown Los Angeles. His neighbors have complained about Bieber several times in the past year, including in May when two neighbors called the sheriff to report he was speeding down residential streets, a sheriff's spokesman said. Deputies visited Bieber's home in response, but the singer refused to talk to them, Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Retired NFL star Keyshawn Johnson went to Bieber's home then to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on the residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep told CNN in May. A neighbor accused Bieber of spitting on him and making threats during a heated confrontation outside his home last March, Whitmore said. It prompted a sheriff's probe, but no charges followed.

"Anyone who knows real estate is likely familiar with the old adage about the things that matter in property: Location. Location. Location. But in New York City, with a population of more than 8 million, finding a good spot for the right price can be tricky. So Gotham's mayor is looking for help. Michael Bloomberg on Monday called on designers to come up with a proposal for a Manhattan apartment building made up mostly of ""micro-units,"" defined as rentals with 275 to 300 square feet of living space. Bloomberg's soda ban proposal goes to public comment . Submissions are due September 14, and winners will be chosen at the end of 2012, with the first micro-units to be developed by late 2013. For New Yorkers accustomed to cramped quarters and others pushed beyond city limits due to cost, the pilot program may be something to consider. ""Today there are about 1.8 million one- and two-person households in our city, but there are only about 1 million studio and one-bedroom apartments,"" Bloomberg told reporters Monday. ""You notice the mismatch."" The pilot units will be required to fill at least 75% of the building. They'll have kitchens and bathrooms, but are far smaller than current city minimums of 450 square feet. ""New York City's housing codes have not kept up with its changing population,"" the mayor's press release said. ""There is a huge shortfall of studio and one-bedroom apartments in the city,"" Bloomberg added. ""This ... will be one way to make more of them, and to make more of them more affordable."" The units will likely be priced under $2,000 a month, which is the average market rent for a studio apartment in Manhattan, according to city Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Matthew Wambua. But for those used to stretching out, the new units may be a bit tight. ""It can fit a twin size bed, maybe a small nightstand, a small dining table for two, and that's pretty much it,"" said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuels, an independent appraisal firm. ""A master bedroom of a modest ranch home equipped with a bathroom would probably be the equivalent."" Micro-units will equate to about 15% of the size of the average U.S. home, he added, which spans about 2,200 to 2,400 square feet. N.Y. governor proposes decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana . The average size of a studio apartment in Manhattan is around 550 square feet. Observers say Bloomberg's proposal may reflect shifting housing needs and point to a more accurate portrayal of the true costs of city living. Considered one of the world's most densely populated areas, more than 69,000 people on average occupy each square mile of Manhattan, according to the latest census data. The program's first micro-units are to be built on a vacant lot owned by the Housing Preservation and Development Department, and are part of a city initiative to create or preserve 165,000 affordable housing units by 2014.

"Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists claims that I have a ""zeal to promote nuclear energy,"" implying that I'm blindly and thoughtlessly promoting a technology I know little about.  I beg to differ. I've spent four years on this film. I've consulted with some of the top nuclear scientists and energy experts in the country to fact check every detail that went into the film, including my senior science adviser, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Dr. Burton Richter. I've screened the film at the U.S. Department of Energy, to the general assembly of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, at nuclear engineering departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and Texas A&M, to name just a few of the tech-savvy viewers who've scrutinized it. This film has received nothing but support from the technical and scientific community regarding the facts presented. So if Lyman has criticisms and sees flaws, his views are not representative of those who know the most about this technology. Read what Edwin Lyman has to say . I am no zealot.  Nor am I an activist.  I've taken not a dime from the nuclear industry.  And I'm not a lobbyist or a propaganda tool for anyone.  I'm an independent documentary filmmaker with a long track record of producing sober and critically acclaimed films on historical, technological and environmental themes. I have no dog in this race.  I'm simply reporting what I've discovered after years of careful research. It's shocking to many people (much of what I discovered was shocking to me as well) and it's caused the anti-nuclear movement to come after me like a ton of bricks. Lyman is but one of their many henchmen. To me, all of these non-fossil energy technologies are simply tools to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. They should not be regarded as ends in themselves -- including nuclear.  Each of them have their pluses and minuses, and we need to weigh the costs and benefits of each.  Solar and wind have their own problems, the biggest being scalability.  But there are many others as well that would only be magnified as they take a more dominant role -- the industrialization of the countryside being, to me, one of the most pernicious. So I feel that Lyman's criticism is a little myopic and is driven mostly by his life-long aversion to nuclear technology in any form -- a view shared by many of his generation that grew up equating nuclear energy with nuclear weapons, as I once did. Obviously, in a 90-minute film for a general audience, I was not able to go into every specific detail of the integral fast reactor technology.  So to find out more about the IFR technology profiled in the film, I would suggest you read the very easily digestible book on the subject called ""Prescription for the Planet."" This is a book that's highly recommended by Dr. James Hansen by the way -- the world's foremost climate scientist -- among a great many others.  For those techno freaks who want to dig even deeper, I suggest reading ""Plentiful Energy,"" a remarkable book by the scientists who developed the IFR.  Both of these books are excellent and chock full of amazing information. Lyman might want to read them too, rather than deriving his information from the Internet, which is all he seems to have done. Climate scientists urge support of nuclear energy . Judge for yourself which side you want to stand on in this debate: anti-nuclear activists or climate scientists?  I know who I stand with. Indeed, Hansen, in our post-screening panel discussion with CNN's Anderson Cooper, to be aired on CNN on Thursday and Sunday, November 7 and 10, told the audience that he believes the single best thing you could do if you care about the future of the planet and you care about your children and grandchildren is stop giving money to groups like Lyman's.  Sadly, the big environmental groups, in their staunch opposition to nuclear technology, have become as much of an impediment to us solving climate change as are the most vociferous climate deniers. For the record, the IFR technology featured in the film is simply one illustrative example of the many advanced reactor technologies that are in various stages of development: thorium reactors, molten salt reactors, small modular reactors, traveling wave reactors, etc. The list goes on and on, and all this stuff is being developed and prototyped now (mostly in China) and is mentioned near the end of the film. Lyman and others seem to suggest that nuclear energy is hopeless and that all research and development into its advancement should be abandoned, period, and that we should throw all of our efforts into renewables and energy efficiency alone. Given the overwhelming challenges we face in attempting to power a planet of almost 9 billion people with clean, affordable, non-CO2-emitting energy, that's about the most irresponsible course of action imaginable. Watch ""Pandora's Promise"" and decide for yourself.","Director: Some of country's ""top nuclear scientists and energy experts"" fact checked the film .

"Vladimir Putin always understood that the old ways would no longer do. He had witnessed the errors of 20th century dictatorship firsthand as a KGB agent stationed in Dresden during the last years of the Cold War. The young Soviet officer was shocked at how ""totally invasive"" the East German police state's surveillance was of its own citizens. In 2000, reflecting on those years on the eve of his first term as Russia's president, Putin said, ""I only regretted that the Soviet Union had lost its position in Europe, although intellectually I understood that a position built on walls and dividers cannot last. But I wanted something different to rise in its place. And nothing different was proposed."" More than a decade later, something different has risen to replace the totalitarian models of old. Modern strongmen are more sophisticated and cunning then their twentieth-century predecessors. These savvy authoritarians eschew the most heavy-handed methods -- mass executions, disappearances, brutal crackdowns -- as an extreme last resort. Instead, subtle forms of coercion are preferred. Rather than have its activists roughed up, a human rights organization is more likely to be shuttered for fire-code violations. These regimes are fluent in the language of democracy and human rights, and may even establish human rights commissions -- despite being the chief perpetrators of any abuses. Laws are written in vague terms and then applied capriciously against those who question the regime's ways. And fear is always a potent weapon. ""My father used to say that he would rather live in a dictatorship like Cuba,"" one Venezuelan activist told me. ""At least there you know if you criticized the government, they would put you in prison. Here they rule through uncertainty."" Of course, elections are de rigueur in modern dictatorships -- and not the absurd sham polls of the Soviet Union that always left Brezhnev with 99 percent of the vote. Today the ballot stuffing usually stops at 70 percent. Everyone understands that it is better to appear to win a genuine election -- which means you need the opposition to win some votes -- than to participate in a clear charade. There is something Darwinian about the way that authoritarianism has evolved. Because, in many ways, it has never been harder to be a dictator. In the past 20 years, the democracy promotion business boomed. Many dictatorships lost their chief lifeline with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The internet, satellite communication, and smart phones make it incredibly difficult for a regime to keep its worst crimes secret. In 1989, the Chinese Communist Party tried to strong-arm CNN off the air before they mowed down protesters on the roads leading to Tiananmen Square. If people assembled in the square today, the regime's response would be captured on a thousand iPhones. In response to these pressures, the smartest regimes did not close themselves off from the world or seek to become the next North Korea. Police states hold no appeal. Instead, they evolved. In Russia, the Kremlin has responded to protests by passing a raft of laws that enable the authorities to squash activists with fines and prison sentences. In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez has engineered the electoral rules with some of the world's most sophisticated gerrymandering. In Jordan, the government has proposed one reform after another -- without ever curbing the monarchy's true power. In China, the Communist Party altered its social compact with its people, granting them greater personal freedoms in exchange for keeping tight control of their political rights. In Malaysia, the ruling party promised to relax its rule -- right before it banned street demonstrations. When people responded in protest, Prime Minister Najib Razak referred to them as a ""sign of a mature democracy."" It was the perfectly tailored reply of the modern authoritarian. In a world of unfettered information and open borders, we should understand authoritarian regimes for what they are. They are not the outgrowth of a certain culture, history, or level of economic development. Rather, they are conscious, man-made projects that must be carefully built, polished, and reinforced. But it makes no difference if a regime has developed innovative strategies, political tools, or social controls if it doesn't use them. No matter how sophisticated these regimes may be, some are finding that their methods are wearing thin. Since the announcement of Putin's return for a third presidential term 12 months ago, Putin and the Kremlin have demonstrated a remarkably tin ear. The trial of Pussy Riot is just the most recent example where the regime has appeared flatfooted -- unnecessarily politicizing issues that make it appear overweening and abusive. Putin has now lost the support of much of the urban middle class and young people -- a group that always polled highly for Putin -- and his ruling party's brand is in shambles. As one activist told me, ""It is no longer cool to be pro-Putin."" That is an important loss for a regime that banks on the apathy of its citizens. In Venezuela, Chavez's prospects are in question. The past month has been his worst politically, with a string of disasters and accidents that underline how much the state has crumbled under his watch. Workers -- if ever he had a core constituency -- recently booed El Comandante at a rally. Although his control of the media, oil wealth, and state machinery keeps him formidable, it is increasingly clear (to Venezuelans of all political stripes) that the country is reaching a breaking point. Of course, Syria offers a daily reminder that some dictatorships still opt for a bloodbath. In 1982, Hafez Assad brutally ended an uprising in the Syrian city of Hama. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 40,000 Syrians were slaughtered in a month. Bashar Assad chose to follow his father's example in crushing his own rebellion. The difference is that in 1982 the elder Assad could be confident that he could perpetrate his crimes with impunity. His son's regime looks less tenable by the day. No matter what happens, Assad's government will never win back its legitimacy. Apparently Assad never learned that the old ways would no longer do.","Dobson: Sophisticated authoritarians replacing old totalitarian regimes .

"A gunman opened fire outside a terminal at Manila's main airport on Friday, killing the mayor of a southern Philippines town, two members of his family and a young child, authorities said. Striking amid the bustle of pre-Christmas travel, the attack wounded five people and caused panic among passengers caught up in the chaos. Gun crime and political violence occur with grim frequency in the Philippines. But the shooting Friday at Terminal 3 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport appeared particularly brazen. Initial reports suggested the shooting may have been carried out by more than one attacker. But police said they believe a lone gunman sprayed bullets at the mayor and his entourage before fleeing on foot and being picked up by an accomplice on a motorcycle. The dead include Ukol Talumpa, the mayor of Labangan, a town in the southern Philippines, and his wife and 28-year-old niece, said Supt. Jose Erwin Villacorte, director of the Manila region's Southern Police District. An 18-month-old child, believed to have been struck by a stray bullet, was also killed, Villacorte said. Authorities said the shooting took place around 11:20 a.m. at the terminal's loading bay, an area outside the airport's security screening of passengers. It was a busy time at the airport, which handles both domestic and international flights. Police believe the mayor, who has reportedly survived previous assassination attempts, was the target of the attack, Villacorte said. Talumpa and his family had flown from the southern Philippines to Manila, where they planned to spend the Christmas holidays, Villacorte said. The mayor's security detail, at least one of whom was wounded, hadn't yet reclaimed their weapons after the flight, so they were unarmed when the attack took place, he said. Jose Angel Honrado, the general manager of Manila International Airport Authority, said flights haven't been disrupted and the airport is operating as normal, except for the specific area where the shooting happened. The people wounded in the attack have been taken to a medical center for treatment, he said. Villacorte said police were still gathering information in their investigation into the case. The official Philippines News Agency reported that Talumpa had previously survived an assassination attempt in Manila in 2010 and a grenade attack in 2012 in Zamboanga del Sur, the province where Labangan is situated on the southern island of Mindanao. The Philippines is plagued by political violence. Some political clans control private armies. The deadliest outbreak of politically motivated violence in recent history took place in 2009 in Maguindanao province on Mindanao. The wife and sister of a political candidate and 30 journalists were among the dozens of victims who were shot and buried in a mass grave. Philippines authorities say there were more than 1.2 million registered firearms in the country last year and estimate there were another 600,000 unlicensed firearms in circulation nationwide. The Philippines is currently estimated to have a population of about 106 million people.","Police say they believe the shooting was carried out by a lone gunman .

"As millions of Taiwanese headed for the polling stations across the nation last weekend, there was a general sense that change was at hand. As the results of the vote started trickling in during the evening, it soon became clear that the political scene in Taiwan was about to become a much different place. It was a rout. When it was all over and done, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) had merely won six of the 22 constituencies in the mayoral and commissioner elections, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 13, and did so with sizable leads. Moreover, the KMT had lost control of Taipei, the capital city it had run for 16 consecutive years, to an independent with no political experience, and also saw safe cities in the northern half of the island, such as Hsinchu and Taoyuan, slip through its fingers. In all, it lost nine of the 15 cities and counties it used to control. Overall, the DPP garnered 5.83 million votes, or 47.6%, against the KMT's 4.99 million (40.7%). However, if we factor the votes that went to independent candidates who are ideologically close to the DPP, the ""green camp"" accounted for a solid 6.88 million votes. Discontent with the KMT alone doesn't sufficiently explain the DPP's performance; the latter, including leader Tsai Ing-wen, worked tirelessly in the lead-up to the elections, and for the most part fielded candidates of quality. In the wake of catastrophe, Premier Jiang Yi-huah and KMT Secretary-General Tseng Yung-chyuan, as well as 80 members of the Cabinet, have resigned, and it is now rumored that President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, could step down from the latter position on Wednesday. Lazy campaigns? There are sundry reasons for the defeat. In many constituencies, including Taipei, the KMT ran lazy campaigns and spent more time attacking its opponents than trying to convince voters of the virtues of its own candidates. More importantly, Ma and his party have become highly unpopular. After six years of rapprochement with Beijing, and the signing of as many as 20 cross-strait agreements, the promised ""revival"" of Taiwan's stagnating economy never materialized. Furthermore, the benefits of increasing trade with China tended to fall in the lap of magnates who were close to the administration, while for the majority of Taiwanese -- especially youth -- the prospects for their future seemed grim. Many voters appear to have blamed the KMT's inability to deliver domestically on the administration's single-minded focus on China. Undeniably, relations between the two sides have improved since 2008, when Ma stepped into office, but many have become increasingly aware of the inherent political risks of doing so. Taiwanese of all stripes know that Beijing continues to regard Taiwan as a ""renegade province,"" but many were nevertheless willing to liberalize ties with it, though many faulted Ma for not paying enough attention to safeguarding the island's sovereignty and democracy in the process. More and more, local problems were seen to be tied to the external China factor. From the media to major infrastructure projects, ""black box"" trade agreements to pro-Beijing gangsters menacing the population, China's hand suddenly became a major issue. A red line had been crossed, and civic organizations fearing the administration had gone too far, took action. In March, scores of protesters stormed a key government building to urge the government to scrap a controversial trade deal with China in what was dubbed the Sunflower Movement. The Ma administration reacted to all this with repression, then indifference, and consequently paid a high price on November 29. One of the Sunflowers' greatest achievements was to raise awareness about the perceived failures of government and the ""black hand"" of China. Sunflower generation . Candidates like Ko Wen-je in Taipei had great appeal with the Sunflower generation. The fact that the DPP chose not to field a candidate to run against him was a masterful move on chairperson Tsai's part: It signaled the party's willingness to cooperate with this ""third force."" Several young candidates, some of them from smaller parties or running as independents, were also elected and will be part of that coalition. This green coalition will undoubtedly be more attuned to civil society, and their control of a majority of the municipalities across Taiwan will make it more difficult for the central government to implement policies that are unpopular with the public -- something it has done repeatedly since the beginning of Ma's second, and last, term in 2012. In an early sign that things may be already changing, mayor-elect Ko has already said he would fire the police chief in Xinyi District if pro-Beijing activists continued to physically assault practitioners ofFalun Gong -- a spiritual movement banned in China — and pro-Taiwan independence activists outside the Taipei 101 skyscraper. Facing much greater resistance from ""below,"" and confronted to an emboldened pan-green coalition, Ma's ability to press ahead with further unpopular agreements with China likely has been severely compromised. With a little more than a year left in office, he may have reached the limit of what he can give to Beijing, even more so if he steps down as party chairman. There is no doubt that civil society, and the many that it inspired, punished the KMT in the elections. Unless the KMT wants to go through a similar embarrassment in the 2016 presidential election, whoever is in charge will have to ensure that the party better reflects public wishes. And that means being more careful with China.","Taiwan's ruling party routed in local elections in ""black Saturday.""

"The new film ""Pandora's Promise"" is a love song to nuclear power that claims to be a documentary, but like all good propaganda it omits key parts of the story, overstates the positives and underplays the negatives. Built around the (false) proposition that improved quality of life requires commensurate growth in energy use (a recurring visual theme is a globe that glows brighter and brighter), the movie presents nuclear power as the only plausible solution to global warming. No American utility today would consider building a new nuclear power plant without massive government support. Of 29 power plants on the drawing boards in 2009, only a handful are going forward, with government help, and even those are experiencing delays and cost overruns. No major U.S. environmental group endorses nuclear power as a solution to climate change caused by fossil fuels, but this movie lionizes environmental activists who have become nuclear power enthusiasts, led by Michael Shellenberger and Stewart Brand. Shellenberger notes in the film that he at one time worked for NRDC and other major environmental groups in a consulting role. Their narratives are juxtaposed against unflattering, decades-old clips of veteran anti-nuclear activists like Helen Caldicott, Jane Fonda and Ralph Nader, suggesting that being pro-nuke is modern and hip. One of us, Cavanagh, was among about 50 people who attended a screening at Stanford University, home to the film's science adviser, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Burton Richter. Those in the mostly empty auditorium heard one of the movie's principal funders -- tech entrepreneur Steve Kirsch -- tell the audience beforehand that outspoken climate scientist James Hansen was an inspiration for the film. Kirsch said it was Hansen who first alerted him to the promise of the Integral Fast Reactor, which is an advanced reactor design intended to operate more safely and produce less hazardous waste than today's plants. Hansen certainly would not agree, however, with the film's curt dismissal of the potential contributions of energy efficiency and renewable energy resources to meeting global energy needs. Opinion: Are environmental leaders steering us toward disaster? Integral Fast Reactor and France . The still-unrealized Integral Fast Reactor is the real star of the film, along with the nation of France, whose nuclear generation program is extolled as ""one of the most inspiring stories ever"" (""the trains are electric powered, they have clean air, and they have the cheapest electricity in Europe""). Nuclear power debates are the only places where you will ever see those at the conservative edge of the political spectrum argue that the United States should reorganize its economy to be more like France. The Clinton administration killed the Integral Fast Reactor in 1994 because of concern over the potential diversion of the plutonium fuel by terrorists and non-nuclear weapon states of concern. Yet the film's closing argument is that a ""fourth-generation"" reactor modeled on the Integral Fast Reactor will sweep the globe, burning waste created by the first three generations and ""solving"" the nagging problem of long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The film fails to mention that this would take hundreds to thousands of plutonium-fueled reactors operating over hundreds of years, resulting most likely in an increase in the releases of radioactivity to the environment as a consequence of operations by the Integral Fast Reactor's fuel processing and fabricating facilities. The film invokes Bill Gates as one of many forward-thinking new investors in nuclear innovation, but surely even Gates would recoil from the Integral Fast Reactor's poor economic outlook compared to conventional reactors and the financial risks associated with building just one Integral Fast Reactor, let alone a global fleet of them. The film fails to acknowledge that the flagship fast reactor development efforts in the United States, France, Germany, Japan and Italy all failed, and that fast reactors were abandoned by both the U.S. and Soviet navies, hardly a strong selling point for resurrecting the Integral Fast Reactor program. Director/producer Robert Stone told the Stanford audience that he first sought financial backing from Kirsch about three years ago, which also explains one of the film's dilemmas. It clearly was crafted initially to debunk concerns about Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl (1986), but then the Fukushima nuclear disaster inconveniently intervened (2011). Obviously unable to ignore Fukushima, Stone had one of the narrators visit the site to wield a radiation meter and contend that the reactor accidents should have been far less newsworthy than the earthquake-generated tsunami that caused them. Still, the wrecked reactors are a nagging distraction from the film's upbeat message, with one speaker acknowledging that ""this is not just something you can brush away.  This was not supposed to happen."" Dismissing facts . Meanwhile, the movie contends that anti-nuclear activists have grossly overstated radiation risks, even as it overlooks scientific findings from, for example, the World Health Organization on actual impacts of radiation releases. The film also dismisses energy efficiency in light of the allegedly inherent energy intensity of modern life, perpetuating the decade-old urban myth that a smartphone uses as much electricity as a refrigerator. (Repeated demonstrations show that if you take everything into account, a smartphone and the cloud data it uses only represent 15-20% as much electricity as an average refrigerator.) The film makes an effective case against coal combustion on public health grounds, with credible data on annual premature deaths both globally (3 million) and in the United States (13,000). Yet this indictment promptly and unfairly broadens to cover the full universe of nuclear power skeptics: ""To be anti-nuclear is to be in favor of burning fossil fuels,"" and presumably all these deaths, too. In the final sequence, an ebullient Shellenberger concludes: ""This is the beginning of something really beautiful."" Cut to that glowing globe of the Earth (without a hint of irony, but remember that these are the same people who chose to include Pandora in the title of a movie promoting nuclear power; readers may recall that Pandora was the figure in Greek mythology who unleashed evil spirits by opening a container that was supposed to be left undisturbed).

"When a reporter asked Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus whether he felt Building 197 at the Washington Navy Yard was secure, he answered the only way he could Monday. ""Not today."" In addition to the gunman, authorities said 12 people were killed and eight others injured when a shooter opened fire in Building 197 at the Navy Yard. Earlier, Navy Vice Adm. William D. French had said 14 people were injured. Located in the heart of the nation's capital, the Navy Yard is home to high-level naval personnel. About 3,000 people work there, including junior service members and civilian employees. It's supposed to be a secure facility. So what went wrong? ""It'll be interesting to see as this develops who the shooter is, how he got in, those type of questions answered. I think right now a lot of people are wondering, you know, just how safe the building is, or how safe the office environment is,"" Jirus said. The FBI has identified the suspected shooter as Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old military contractor from Texas. He had access to the Yard because of his contracting work, and he used a valid pass to gain entry, said Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the Washington FBI field office. Jirus described how access typically works. ""I have a CAC card,"" he said, referring to a common access card, the standard ID for active duty uniformed service personnel, Selected Reserve, Defense Department civilian employees and eligible contractor personnel. Audit reports Navy risked security to cut costs, says source . The ID also is the main card used to grant physical access to buildings and other controlled spaces. ""As a military person, we all have badges that we have to key the door to get in -- that allows us automatic access to the building. ""But again, if you're a contractor, if you're coming to visit the building, you can go through security and walk right in -- not walk right in, but you would check in through security,"" Jirus said. Even to drive or walk onto the base, a person would be required to present credentials, said Navy Capt. Mark Vandroff. Building 197 has armed security at the door. ""There's a kiosk you go through, and it either gives you a green or a red light, but the green light shows that your credentials are recognized as someone who is supposed to be in that building. ""So you have to go through a couple of layers of security to get into Building 197 -- first to get access onto the Yard, and then through the doors to get in,"" Vandroff said. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr has visited the Navy Yard several times over the years for stories. Victims identified . In her experience, security is extensive. Everyone must have clearance to be there or valid identification that allows them entry. If you were an employee of the facility, you would have a parking sticker and go through a checkpoint, Starr said. A guard would see your sticker, know that you were authorized to be on the compound and allow you to proceed. If you were a visitor, as Starr would be, you'd call ahead and have an appointment. Guards would have your name at the gate, and you would be escorted to wherever you needed to go. ""So the question, of course, is -- how did somebody get a weapon onto the base?"" she asked. ""Look, it is always possible in these types of situations, theoretically, to find your way around security measures. Somebody could have had a weapon in their car, unseen, hidden and taken it out. ""There's any number of ways it might have happened,"" Starr said.","Shooting suspect Aaron Alexis had access to the Yard because of his contracting work .

"Nothing riles up the tea party chattering class like a broken pledge against raising taxes. Just ask Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a veteran Georgia Republican who this week turned his back on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge he signed years ago as a rite of passage in right-wing politics. Immediately labeled ""worthless"" and ""a liar"" on the website Tea Party Nation, Chambliss symbolizes the political conundrum facing GOP leaders after President Barack Obama's re-election. After years of opposing higher taxes on anyone, Republicans now are under pressure to work out a comprehensive agreement to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. That means a compromise with Obama and Democrats, who insist on more tax revenue being part of a package that includes spending cuts and entitlement reforms. Congress returns to Washington next week after the Thanksgiving break with just over a month to work out the blueprint for a deal that would avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of steep across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases set to occur at the end of the year. Boehner: Obamacare on table for 'fiscal cliff' talks . Facing imminent unpopular scenarios such as higher taxes for everyone and further cuts in military spending, the negotiations taking place behind closed doors in Washington have new impetus to produce results. Obama's victory this month with a slightly stronger Democratic majority in the Senate and a slightly weaker Republican majority in the House signaled general public acceptance of the president's main campaign theme: raising more tax revenue from the rich as part of a deficit-reduction package. In particular, Obama and Democrats insist that wealthy Americans, so far identified as those with income higher than $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for families, should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same. Norquist responds to senator's break with no-tax pledge . However, the new Congress to be seated in January includes 39 senators, including Chambliss, and 219 House members who have signed the anti-tax pledge pushed by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, according to the group's website. The House total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435-seat chamber, though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge much like Chambliss did Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate WMAZ, a Georgia television station. ""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,"" said Chambliss, who faces re-election for a third Senate term in 2014. Referring to Norquist, who has vowed to oppose candidates who break the pledge, Chambliss said that ""if we do it his way, then we'll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with him about that."" In response to Chambliss, Norquist told CNN that the senator ""wrote a commitment to the voters of Georgia."" ""He got elected and re-elected making that commitment,"" said Norquist. ""He's never promised me anything."" Norquist said he believes Chambliss was ""caught"" on a TV station and that ""he said some things perhaps that didn't make sense."" If the senator wants to ""change his mind and become a tax increaser,"" Norquist said, ""he needs to have that conversation with the people of Georgia."" Fiscal cliff helps mend Obama-CEO relations . Chambliss acknowledged that Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform will likely work against his re-election because of the issue. ""But I don't worry about that because I care too much about my country,"" Chambliss said, adding that he was ""willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves."" Possible consequences were evident on Friday. ""To call Chambliss an idiot is to insult people of lower intelligence,"" blogger Judson Phillips of Tea Party Nation wrote. ""Chambliss is a poster child for every thing that is wrong with the political class in Washington."" Later in his post, Phillips sharpened his point: ""If you give your word and you break your word, then you are a liar."" Phillips also called Chambliss the worst RINO -- Republican In Name Only -- in Washington, citing an acronym that conservatives use for those they consider to be sell-out politicians. ""If you are a worthless Republican politician and you want some good press from the liberal media,"" Phillips wrote, ""all you have to do now days is say you are considering abandoning your pledge not to raise taxes."" However, other conservative voices, including veteran Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, have questioned whether the Norquist pledge remains politically relevant in the face of the mounting federal debt and Obama's re-election. William Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, said after the November 6 vote that Republicans should consider going along with the president's call for making the wealthy pay higher taxes, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""it wouldn't kill the country."" On the same program, GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said ""the yin and the yang of this is that we know there has to be revenues."" ""I haven't met a wealthy Republican or Democrat in Tennessee that's not willing to contribute more as long as they know we solve the problem,"" Corker noted, adding that reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare, the government-run health care system for senior citizens, was another key part of the package. Norquist and other conservatives argue that shrinking the government is the only way to properly address the deficit issue. Their mantra is that America spends too much on government, not that it collects too little in taxes. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge says the signer will ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses"" and will ""oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" Deficit reduction? Not without entitlement reform . That commitment puts any adherents in conflict with the direction of the deficit negotiations under way between the White House and Congress. At the Center for the National Interest on Monday, Norquist predicted that Republicans would prevent any deficit deal from containing a tax increase. Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans, the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks, agrees to the concept of increased revenue, though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates. Instead, they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue. Chambliss, whose voting record got a perfect rating in 2010 from the American Conservative Union, has played a supporting role in the deficit debate. He joined colleagues from both parties in the so-called Gang of Six senators trying to work out a comprehensive deal on the sidelines of the main talks between the White House and Congress. Last year, Norquist's group called at one point for Chambliss and the other two Republicans to drop out of the Gang of Six talks that were considering increased tax revenue as part of the deal. Norquist later sent a letter to Chambliss and GOP colleagues Coburn and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming to clarify that their stance met the conditions of the pledge because they wanted any increase in revenue to come from economic growth spurred by lower tax rates. ""This is very encouraging news from you,"" Norquist wrote then. ""It means that you will fulfill the Taxpayer Protection Pledge you made to your constituents and the American people to oppose and vote against legislated net income tax increases.""

"The federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown, as House Speaker John Boehner told a group of fellow GOP legislators that he won't let the nation default on its debt, according to a House Republican. Boehner said that he'd set aside the ""Hastert Rule"" -- that Republicans would only bring measures up for a vote if they are backed by a majority of their caucus -- and rely on Democrats to pass a measure to raise the nation's debt limit, said the House member. This legislator attended a meeting Wednesday involving Boehner, but requested anonymity because that gathering was private. Congressional Republicans remain divided on how to structure legislation to raise the government's borrowing level. And an aide to the House speaker downplayed the development, saying, ""Boehner has always said the United States will not default on its debt, so that's not news."" Still, at least one Democrat -- Sen. Charles Schumer of New York -- cheered the prospect of the GOP leader refusing to block at least this measure that President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats strongly support. ""This could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous, and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief."" The Ohio Republican's vow comes exactly two weeks before the government is set to run out of money to cover its roughly $16.7 trillion debt, unless Congress agrees to lift the so-called debt ceiling. That had long been routine in Washington -- until recently, that is, when conservative Republicans have pushed not to allow more borrowing without significant cuts. Boehner himself wrote earlier this week in USA Today that ""there is no way Congress can or should pass (a debt ceiling hike) without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit and help get our economy moving again."" He accused President Barack Obama of refusing to negotiate; Obama and fellow Democratic leaders have since said they are open to talks on any and all budgetary matters, but only after the government is reopened. Yet Boehner's comments signal that, at least on the debt ceiling issue, he's willing to allow a vote on a measure backed by top Democrats but not most Republicans in his chamber -- something he's refused to do with a Senate-passed measure to reopen the federal government, without any add-ons. Chief among those Democrats is Obama who, for all his strong rhetoric on ending the government shutdown, has said that avoiding a federal debt default is an even bigger necessity. He's insisted Congress pass such a measure, as is, without tying it to anything else. ""As reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,"" the president said in a speech Thursday in Rockville, Maryland. ""There will be no negotiations over this."" Obama challenges Boehner to allow 'yes-or-no vote' on shutdown . While Boehner's comments suggest hope toward some common resolution on the debt ceiling, the government shutdown is another matter entirely. The two sides appeared no closer to an agreement Thursday, the third day of the shutdown that comes because Congress failed to agree on a budget plan to send to President Barack Obama. In fact, they appeared to dig in -- insisting their approach is best and that the other was to blame for the 800,000 workers at risk of furloughs, shuttering of national parks, loss of funding for various programs and other effects of the shutdown. A conservative GOP wing has demanded that any spending measure include provisions to dismantle or defund Obamacare, which became law in 2010 and was upheld by the Supreme Court last year. As he's done before, Obama on Thursday challenged Boehner to stop what he called Republicans ""reckless"" strategy of refusing to pass the ""clean"" spending bill -- which doesn't have provisions targeting the president's signature health care reform, the Affordable Care Act, like several passed by the GOP-led House --  and instead pushing measures to fund popular programs on a one-by-one basis. The shutdown: Personal stories from Americans on the edge . The president said the spending initiative passed by the Democratic-led Senate would pass the House with support from Democrats and some Republicans, except that Boehner won't allow the vote. ""The only thing that is keeping the government shut down, the only thing preventing people from going back to work, and basic research starting back up, and farmers and small-business owners getting their loans -- the only thing that's preventing all that from happening right now today, in the next five minutes, is that Speaker John Boehner won't even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party,"" Obama said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was part of the Democratic chorus Thursday, accusing Boehner of reneging on an agreement to let the House vote on a ""clean"" spending package of $988 billion, $70 billion less than Democrats wanted). Boehner went back on that deal, Reid surmised in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, because he feared fellow Republicans would turn on him and oust him from his position as House speaker. ""His job is not as important as our country,"" Reid said. ""... He has to have some courage."" Reid jabs Boehner, says he reneged on deal . Cantor: GOP should stand its ground . GOP Rep. Michael Grimm said Thursday night that ""very, very arrogant and very obstinate"" remarks by Reid and what he calls a lack of needed leadership from Obama undermines the chances of reaching a deal. ""If you're going to be insulted ..., and if you're going to be spoken down to, and there's going to be this air of arrogance, you're only going to make things worse,"" Grimm, of New York, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. While Grimm and a few other moderate Republicans have backed a ""clean"" spending bill without anti-Obamacare provisions, some of his colleagues in the House say the party won't budge from their strategy. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, for one, described his caucus as ""very unified"" and said Reid and Obama are ""confused"" if they think ""we're going to fold and let them win on everything."" In fact, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor wrote in a memo that it's the positions of Obama and other Democrats that are ""untenable."" House Republicans would continue passing piecemeal funding measures for popular programs such as veterans affairs, national parks and medical research to keep up pressure on Senate Democrats who refuse to consider such measures in the ongoing stalemate, Cantor's memo said. ""While no one can predict with certainty how the current shutdown will be resolved, I am confident that if we keep advancing common-sense solutions to the problems created by the shutdown that Senate Democrats and President Obama will eventually agree to meaningful discussions that would allow us to ultimately resolve this impasse,"" Cantor said in the memo that a GOP source made available to CNN. A conversation between two conservative GOP senators showed Republicans think they can win the debate. In the comments caught by live microphone, tea party-backed Sen. Rand Paul told his Kentucky Republican colleague, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, that continuing to hammer Democrats for refusing to consider GOP proposals would eventually succeed. Proposal from moderates . Meanwhile, two moderate House members -- one Republican and one Democrat -- proposed a compromise Thursday that would fund the government for six months while eliminating a tax on medical devices in the health care reforms. Senate Democrats quickly rejected the idea because it would link the health care reform provision to the need to fund the government now while extending deep mandatory budget cuts they oppose for half of the new fiscal year. GOP moderates huddle as conservatives set agenda . Instead, Obama -- who canceled a trip to Brunei and Indonesia for this weekend's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit because of the ongoing shutdown -- and other Democrats have said they want to negotiate a broad budget deal that could include tax reforms and other matters. But they're only willing to engage in such talks after the government reopens. This already slogging debate over what to do about the crisis ground to a halt Thursday because of something that, at first glance, did not directly involve any of the legislators on Capitol Hill, even if it did hit very close to home. A chase that began at a White House security checkpoint ended near the U.S. Capitol Hill when authorities opened fire on a car containing a woman and a child, an intelligence source told CNN. Two police officers suffered injuries in the ordeal, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The female driver -- who didn't fire any shots herself, according to multiple sources -- died of gunshot wounds. The House and Senate were both put on lockdown, with no one allowed to leave or enter Capitol Hill buildings and everyone urged to steer clear of windows and doorways, for about an hour. Not long after, Democrats and Republicans reconvened on the House floor and, in a rare show of unanimity, thanked the responding officers. Then they resumed their normal business -- which, if the past few weeks is any indication, meant more blame and little agreement on how to bring the government back on line.","Obama cancels a trip to the APEC summit because of the shutdown .

"(CNN)Magazines and websites regularly rank Peachtree City, Georgia, as one of the best places to live and raise a family.  The community's trademark: Residents putter around in golf carts on the community's 90-plus miles of paved pathways. But on the first day of 2015, the town of 35,000 people south of Atlanta was known for something else. The man tasked with keeping the peace in Peachtree City, Police Chief William McCollom, was being investigated in a shooting that left his wife in critical condition. Authorities aren't revealing many details, but they said McCollom shot Margaret McCollom with his service Glock 9mm a few hours before dawn inside the couple's bedroom. The chief told 911 it was an accident, said Sherry Lang, spokeswoman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. No charges have been filed. Margaret McCollom was taken by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition, according to a statement from police spokesman Lt. Mark Brown. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said at a press conference that he won't decide whether charges should be filed until the GBI presents him with an investigation report. ""We have no leanings one way or the other at this point because we just don't know,"" Ballard said. ""As soon as all the facts are known they'll turn over a file to our office, and we'll review to see if in fact there's been any criminal activity."" McCollom is fully cooperating with authorities, Lang said. He's the one who called 911. Margaret McCollom has not been interviewed, she said. Chief McCollom was placed on administrative leave. Lang declined to comment when asked whether alcohol played a part in the incident, saying that's part of the investigation that cannot be revealed yet. Lang said the investigation determined that Margaret McCollom was shot once. ""The initial reports that we got from a 911 call were that the chief had shot his wife, accidentally, twice. As a result of our preliminary interview, we have found that he only shot her one time,"" she said. Brown said Peachtree City officers were called to the home at 4:17 a.m. and immediately realized it was their boss's house. The GBI was quickly called in to lead the investigation. Brown said he knew of no previous disciplinary actions against the chief. McCollom was well-liked by officers in the department, Brown said. He said his co-workers are worried about the chief and his wife. ""The department is hurting at this point,"" Brown said. McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, reported CNN affiliate WSB.","No charges filed; DA says he will await investigative report .

"Trayvon Martin walked into a 7-Eleven in Sanford, Florida, grabbing a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona iced tea. The hood from his dark gray sweatshirt over his head, he walked up to the counter, reached deep into his pants' pockets, paid the clerk, then walked out. This seemingly mundane act, captured on a surveillance video, would be the last image the 17-year-old's loved ones would have of him alive. While questions still remain, what happened next to Martin on the night of February 26 became clearer on Thursday with the release of scores of pages of investigative and medical examiner's reports, in addition to new images of Martin's shooter and the 7-Eleven video. Martin didn't live in Sanford, a central Florida city of about 53,000 people. Yet by that winter night, he'd been there for seven days, after being suspended for the third time from Dr. Michael M. Krop High School in Miami, in this instance, for 10 days after drug residue was found in his backpack, according to records obtained by the Miami Herald. His father Tracy had taken his son four hours away from home because neither he or Trayvon Martin's mother wanted the teen to stay in his hometown where he could enjoy time with his friends, family friend and former football coach Jerome Horton recalled later. That Sunday night, Martin was supposed to be getting a snack and heading back to the Sanford home of his father's fiance. It was on that walk back that he encountered George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer. Some details as to Martin's thought process around that time may someday be gleaned from what he told his girlfriend back in Miami in a cell phone conversation, his family's lawyers said. The boyfriend and girlfriend spoke at 7:12 p.m. Zimmerman's voice, meanwhile, comes through on a 911 call he made around that time, telling a dispatcher about ""a real suspicious guy."" ""This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. It's raining, and he's just walking around."" The dispatcher asked Zimmerman, who'd called 911 at least four times previously for other incidents, if he was following the person. He replies, ""Yes."" ""OK. We don't need you to do that,"" the dispatcher responded. But Zimmerman followed him anyway. What happened next is a matter of dispute. Martin and Zimmerman were obviously in the middle of it, but no one else saw all that happened. One witness later told police that ""she heard a commotion, which sounded like arguing,"" while another mentioned ""loud talking."" And on one 911 call, placed by a neighbor, a police sergeant counted one man yelling ""help!"" or ""help me!"" 14 times in a span of 38 seconds. Who was yelling? When the 911 calls were later played back for him and he was asked if they were from his son, an emotional Tracy Martin ""quietly responded 'no'."" But an FBI analysis, also detailed on Thursday, said it couldn't be determined whose voice it was due to the ""extreme emotional state"" of whomever was yelling, a lack of words from which to compare, overlapping voices and ""insufficient voice quality"" on the recording. The same analysis also didn't reach conclusions as to whether Zimmerman used a racial epithet to describe Martin on his own 911 call, as some have alleged. Martin's family have said they believe Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, profiled the African-American teen. Numerous witnesses, however, did clearly hear a gunshot. It came from Zimmerman's black, 9mm semiautomatic hand gun. The bullet went into Martin's left chest and lodged there. Police headed to the neighborhood after Zimmerman's initial 911 call, but didn't arrive until after the fatal shot. They found Martin ""face down in the grass."" A sergeant checked and couldn't find a pulse. For the next six minutes, he and another police officer teamed up to conduct CPR on the teen. A plastic bag, brought by a neighbor, was used to seal his chest wound. Firefighters and EMS from the Sanford Fire Department arrived at 7:27 p.m., to continue efforts to try to save him. Three minutes later, at 7:30 p.m., Martin was pronounced dead. Aside from a small scratch on one finger, that gunshot wound was the only apparent injury the teenager suffered. A medical examiner's report later found trace elements of THC, an element of marijuana, in his system, though experts pointed out the challenge in equating the levels found with Martin's level of intoxication at the time of his death. One officer who lifted Martin's shirt at the scene ""felt a large, cold can in the center pocket"" of the teen's hoodie, which was the iced tea he'd bought just minutes before. Blood was later spotted on his Skittles, along with a lighter, a T-Mobile brand cell phone, headphones and $40 and some change. A witness told police that, after the gunshot, she saw a ""larger"" man standing over Martin. Police who arrived described the shooter, Zimmerman, as compliant in answering their questions and willingly putting on handcuffs. He had blood on his nose -- with one officer saying it appeared ""broken,"" while noting ""swelling"" of his face -- and, as photographs showed, blood on the back of his head. His back was wet and soiled, as if he'd been in grass. Zimmerman claimed that Martin had attacked him, hitting him in the nose and knocking him back into the pavement. It was only then, in self-defense, that he'd taken out his gun and shot the teen, he said. Tests, the results of which were made public Thursday, would show evidence of Zimmerman's hands on the firearm, but not Martin's. An analysis of scrapings from underneath the teenager's fingernails did not contain any of Zimmerman's DNA, as might rub off in the case of a prolonged struggle. At the scene, Zimmerman declined to be transported to the hospital despite his apparent injuries. A police officer reiterated that offer after Zimmerman complained his head hurt and he felt lightheaded while being driven to the Sanford Police Department. But again he turned it down. While at the police station, Zimmerman requested some tissues, water and to go to the bathroom, but little else. He ended up turning over his clothes to police but, after being questioned and putting on a change of clothes brought in by his wife, he headed home. Tracy Martin, meanwhile, didn't know where his son was. He filed a missing person's complaint on the morning of February 27, telling authorities that his son hadn't returned from going to the store the previous evening. Police then showed Tracy Martin a picture taken from the crime scene, and he confirmed the dead teenager was, in fact, Trayvon. As to Zimmerman, he remained in limbo for weeks. Police had declined to arrest him that night, saying there wasn't enough evidence to refute his self-defense claim. But the investigation continued. In a capias request, a request that someone be taken into custody, on March 13, police described what happened as ""ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern. ""There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity."" On April 11, special prosecutor Angela Corey announced that Zimmerman was being charged with second-degree murder. He was subsequently arrested and, eventually, released on bail. The start of his scheduled trial has not yet been set.","George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin on February 26 .

"Baseball superstar Alex Rodriguez isn't going down without a fight. But in the process, the slugger may have let out a dirty little secret. Tucked deep in the lawsuit Rodriguez filed Monday against Major League Baseball to get his suspension vacated is an exhaustive report about his alleged steroid use. And boy, is it detailed. The report alleges injections of  banned drugs, secret meetings and big money payments. Part of the 34-page document details Rodriguez's alleged cocktail of banned substances to the milligram. Some of these accusations have leaked out in recent days as Rodriguez's fight with baseball has gotten uglier and uglier. But this report, compiled by arbitrator Fredric Horowitz, is a graphic look at the case against Rodriguez. Trying to save his career . Rodriguez filed his lawsuit Monday in New York's Southern District against Major League Baseball in an effort to get back on the field. Two days earlier, an arbitration panel ruled that he would serve a 162-game doping suspension, the longest in baseball history. So Rodriguez sued league Commissioner Bud Selig and even his own union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. In the lawsuit, Rodriguez's lawyers say the actions against the slugger have been a ""carefully orchestrated smear campaign"" and the suspension should be vacated. The lawsuit also alleges that the baseball union did not protect Rodriguez from continual leaks of ""prejudicial information"" from baseball officials. The player's union has denied that allegation. ""It is unfortunate that Alex Rodriguez has chosen to sue the Players Association. His claim is completely without merit, and we will aggressively defend ourselves and our members from these baseless charges,"" said Tony Clark, head of the union. Aging slugger . All this comes as the clock is ticking for A-Rod. The suspension will not only cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary, it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who'll turn 40 in the 2015 season. Major League Baseball says Rodriguez is dirty. It says he used three different performance-enhancing drugs in a three-year period and had ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic in South Florida. Biogenesis was an anti-aging clinic that MLB said supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players. Rodriguez, fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, says he didn't use performance-enhancing drugs at that time. He says he has not failed a drug test. In court documents, his lawyers accused Horowitz of being unfair. ""Horowitz exhibited a manifest disregard for the law,"" the lawsuit alleged. ""He did so in a way which ensured such testimony would be selective and one-sided."" Gummies and food . The Horowitz report seemed to be mostly based on Rodriguez's relationship with Anthony Bosch, who ran the Biogenesis clinic. The two were introduced by Rodriguez's cousin in 2009 or 2010, according to the report. By late 2010, Rodriguez was a client of Bosch, paying thousands of dollars for banned substances, the report says. The two became close. They created their own language to camouflage the performance-enhancing drugs. Testosterone cream was called ""pink food,"" and lozenges containing testosterone were called ""gummies."" Melted testosterone was called ""liquid soup."" In 2012, the pair spoke on the phone 53 times and exchanged 556 text messages, the report said. In one exchange, detailed in the report, Bosch messaged Rodriguez, saying he was going to pick up his ""meds."" Rodriguez wrote back: ""Not meds, dude. Food."" In another message Rodriguez warns Bosch:  ""Erase all these messages."" Clearly, somebody didn't.","Lawsuit contains a 34-page report with doping allegations .

"Rolling Stone magazine apologized Friday for discrepancies in an article about the alleged gang rape of a University of Virginia student, after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details. Rolling Stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly ""orchestrated the attack on 'Jackie' (the woman who was the subject of the article) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,"" a decision the magazine says it now regrets. ""In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,"" Rolling Stone said. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that ""the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story."" University of Virginia pledges zero-tolerance in rape cases . The article chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault. It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said in a statement Friday. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN email and fraternity records are proof. Warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser's account. For example, the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity, the fraternity house has no side staircase, and there were no pledges at that time of year. Jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on, asking, ""Don't you want to be a brother?"" ""It's not part of our culture,"" Warthen said. ""It's just not true."" Jackie also described her alleged attacker as a fellow lifeguard at the university pool. The fraternity's UVA chapter said an internal investigation found no member who worked at the Aquatic and Fitness Center at the time of the alleged attack. ""We have no knowledge of these alleged acts being committed at our house or by our members,"" the chapter statement said. ""Anyone who commits any form of sexual assault, wherever or whenever, should be identified and brought to justice."" Members of the fraternity were contacted by the author of the Rolling Stone article but provided no information ""because they had none to provide,"" fraternity spokeswoman Pam Fitzgerald said in a statement. She said the members were shocked and surprised by the allegations, and that they were never contacted by fact-checkers at the magazine. The chapter said it is working with the Charlottesville Police Department as it investigates the allegations. The Washington Post reported Friday that a group of Jackie's close friends ""believe something traumatic happened to her, but they also have come to doubt her account"" because details have changed over time. Jackie stands by her story, the Post also reported. ""I never asked for this"" attention, Jackie told the newspaper. ""What bothers me is that so many people act like it didn't happen. It's my life. I have had to live with the fact that it happened every day for the last two years."" Rolling Stone's scathing report, detailing not just Jackie's graphic allegation of being raped and brutalized at a fraternity party, but also UVA's supposed indifference to victims of sexual assault, stirred a firestorm on the campus. At a recent emergency meeting of UVA's governing board, Rector George Keith Martin said, ""To Jackie and her parents, I say I am sorry. To the survivors of sexual assault and their families, I am also sorry."" The board unanimously adopted a resolution affirming a zero-tolerance approach toward rape and sexual assault cases, though what exactly that means remains to be seen. ""This type of conduct will not be tolerated at the University of Virginia,"" Martin said. ""The status quo is no longer acceptable."" In the wake of the Rolling Stone article's publication, UVA also suspended all fraternities' activities until after the winter break.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a 2010 Pentagon budget Monday that reflects major changes in the ""scope and significance"" of Defense Department priorities. One of the high-profile programs on the chopping block is the . Air Force's most expensive fighter, the  F-22 Raptor. The proposed budget cuts several traditional big-ticket items while investing in programs designed to bolster the military's ability to wage an ongoing conflict against terrorists and other extremist elements in multiple regions at the same time. Gates acknowledged that parts of the budget are likely to run into significant opposition on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are concerned in part about preserving valuable defense contracts for their districts and states. ""This is a reform budget, reflecting lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Gates said. ""There's no question that a lot of these decisions will be controversial."" He called on Congress to ""rise above parochial interests and consider what is in the best interests of the nation as a whole."" House Armed Service Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, acknowledged that congressmen have concerns about job losses in their home districts but said that ultimately, ""the national interest overrides anything."" ""The buck stops with us,"" he said. ""We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us."" Three key priorities are reflected in the changes, Gates said. The priorities are a stronger institutional commitment to the military's all-volunteer force, a decision to ""rebalance"" defense programs to better fight current and future conflicts, and ""fundamental overhauls"" of the military's procurement, acquisition and contracting process. Among other things, Gates called for production of the Air Force's most expensive fighter, the F-22 Raptor, to be phased out by fiscal year 2011. He also called for terminating a proposed fleet of 23 presidential helicopters estimated to cost more than $13 billion. The proposed fleet, he noted, was originally projected to cost $6.5 billion. It ""has fallen six years behind schedule and runs the risk of not delivering the requested capability,"" he said. Gates maintained that a new fleet of presidential helicopters will still ultimately be necessary, however.  See a list of winners, losers and break-even programs » . At the same time, he said he did not want to pursue a development program for a new Air Force bomber ""until we have a better understanding of the need, the requirement and the technology."" Gates did request 50 Predator and Reaper-class unmanned aerial vehicles by fiscal year 2011, translating to a 62 percent increase in capability over the current level and 127 percent from a year ago. The Predator has been used extensively by the military in operations along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Turning to the military's overall troop levels, Gates proposed spending an additional $11 billion to complete a planned expansion of the Army and Marine Corps while halting reductions in the Air Force and Navy. A planned 547,000 troop increase, while capping the growth of Army brigade combat teams at 45 as opposed to a previously discussed level of 48, will be sufficient to ""ensure that we have better manned units ready to employ and help put an end to the routine use of stop-loss,"" Gates maintained. ""This step will also lower the risk of hollowing the force,"" he said. Gates also proposed a reduction in the use of support service contractors from 39 percent of the Pentagon work force to a pre-2001 level of 26 percent. The contractors, Gates added, would be replaced with full-time government employees. To help create a more mobile, flexible force, Gates proposed boosting special operations personnel by 2,800, or 5 percent, as well as purchasing aircraft designed to provide greater lift mobility and rapid transportation of those forces. Among other things, he cited a proposed increase in the purchase of ""littoral combat ships, a key capability for presence, stability and counterinsurgency operations in coastal regions,"" from two to three ships. The Pentagon's ultimate goal, he said, is to acquire 55 of these ships. Another $500 million is directed toward boosting ""global partnership capacity efforts"" through enhanced initiatives for ""training and equipping foreign militaries to undertake counterterrorism and stability operations."" In what may prove to be one of the most controversial aspects of his proposed budget, Gates announced the cancellation or reduction of key elements of the Pentagon's missile defense system, including the installation of additional ground-based interceptor missiles in Alaska. The proposed overall missile defense system budget was trimmed by $1.4 billion. A bipartisan group of senators released a letter during Gates' announcement that urged him ""not to allow deep cuts in U.S. missile defense programs that are critically important to protecting our homeland and our allies against the growing threat of ballistic missiles."" ""The threat from ballistic missiles is significant and on the rise. [It] has been underscored by Iran and North Korea's recent missile tests,"" they argued. The letter was signed by both senators from Alaska -- Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Mark Begich -- among others. Although Gates was initially appointed Pentagon chief by former President George W. Bush, his overall budget received what appeared to be a mixed reception from congressional Republicans. ""Republicans appreciate Secretary Gates' effort to shape the Department of Defense so that we more effectively fight the wars our troops are engaged in today. However, we are concerned about the tradeoffs involved in re-balancing the Department,"" New York Rep. John McHugh, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services committee, said in a written statement. ""It remains the Congress' responsibility to provide for the common defense,"" he warned. Former Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, however, said Gates' budget ""is a major step in the right direction."" ""It has long been necessary to shift spending away from weapon systems plagued by scheduling and cost overruns to ones that strike the correct balance between the needs of our deployed forces and the requirements for meeting the emerging threats of tomorrow,"" he said. ""I believe Secretary Gates' decision is key to ensuring that the defense establishment closes the gap between the way it supports current operations and the way it prepares for future conventional threats."" Georgia Republicans slammed President Obama for Gates' announcement about the phase-out of the F-22 Raptor, which is assembled in Cobb County, Georgia. Rep. Tom Price, whose district includes the Raptor production facility, called the cut ""outrageous"" and said Obama's ""priorities are deeply flawed."" Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss said he was ""disappointed"" in the cuts and accused the administration of being ""willing to sacrifice the lives of American military men and women for the sake of domestic programs."" Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, was also dismissive of the F-22 phase-out, although he said he generally supported Gates' moves to modernize the military. Some F-22 production takes place in Connecticut as well. The proposed overall fiscal year 2010 Defense Department budget is almost $534 billion, or nearly $664 billion when including the costs of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The current Pentagon budget totals slightly over $513 billion, or almost $655 billion including the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.

"The costs of your airline travel will rise a little today, thanks to the federal government. Airline passenger security fees charged by the Transportation Security Administration are increasing because of the congressional budget deal passed in December. The September 11 passenger security fee has traditionally been collected to fund the TSA's airport security measures, but not this time. Most of the new revenue will go to pay down the federal deficit. Until Monday, a passenger was charged $2.50 for each leg of a journey. For a nonstop round trip, the cost was $5. For a round trip with a connection each way, the cost was $10. The fee was capped at two flights each way. That means you couldn't get charged more than $5 each way or $10 round trip, even if you took three flights to get your destination. Now, passengers must pay a flat fee of $5.60 in each direction, no matter how many plane transfers are made to get from one city to another. For passengers flying a nonstop round trip, that means the fee will increase from $5 to $11.20. Passengers flying round-trip with a connection each way will see their fees increase $1.20 to $11.20 per round trip, versus $10 before the fee increase. There's one exception: If you book that terrible trip with a long layover, meaning at least four hours when traveling domestically or 12 hours when traveling internationally, the fees start over. Passengers with that much of a stopover between their flights will have to pay another $5.60 for the next leg. The TSA's interpretation of the fee increase has been called into question. Though the TSA says the congressional budget deal eliminated caps on these fees, top congressional budget writers say that's not true. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, have written the TSA demanding an explanation. The trade group Airlines for America has generally objected to government raising more funds from airline passenger travel and specifically objected to this fee increase and the elimination of the fee cap. ""Our government must stop using airlines and their passengers as its own personal ATM whenever it needs more money,"" according to a statement. ""A4A strongly opposes TSA's elimination of the regulatory regime that rejects congressional intent by removing the cap on the TSA fee increase per enplanement as it will disproportionately harm airline passengers who rely on service to small and rural communities."" Who will pay the fee? Though there's a chance the airlines could absorb some of the cost, don't bet on it. Southwest Airlines added the fee to its list of taxes and fees charged to customers starting today. ""Effective for bookings starting on July 21, 2014, all domestic air carriers are required to implement an increase in the government-imposed September 11th passenger security fee,"" Southwest spokesman Nick Blampye wrote in an e-mail. ""The fee increased from $2.50 per segment (with a maximum of $10.00 per round-trip) to $5.60 per one-way trip,"" Blampye said. ""Southwest customers can view a complete fare breakdown at the time of purchase, which includes the current security fee."" Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which both declined to comment, also appear to be putting the entire cost on passengers. A flight search Monday at Delta.com showed a charge of $11.20 for a nonstop round-trip flight from Atlanta to New York's LaGuardia Airport. So did a United.com search for a nonstop round-trip flight from Atlanta to San Francisco. Want to comment on the new rule?

"This is what an ISIS rout looks like in Iraq: . Up to 300 troops killed. Others missing, possibly dead or having fled. Dozens of military vehicles, from tanks to ambulances, destroyed or seized. And the Iraqi military in disarray, so much so the country's Prime Minister has sent ""anti-terrorism forces ... to hold the negligent (military) leaders responsible."" What happened Sunday east of Falluja, around military encampments in Saqlawiyah and Sejar, is bad enough for the Iraqi government. Yet what makes it worse is that it's happened before. This latest incident was particularly galling because, according to surviving Iraqi soldiers, military commanders didn't follow up on troops' pleas for airstrikes or other help, and instead stranded them. And the fact this isn't an isolated episode raises big questions about whether the Iraqi military is up to the fight against ISIS and whether other nations -- the United States being chief among them -- should devote manpower and air power to supporting them. Bill Roggio -- the editor of the Long War Journal, which provides information and analysis on terrorists and efforts to combat them -- said Thursday that those who believe Iraqi troops, like moderate Syrian opposition forces, can beat back ISIS fighters on the ground, on their own, are in ""for a very rude awakening."" ""I think the events since the Islamic State invasion,"" said Roggio -- using the term that ISIS calls itself -- ""have shown the Iraqi military is incapable of going toe-to-toe (with ISIS)."" Iraq's military has been overrun before . ISIS, which is also sometimes referred to as ISIL or DAIISH, isn't new to the fighting game. It emerged in the early 2000s as al Qaeda in Iraq, developing a grisly reputation for attacking U.S. and allied forces, assassinating officials and beheading hostages. A U.S.-led push significantly weakened the Islamist extremist group, which contains some former members of ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's military, but didn't wipe it out entirely. Instead, the group was reborn as ISIS, then the Islamic State, with a new mission to control as much territory as possible under its strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. In many ways, ISIS has succeeded. It took advantage of instability in Syria to take large swaths of that country. And the group advanced into Iraq, bringing with it its brutal tactics of killing men, women and children who didn't subscribe to its extreme beliefs or just got in the way. Iraq, though, wasn't supposed to be Syria. It's not in the middle of a bloody, complicated, years-long civil war. It has a large military that is not being challenged by opposition forces on all sides. And, in theory, this armed forces should be somewhat battle-tested from the 2000s. Yet Iraq's military hasn't always fared well against ISIS. The most glaring example came in June, when soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Militants overrun Mosul, as Iraqi soldiers flee . Since then, a lot has changed. Chief among them: International forces have gotten involved. A U.S.-led coalition has conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq, and more recently in Syria, while calling on allied Iraqi troops to do their part on the ground to turn back the terrorist group. But one thing that hasn't necessarily changed much is the Iraqi military's capability to do just that -- as this week's incident showed. Soldiers: No response to requests for help . In a statement, ISIS explained that its mobilized fighters overran an Iraqi military checkpoint, destroyed several tanks and cut off the Iraqi military's supply routes. Then, its attack really began. An injured Iraqi man -- apparently recounting the ordeal in a video posted to YouTube, though his account couldn't wholly be confirmed by CNN -- said he was stationed with eight other soldiers on a school's rooftop when he saw two black Humvees drive in and several men, all dressed in black, get out. ""Thinking it was Iraqi special forces, I called my commander ... and he said, 'Let me check,'"" the man said. The men in black weren't Iraqi special forces. The Iraqi soldier said he eventually engaged the men, claiming he killed four militants before getting shot himself. He stayed there for hours, waiting for support. ""From 2:30 a.m. until 10 a.m., no one came to help us,"" the man said, claiming he kept calling his commander. ""... No one responded, and they sent us nothing."" Another man who said he is an Iraqi soldier, featured in a video posted Sunday to YouTube, described how militants blew up two Humvees. (ISIS credited one of these blasts to a Saudi man who detonated an armored vehicle with two tons of explosives.) This second Iraqi soldier said he alerted an Iraqi military leader about the suicide bombing. ""He said, 'Yes, yes, air support is on its way,'"" he added. ""Since I made the call to him until I reached (a) base about three hours later, I did not see a single plane."" Two senior Iraqi senior security officials in Ramadi told CNN that 113 troops died in the ISIS attack on the Sejar military base and the fate of 78 others is unknown. Iraqi security forces tried, but failed, to deliver food and water to nearly 300 more stranded Iraqi soldiers, the officials said. ISIS, meanwhile, claimed that nearly 300 Iraqi troops were killed in the onslaught. It also reported destroying 65 Iraqi military vehicles, including 41 Humvees, and seizing 37 others. Can Iraqi forces defeat ISIS on the ground? The whole ordeal spurred Haider al-Abadi -- who, as Iraq's Prime Minister, is also commander in chief of its military -- to issue ""orders to detain and interrogate the army commanders of the regiments who showed negligence,"" according to a statement issued through his military spokesman. Al-Abadi also called for reinforcements and supplies to the affected area, as well as intensified airstrikes. ""The ... commander praises the sacrifices made by the security forces stationed in combat positions and defending the homeland against terrorists, noting the battle with ISIS will end in victory, God willing, for Iraq and its people,"" the statement said. ""And ISIS will be defeated at the hands of the brave men of our security forces."" Not everyone agrees -- at least given how things stand now on the ground. Roggio notes ISIS has managed to defeat Iraqi troops, Syrian troops, other anti-government fighters in Syria, ""and they've done it all at the same time."" One big thing these militants have going for them, especially compared to Iraq's military, is their ruthlessness and drive. ""It's a level of commitment the Iraqi forces don't display,"" Roggio said. ""You can't coach aggressiveness."" Yet the United States and others are counting on what U.S. Rear Adm. John Kirby called ""competent partners on the ground"" to finish off ISIS and keep it at bay. He characterized the Iraqi security forces capabilities Thursday as ""a mix,"" with some doing well and others not. But even if there are failures, that doesn't mean American combat troops will be fighting in Iraq anytime soon. ""It's going to be the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish forces,"" said Kirby, who is Pentagon spokesman. ""We're continuing to strike targets in Iraq."" How effective will airstrikes be in ""degrading and destroying"" ISIS, as U.S. officials have repeatedly stated is the end goal? Can local ground forces be counted on to do their part? And how long will this all last? ""We can continue indefinitely,"" said retired U.S. Army Col. Peter Mansoor, a CNN analyst who was Gen. David Petraeus' executive officer in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. ""But (battling militants like ISIS) is like mowing the grass. The grass will come back.""","ISIS fighters attack, overrun Iraqi troops stationed east of Falluja .

"""Mexico on the 17th woohoo!"" ""On a jet plane. Bye bye USA. Hello Mexico."" ""Last day in Mexico ... I could so live here ..."" Judging from social media, not everyone is avoiding Mexico this spring break. And, despite a steady stream of bad press and travel warnings, Mexico is counting on a good year for tourism. Image problem notwithstanding, Mexico has been the top foreign country visited by Americans for more than two decades. Mexico welcomed more than 16 million Americans in 1990, according to the Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. With a few periods of fluctuation in between, that number reached 20 million in 2010, the latest year for which data is available from the U.S. Department of Commerce. ""When you hear about swine flu and the drug war and see grisly photos and stories that go along with them, people look at the country on a whole through that light,"" said Lonely Planet writer Richard Reid, who has been to Mexico 15 times in his 43 years. ""That's not always an accurate representation of the entire country."" The Mexico Tourism Board estimates that 52 million domestic and international tourists will visit the southeastern part of the country in 2012, thanks to growing numbers of visitors from emerging markets and aggressive public relations campaigns to counter the perception that Mexico is unsafe. The southeast consists of resort areas such as Cancun, Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, as well as Mayan cultural destinations, a key area of focus for the tourist board in 2012. Analysts say efforts to direct tourists to the southeast reflect the experience of most visitors to the country who stay away from areas in northern Mexico plagued by cartel-related violence. ""While there are security concerns in certain areas in the country, particularly in the north, travel to traditional tourist destinations along the Mayan Riviera remain safe,"" said Miguel Salazar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning to Americans to avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 Mexican states. No advisory is in effect for Yucatan, Quintana Roo or Campeche, states that make up the Yucatan Peninsula, or for that matter, Mexico City, the nation's capital. ""The fact that tourist destinations along the Mayan Riviera still remain safe is further underscored by the State Department's most recent travel warnings, which shows that not all of Mexico is experiencing increased violence as a result of efforts to confront organized crime,"" Salazar said. That success might not be evident in the news that comes out of Mexico, but the numbers tell a different story: A record-breaking 22.67 million international visitors arrived in 2011, representing a 2% increase from 2010, according to figures provided by the Mexico Tourism Board. That's not to say that bad things don't happen outside the hot zones. In February, 22 Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports during a shore excursion in the Mexico seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco. The State Department warning advises travelers to defer nonessential travel to areas of Jalisco that border the states of Michoacán and Zacatecas. It also recommends exercising caution when traveling at night outside of cities elsewhere in the state. The tour was driving on a remote highway about 15 kilometers (about 9.3 miles) outside Puerto Vallarta when an individual held them up, Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism Board, told CNN. ""I can assure this is an isolated, rare incident that shouldn't have happened,"" he said. ""But at same time, I have to tell you that this is something that could happen anywhere else in the world."" Putting things in context is a large part of Negrete's modus operandi. While many rushed to interpret the State Department's recent expanded travel warning as a blow to Mexico, Lopez Negrete said he welcomed the extent to which it pinpointed areas to avoid with specific descriptions and a map and highlighted others where no travel warning was in effect. And while the State Department's travel warning puts Mexico in the company of Syria, Libya and North Korea, none of those countries is described by the State Department as a place where ""millions of U.S. citizens safely visit"" for study, tourism and business. ""We try to put things within the proper context of making sure people understand that if there are problems in certain pockets of the country, that doesn't mean the major resort destinations and city center destinations are in danger,"" Lopez Negrete said. ""Mexico is a very large country, the size of western Europe, so it's unfair to paint Mexico with such a massively broad stroke,"" Lopez Negrete said in a phone call this week from Germany, where he was representing Mexico in ITB Berlin, the world's biggest travel trade show. It was a sentiment he would repeat later in the week in response to the Texas Department of Public Safety's blanket warning against spring break travel to Mexico, citing drug cartel violence and criminal activity. Texas officials highlighted an increase in murders of U.S. citizens in Mexico and other violent crime concerns. ""The Mexican government has made great strides battling the cartels, and we commend their continued commitment to making Mexico a safer place to live and visit,"" Texas DPS Director Steven C. McCraw said in a statement. ""However, drug cartel violence and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat, even in some resort areas."" This is the third year in a row that Texas has issued the warning, prompting allegations from the World Travel and Tourism Council that it was a ploy to encourage domestic tourism, according to Mexican news outlet Notimex. Last year's announcement prompted similar reaction, with several leading American tourism groups urging Texas to downgrade the warning to an advisory. ""We want to caution consumers against overgeneralizing -- taking isolated events and applying them to the whole country,"" said Lisa Simon, president of tour operator trade group, NTA. ""Mexico is a beautiful destination with incredible adventure and cultural experiences available. We advise Americans to travel with professional tour operators, because they know what's happening in specific areas of the country and can provide safe and secure travel arrangements."" American travel to Mexico has fluctuated over the past few years, coinciding with an overall decline in international travel during the recession, according to U.S. Department of Commerce numbers. Figures from the Mexico Tourism Board indicate that the number of American visitors dropped by 3% overall in 2011. But they consider it a promising sign the number of American visitors in the last four months of 2011 was up 10.6% compared with 2010. The fluctuations prompted Mexico to woo new visitors from outside the United States by building relationships in emerging markets and easing the visa application process with online portals, Lopez Negrete said. Those efforts paid off in record-breaking numbers for 2011, with the biggest growth from emerging markets such as Brazil (66%), Russia (55%) and China (30%). Those gains tend to be overshadowed by media coverage of cartel-related violence and occasional acts of violence toward tourists. Lopez Negrete acknowledges that parts of Mexico should be avoided, which is why the tourism board has focused efforts on driving visitors to southern Mexico with an emphasis on the ""mundo Maya,"" or the Mayan world, and gastronomy tours. The timing couldn't be better with doomsday travel ramping up ahead of the alleged Mayan prophecy of the apocalypse. But Lopez Negrete says the push is about diversifying Mexico's appeal. Mexico's indigenous roots and UNESCO-honored cuisine have always been a big part of its culture, he said. Again, it seems to be a matter of changing perceptions. ""We see a great opportunity to share a part of our culture that many visitors don't normally see,"" he said. ""For those who've been to Mexico before, it's a chance to see the country in a new light.""","Mexico says it expects 52 million domestic and foreign tourists to visit southeast region in 2012 .

"The White House late Saturday issued a detailed synopsis, or ""fact sheet,"" of the six-month deal regarding Iran's nuclear program. Read the deal (.PDF) Below is a copy of the agreement's details, verbatim from the White House: . Halting the progress of Iran's program and rolling back key elements . Iran has committed to halt enrichment above 5%: . • Halt all enrichment (above 5% and dismantle the technical connections required to enrich above 5%. Iran has committed to neutralize its stockpile of near-20% uranium: . • Dilute below 5% or convert to a form not suitable for further enrichment its entire stockpile of near-20% enriched uranium before the end of the initial phase. Iran has committed to halt progress on its enrichment capacity: . • Not install additional centrifuges of any type. • Not install or use any next-generation centrifuges to enrich uranium. • Leave inoperable roughly half of installed centrifuges at Natanz and three-quarters of installed centrifuges at Fordow, so they cannot be used to enrich uranium. • Limit its centrifuge production to those needed to replace damaged machines, so Iran cannot use the six months to stockpile centrifuges. • Not construct additional enrichment facilities. 20 questions about the deal . Iran has committed to halt progress on the growth of its 3.5% stockpile: . • Not increase its stockpile of 3.5% low enriched uranium, so that the amount is not greater at the end of the six months than it is at the beginning, and any newly enriched 3.5% enriched uranium is converted into oxide. Iran has committed to no further advances of its activities at Arak and to halt progress on its plutonium track. Iran has committed to: . • Not commission the Arak reactor. • Not fuel the Arak reactor. • Halt the production of fuel for the Arak reactor. • No additional testing of fuel for the Arak reactor. • Not install any additional reactor components at Arak. • Not transfer fuel and heavy water to the reactor site. • Not construct a facility capable of reprocessing. Without reprocessing, Iran cannot separate plutonium from spent fuel. Fareed Zakaria: What critics are getting wrong about the Iran deal . Unprecedented transparency and intrusive monitoring of Iran's nuclear program . Iran has committed to: . • Provide daily access by IAEA inspectors at Natanz and Fordow. This daily access will permit inspectors to review surveillance camera footage to ensure comprehensive monitoring. This access will provide even greater transparency into enrichment at these sites and shorten detection time for any non-compliance. • Provide IAEA access to centrifuge assembly facilities. • Provide IAEA access to centrifuge rotor component production and storage facilities. • Provide IAEA access to uranium mines and mills. • Provide long-sought design information for the Arak reactor. This will provide critical insight into the reactor that has not previously been available. • Provide more frequent inspector access to the Arak reactor. • Provide certain key data and information called for in the Additional Protocol to Iran's IAEA Safeguards Agreement and Modified Code 3.1. One agreement, wildly different reactions . Verification mechanism . The IAEA will be called upon to perform many of these verification steps, consistent with their ongoing inspection role in Iran. In addition, the P5+1 and Iran have committed to establishing a Joint Commission to work with the IAEA to monitor implementation and address issues that may arise. The Joint Commission will also work with the IAEA to facilitate resolution of past and present concerns with respect to Iran's nuclear program, including the possible military dimension of Iran's nuclear program and Iran's activities at Parchin. Limited, temporary, reversible relief . In return for these steps, the P5+1 is to provide limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible relief while maintaining the vast bulk of our sanctions, including the oil, finance, and banking sanctions architecture. If Iran fails to meet its commitments, we will revoke the relief. Specifically the P5+1 has committed to: . • Not impose new nuclear-related sanctions for six months, if Iran abides by its commitments under this deal, to the extent permissible within their political systems. • Suspend certain sanctions on gold and precious metals, Iran's auto sector, and Iran's petrochemical exports, potentially providing Iran approximately $1.5 billion in revenue. • License safety-related repairs and inspections inside Iran for certain Iranian airlines. • Allow purchases of Iranian oil to remain at their currently significantly reduced levels -- levels that are 60% less than two years ago. $4.2 billion from these sales will be allowed to be transferred in installments if, and as, Iran fulfills its commitments. • Allow $400 million in governmental tuition assistance to be transferred from restricted Iranian funds directly to recognized educational institutions in third countries to defray the tuition costs of Iranian students. Opinion: Iran deal a risk worth taking . Humanitarian transactions . Facilitate humanitarian transactions that are already allowed by U.S. law. Humanitarian transactions have been explicitly exempted from sanctions by Congress so this channel will not provide Iran access to any new source of funds. Humanitarian transactions are those related to Iran's purchase of food, agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices; we would also facilitate transactions for medical expenses incurred abroad. We will establish this channel for the benefit of the Iranian people. Putting limited relief in perspective . In total, the approximately $7 billion in relief is a fraction of the costs that Iran will continue to incur during this first phase under the sanctions that will remain in place. The vast majority of Iran's approximately $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions. In the next six months, Iran's crude oil sales cannot increase. Oil sanctions alone will result in approximately $30 billion in lost revenues to Iran -- or roughly $5 billion per month -- compared to what Iran earned in a six month period in 2011, before these sanctions took effect. While Iran will be allowed access to $4.2 billion of its oil sales, nearly $15 billion of its revenues during this period will go into restricted overseas accounts. In summary, we expect the balance of Iran's money in restricted accounts overseas will actually increase, not decrease, under the terms of this deal. Kerry: Israel is safe under new deal . Maintaining economic pressure on Iran and preserving our sanctions architecture . During the first phase, we will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against Iran, including by taking action against those who seek to evade or circumvent our sanctions. • Sanctions affecting crude oil sales will continue to impose pressure on Iran's government. Working with our international partners, we have cut Iran's oil sales from 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in early 2012 to 1 million bpd today, denying Iran the ability to sell almost 1.5 million bpd. That's a loss of more than $80 billion since the beginning of 2012 that Iran will never be able to recoup. Under this first step, the EU crude oil ban will remain in effect and Iran will be held to approximately 1 million bpd in sales, resulting in continuing lost sales worth an additional $4 billion per month, every month, going forward. • Sanctions affecting petroleum product exports to Iran, which result in billions of dollars of lost revenue, will remain in effect. • The vast majority of Iran's approximately $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings remain inaccessible or restricted by our sanctions. • Other significant parts of our sanctions regime remain intact, including: . -- Sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran and approximately two dozen other major Iranian banks and financial actors; . -- Secondary sanctions, pursuant to the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) as amended and other laws, on banks that do business with U.S.-designated individuals and entities; . -- Sanctions on those who provide a broad range of other financial services to Iran, such as many types of insurance; and, . -- Restricted access to the U.S. financial system. • All sanctions on over 600 individuals and entities targeted for supporting Iran's nuclear or ballistic missile program remain in effect. • Sanctions on several sectors of Iran's economy, including shipping and shipbuilding, remain in effect. • Sanctions on long-term investment in and provision of technical services to Iran's energy sector remain in effect. • Sanctions on Iran's military program remain in effect. • Broad U.S. restrictions on trade with Iran remain in effect, depriving Iran of access to virtually all dealings with the world's biggest economy. • All UN Security Council sanctions remain in effect. • All of our targeted sanctions related to Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism, its destabilizing role in the Syrian conflict, and its abysmal human rights record, among other concerns, remain in effect.

"A new buildup of Russian troops along the Ukraine border raised concerns Tuesday that Moscow might be contemplating another intervention like the one that annexed Crimea earlier this year. According to a NATO official, Russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed ""in an area along the entire border with eastern Ukraine."" The buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the last week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there, the official said. It comes a week after the United States and the European Union increased economic sanctions on Russia for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia. In addition, Russia's Defense Ministry is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces. The exercises are taking place in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, roughly 500 miles from the border with Ukraine. Similar military exercises in the region preceded Russia's annexation of Crimea in March, which escalated the Ukraine conflict following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych a month earlier. Donetsk braces for offensive . Meanwhile, Ukraine government security officials said Monday they were preparing for a ""massive assault"" on Donetsk city, state media reported. Inside the city, a rebel stronghold for months, shelling has already pushed some residents underground into cellars and half-built basements. Russia's Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement Monday that the Ukrainian military was firing missiles and using multiple rocket systems in and around the city. It accused Ukraine's government of wanting to continue the war and called for talks to find a political situation to the crisis. With escalated fighting and Ukrainian forces making gains, the Russian deployment at the border could portend an intervention under the banner of a peacekeeping operation. ""On a human scale, the situation in the east -- particularly in Donetsk and Luhansk -- is disastrous. Today, with all certainty, there's a need to speak about a true war,"" Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday. Russian troop buildup . The NATO official said Russian forces gathering at the Ukraine border included a ""spectrum"" of assets: infantry, mechanized divisions, armor, a lot of artillery, conventional and air defense, and special forces and logistics. ""They are very capable Russian regular units and can move in a matter of hours and could significantly disrupt the situation"" in eastern Ukraine, the official said. The Ukrainian government and Western leaders accuse Russia of fomenting instability in its neighbor by arming and supporting the rebels there, which Russia denies. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17 exacerbated the situation. Malaysian plane downed . U.S. and Ukrainian officials allege that a Russian-made missile shot down the plane from rebel-held territory, killing all 298 people on board. Russia and the rebel fighters deny involvement. Earlier this year, Russia amassed about 40,000 troops on the Ukraine border and threatened to invade, NATO said in a fact sheet published last month. Putin then ordered most of the soldiers to return to their bases, leaving about 12,000 of July 11, NATO said. On Tuesday, Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said the Russian deployment now numbered as high as 45,000, and that there had been 26 clashes in the past 24 hours, including six attacks from Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russian combat aircraft crew will practice firing at air and ground targets in unfamiliar territory, the defense ministry said of the military exercises in the region. The maneuvers will involve 100 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers and combat helicopters. In its fact sheet, NATO challenged Russian accusations that the alliance is escalating the crisis in Ukraine by bolstering its support for NATO members in Eastern Europe. ""Over the past months, Russia has also embarked on an unprecedented schedule of no-notice military exercises involving massive numbers of troops and heavy equipment,"" NATO said, adding: ""Russia should explain what its military plans are before it starts accusing others of posing a threat."" Search for remains . An official with knowledge of the MH17 investigation told CNN that a significant part of the crash site was between Ukrainian and separatist front lines, which constantly change. A 17-vehicle convoy of 110 experts accompanied by nine international monitors made it to the site on Tuesday, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said via Twitter. The experts, from the Netherlands, Australia and Malaysia, were hampered in their search efforts Monday by renewed fighting in the area. Monday's search focused in and around the village of Petropavlivka, in the western part of the huge debris field, but the team was unable to complete its mission after an initial delay. They did recover some personal belongings of those on the flight, including photo albums and passports, said Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the Dutch recovery mission. ""Although some access to the crash site has been secured, we still don't have the unimpeded and complete access to the site -- all of it -- that is essential,"" Gary Quinlan, Australia's ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday. In addition, a team of about a dozen U.S. military specialists arrived Tuesday in Kiev to assist the recovery effort, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters. ""They are military; they will not leave Kiev,"" he said, adding that the team includes experts in communications, logistics and other areas that can aid the investigation. ""Recovery operations is something, tragically and unfortunately, the U.S. military has to do and has to be good at,"" Kirby said. Refugees flee conflict . The ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to U.N. officials. The fighting has also forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia. The U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, said Tuesday that the Russian authorities estimate that around 730,000 Ukrainians have sought sanctuary in Russia this year under a visa-free travel program. This includes more than 168,000 who have reported to Russia's Federal Migration Service. UNHCR's European director Vincent Cochetel told journalists in Geneva that about 80% of the Ukrainians who have fled to Russia are staying in border areas, while others are with friends or family in other parts of the country. Many people in eastern Ukraine are Russian-speaking and have strong ties to Russia. At the same time, nearly 118,000 people are reported to be internally displaced, most of them from eastern Ukraine, based on information given to the UNHCR by Ukrainian authorities and local NGOs. ""In the past seven days more than 6,200 people have been forced from their homes,"" Cochetel said. Many have fled with limited possessions, some driven out by the destruction of homes and infrastructure, while others say they fear being caught in the crossfire or suffering persecution. John Ging, operations director of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, called on all sides Tuesday to allow people to move freely and safely. ""The humanitarian situation is deteriorating, and the worrying increase in violence in urban areas puts a greater number of people at risk. ""Until violence is ended, we will continue to see an increase in human suffering, and in the number of people displaced. Immediate action is required to prevent this crisis from worsening,"" he said, according to prepared remarks. Donetsk residents hunker down .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Desperate pleas for food and water forced aid organizations and nations around the world to scramble Wednesday to deliver supplies four days after Typhoon Haiyan flattened areas of the Philippines, where bodies still litter the streets in one devastated province. Rain from a tropical depression grounded some relief flights, while blocked roads and poor conditions at some airports made delivering other aid a difficult proposition, increasing the misery of survivors and raising anxiety. ""I fear anarchy happening in Tacloban City,"" said CNN iReporter Maelene Alcala, who was on vacation in Tacloban where the typhoon struck and was evacuated to Manila. ""It's like survival of the fittest."" Tacloban, the provincial capital of the island of Leyte, was ground zero for the typhoon that struck Friday, leaving the city in ruins and its population of more than 200,000 in desperate conditions. ""The whole scene was like something fresh out of a movie. It was like the end of the world,"" Alcala said. ""...Survivors are walking everywhere carrying sacks of goods they were able to get."" The lack of food and water drove famished survivors to desperate measures. They've taken food and other items from grocery and department stores in Tacloban, where shop owners have organized to defend their goods with deadly force. Authorities have sent police and military reinforcements to try to bring the situation under control. Still, little aid was reaching victims, especially those in remote locations. More than 2 million people need food aid, the Philippine government said. The initial death toll projection of 10,000 was ""too much,"" President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He estimated that the final accounting would more likely be around 2,000 to 2,500. The toll from Typhoon Haiyan -- known in the Philippines as ""Yolanda"" -- grew to 1,833 dead and 2,623 injured, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said Wednesday. At least 84 people are missing, the council said. The number of dead and wounded will likely grow as search and rescue efforts continue. Among the dead, the State Department said Tuesday, were two U.S. citizens. Their identities were not released pending notification of next of kin. Bodies in the streets . Everybody in Tacloban is searching for somebody. A dog led Yan Chow and a search crew to the body of his daughter buried underneath debris in Tacloban. Chow has been looking for his two children and his wife since the storm hit. He was texting with his daughter when the messages suddenly stopped, about the time a massive storm surge is believed to have hit the city. Her body was found not too far from where they found her brother, some distance from their house, Chow told CNN early Wednesday. The children's mother is believed to be buried somewhere nearby, Chow said. Bodies litter the roads. Some are crudely covered in plastic and sheets, others left out in the blazing sun. Many corpses are out of view, mixed up with the rubble spread out as far as the eye can see. Some of them may be buried inside homes covered by mud and debris. Juan Martinez sits underneath a makeshift shack where his home once stood. Nearby, the bodies of his wife and two children are covered by sacks. ""I really want someone to collect their bodies so I know where they are taken,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I want to know where they are taken."" Hundreds of thousands displaced . More than 580,000 people in the Philippines have been displaced in the aftermath of the storm, disaster officials said. Of those, about 286,000 people are being housed in 993 evacuation centers, the officials said. CNN OPEN STORY: Typhoon Haiyan's impact . Aquino defended the pace of relief to some of the hardest hit areas. The typhoon simply overwhelmed the ability of two or three local governments to do their jobs, which include taking care of the initial response, Aquino said. For example, in Tacloban, only 20 of 290 police were available when disaster struck; many were tending to their own families, he said. The national government ""had to replace a lot of the personnel with personnel from other regions to take care of government's vital functions,"" Aquino said. The Philippines Armed Forces has increased troops and military engineers in Tacloban, and the army will fly aid to survivors in remote areas around the city with 11 helicopters and as many trucks. The exodus from the ravaged areas is adding to road congestion, further slowing help from getting in. Help on the way . At least 29 nations or government groups have sent or pledged aid, according to the Philippines government. The aid includes $25 million from the United Nations, $4 million from the European Union, $16 million from Britain and $10 million from the United Arab Emirates, home to a large population of expatriate Filipino workers. In Hong Kong, the U.S. Navy rounded up sailors on shore leave from the USS George Washington and ordered the aircraft carrier's strike group to make ""best speed"" for the Philippines. Its air wings will deliver supplies and medical care to survivors. The Pentagon ordered more Marines from Japan to join the relief effort, and the U.S. Navy was also preparing three amphibious assault ships to head for the region, a senior Pentagon official told CNN. Among other things, such ships can turn seawater into desperately needed potable water. Experts from Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and other organizations, as well as U.N. and U.S. civilian disaster assessment teams, were on the scene. Belgium and Russia sent field hospitals. The European Union sent â‚¬3 million ($4 million) and two Boeing 747 aircraft loaded with supplies. Israel loaded up two 747s with 200 medical personnel and supplies. Difficult deliveries . But it will almost certainly continue to be difficult to get that aid to survivors. Many roads remain blocked, and electricity is out in many areas, making it difficult to operate at night. Complicating matters, a new tropical storm, Zoraida, blew in Tuesday delivering more rain, the Philippine national weather agency PAGASA reported. Zoraida is not a strong storm, but it has dumped just under 4 inches of rain in some places, CNN meteorologists say. It was holding up desperately needed aid in at least one province, Iloilo, where Gov. Arthur Defensor Sr. grounded relief flights until it passed. Zoraida also slowed air aid in the neighboring province of Cebu, an official said, although military planes continued flying at the maximum allowed level of risk there. INTERACTIVE: 'The one building that survived the storm' 'God, thank you for this big miracle' Amid the despair, there were moments of joy. In Cebu, Fritz Anosa was reunited with his parents, who live in the hard-hit city of Guiuan where the storm made its first landfall in the Philippines. They were able to make it onto a Philippines Air Force C-130 making a return flight to deliver aid to the devastated community. ""When I first saw them, I was just so happy that we all broke down in tears,"" he said. ""When I saw them, it was like, 'God, thank you for this big miracle.'"" Late Tuesday, CNN iReporter Debra Thomas found Sebastian Makison, the young man she has raised since high school. He was in the Philippines for volunteer work. Family members worked through Facebook and Twitter to find him, and a volunteer worker saw the posts and connected them. They visited over Skype late Tuesday night, bringing tears of joy. ""I am praying for the rest of the families and I hope they are as lucky as we are,"" Thomas said. CNN BELIEF BLOG: Where was God in the Philippines?

"A historic deal was struck early Sunday between Iran and six world powers over Tehran's nuclear program that slows the country's nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out. The agreement -- described as an ""initial, six-month"" deal -- includes ""substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address. The deal, which capped days of marathon talks, addresses Iran's ability to enrich uranium, what to do about its existing enriched uranium stockpiles, the number and potential of its centrifuges and Tehran's ""ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium using the Arak reactor,"" according to a statement released by the White House. Iran also agreed to provide ""increased transparency and intrusive monitoring of its nuclear program,"" it said. There was no immediate reaction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has consistently asked the West to be wary of any deals with Iran. However, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yubal Steinitz reiterated the Israeli government stance when he said Sunday morning that the last-second amendments put into the agreement are ""far from satisfactory."" ""This agreement is still bad and will make it more difficult than before to achieve an appropriate solution in the future,"" he said. Obama warned that if Tehran violates terms of the deal, ""We will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure."" You can be sure that President Obama will speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu"" on Sunday about the Iran agreement, . A senior administration official said Obama will speak with Netanyahu sometime Sunday. ""Ultimately, we understand why Israel is particularly skeptical about Iran,"" the official said, adding, ""This is not simply about trusting the Iranian government. There are strict verification measures."" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the deal an opportunity ""to avert an unnecessary crisis."" Zarif said he hopes the nuclear agreement will lead to ""concrete steps"" to improve relations between Iran and Western powers. As part of the deal, according to Zarif, Iran retains the right to nuclear technology, including the enriching of uranium under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -- which requires it not to create nuclear weapons or enable other countries to obtain them. Iran has agreed to what U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described as ""unprecedented international monitoring"" of its nuclear program. ""The first step, let me be clear, does not say that Iran has a right to enrich uranium,"" Kerry said, appearing to contradict claims earlier by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi. Araghchi -- on Twitter feed commonly attributed to him by Iranian media -- said that ""our enrichment program was recognized."" In exchange for Iran's concessions, sanctions on its oil revenues will be eased. But Kerry said the agreement does not roll back the ""vast majority of the sanctions that are currently in place."" The deal was formally announced by Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, in Geneva where the foreign ministers representing Iran, the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany were meeting. But closed-door negotiations had been taking place for a while. A senior administration official told CNN that in the months leading up to the Geneva talks, U.S. and Iranian officials held private, previously unknown discussions to generate ideas for the wider P5+1 negotiations. The official said talks began after Hassan Rouhani was elected Iran's president, and that as the discussions were occurring, U.S. officials were briefing the P5+1 partners. The official suggested other partners were meeting with the Iranians and briefing the U.S. about the progress of those discussions. The Iran nuclear deal is a first step requiring actions by both sides, which have ""a strong commitment to negotiate a final comprehensive solution,"" Ashton said. According to a statement released by the White House, the deal halts Tehran's nuclear program, including halting the development at the Arak reactor and requiring all of the uranium enriched to 20% -- close to weapons-grade -- to be diluted so it cannot be converted for military purposes. The Arak heavy water reactor under construction southwest of Tehran had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations. For years, Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement, frustration and at times open animosity. But the diplomatic tone changed with the transfer of power after Iran's election this year, which saw President Hassan Rouhani replace Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Caustic jabs at the United States and bellicose threats toward Israel were a hallmark of Ahmadinejad's foreign policy rhetoric. He lambasted the West over the economic sanctions crippling Iran's economy and at the same time, pushed the advancement of nuclear technology in Iran. Rouhani has struck up a more conciliatory tone and made the lifting sanctions against his country a priority. Despite the sanctions, Iran today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Most world powers believe that Iran could not realistically build a usable bomb in less than a year, Hibbs said.","Iran's foreign minister says Iran retains the right to nuclear technology .
But it does not retain the right to enrich uranium, Secretary of State John Kerry says .
The deal includes substantial limitations to prevent the creation of nuclear weapons, Obama says .
The deal follows marathon talks that stretched into early Sunday morning ."
"The thronging mass of people in front of me, which seconds before had been surging forward to see a tar-lined barrel being set aflame, suddenly parts. I soon see why. Charging towards me, like a blazing bull, is a young man with a raging inferno on his shoulders. I duck and weave, looking for an opening in the crowd to escape through, but none exists. Abruptly, though, the flaming figure performs a pirouette and changes direction. I join the chase as the reassembled masses forget their fear and race after the barrel runner, with fire-lust burning in their eyes. I'm in Ottery St. Mary, a normally sleepy in the Devon region of southwestern England. Across the country in November, most communities celebrate bonfire night -- a fiery commemoration of a foiled attempt to blow up London's Houses of Parliament in 1605. Here they do it by charging up and down the streets with flaming tar barrels held aloft. It's the maddest thing I've ever witnessed. Gunpowder plot . The health-and-safety defying tradition is at least several centuries old. Although its exact origins have gone up in smoke, it's thought they're linked to the ""gunpowder plot"" of 1605. Andy Wade, who's been involved in the event for 30 years, has been on the 80-strong organizing committee for the past 22 years and is now life president, explains that many places in southwestern England once had burning-barrel rolling festivals. ""But one year a long, long time ago, some bright spark in Ottery obviously decided that things would be a lot more exciting if you picked the barrel up,"" says Wade. ""And then our unique tradition was born."" Interpreted through the eyes of an expert, the festival is a lot more controlled than it appears at first glance. For starters, people can't just rock up, grab a burning barrel and go for a jog through the crowd. ""The runners are extremely experienced,"" Wade explains. ""They come up through the ranks, starting with the kids' barrels when they're eight years old, and then progressing to the intermediate barrels. And then -- if they're big enough and ugly enough -- they move up to the men's barrels."" For Wade, it's about the perpetuation of a proud tradition. ""Many of these guys come from families that have a connection with the event going back generations,"" he says. ""The fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers of these lads carried barrels."" Earlier in the evening I'd witnessed the initiation of a new generation of barrel boys and girls. The barrel is slightly smaller for the kids' event, but the principle is exactly the same: get the flaming thing up on your shoulders and run like mad, without dropping it, until someone else demands it. Dancing with fire . There's no competitive element -- the challenge is to keep hold of the barrel for as long as possible, and to keep the flames bellowing. This explains the pirouettes, which get extra oxygen into the barrel. In total, 17 barrels are daubed with tar throughout the year, then set ablaze during the evening of November 5, starting with the kids, then women and intermediates -- and finally the men. Traditionally, each barrel is sponsored by a pub. Although only four of the town's original pubs remain, the memory of those that have shut is kept alive in the name of the barrels. By the time the men get going, Ottery's streets are heaving with spectators who flock to the town. It's estimated about 15,000 people come to see the event when it's on a school night, and up to 20,000 gather when November 5 falls on a weekend. Safety concerns? Eh. Inevitably, every year there are complaints from people who feel the event is unsafe. Wade's message to them is simple: ""The atmosphere is lighthearted, but the barrels do get run through the streets. If you don't like it, please stand back. ""And don't touch or interfere with the barrels -- the boys really don't like that. ""Visitors have to remember that they're getting a free show. We don't make anything out of this -- the collections that take place on the night just about cover costs. ""Every year getting insurance is a problem. Of course there are injuries, but more of these are caused by factors other than the barrels -- like people boozing too much and falling over."" These days the runners aren't allowed to drink until they've finished. But that doesn't stop the crowd taking up the slack on the cider-swilling front, and the later the night gets, the more boisterous the atmosphere becomes. If the detractors think the event is crazy now, it's good they weren't here a few years ago, before health and safety became such a big issue. ""It was proper mayhem when I was young,"" reminisces Wade, fondly. ""People used to get cidered-up and there was plenty of fighting over the barrels. Things used to get sorted out on November 5th."" Ottery's Flaming Tar Barrels takes place on November 5. Most of the barrels are lit outside the town's four pubs: The Lamb & Flag, The Volunteer, The London and the Kings Arms. The first barrel runs start at 4 p.m. More at www.otterytarbarrels.co.uk . Lewes Bonfire Night . Ottery St. Mary isn't the only UK town to turn fiery celebrations into unusual spectacles. The largest November 5 event in the world takes place in the Lewes, in the southern English region of East Sussex. The whole town burns brightly every year as up to 80,000 people come to watch six ""bonfire societies"" parade through the streets, dressed as smugglers, with burning crosses and (sometimes controversial) effigies, before lighting various infernos and letting off fireworks. Burning tar barrels are also featured here, but they're rolled, not carried. The event commemorates both the discovery of the 1605 gunpowder plot and the burning at the stake of 17 local Protestant ""martyrs."" Up Helly Aa . Before the 1880s, there was a great winter tradition of tar barreling in Scotland's Shetland Islands, which saw local men dragging burning barrels through the town of Lerwick on sledges, getting up to high jinx en route. When this was banned, they started celebrating Up Helly Aa, a fire festival that takes place on the last Tuesday in January. This event features a torch-lit parade by people dressed as Vikings and culminates with the dramatic burning of a Viking-style galley ship.","Ottery St. Mary in southwestern England hosts dramatic annual barrel burning festival .

"A Ukrainian court has found former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her Tuesday to seven years in prison. Authorities deployed hundreds of police officers around the court to keep order, state media reported.  Dozens of angry Tymoshenko supporters took to the streets of Kiev in August when she was taken into custody. ""Dear friends, I just want to say that I disagree with this verdict and I am saying that the year 1937 is  back again,"" Tymoshenko said in the courtroom Tuesday, making a reference to Josef Stalin's rule when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. But Judge Rodion Kireev said that ""bearing in mind the fact that the court has not established any circumstances aggravating or  mitigating Tymoshenko's punishment,  and given the heightened social danger of the crime committed by Tymoshenko, her personality and the absence of any penitence on her part, the court sees no grounds to hand down a more lenient sentence."" In April, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's office opened a criminal case charging Tymoshenko with signing overpriced gas deals with Russian energy provider Gazprom that inflicted damages to the country of more than 1.5 billion hryvnas (almost $190 million at the current exchange rate) and which Tymoshenko had allegedly no right to sign. The court ruled Tymoshenko must repay the money, and she is banned from holding public office for three years. Tymoshenko narrowly lost to President Viktor Yanukovych in a presidential election in February 2010, and she became his fiercest opponent. Tymoshenko repeatedly brushed off all charges against her as political, calling the trial a ""farce"" and naming the judge a ""stooge of Yanukovych's administration,"" appointed to ""fabricate"" the case. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Tuesday he didn't understand why she was sentenced to seven years in the case. ""It's dangerous and counterproductive to question the complex of gas agreements reached between Ukraine and Russia in talks with Tymoshenko,"" Putin was quoted as saying in Beijing, according to state TV broadcaster Russia-24 news.  ""Gas contracts signed by Russia and Ukraine, after talks with Tymoshenko, fully comply with the laws of Russia, Ukraine and international standards."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said the nation's 2009 natural gas agreements with Ukraine were legal. It says Russia ""is committed to developing and deepening all-round partnership with Ukraine, including the search for mutually acceptable solutions in the gas sphere, as the leaders of the two countries agreed to in (the Russian government country estate of) Zavidovo on September 24."" ""One should take into consideration the fact that the leadership of many countries and the international community have perceived this court trial as one that was initiated for purely political reasons. By accusing Tymoshenko of abusing power when signing a contract for the supply of Russian gas in 2009, the ... court ignored compelling evidence that those gas agreements were designed in strict accordance with the laws of Russia and Ukraine as well as the rules of international law, "" it says. ""We also see an obvious anti-Russian implication in this issue. In actual fact, Yulia Tymoshenko was sentenced for the valid and legally-binding agreements in the gas area between 'Gazprom' and 'Naftogaz Ukraine',"" the ministry statement said. Amnesty International slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010. ""The charges against her are not internationally recognizable offenses, they are attempts to criminalize decisions that she made in the course of her work,"" said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia deputy program director of Amnesty International. ""Poor political decisions of this kind -- if that is what they were -- should be punished by voters, not through courts. Her conviction on these charges is illegitimate and she should be immediately released,"" Dalhuisen said. ""The trial against Yulia Tymoshenko highlights systemic problems within the justice system in Ukraine, and the conduct of this trial casts doubt over the independence of the judiciary."" Amnesty says she was charged in December ""for abuse of office over the receipt of 180 million euros from the sale of a greenhouse gas quota to a Japanese company."" It also says she is charged ""with having delayed signing an order in December 2009 for the customs clearance of 1,000 Opel Combo cars. The delay allegedly resulted in a budget loss of $4.6 million."" ""Yulia Tymoshenko must be released and all charges against her must be dropped,"" said Dalhuisen. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the organization ""is deeply disappointed with the verdict"" and it will prompt the EU to ""reflect on its policies towards Ukraine."" She said the action points to the ""politically motivated prosecutions"" for ""the leaders of the opposition and members of the former government."" ""The way the Ukrainian authorities will generally respect universal values and rule of law, and specifically how they will handle these cases, risks having profound implications for the EU-Ukraine bilateral relationship, including for the conclusion of the Association Agreement, our political dialogue and our cooperation more broadly."" Ashton said the EU calls for ""competent Ukrainian authorities to ensure a fair, transparent and impartial process in any appeal in the case of Ms. Tymoshenko and in the other trials related to members of the former government"" and says ""the right of appeal should not be compromised by imposing limitations on the defendants' ability to stand in future elections in Ukraine, including the parliamentary elections scheduled for next year."" The Ukrainian foreign ministry said ""internal processes"" in the country must not affect forging the Association Agreement with the European Union. ""Any internal processes or  passing events cannot  be a reason  for refusal from such reciprocity [on the question of European  integration] since we are talking about strategic prospects for the EU-Ukrainian relations,"" the ministry said. Disputes over energy prices have been the main sticking point in the relations between the Russia and Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia retained its vast oil and gas reserves, while the largest pipeline network to Western Europe -- the main customer of those energy riches -- ended up in Ukraine's territory. Ukraine is buying Russian gas for its domestic consumption and at the same time charges Russia transit fees for all its gas exports going west. In 2006, the conflict was exacerbated when Russia cut off its supplies to Ukraine for not agreeing to pay what it was asking for gas, while the latter siphoned off Russia's gas deliveries to Europe to compensate for its own shortages. But three years later, the gas war reached a further unprecedented scale. For about two weeks of an unusually cold winter in Europe, most European customers were freezing, being cut off from Russian gas supplies as the two former Soviet countries crossed horns in a commercial dispute and didn't want to yield to each other. And over the past few years, Russia has had much the same oil and gas disputes with its other western neighbor, Belarus. But Western governments have repeatedly criticized Russia for its arm-twisting tactics against its less rich neighbors in economic matters and for using its vast energy resources as a weapon to impose its political will across the former Soviet states, accusations that Russia denies.","Putin, EU, Amnesty International question the move .

"Hours after a Sudanese court sentenced his pregnant wife to death when she refused to recant her Christian faith, her husband told CNN he feels helpless. ""I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do,"" Daniel Wani told CNN on Thursday. ""I'm just praying."" This week a Khartoum court convicted his wife, Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith. Ibrahim is Christian, her husband said. But the court considers her to be Muslim. The court also convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes because her marriage to a Christian man is considered void under Sharia law. The court gave her until Thursday to recant her Christian faith -- something she refused to do, according to her lawyer. During Thursday's sentencing hearing, a sheikh told the court ""how dangerous a crime like this is to Islam and the Islamic community,"" said attorney Mohamed Jar Elnabi, who's representing Ibrahim. ""I am a Christian,"" Ibrahim fired back, ""and I will remain a Christian."" Her legal team says it plans to appeal the verdict, which drew swift condemnation from human rights organizations around the world. In the meantime, Ibrahim, who is eight months' pregnant, remains in prison with her 20-month-old son. ""She is very strong and very firm. She is very clear that she is a Christian and that she will get out one day,"" Elnabi told CNN from Sudan. Ibrahim was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old, and Ibrahim was raised by her mother as a Christian. However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her to be the same, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. The case, her lawyer said, started after Ibrahim's brother filed a complaint against her, alleging that she had gone missing for several years and that her family was shocked to find she had married a Christian man. A family divided . The court's ruling leaves a family divided, with Ibrahim behind bars and her husband struggling to survive, Elnabi said. Police blocked Wani from entering the courtroom on Thursday, Elnabi said. Lawyers appealed to the judge, but he refused, Elnabi said. Wani uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends on her for all details of his life,"" Elnabi said. ""He cannot live without her,"" said the lawyer. The couple's son is having a difficult time in prison. ""He is very affected from being trapped inside a prison from such a young age,"" Elnabi said. ""He is always getting sick due to lack of hygiene and bugs."" Ibrahim is having a difficult pregnancy, the lawyer said. A request to send her to a private hospital was denied ""due to security measures."" There also is the question of the timing of a potential execution. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. Rights groups, governments ask for compassion . Amnesty International describes Ibrahim as a prisoner of conscience. ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher, said in a statement. ""'Adultery' and 'apostasy' are acts which should not be considered crimes at all, let alone meet the international standard of 'most serious crimes' in relation to the death penalty. It is a flagrant breach of international human rights law,"" the researcher said. Katherine Perks with the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's ""own Constitution and commitments made under regional and international law."" ""Meriam has been convicted solely on account of her religious convictions and personal status,"" she said. Foreign embassies in Khartoum are urging the government there to reverse course. ""We call upon the Government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution,"" the embassies of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Netherlands said in a statement. ""We further urge Sudanese legal authorities to approach Ms. Meriam's case with justice and compassion that is in keeping with the values of the Sudanese people,"" it read. 'Egregious violations of freedom of religion' Attempts to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister about the Ibrahim case were unsuccessful. Sudan is one of the most difficult countries in the world to be a Christian, according to international religious freedom monitors. Under President Omar al-Bashir, the African nation ""continues to engage in systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief,"" the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its 2014 report. The country imposes Sharia law on Muslims and non-Muslims alike and punishes acts of ""indecency"" and ""immorality"" by floggings and amputations, the commission said. ""Conversion from Islam is a crime punishable by death, suspected converts to Christianity face societal pressures, and government security personnel intimidate and sometimes torture those suspected of conversion,"" said  the commission, whose members are appointed by Congress and the president. The 8 worst places in the world to be religious . The Sudanese government has arrested Christians for spreading their faith, razed Christian churches and confiscated Christians' property, the commission said. Since 1999, the U.S. State Department has called Sudan one of the worst offenders of religious rights, counting it among eight ""countries of particular concern."" ""The government at times enforced laws against blasphemy and defaming Islam,"" the State Department said in its most recent report on religious freedom, from 2012. The State Department's other countries of concern, all of which impose strict penalties on Christians or other faiths, are: Myanmar (also known as Burma), China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan. Among all religious groups, Christians are the most likely to be persecuted worldwide, according to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center. Between June 2006 and December 2012, Christians were harassed by governments in 151 countries, Pew reported. Islam was second, with 135 countries. Together, Christians and Muslims make up half of the world's population, Pew noted. Lawyer says he's gotten a death threat . Elnabi says he got a death threat a day before the controversial court hearing, with an anonymous caller telling him to pull out of representing Ibrahim or risk attack. ""I feel very scared,"" he said. ""Since yesterday, I live in fear if I just hear a door open or a strange sound in the street."" Still, the lawyer said he'll continue representing Ibrahim. ""I could never leave the case. This is a matter of belief and principles,"" he said. ""I must help someone who is in need, even if it will cost me my life.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate's financial rescue plan may have a better chance of passage because it's padded with pork that may be tasty enough to get reluctant House members to bite. Lawmakers added billions in tax incentives to the bailout bill to help it pass the House. Most of the $110 billion in additions, such as a tax credit for research and development and an increase in insurance for bank accounts, would have broad economic impact. The benefits of others, though, may not be so evident to most taxpayers. For example, the proposal includes an excise tax exemption for a very specific type of arrow used by child archers.  View details of the incentives » . According to Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog group, current law places an excise tax of 39 cents on the first sale by the manufacturer, producer or importer of any shaft of a type used to produce certain types of arrows.  Watch where's the pork? » . ""This proposal would exempt from the excise tax any shaft consisting of all natural wood with no laminations or artificial means to enhance the spine of the shaft used in the manufacture of an arrow that measures 5/16 of an inch or less and is unsuited for use with a bow with a peak draw weight of 30 pounds or more,"" Ellis wrote. The estimated cost of the proposal is $2 million over 10 years, he wrote.  Follow the progress of the $700 billion bailout plan » . Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and Gordon Smith, a Republican, were the initial sponsors of the arrow provision. According to Bloomberg News, the earmark provision would be worth $200,000 a year to Rose City Archery in Myrtle Point, Oregon. A Wyden aide said the Oregon senator did not ask that the provision be added to bailout package, but that doesn't fly with Ellis. ""The bottom line is, this is benefiting a very few manufacturers, and I think most Americans who are either concerned about the bailout package or concerned about the economy are going to be wondering why a provision benefiting wooden arrow manufacturers is catching a ride on the package,"" Ellis said. The Taxpayers for Common Sense also reports that the proposal includes such mouthwatering morsels as these: . CNN's Scott J.

"(CNN) -- ""Do you want to hit this?"" a man asked President Barack Obama in a bar in Denver Tuesday night. The president laughed but didn't indulge. It wasn't the only time Obama was offered weed on his night out. That's apparently what happens in Colorado, which recently legalized recreational marijuana. The man posted the exchange on Instagram for the world to see. Obama has admitted to smoking pot as a young man. He was an active member of the ""Choom Gang"" in high school, which perfected all sorts of techniques for getting high. The President has since spoken about those times in more serious settings, saying as recently as this year that he made ""bad choices"" without considering ""the harm it could do."" Earlier in the evening, the presidential motorcade passed a bearded man holding a sign: ""Free weed 4 Obama."" A sign outside a marijuana dispensary offered the same thing. The motorcade didn't stop. And Obama waving off the offers didn't seem to ruin the fun. His boys' night out with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper at the bar the governor used to own consisted of, well, things that take place in bars. ""Did you see how many balls he still has on the table?"" the President joked after a game of pool. Hickenlooper had five, while the President sunk the 8-ball. A patron offered to buy the President a beer. ""It's too late, man. I just got one,"" Obama said. While Obama the bear was loose, the entire night was not all jovial. A woman stopped the President, telling him that her brother died in Afghanistan four years ago. Obama gave Kalynne May Arrick, from Tyler, Texas, a challenge coin usually reserved for veterans, who collect them. Her brother, Marine Sgt. Kenneth May, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. ""I'm so sorry,"" he told Arrick, hugging her. Presidential meet-and-greets rarely veer so far off script. By the time Obama sat down at a pizza joint with people who had written him letters, the President had loosened his blue tie and rolled up his sleeves. A teacher, a couple who own a small business, a college student, and a furniture store worker sat Obama down at the head of a table crowded with plates and pizza trays. ""Where do you all want me?"" asked the President. ""Right at the head of the table."" ""Oh my goodness, that's so formal."" Later, he walked down the streets of downtown Denver, giving fist bumps, shaking hands and slapping high fives. He refused a selfie and resisted holding a cute baby. But he did find himself shaking hands with a man in a horse mask. ""One onlooker wore a large horse head,"" the pool report on the visit said, ""but it's unclear what message he hoped to convey."" Obama also stopped to talk with a father and son. The boy said he was a skateboarder. ""I see you got a little scab here,"" the President told him. ""You got scuffed up a little bit. That's alright. If you're 10 and you don't have a scab you're not having fun."" The President ended the night with a picture and a fist bump with a gorilla statue and was back at his hotel by 9 p.m. Tuesday was just the first night of a three-day road trip. Obama is holding a fundraiser for Sen. Mark Udall Wednesday and will give a speech focused on the economy to promote his policies to help workers. Then he'll head to Texas, which has been the center of a political sparring match between he and Gov. Rick Perry over the deluge of immigrant children crossing the border. What can the Lone Star State possibly do to top one night in Denver? Immigration reform probably isn't going to do it. Opinion: Obama hasn't hit rock bottom yet .","The President gets multiple offers of free pot .

"(CNN) -- News that the United States is considering a military strike on Syria in response to the Bashar al-Assad regime's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an American bombing campaign on the war-torn country. The atrocities that took place in Syria recently, such as those that have been taking place there for almost two years, are deplorable and inhuman. Before bombing Syria over the regime's latest crimes, however, we should stand back and ask, ""And then what?"" Bergen: For U.S., Syria is truly a problem from hell . A brief bombing campaign in Syria might make the United States and its allies feel like they are doing something, but it will prove nothing. We have already abstained from getting involved in the civil war for two years and have chosen not to respond to evidence (albeit less clear) of another chemical attack this year. We have already concluded that as terrible as the civil war is, it cannot be our war. The bombing will not change this -- and then what? Both sides in Syria are bad. One side is a brutal dictator, and the other includes Islamists and terrorists who are dangerous already and who would be brutal in power if given the chance. We will not spend the time, money and blood to create a desirable side in Syria. There is no victory to be had there. Syria is not the greatest threat in the Middle East to U.S. or world security. The Iranian regime is working every day to get a nuclear weapon. It poses a direct threat to Israel's survival and a long-term threat to America. The conflicts in Syria, Egypt and Libya are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if Iran succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons. We should focus more on the truly big threat ahead of the headlines of the day -- or we will be reading much worse headlines in the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","U.S. is considering a military strike on Syria in response to chemical weapons attack .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama poked fun at everyone -- from his wife to Donald Trump -- during the annual White House Correspondents dinner, before ending his speech with a tribute to journalists who brave deadly conditions to get a story. No one was safe from the president's zings on Saturday night, including Republican presidential challengers. Days after releasing his long-form birth certificate to refute claims he wasn't born in the United States, the president began his address by showing what he called his birth video. But rather than footage of a baby Barack being born in Hawaii, the clip was from Disney's ""The Lion King,"" showing the grand unveiling of the baby Simba in Africa. The speech was before a crowd of about 2,600 at the packed Washington Hilton ballroom. In addition to journalists, other attendees included Chief of Staff Bill Daley, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Speaker of the House John Boehner. Actors, fashion icons and musicians also attended, helping set the event apart from a typical late-night dinner among politicos in Georgetown. Hollywood was represented by the likes of ""Hangover"" star Zach Galifianakis, ""Glee"" standout Jane Lynch, Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" fame, among others. Steven Tyler and Michael Stipe, frontmen for legendary rock groups Aerosmith and R.E.M. respectively, also mingled with the guests, as did fashion designers Diane von Furstenberg and Michael Kors. Obama then singled out an unsmiling Trump and credited him with making hard decisions -- such as firing Gary Busey over Meatloaf on an episode of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" -- and succeeding in his push for the president to release his long-form birth certificate. ""Now, he can focus on more important matters like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama said, referring to Neil Armstrong's 1969 walk on the moon, the alleged UFO crash in New Mexico and the deaths of rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur. The president also jokingly suggested several Republicans who have signalled they might challenge him in 2012 were not born in America. He revealed that Rep. Michele Bachmann came from Canada, talked about the full name of Minnesota Gov. Tim ""Hosni"" Pawlenty, and hinted that the first language of former Utah governor, Jon Huntsman, is Chinese. Huntsman ended his tenure as Obama's appointed ambassador to China on Saturday. ""And then there's a vicious rumor floating around that could really hurt Mitt Romney,"" Obama said. ""I hear he passed universal health care when he was governor of Massachusetts."" Not even his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, was immune to ribbing. Alluding to her push to promote healthy eating, the president said the two of them made a great team at the recent Easter egg roll: ""I'd give candy ... to the kids, and she'd snatch them right back out of their hands."" The president concluded his presentation on a serious note with a tribute to the tornado-ravaged areas in the Southeast and to journalists who have been ""threatened, arrested, beaten, attacked and in some cases even killed"" on the job. ""No one should be silenced,"" Obama said. ""That's what you do. And at its best, that's what journalism is."" The president was followed on stage by Seth Meyers, the head writer and ""Weekend Update"" anchor for ""Saturday Night Live."" Meyers poked fun at news outlets such as C-SPAN, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN and The New York Times.  He also . focused on the 2012 Republican presidential field -- a roster he said ""sounds like season 13 of 'Dancing With the Stars,' and not the stars (but) the dancers."" As is tradition, the dinner's featured speaker didn't let the commander-in-chief off unscathed. Meyers said the one candidate who could ""definitely beat"" the incumbent was the ""2008 Barack Obama. You would have loved him."" The White House Correspondents' Association dinner was Obama's third as president. It has been a ritual in Washington since 1920, when it was first held to boost communication between the press and the president, according to the association's website. It was only open to men until 1962, when President John F. Kennedy said he would not attend unless women were invited.","White House Correspondents' dinner is held Saturday in Washington .

"The United States hasn't abandoned Robert Levinson, the retired FBI agent described by his wife as the ""longest-held American hostage,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday. ""There hasn't been progress in the sense that we don't have him back. But to suggest that we've abandoned him or anybody ... is simply incorrect and not helpful,"" Kerry told ABC's ""This Week."" ""The fact is that I have personally raised the issue, not only at the highest level that I have been involved with, but also through other intermediaries."" Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007 during a business trip, purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling. However, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported Thursday that contrary to what the State Department and Levinson's family have said for years, Levinson actually was working for the CIA in Iran. And a source involved in the matter told CNN there's proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover, and under contract, while also working as a private investigator. White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip . That allegation doesn't sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. ""What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson,"" McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If that's true, then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees didn't know about other activities, which have been revealed by (NSA leaker Edward) Snowden -- maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of Congress over our different intelligence agencies."" Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. During a September interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson's family. ""We don't know where he is, who he is,"" Rouhani said. ""He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him."" McCain: CIA did not tell Congress the truth about Levinson . Kerry said the United States is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive. A ""number of different channels"" are ""being worked aggressively,"" he said. Iran's previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as ""proof of life."" In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia. This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, ""We have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate."" Asked whether he believes the Iranian government is responsible for Levinson's disappearance, Kerry said he thinks the government ""has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will."" McCain said he was ""confident we are doing everything that we can"" to get Levinson released from Iran, . He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

"A major online security vulnerability dubbed ""Heartbleed"" could put your personal information at risk, including passwords, credit card information and e-mails. Heartbleed is a flaw in OpenSSL, an open-source encryption technology that is used by an estimated two-thirds of Web servers. It is behind many HTTPS sites that collect personal or financial information. These sites are typically indicated by a lock icon in the browser to let site visitors know the information they're sending online is hidden from prying eyes. Cybercriminals could exploit the bug to access visitors' personal data as well as a site's cryptographic keys, which can be used to impersonate that site and collect even more information. It was discovered by a Google researcher and an independent Finnish security firm called Codenomicon. The researchers have put up a dedicated site to answer common questions about the bug. They even gave it an adorably gruesome custom icon. Heartbleed is the result of a small coding error but it could have far-reaching consequences and affect the majority of Internet users. Researchers discovered the issue last week and published their findings on Monday, but said the problem has been present for more than two years, since March 2012. Any communications that took place over SSL in the past two years could have been subject to malicious eavesdropping. What makes the bug particularly problematic is that there is no simple fix. Action needs to be taken by both the compromised sites and individuals who have visited them. To protect their user data and encryption keys, sites must upgrade to the patched version of OpenSSL, revoke compromised SSL certificates and get new ones issued. Many major websites including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon have said they've taken steps to secure their sites. Security researchers demonstrated the flaw by stealing Yahoo e-mail logins on Tuesday morning, but Yahoo has since fixed the issue across its major sites, including Tumblr. It's not just an issue for major sites. Smaller online stores and services use OpenSSL, and those sites might take longer to make the necessary fixes. Websites don't typically publicize whether they're using OpenSSL, so the process will also be bumpy for consumers. Individuals should update their passwords across the various Web pages they use, but only once they have confirmed a site has already taken the proper measures to address Heartbleed. If they don't and that site is still at risk, the new password could also be compromised. Many sites will also likely send e-mails instructing customers to update passwords if necessary.","Security research discovers a bug in the encryption technology used by two-thirds of the Web .

"President Barack Obama is sending about 100 U.S. troops to Africa to help hunt down the leaders of the notoriously violent Lord's Resistance Army in and around Uganda. ""I have authorized a small number of combat-equipped U.S. forces to deploy to central Africa to provide assistance to regional forces that are working toward the removal of Joseph Kony from the battlefield,"" Obama said in letter sent Friday to House Speaker John Boehner and Daniel Inouye, the president pro tempore of the Senate.  Kony is the head of the Lord's Resistance Army. U.S. military personnel advising regional forces working to target Kony and other senior leaders will not engage Kony's forces ""unless necessary for self-defense,"" Obama said. ""I believe that deploying these U.S. armed forces furthers U.S. national security interests and foreign policy and will be a significant contribution toward counter-LRA efforts in central Africa."" Obama noted that the group ""has murdered, raped, and kidnapped tens of thousands of men, women and children in central Africa"" and ""continues to commit atrocities across the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan that have a disproportionate impact on regional security."" What is the Lord's Resistance Army? According to the State Department, ""since 2008 alone, the LRA has killed more than 2,400 people and abducted more than 3,400.  The United Nations estimates that over 380,000 people are displaced across the region because of LRA activity."" Obama said the United States since 2008 has backed regional military efforts to go after the Lord's Resistance Army. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that since that time the United States has provided more than $40 million in support. Efforts to combat the LRA, however, have been unsuccessful. In his letter, Obama cited the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009.  In that measure, Congress ""expressed support for increased, comprehensive U.S. efforts to help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the LRA to civilians and regional stability,"" he said. ""I have directed this deployment, which is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am making this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution,"" he said.  ""I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action."" Obama said the initial team of U.S. military personnel ""with appropriate combat equipment"" deployed to Uganda on Wednesday. Other forces deploying include ""a second combat-equipped team and associated headquarters, communications and logistics personnel."" ""Our forces will provide information, advice and assistance to select partner nation forces,"" he said.  ""Subject to the approval of each respective host nation, elements of these U.S. forces will deploy into Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The support provided by U.S. forces will enhance regional efforts against the LRA. "" The U.S. troops backing the operation ""are primarily comprised of Special Operations Forces,"" according to the Pentagon. It said the United States has been helping Uganda and the other regional countries in their fight against the LRA since 2008. The U.S. has provided logistical support, non-lethal equipment, training and intelligence assistance, as well as $33 million to Uganda's People Defense Forces effort to counter the group. The Pentagon cited multiple examples of its assistance, such as sending equipment to Central African armed forces and training a Democratic Republic of Congo light infantry battalion deployed in that country's northeast. It noted that U.S. Africa Command is ""exploring ways to support the military of South Sudan."" In early October 2010, the U.S. military had more than 1,700 troops deployed in sub-Saharan Africa, the Pentagon said. The majority of them -- around 1,380 - were deployed in Djibouti. But U.S. troops had at least a small presence in 33 different nations in sub-Saharan Africa. At this time last year they had nine troops in Uganda. One conservative member of Congress, Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, weighed in to support the effort. ""I applaud our nation's military for making this a priority and taking the steps outlined in our legislation that will eventually protect the children and people from Joseph Kony's reign of terror,"" Inhofe said. ""I have witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by the LRA, and this will help end Kony's heinous acts that have created a human rights crisis in Africa. We must work to bring justice to the children and victims in Uganda devastated by Kony and the LRA.  I have been fervently involved in trying to prevent further abductions and murders of Ugandan children, and today's action offers hope that the end of the LRA is in sight."" Kony claims he is a prophet sent from God to replace the Ugandan government with a democracy based on the Ten Commandments. The group has been ""notorious for kidnapping children and forcing them to become rebel fighters or concubines,"" according to the website GlobalSecurity.org. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Kony and four other group leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Campo said that the ""LRA is an involuntary army and the majority of the fighters are formerly abducted children. "" Obama's plan in dealing with the LRA calls for increasing ""protection of civilians,"" apprehending or removing Kony and senior LRA commanders from the battlefield, promoting the ""defection, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of remaining LRA fighters"" and increasing ""humanitarian access."" Representatives of 34 groups in the LRA-affected areas of northern Congo, Central African Republic, and Southern Sudan wrote Obama in December, applauding his commitment to tackle the problem and urging him to deal with the group, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Each day that goes by without a solution to the problem of the LRA is another day of terror and pain for those of us living under constant threat of renewed attacks. Already, the LRA has brutally killed more than 2,300 of our family members and abducted over 3,000 others since they began their latest wave of killings in September 2008,"" the letter said. ""Many of our children are still in the hands of the LRA. We do not know if they are alive or dead. Those who have managed to escape the LRA bear the physical and mental scars of what they have suffered and will never be the same again. We have few means to help them readjust and integrate back into our communities, but we are trying to do what we can."" The letter cites massacres in 2008 and 2009. ""During these attacks, our family members were killed in unimaginably savage ways: their heads crushed with clubs or machetes; their faces disfigured; and their genitals, mouths, ears, legs and arms cut off, for no reason other than to terrorize.""","Groups say that ""without a solution,"" it is daily ""terror and pain""

"Billionaire Petro Poroshenko declared victory Sunday in Ukraine's presidential election, following preliminary exit polls that suggested he got 56% of the vote. His closest challenger, former Ukrainian prime minister and leader of the Batkivshchyna party Yulia Tymoshenko, conceded the election after exit polls showed her with 13% of the vote. Poroshenko, a candy tycoon known as the ""Chocolate King,"" is also a seasoned politician. The election took place Sunday despite a recent wave of deadly violence in the east and threats by pro-Russia separatists to prevent citizens from casting their ballots. Voters were picking a successor to ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in a country torn apart by Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and bloody conflict with pro-Russia factions. The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday. As of 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), some 528 polling sites out of 2,430 were open in the Donetsk region, the regional administration said. Local officials said there was 11.8% turnout at these polling stations. Outside the country's restive east, voting was progressing more normally. The Central Election Commission put voter turnout at nearly 38% as of 3 p.m. local time, not including the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine's official Ukrinform news agency reported. In the city of Donetsk, the regional capital where pro-Russia militias are concentrated, there were no open polling stations, local officials said earlier. A CNN team driving through the city Sunday morning was not able to see a single polling station in operation. However, there were signs some voters were trying to go to polling stations in areas west and south of the city. Besides the presidential race, candidates are also running in municipal elections in some cities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe deployed 900 observers for the election -- the largest such mission in its history. Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine's acting President, called the polls open and transparent. ""The voting was free, without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure,"" Turchynov said in a statement. U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russian-backed separatists, whom he accused of trying to block voting. ""Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots,"" he said in a written statement. ""We commend the resolve of all those who participated, as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats."" Intimidation in eastern Ukraine appears widespread . Increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in Kiev to accuse Russia, which they say is backing the armed separatists, of seeking to disrupt the vote. Russia denies having direct influence over the militants, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect the Ukrainians' choice. Amid heightened tensions, instances of intimidation in eastern Ukraine appear widespread. A large separatist rally was held in a central Donetsk city square around lunchtime. The protesters, who chanted pro-Russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders, were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks, some firing guns into the air. On the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be Chechen. Two told a CNN team they were from the Chechen capital, Grozny, and one indicated that he was formerly a policemen in Chechnya and was in Donetsk to serve the Russian Federation. The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as ""volunteers."" But if their accounts were true, their presence in Donetsk would appear to indicate some kind of acquiescence by the Russian government at the least. Residents of Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol saw new billboards on the streets Sunday urging them not to cast their ballots. The billboards were not at those locations the night before, residents said. Also in Mariupol, people talked on social media about being asked by local Russia supporters to boycott the election. The city is one of several where deadly clashes have erupted in recent weeks. The self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tries to vote there will be arrested. Also, an Italian journalist was killed Saturday near the flashpoint town, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday. The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said. Reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the Slovyansk area.

"Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has made a renewed call for Buddhists in Myanmar and Sri Lanka to cease violence towards the countries' Muslim minorities, in an address delivered on his 79th birthday. Speaking before tens of thousands of Buddhists, including Hollywood actor Richard Gere, the exiled Buddhist leader implored the faithful in the majority-Buddhist countries to refrain from such attacks. ""I urge the Buddhists in these countries to imagine an image of Buddha before they commit such a crime,"" he said in the Indian town of Leh. ""Buddha preaches love and compassion. If the Buddha is there, he will protect the Muslims whom the Buddhists are attacking."" Rising Buddhist nationalism in both countries, spearheaded by movements led by extremist monks, has led to communal violence targeting Muslims in recent years. In Myanmar, religious violence has left more than 200 dead and close to 150,000 homeless -- predominantly members of the Rohingya Muslim minority, since unrest broke out in in the western state of Rakhine in June 2012. Outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence have also occurred elsewhere in the country. Curfews were introduced in the second-largest city, Mandalay, last week after rioting left two dead and 14 injured. READ MORE: Curfew imposed after deadly clashes between Buddhists, Muslims in Mandalay . Human rights groups said that extremist monks helped incite last week's violence, and were present in the rioting mobs. In Sri Lanka last month, four people were killed in nights of religious violence in which Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim neighborhoods around the southwest town of Aluthgama. Witnesses told CNN the rioting began after a rally organized by the far-right Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force) group, at which the group's leader, a monk, gave an inflammatory speech against Muslims. The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since 1959, has previously spoken out about the violence perpetrated by Buddhist nationalists. In May last year, he made comments at a U.S. university decrying the violence in Myanmar, and he has written to Aung San Suu Kyi, a renowned Burmese pro-democracy campaigner and fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, calling for a halt to the violence, his staff said. The Dalai Lama was speaking before the audience in Leh to confer Kalachakra, a process intended to empower tens of thousands of his Buddhist followers to reach enlightenment, his office said.

"Justin Bieber and his father allegedly refused a pilot's warning to stop smoking pot during a flight from Canada to New Jersey on Friday, according to a law enforcement source. A law enforcement official gave details to CNN about what the flight crew on the chartered jet told federal officials after they ferried Bieber and his entourage from Canada to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport. The official asked not to be identified. Marijuana smoke was so strong in the jet's cabin that flight crew members put on oxygen masks because they were concerned they might inhale so much it would cause them to test positive for drug use, said the source. 'Cocky' Bieber tested positive for pot, Xanax . The pilots repeatedly asked the pop star, his father, Jeremy Bieber, and other passengers to put away marijuana during the flight, according to the source.  The pilot said the singer and his father were verbally abusive to the flight crew. This prompted the pilot to have the flight attendant stay close to the cockpit to avoid contact with Bieber as much as possible, the source said. Bieber and his entourage of 10 were granted re-entry into the United States after a search of the chartered plane by federal officials, who said they detected an odor of marijuana after it landed at Teterboro Airport, a law enforcement official told CNN. A number of federal agents from Customs and Border Protection, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement said they detected the odor, which prompted the search by drug-sniffing dogs, the source said. No sign of drugs were detected and no illegal substances were found, a law enforcement source told CNN last week. How Brown, Lohan could help Bieber . Bieber, a Canadian citizen living in the United States on a work visa, was detained by border agents for several hours of questioning.  The interview is routinely conducted to ensure people entering the country are in compliance with U.S. law, another law enforcement source said.

"(CNN) -- African-Americans really like President Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office, a new national poll found. Obama's crowd in Chicago on Election Night, when fewer blacks thought race relations were a serious problem. Ninety-six percent of African-Americans approve of how Obama is handling his presidency, according to a CNN/Essence Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday. During the 2008 election, 38 percent of blacks surveyed thought racial discrimination was a serious problem. In the new survey, 55 percent of blacks surveyed believed it was a serious problem, which is about the same level as it was in 2000. The poll was conducted May 16-18, in telephone interviews with 505 African-Americans and 501 whites. Blacks and whites had differing opinions of Obama's performance. More than 60 percent of blacks felt that Obama met their expectations, while 46 percent of whites did.  See the CNN/ESSENCE poll results » .

"Freed from prison, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko returned Saturday to the battleground capital the same day the country's president said he left Kiev because of a ""coup."" Tymoshenko's release was the latest in a day of dramatic, fast-paced developments that saw Parliament vote to remove President Viktor Yanukovych from office and call for new elections. ""Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator, Mr. Yanukovych,"" Tymoshenko told a cheering crowd of thousands in Kiev's Independence Square, the scene of deadly demonstrations. Just hours after her release from a prison hospital, Tymoshenko called for justice for protesters killed in demonstrations sparked by the President's decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union in favor of one with Russia. ""You were able to change Ukraine, and you can do everything,"" she told the crowd. ""Everyone has a right to take part in building a European, independent state."" But Yanukovych took to television airwaves, saying he had been forced to leave Kiev because of ""vandalism, crime and a coup."" ""I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate president,"" he said in an interview from Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation. ""...What I am going to do next is to protect my country from the split, to stop the bloodshed. I don't know how to do it yet. I am in Kharkiv and I don't know what I am going to do next."" He did not address reports that he attempted to leave the country by airplane. According to the head of Ukraine's Border Guard Service, Sergei Astakov, Yanukovych and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk. He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces, Astakov told CNN, confirming an account he gave to Ukraine's Interfax news agency. In that account, Astakov said border security had approached the plane to check paperwork, and an armed group of people on the plane attempted to offer money to the inspectors to allow the flight to take off. When the inspectors refused the money, Yanukovych and others in his entourage exited the plane and got into two vehicles that drove up on the tarmac, Astakov is quoted as saying. Ukraine's dismissed interior minister, Vitaliy Zakharchenko, also was refused exit from the country in a similar incident at the same airport, Astakov said. The events of the day raise questions about just who is in control in Ukraine, with Parliament voting to oust Yanukovych and hold new elections on May 25. The vote came just 24 hours after Yanukovych signed a peace deal with the opposition intended to end days of bloody protests. 'People's residence' At the presidential residence in a Kiev suburb, the president's living quarters were vacant, his guards gone. Government buildings, protest gatherings and the central city were devoid of police and security forces, who had opened fire on protesters this week, killing dozens. Track how the crisis in Ukraine unfolded . As a CNN crew drove to Yanukovych's residence, it passed checkpoints set up by protesters. When the crew arrived, the gatekeepers said they were not allowing the general public onto the grounds, but they let journalists enter. The civil servants asked that the reporters treat his home as a crime scene and referred to it as the ""people's residence."" But not everyone in Ukraine was happy with the news. The country is ethnically split, with many ethnic Russians living in the east. The rest comprises mostly ethnic Ukrainians. In several cities, people have toppled statues of Vladimir Lenin, a founder of the Soviet Union. The communist empire had included Ukraine until it gained independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union. In a sign of the deep divisions, government supporters took to the streets Saturday night in Kharkiv to protect a monument to Lenin that anti-government protesters threatened to tear down. Police in riot gear stood between the two sides, while others erected a temporary fence around the monument. Freeing Tymoshenko . In the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, lawmakers passed a resolution to free Tymoshenko, a hero of the country's 2004 revolution that forced the questionable results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out. Tymoshenko served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and was forced out of office after losing an election to Yanukovych. She was sentenced in 2011 to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The case against her was widely considered to have been politically motivated, and the United States and other Western nations called her ""a political prisoner."" In 2012, after she was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards, she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country. In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said U.S. officials were closely monitoring developments. ""We have consistently advocated a de-escalation of violence, constitutional change, a coalition government, and early elections, and today's developments could move us closer to that goal,"" he said in a statement. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine. ""Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,"" Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account. A day earlier, Churkin accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force. ""If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs that will not produce democracy in Ukraine,"" he said. By Saturday, a tidal wave of political change appeared to be engulfing Ukraine with key Yanukovych allies leaving office, and the presidential duties being handed off until a new cabinet has been selected. During the parliamentary session, resignations were announced for the speaker and another leading presidential ally. Hours later, Parliament elected a new speaker, a rival to Yanukovych, and gave him the duty of coordinating the executive office until a new cabinet is in place. Another opposition parliamentarian received the duties of acting interior minister. The Verkhovna Rada sacked Yanukovych's prosecutor general. Discord's roots . The unrest began in November, when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia. Russia, which has offered to lend money to cash-strapped Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices, has pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators. Western leaders, who have offered Ukraine a long-term aid package requiring economic modernization, urged him to show restraint, open the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out deep-seated political differences. But the fight was also about corruption and control. The opposition called Yanukovych heavy-handed, with protesters saying they wouldn't leave Independence Square until he resigned. Tensions boiled over Tuesday, when security forces charged into a Kiev crowd with stun grenades, nightsticks and armored personnel carriers. The violence escalated, leaving dozens -- protesters and police alike -- dead.

"Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has issued an order preventing any court from overturning his decisions, essentially allowing him to run the country unchecked until a new constitution is drafted, his spokesman announced on state TV Thursday. Morsy also ordered retrials and reinvestigations in the deaths of protesters during last year's uprising against strongman Hosni Mubarak. That could lead to the reprosecution of Mubarak, currently serving a life prison term, and several acquitted officials who served under him. The order for retrials could please some Egyptians who've expressed disappointment that security officers and others have escaped legal consequences over last year's protester crackdown by the Mubarak regime. Egypt and Morsy proved 'pivotal' in Gaza cease-fire talks . Some demonstrators in Cairo, however -- protesting for a fourth day against Morsy and the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood -- expressed anger over his assumption of more power. About 2,000 people protested Thursday night in and around Tahrir Square, with some chanting ""birth of a new pharaoh"" and ""Morsy the dictator."" Political rivals also expressed dismay Thursday evening. ""Morsy is taking over the executive, judicial, and legislative powers in his hands, and this is a dangerous path,"" said the Twitter account of Hamdeen Sabahy, a former presidential candidate. ""Morsy has issued immunity to any laws he issues. This is the birth of a new dictator,"" tweeted Khaled Ali, another former presidential candidate. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters, meanwhile, stood outside the general prosecutor's office Thursday to support Morsy's decrees. Morsy declared that any laws or decrees he's made since he took office June 30, and until a new constitution is put in place, are final and cannot be overturned or appealed, his spokesman said on state-run TV. Morsy also declared that a 100-man council drafting a new constitution, plus the upper house of parliament, cannot be dissolved. And he granted the council two more months to finish a draft constitution, meaning the panel has six months to finish. That means Morsy, who earlier this year took over legislative powers from the military council that ruled after Mubarak's ouster, could have at least six months of unchecked rule by decree. The draft constitution would go to a referendum before it is finalized. He also fired Egypt's general prosecutor, who had taken criticism from protesters in recent months because they believe prosecutions over demonstrators' deaths were insufficient. Morsy swore in Talaat Ibrahim as the new general prosecutor on Thursday. Morsy's moves come three days after the start of violent protests in central Cairo, largely by people angry at Morsy's government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement to which Morsy belongs. They also come amid turmoil in the constitution panel, which has been torn between conservatives wanting the constitution to mandate Egypt be governed by Islam's Sharia law, and moderates and liberals who want it to say that Egypt be governed by principles of Sharia. The announcements also come a day after Morsy helped broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas after an eight-day conflict between the sides. On Wednesday, Morsy released a statement saying he had canceled a planned trip to Pakistan -- sending his vice president instead -- to concentrate on internal political developments and the Israel-Hamas cease-fire. Thousands of people have protested in Cairo since Monday, chanting -- for the first time since Morsy took office -- for the toppling of the regime. Some in Tahrir Square held posters saying ""No to the Brotherhood,"" and banned Brotherhood members from entering the square. Some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails and rocks at police, who have fired tear gas and birdshot at the demonstrators. One person has died and at least 80 have been injured in the protests, according to Mohamed Sultan, a Health Ministry spokesman. Nine police officers have been injured in the clashes so far, said Alaa Mahmoud, an Interior Ministry spokesman. Dozens of protesters have been arrested, said Interior Minister Ahmed Gamal El Din. Cameras have been installed around Tahrir Square, its side streets and the Interior Ministry in an effort to determine the identities of people attacking security forces, he announced. Middle East balance of power shifting . More demonstrations are scheduled in Tahrir Square on Friday. Fekri Mahkroub, a criminal court judge in Egypt's Ismailia district, said Thursday night that he was ""sad because what President Morsy did is an assault on the legislative and judicial system."" ""He defies anything the revolution stands for, and his actions are an insult to us as judges,"" Mahkroub said. ""Declaring that his laws cannot be questioned is unacceptable, and we may see a general judicial strike."" Eric Trager, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Morsy not only is preventing the judiciary from overruling his decisions, but he also has ""insulated the Muslim-Brotherhood-dominated (constitutional panel) from judicial oversight."" Depsite the protests in Cairo and objections from political rivals, Morsy -- elected with nearly 52% of the vote in a June runoff against former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik -- enjoys the ""best mobilizing capability in the country"" in the Muslim Brotherhood, Trager said. ""If there's a nationwide movement against this, you'll (also) have a nationwide movement for it,"" Trager said. After he was elected, Morsy took legislative control from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which had ruled after Mubarak was deposed. Earlier, the council dissolved parliament's lower house, saying parliamentary elections that began in November 2011 were unconstitutional. Morsy indicated in June he would call back parliament, but Egypt's high administrative court upheld the dissolution. Mubarak and his former Interior Minister Habib El Adly were convicted and sentenced in June to life in prison on charges relating to the deaths of hundreds of protesters after a 10-month trial, while six former government aides were acquitted. Some Egyptians protested the sentences and acquittals. Morsy, who still was running for office, said at the time that he would initiate new investigations if elected. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 others were injured in last year's 18-day uprising, according to Amnesty International.","Morsy: Any decisions until new constitution is established can't be overturned .

"The smell of incense burning and the sound of deep-throated chants greet you at the gate of one of Kathmandu's massive stupas, a Buddhist holy place where Tibetans gather to pray. For decades, Nepal has been a safe haven for Tibetans who escape China. But Tibetan activists say their people's peaceful existence here is being disturbed because of China's growing influence in Nepal. Nepali-born Tibetan Sonam Choden has lived in Nepal her whole life, hearing stories from her parents about how her grandparents were killed by the Chinese. She says she is overwhelmed with frustration over how Tibetans are now being treated in Nepal. ""Since China has given Nepal a lot of money, the Nepali government doesn't let Tibetans do much of anything. They don't let us gather to mourn, or protest. They even pick up Tibetans while they are walking on the street and send them to jail,"" Sonam Choden alleged. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, sandwiched between two behemoths: India and China. Traditionally, India has had the biggest influence in Nepal. But China's influence is growing. It recently doubled its annual aid to Nepal. China is also building a railway linking the countries and building roads in Nepal, which is in desperate need of infrastructure. Nepal's prime minister, Baburam Bhattarai, said China's biggest interest in Nepal is the Tibetan issue. But he said he and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao have not specifically discussed repatriating Tibetans who have escaped to Nepal. In terms of Tibetan refugees in his country, the prime minister said, ""We are not allowing anti-China or anti-Indian sentiment on our soil, as per international law."" But he denies there is a crackdown on refugees' rights. As China becomes a bigger factor in Nepal, refugees from neighboring Tibet say they are being squeezed. Choden is one of the few Tibetans willing to talk openly about what is happening. Inside her home, she worships the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader loathed by China and revered as a living God by many Tibetans. She also speaks her mind on issues involving Tibet and has paid a price for it. ""Since 2008 I went to jail many times, 30 times at least,"" Choden said. At home, she keeps a picture of herself being lifted off the ground by several Nepali police during a protest in 2008. She says that's the year things began changing for the worse for Tibetans. Others, including some Nepalese citizens, say the same thing in hushed whispers. 2008 was the year of the uprising in Tibet and subsequent crackdown by Chinese authorities on Tibetans, which sparked protests across the world and came as Beijing prepared to host the Olympic Games. At one of the official Nepal-China border crossings, trade is the main order of business. Nepali citizens freely travel to China, and as we found out, the Chinese freely cross into Nepal too -- and enforce their rules on Nepal's territory. We were approached by several men in plain clothes, who put their hands over the camera as we tried to film on the border. The men were speaking Chinese to one another and were clearly on the Nepalese side of the border. Nepal's border police were also there. Their security forces had warned us that if the uniformed Chinese police came over the bridge, we'd better watch out because our camera would likely get broken. However, the Nepalese forces didn't try to stop us from filming; nor did they stop the Chinese men from following us deep into Nepal's territory. The same men later followed us far into the streets of the Nepal border village, as we tried to talk to people there. We left unharmed and with all our equipment intact. The Nepalese Home Ministry declined to comment on issues involving Tibet. But one border police inspector who did not want to be identified told us above all else, China's main interest in Nepal is the Tibetan issue. For more than 20 years, the Nepalese government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has had an informal agreement when it comes to Tibetans who make it to Nepal with or without documentation. The Nepalese government agrees to allow Tibetans transit through Nepal to India, while UNHCR agrees to facilitate that. The current representative in Nepal says the government has not rescinded that agreement and officials continue to process newly arrived Tibetans to help usher them legally to India. The numbers of Tibetans coming to Nepal has declined dramatically since 2008, even as reports of unrest and self-immolations by protesting Tibetans continue to leak out of Tibet.

"Americans are sharply divided along racial lines as to whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged with murder in the shooting death of Michael Brown, a new CNN/ORC poll out Monday finds. Fifty-four percent of nonwhites -- including blacks, Latinos and Asians -- say Wilson should be charged with murder, while just 23% of whites agree. And 38% of whites say Wilson should be charged with no crime at all, while just 15% of nonwhites hold that position. The poll's results come as the grand jury prepares to make its decision, with an announcement expected Monday evening. Most Americans agree that Wilson should at least face some form of criminal charges, the poll finds. A combined total of 32% say a Missouri grand jury should charge Wilson with murder, while 25% say he should face lesser criminal charges and 21% say he should be charged with no crime at all. The CNN/ORC International survey of 1,045 Americans was conducted Nov. 21-23 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. There is broad 63% agreement that peaceful protests are justified if a grand jury doesn't indict Wilson for murder. But a racial divide exists over whether violent protests are justified in that case, with 22% of nonwhites saying yes while 10% of whites agree. Voices of Ferguson . The differences underscored the broader perceptions of prejudice among police officers. Only 19% of whites said some or most police officers in their areas are prejudiced against blacks, while 33% of nonwhites held that opinion. Half of all whites say that ""almost none"" or ""none"" of the police in their areas are prejudiced against blacks. Only 35% of nonwhites agreed with that view.

"Washington (CNN) -- When the nation's capital was turned upside down Friday with the announcement that Justice John Paul Stevens was retiring after 40 years on the federal bench, he was miles away from the political circus -- literally and figuratively. The 89-year-old justice was quietly working on his caseload at his Fort Lauderdale, Florida, condo, a second home that serves as his occasional refuge from the high-pressure atmosphere of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is doubtful his replacement will soon find any sanctuary in what could be a protracted fight over the shaky ideological balance of a mostly conservative high court. The 112th justice, by most measures, will have a tough act to follow, as he or she seeks to navigate the complex dynamics of a divided bench and gain a measure of the level of influence Stevens enjoyed for the past two decades and more. ""He is undoubtedly a leader on the court,"" said Diane Amann, a former Stevens law clerk who is writing a book about him. Names added to Supreme Court short list . She predicted President Obama will replace a liberal with a liberal, ""and although the vote change [on a 5-4 conservative majority] may not alter very much in the short run, the absence of Justice Stevens' leadership, his ability to build coalitions along people with very different ideas about things, will be something that will be hard to replace in the short term."" Short-term considerations drive much of the politics over who the nominee will and should be. Progressives worry Obama may not get another high court pick and urge him to name a forceful advocate for the left. ""The president now has an opportunity to name a worthy successor who will stand up for equal justice for all, not just the wealthy or powerful,"" said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, which describes itself as a national organization dedicated to advancing justice and democracy. The most important number at the court . The late liberal lion, Justice William Brennan, was noted for saying the most important number at the court was five, the votes need to command a majority on the nine-member bench. Such practical concerns also figure in the White House calculus over whether their nominee will pass Senate muster without fear of a filibuster. ""The court needs a consensus-builder just as much as it needs a progressive firebrand,"" said Doug Kendall, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, which describes itself as a ""think tank, law firm and action center dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of our Constitution's text and history."" ""President Obama's next nominee needs to improve upon [Justice Sonia] Sotomayor's performance by articulating the differences between judicial conservatives and progressives and focusing on how the Constitution and the law itself point in a progressive direction."" Administration officials quietly acknowledge the desire to excite liberals in an election year with an outspoken judge willing to take on the right. They also know Obama has his own liberal, but restrained. view of constitutional interpretation. Most of his federal judicial nominees thus far have been noncontroversial, center-left candidates. Many liberal activists say the president may be inclined to go the same route, choosing a nominee who will be spared a bruising confirmation. For their part, many conservative activists would not mind a fight, and their early rhetoric suggests they anticipate one. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group, warned Obama against ""packing the Supreme Court with rubber stamps instead of judges. To an activist judge, the Constitution represents an inconvenient truth that they will distort, ignore, or defy to push their radical liberal agenda."" Grudging acknowledgement . Some conservative groups grudgingly acknowledge Stevens' influence and his ability to pull conservatives like Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor onto his side in hot button-cases. When the chief justice is on the losing side of a case, Stevens -- as senior associate justice -- gets to assign who writes the all-important opinion. That opinion becomes the voice of the court, whence its strength and influence derive. O'Connor, for example, supported the liberal bloc in upholding affirmative action for college admissions in 2003 and was rewarded by being selected to articulate her view of the necessity, but also the limits, of diversity in school selection. That same year, Kennedy joined four liberal justices in striking down state laws that banned homosexual sodomy and wrote a forceful opinion. He also issued landmark rulings against applying the death penalty for juvenile killers and those sentenced to die for non-homicides. Stevens' willingness to put aside ego and to rule narrowly on hot-button cases -- combined with an unmatched cordiality and kindness -- earned him quiet power and respect. ""The distinctive thing about Justice Stevens that's going to be hardest to replace is his attention to the individual case and his willingness to decide it in a way that really isn't determined by ideology,"" said Christopher Eisgruber, a former Stevens law clerk and author of ""The Next Justice: Repairing the Supreme Court Appointments Process."" ""His intelligence, of course, has made him a very important contributor to that, but I think it's really that distinctiveness to his approach that will be toughest to replace."" In some ways, the nomination of Sotomayor last year represented perfect timing in a perfect political climate -- a president still in the glow of his first months on the job and the political desire to name a woman and a Latino that put other liberal constituencies at bay. She was a candidate with a sterling resume who deftly maneuvered her way to confirmation. This time will be different, when the options are wider. Some advocacy groups have weighed in. Groups already weighing in . ""We call on President Obama to nominate a woman to fill this seat,"" said National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill. ""The Supreme Court is out of balance, with women making up a mere 22 percent of the bench. That's simply not enough."" Who else has a stake? Should Obama: . -- Name a non-judge or politician? How about Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm or Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick? Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and Claire McKaskill, D-Missouri, are frequently mentioned. And supporters of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sing her praises, though the White House Monday tempered that talk by saying the president wanted her in her current job. --How about an articulate academic? Stanford Law School Professors Pamela Karlan and Kathleen Sullivan have earned progressive praise. --There are no Asian-Americans on the high court, or the federal appeals courts for that matter. Harold Koh, formerly dean at Yale Law School and now a top State Department lawyer is a Korean-American who would represent another history-making choice. ""The president doesn't seem to have the perfect-storm candidate this time that he did with Sonia Sotomayor,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a top Washington attorney and founder of Scotusblog.com. ""There's a delicate balance here. I think he's likely to appoint somebody who's more on the center left, someone like Sonia Sotomayor who the president believes really shares his values as a judge, but doesn't generate the kind of political heat that would disrupt politics over the summer."" Meanwhile, Stevens remains his usual apolitical self, detached from the political storm. As usual, he'll find time for his twice weekly tennis matches with his daughter. He returns to the bench next week for oral arguments, then will finish writing his remaining opinions. In two and a half months he will be gone from the court, but not forgotten.","CNN's Bill Mears says President Obama has tough choice to make .

"Same-sex marriage can move forward in Idaho after the Supreme Court on Friday refused the state's request to delay implementation. It was unclear when gays and lesbians in Idaho could legally wed, but the decision will make Idaho the 27th state to allow same-sex marriage. The high court's two-sentence order came after a federal appeals court on Tuesday found bans in Idaho and neighboring Nevada unconstitutional. There are an estimated 7,000 or more same-sex couples in Nevada, according to UCLA's Williams Institute, a think tank conducting research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. Idaho officials had asked the high court to intervene on an emergency basis and block enforcement of the lower court mandate. Friday's order clears the legal hurdles, and gives another victory to supporters of marriage equality. ""I disagree with the court's conclusion, which negates the 2006 vote of the people of Idaho, is contrary to the values of most Idahoans, and undermines fundamental states' rights,"" said Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter.  ""But we are a nation of laws. Idaho now should proceed with civility and in an orderly manner to comply with any forthcoming order from the 9th Circuit."" With Nevada, same-sex marriage legal in more than half the states . A federal judge in North Carolina also ruled Friday that same-sex marriage can begin there. State officials earlier Friday had announced they would fight any such order. If eventually upheld, the North Carolina case would add further legal and political momentum to having same-sex marriage allowed in a majority of the United States. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to intervene in legal challenges over voter-approved bans in five states: Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin. That meant three separate appeals court rulings striking down those bans as unconstitutional would go into effect quickly in those states, as well as six others covered by those courts' jurisdiction. That would include West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming. A judge Wednesday in Johnson County, Kansas -- the state's largest county -- also ordered same-sex licenses to be issued. Kansas officials have since attempted to block the issuance of marriage licenses after the first and only couple successfully obtained a marriage license and wed in Johnson County on Friday, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas. The ACLU of Kansas filed a lawsuit on Friday against district court clerks in Douglas and Sedgwick counties for their refusal to issue marriage applications to two same-sex couples, the nonpartisan nonprofit organization said. ""The ACLU of Kansas understands that the freedom to marry is an important right. Marriage equality is the law in more than 25 states now,"" said Susan Estes, board president of the ACLU of Kansas, ""and it's time for marriage equality in Kansas. All loving and committed couples -- without restrictions of state lines or sexual orientation -- should have access to the protections that marriage provides."" Opinion: Supreme Court should act on gay marriage . With the addition of Idaho, there are 26 other states that allow same-sex marriage, following the Supreme Court's decision Monday not to review lower court rulings striking down voter-approved bans: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin, plus the District of Columbia. Eight more states could soon legalize it, after federal appeals courts issued binding mandates in recent months: Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, Montana, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming.","ACLU of Kansas files lawsuit to allow marriage for same-sex couples .

"One of the reported architects of the interrogation program blasted in a scathing Senate Intelligence Committee report has tough words  for the authors. ""It's a partisan pile of bull----,"" James Mitchell told CNN in an interview. Mitchell said he could not confirm or deny whether he was one of the key players referred to pseudonymously in the report -- citing a non-disclosure agreement he signed with the federal government. ""If they were truly interested in getting the truth out, they would release me from it,"" said Mitchell, adding that he would be happy to talk. The report describes two psychologists who developed the interrogation program, and later had received $80 million from the government to run it despite the fact that neither had ""specialized knowledge of al-Qa'ida, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise."" Related: Read the torture report . Senate report: CIA misled public, White House, Congress on torture . Several publications and a 2008 Senate report have connected Mitchell to the program, including a New York Times article Tuesday. ""The suggestion that the men and women of the CIA who put their lives on the line after 9/11 lied to the Senate, lied to the President and used bogus intelligence for some nefarious reason that's unknown,"" he said. ""People gave their lives to protect the American people. And the last thing the Democrats want to do as they leave office is to smear their memory. It's despicable."" The comments reflect the political divide over combating terrorism that is resurfacing after the Senate's report was released on Tuesday. The CIA -- and many Republicans -- are defending harsh interrogation tactics as vital to preventing terrorist attacks while most Democrats argue the programs violated American values. Mitchell said the report has a ""hindsight bias."" At the time, CIA officials ""were in a running gun battle with a group that they knew very little about and they did the best they could given the information that was available."" He seemed to defend interrogation techniques such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation. ""Nothing was done to those detainees that aren't done to our servicemen and women, and women, by our own training programs,"" he said. ""I think it's a national discussion. The administration and the people of the United States really have to ask themselves if whether in a situation like immediately after 9/11 they think it's a good idea to let them lawyer up.""","Reported 'architect' of CIA interrogation techniques slams torture report .

"A former FBI agent who went missing in Iran was working for the CIA there, not conducting private business as officials have previously claimed, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Both the State Department and Bob Levinson's family have long denied he was working for the U.S. government when he disappeared on a trip to Iran in 2007. But Thursday's reports from the Washington Post and the AP claim that Levinson had been on a CIA mission to dig up information. A source who's involved in the matter told CNN that there's proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover and under contract while also working as a private investigator. The AP says it decided to move forward with publishing the sensitive story after holding off several times. ""The AP first confirmed Levinson's CIA ties in 2010 and continued reporting to uncover more details. It agreed three times to delay publishing the story because the U.S. government said it was pursuing promising leads to get him home,"" the news agency said in its report. ""The AP is reporting the story now because, nearly seven years after his disappearance, those efforts have repeatedly come up empty. The government has not received any sign of life in nearly three years. Top U.S. officials, meanwhile, say his captors almost certainly already know about his CIA association."" CNN's source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the investigation, said that after six and half years in captivity and interrogations, it's more than likely that Levinson's captors know he was working undercover. ""The family is aware of the risk created by this story and are praying for his safety, as they have for six years,"" a Levinson family spokesman told CNN Thursday night. ""All they want is to bring Bob home."" In a written statement, the family criticized the U.S. government's response to the situation. ""Bob is a courageous man who has dedicated himself, including risking his own life, in service to the U.S. government. But the U.S. government has failed to make saving this good man's life the priority it should be. There are those in the U.S. government who have done their duty in their efforts to find Bob, but there are those who have not,"" the statement said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to step up and take care of one of its own. After nearly 7 years, our family should not be struggling to get through each day without this wonderful, caring, man that we love so much."" Officials contacted by CNN on Thursday declined to comment on any alleged ties between Levinson and the U.S. government. ""We have no comment on any purported affiliation between Mr. Levinson and the U.S. Government,"" CIA spokesman Chris White said. ""The U.S. Government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family."" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden criticized the AP for publishing the story and said it ""does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home."" ""Without commenting on any purported affiliation between Mr. Levinson and the U.S. government, the White House and others in the U.S. Government strongly urged the AP not to run this story out of concern for Mr. Levinson's life,"" she said. ""We regret that the AP would choose to run a story that does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home. The investigation into Mr. Levinson's disappearance continues, and we all remain committed to finding him and bringing him home safely to his family."" Other detained Americans . AP: 'One of the biggest scandals in recent CIA history' The agent-turned-security-consultant was last heard from on March 8, 2007, when he checked into a hotel on Iran's Kish Island and then checked out to return to the United States the next day. From the start, the CIA and the State Department denied there were any government ties to Levinson's trip. And Levinson's family said he had been in Iran on private business investigating cigarette smuggling. But the Washington Post and AP reports differ sharply from public government descriptions. After Levinson's disappearance, the Washington Post and AP reported, CIA officials initially downplayed his ties with the agency and said he did not go to Iran for the agency. ""But months after Levinson's abduction, e-mails and other documents surfaced that suggested he had gone to Iran at the direction of certain CIA analysts who had no authority to run operations overseas,"" the Washington Post story says, citing officials. ""That revelation prompted a major internal investigation that had wide-ranging repercussions at Langley."" The AP's story describes the situation as ""one of the biggest scandals in recent CIA history."" According to the reports, the CIA changed how analysts work with contractors as a result. And the agency paid $2.5 million to Levinson's family, the Washington Post and AP said. Source: CIA apologized to family . CNN's source said that David McGee, a family friend who used to be a federal prosecutor in Florida, helped find the documents that proved Levinson's CIA connection. Ever since Levinson's disappearance, McGee had been trying to do whatever he could to locate his friend. With the help of his paralegal, McGee found e-mails exchanged between a CIA analyst and Levinson. The e-mails discussed Levinson's 2007 trip to Iran, the source said. And more importantly, they revealed the trip had a CIA connection, as the AP and the Washington Post reported. McGee took the e-mails to the Senate Intelligence Committee and to Sen. Bill Nelson from Levinson's home state of Florida, a committee member at the time, the source said. At first, the source said, the CIA denied any involvement. ""As a result of the documents, they conducted an investigation and discovered it was true,"" the source said. A CIA representative asked to meet Levinson's family in Pensacola, Florida, the source said, and ""personally apologized on behalf of the CIA."" McGee met with the CIA and negotiated a $2.5 million settlement with Levinson's family to fend off a lawsuit, the source told CNN. But all the while, in public statements, the U.S. government continued to deny any ties between Levinson and the CIA -- work that, according to the AP and Washington Post reports, was done off the books. As a results of the investigation, three CIA employees were fired and seven others were disciplined, the source said. At least two of the three people fired have been rehired by other government agencies, a source told CNN, confirming information first reported by the AP. ""They fired their own people and then took care of them,"" the source said. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the matter, according to the source. So far, the source said, no one has been charged. Justice Department spokesman Andrew Ames declined to comment. Where is Levinson? Levinson's whereabouts remain unclear. During an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in September, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani offered little when asked what he could tell Levinson's family. ""We don't know where he is, who he is,"" Rouhani said. ""He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him."" In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia. This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, ""we have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate."" Last month, Levinson became the longest held American hostage in history. At the time, Levinson's family members told CNN's New Day that they were worried because they haven't had any word since they received five photos in 2011. The pictures show Levinson in an orange jumpsuit, holding messages. ""We have not received any recent information about him,"" said his wife, Christine Levinson, ""although I do believe he is safe and will come home to us soon.""

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels have looted and burned homes and abused civilians, a human rights group said Wednesday. The New York-based Human Rights Watch said that, in ""four towns captured by rebels in the Nafusa Mountains over the past month, rebel fighters and supporters have damaged property, burned some homes, looted from hospitals, homes, and shops, and beaten some individuals alleged to have supported government forces."" The accusations came as rebel forces inside Libya managed to retake a village from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces, and rebel leaders were in Europe meeting with NATO officials and the European Commission. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the executive board of the opposition Transitional National Council, said the complaints represent only a ""few incidents"" that ""took place in the very early days of the revolution, and we've been investigating those cases. We are against any human rights violation whomever is the source of those violations."" Those responsible are ""going to be brought to justice,"" he vowed. Jibril spoke at a news conference after meeting with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels, Belgium. In the news release announcing the accusations, Human Rights Watch said its representatives had ""witnessed some of these acts, interviewed witnesses to others, and spoke with a rebel commander about the abuses."" ""The rebel military commander in the Nafusa Mountains, Col. El-Moktar Firnana, admitted that some abuses had taken place after rebels captured the towns, but said such attacks violated orders issued to the rebel forces not to attack civilians or damage civilian property. He claimed that some people had been punished, but did not say how many people or for what offenses,"" Human Rights Watch said. The group also noted that it has ""documented repeated indiscriminate attacks by government forces on civilian areas"" and the use of landmines. Inside Libya on Wednesday, rebels lost and then regained control of Qawalish, a village in the western part of the country. A CNN crew close to Qawalish witnessed the events, including the rebels' five-hour battle to retake the village. Eight rebels were killed and 30 were wounded, according to hospital sources in nearby Zintan. Qawalish lies along a major north-south highway leading to Tripoli, which rebel leaders say Gadhafi forces have been using to bring in arms from other parts of Africa. The rebels want to cut off the supply chain. A rebel commander told CNN his forces would advance another 10 km (6.2 miles) and then stop, because they do not have enough fighters and ammunition to go farther. Reinforcements were heading in. Almost all civilians had already fled the area around Qawalish. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a statement Wednesday after what NATO called ""an informal meeting"" with members of the Transitional National Council in Brussels. ""The members of the Transitional National Council thanked us for the mission's indispensable humanitarian role,"" he said. ""And they briefed us on their vision of their country's future -- one based on democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."" Some rebel leaders in Libya have criticized NATO for not doing enough to halt Gadhafi's forces. Rasmussen said the two groups agreed ""that NATO's operations to protect civilians must continue. Gadhafi's forces are still threatening innocent people. And as long as that threat continues, we must continue to deal with it."" Gadhafi's regime ""has lost all legitimacy,"" and there must be ""a political solution,"" Rasmussen said, ""for the people of Libya -- who have the right to live without violence and fear; the right to plan their own future; and whose legitimate aspirations must be met."" The British Ministry of Defense said British Army helicopters struck Gadhafi troops ""engaged in the repression of the civilian population of western Libya"" on Tuesday. In a statement issued Wednesday, the ministry said ""Apaches targeted three vehicle check points, which had been located in advance by intensive NATO reconnaissance operations and were being used to prevent free movement by local people. At each check point, military vehicles and structures were identified and successfully engaged using Hellfire missiles and cannon fire, as well as infantry positions. In total, four military structures and seven vehicles were destroyed, including at least one multiple barrelled rocket launcher.""

"It's a view of the Michael Brown shooting we hadn't seen before, but could it be enough to shape the way a grand jury handles the controversial case? An exclusive video first broadcast Wednesday on CNN shows two construction workers' reactions just after a police officer shot the unarmed African-American 18-year-old last month in Ferguson, Missouri. The contractors shown in the short video clip told CNN they saw Brown with his hands up as Officer Darren Wilson pursued him and opened fire. Several legal analysts describe the video as a ""game changer."" Others said it might not make much of a dent in the case.​ . Here are three reasons legal analysts told CNN the video could be important: . 1. The witnesses it depicts are white and don't live in Ferguson. The race of the witnesses shouldn't matter, but it could for the grand jury that's investigating the case, said Mark Geragos, a CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney. There are nine whites and three African-Americans on the 12-member panel tasked with deciding whether Wilson, who is white, should be charged. ""You now have some witnesses who the majority of this grand jury are going to better relate to. I hate to say it, but that's the reality of it, and that's why it's a game changer to me,"" Geragos said. 2. It shows their reactions shortly after the shooting. Lots of people have come forward with their accounts of what happened the day Wilson shot Brown. But it's significant to have the immediate reactions of two witnesses on tape, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. In the video, one of the construction workers raises his arms in the air -- just as, the contractor says, Brown was doing when he was shot. ""You have practically in real time someone discussing what they saw, and that's just good evidence,"" Toobin said. 3. Their observations echo other witness descriptions. Some witnesses say the teenager assaulted the white officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun; other witnesses say Wilson was the aggressor. This isn't the first time we've heard witnesses say Brown's hands were up. When eyewitnesses' accounts coincide, that's a key part of building a case for prosecutors, said Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. ""They're saying that he was running from the police officer and that his hands were up,"" she said. ""I don't know what other witness testimony at this point or account we have to hear. The bottom line is having your hands up is the universal sign for surrender."" But she criticized claims that the testimony of white witnesses from outside the community would be more valuable. ""Five other witnesses from the community said the exact same thing, and it is befuddling to me how with these two witnesses, suddenly this is a game changer,"" she said. Analysts also gave several reasons to be skeptical the video will have much of an impact: . 1. The witnesses didn't see how it all started. The men depicted in the video, who asked not to be identified after CNN contacted them, say they were standing about 50 feet away from Brown and Wilson. They say they couldn't see how the altercation between the teenager and the police officer began. ""You have to look at where they're standing,"" said Neil Bruntrager, general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association. The angle the video was shot from is important, he said, adding that it seemed like the witnesses were more like 100 feet away from the shooting. ""They couldn't have seen everything,"" he said. 2. There's a lot more evidence we haven't seen. Officials have said it could take months for the grand jury to review all the evidence in the controversial case. And there's a lot of things that could shape the direction the case takes, Geragos said, such as Wilson's initial account immediately after the shooting and forensic investigations about where the shell casings from his gun fell. ""Somebody's going to go through and do a detailed analysis of all that,"" Geragos said. 3. It doesn't show the shooting. Even though it's valuable to see the aftermath, the video doesn't show the shooting itself. If Wilson's charged, that could give his defense an opening, Geragos said. An attorney for the man who filmed the video told CNN he started recording about 40 seconds after the shooting. The video shows an officer putting up crime scene tape -- a sign, Bruntrager says, that it could have been made ""well after the shooting."" ""What you have is a conversation that's occurring after the fact,"" he says.

"The United States said Thursday it has proof that Russia is firing into Ukraine. Also Thursday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and his Cabinet announced their resignation in what Ukrainian political experts said was an expected development. Yatsenyuk and his Cabinet will remain in place as an acting government until elections in October. The Ukrainian government has been battling pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. More than 400 people have died in the fighting, the government has said. ""We have new evidence that the Russians intend to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatist forces in Ukraine and have evidence that Russia is firing artillery from within Russia to attack Ukrainian military positions,"" said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. Two U.S. officials said earlier that Russian troops have broken up into smaller groups and moved closer to the Ukrainian border. In the political realm, Yatsenyuk told Parliament that he was announcing his resignation after the blocking of government initiatives and the collapse of the coalition. ""At the moment my government does not have the answer"" to numerous questions, including how to keep paying government salaries, military expenses and families of flight victims. A ""collapsed coalition has consequences,"" he said. The Prime Minister's announcement comes as more bodies from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 arrived in the Netherlands.

Among other developments Thursday: . -- A Ukrainian journalist working as a freelancer for CNN has been detained by pro-Russian rebels. Armed men from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic seized Anton Skiba outside a hotel Tuesday in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk. An official with the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic initially accused Skiba of ""terrorism"" and of posting cash rewards for the killing of rebel fighters on his Facebook page. Later the official dropped the accusation about the Facebook posts and said Skiba was being questioned for having multiple forms of identification with different surnames. On Wednesday, another high-ranking separatist official told CNN that Skiba admitted to being a ""Ukrainian agent."" CNN initially chose not to report on Skiba's detention while making efforts to secure his release. -- Planes bearing the dead from Flight 17 arrived in Netherlands for a second day. Aircraft carrying the remains of as many as 74 people touched down Thursday at a military base in Eindhoven. Forty wooden caskets were flown in Wednesday and greeted by somber, moving tributes across the country. Of the citizens from 10 countries who died on Flight 17, the majority, 193, were Dutch. What happens to the victims' bodies next? 'Black boxes' in the UK . It took days for Ukrainian rebels who control the area of the crash site to hand over the bodies and the airliner's black boxes to Malaysian officials. The voice and flight data recorders are now in Britain for what will be a detailed scouring by international analysts that could take weeks. On Wednesday, investigators found that the cockpit voice recorder was damaged, but its memory was intact. There was no sign of tampering. But Dutch crash investigators leading the inquiry said Wednesday they still don't have everything they need and haven't been able to visit the crash site under safe conditions to carry out their work. It's happened before: MH17 tragedy was part of a bigger air war . Who are Ukraine's pro-Russian rebels? Australia has sent 50 police officials to London in advance of their joining a possible international deployment to eastern Ukraine to secure the crash site, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday. Did rebels have missile system? Accusations continue to fly over who was responsible for shooting down Flight 17. One pro-Russian rebel commander further complicated the picture by appearing to acknowledge that rebels had in their possession the type of surface-to-air missile system that U.S. officials say was used to bring down Flight 17. Since the crash a week ago, rebel leaders have repeatedly denied that they had an SA-11, or Buk, missile system, at their disposal. But in an interview with the news agency Reuters, Alexander Khodakovsky, the commander of the Vostok Battalion in Donetsk, said he knew about the missile system. ""I knew that a BUK came from Luhansk. At the time I was told that a BUK was coming from Luhansk under the flag of the LNR,"" Khodakovsky told Reuters, making a reference to the Luhansk People's Republic, the principal rebel group in Luhansk. Luhansk is one of two rebel provinces in eastern Ukraine. The other, Donetsk, is where Flight 17 came down. ""I found out about it when I found out that this tragedy happened. Most likely it was brought back in order to conceal the evidence of its presence,"" Khodakovsky said in the Reuters interview, which took place Tuesday and was published Wednesday. He accused the Ukrainian government of provoking ""usage of this kind of weapon against a plane with civilians which was flying by."" But Russian media later reported that Khodakovsky later denied that he confirmed that rebels had the missile system, saying his comments were taken out of context. He told the news outlet RT that he was only discussing theories with Reuters and that he did not have information on such a weapon. Reuters said it is sticking by its story.

"A distressed-looking woman sits on a bed in a dark hotel room. A caption reads, ""Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation."" Prominently on display at a busy Denver intersection, the billboard is a warning about the dangers of marijuana-infused edibles. ""With edibles, start low and go slow,"" it reads. It's part of a public education campaign launched Wednesday by the marijuana advocacy group, Marijuana Policy Project, urging adults to consume pot responsibly in states where marijuana is legal. The woman on the billboard, red-headed with her forehead in her palm, is an allusion to Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New York Times who wrote in June that a ""bite or two"" of a chocolate-caramel candy bar left her ""curled up in a hallucinatory state"" for eight hours. ""The problem is that people have just never really been educated about the actual effects of marijuana and marijuana products. They've simply been told to never use it and they are stupid if they do. And that's not a very useful education,"" said Mason Tvert, spokesman the Marijuana Policy Project. Serious concerns over marijuana edibles have surfaced since Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use. There have been at least two reported deaths following the consumption of marijuana-infused edibles. A 19-year-old foreign exchange student fell from a balcony and died after consuming a cannabis cookie in March. About a month later, a man allegedly shot and killed his wife while reportedly high on pot and other drugs. The victim told a 911 operator moments before the shooting that her husband was scaring her and their children after eating some marijuana-laced candy. Dowd described her own personal experience of eating too much of a marijuana-infused candy bar: . ""I was thirsty but couldn't move to get water. Or even turn off the lights. I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I didn't answer, he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy."" The column gained national exposure, not all of it positive as many pot advocates and late-night hosts mocked the columnist. Her experience was the inspiration behind the new ""Consume Responsibly"" billboard campaign, organizers say. ""Like most Americans, Ms. Dowd has probably seen countless silly anti-marijuana ads on TV, but she has never seen one that highlights the need to 'start low and go slow' when choosing to consume marijuana edibles,"" Tvert said. With edibles, it takes longer to feel the effects of THC, marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, which can lead people to eat too much, then being hit hard by serious side effects that include delirium and psychosis. ""If you smoke (marijuana) it's in your brain almost immediately. So, the effects start very rapidly. You can have an edible and not feel much right away. Up to an hour or two hours, three hours later you can start feeling the effects. It's slower onset, and it lasts longer,"" said Paula Riggs, director of the division of substance dependence at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Colorado state regulators are looking into stricter requirements for marijuana edible manufacturers that include better labeling and limiting each package to a single dose, about 10 milligrams of THC. Currently, marijuana dispensaries are selling recreational pot products that contain up to 100 milligrams of THC in a single candy bar. Tvert said he hopes people see the billboard and take the time to really educate themselves about marijuana edibles.  The billboard directs people to the campaign's website, consumeresponsibly.org, which has information about marijuana laws, products and their effects, including negative effects like ""increased heart rate and a sense of paranoia."" Campaign organizers also plan to put out print and online ads, along with educational materials in marijuana dispensaries.","Marijuana Policy Project aims to educate people on the dangers of marijuana edibles .

"Six journalists were taken into custody while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday and early Tuesday, aggravating what one press freedom group has called a ""concerted, top-down effort to restrict the fundamental First Amendment rights of the public and the press."" The incidents bring the total number of journalists arrested during the mid-August protests to 11. Other journalists reported being threatened with arrest and affected by tear-gas on Monday night. Authorities tried to restrict members of the news media to a designated area away from the protests, sometimes nicknamed a ""press pen."" The latest arrests came on the same day that President Barack Obama reaffirmed his support for journalists on the ground in Ferguson. ""Let me also be clear that our constitutional rights to speak freely, to assemble, and to report in the press must be vigilantly safeguarded, especially in moments like these,"" the President said at a Monday afternoon news conference. A couple of hours later, Getty Images photographer Scott Olson was arrested. Getty, one of the main suppliers of photos to news outlets around the world, immediately condemned the police action. Olson was released without charge after a few hours. Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president for news, said in a statement that Olson later told him:  ""I want to be able to do my job as a member of the media and not be arrested for just doing my job."" Kerry Picket, a reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News, was arrested around the same time as Olson. She was held for ""several hours,"" the website said. ""Picket was released when it was discovered that the trooper misunderstood directions from his superiors and was told to not allow vehicle traffic through but to allow foot traffic through. Both the arresting officer and his lieutenant apologized to Picket,"" Breitbart News added. The first arrests of journalists came last Wednesday when Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post were arrested inside a McDonald's in Ferguson. They were released 45 minutes later without being charged. Three other reporters were detained for a few minutes on Sunday night. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . Last week, a number of press advocacy groups decried the initial spate of arrests. The American Society of News Editors called it a ""top-down effort to restrict"" First Amendment rights; the group's president, David Boardman said ""the police have made conscious decisions to restrict information and images coming from Ferguson."" Of course, Boardman added, ""For every reporter they arrest, every image they block, every citizen they censor, another will still write, photograph and speak."" Three journalists from German newspapers were also taken into custody on Monday evening. Two of them, Ansgar Graw and Frank Herrmann of the newspaper Die Welt, were detained for three hours and then released without any charges. ""This was a very new experience,"" Graw wrote, according to an English-language translation of his German-language account. ""I've been in several conflict zones: I was in the civil war regions in Georgia, the Gaza strip, illegally visited the Kaliningrad region when travel to the Soviet Union was still strictly prohibited for westerners, I've been in Iraq, Vietnam and in China, I've met Cuba dissidents. But to be arrested and yelled at and be rudely treated by police? For that I had to travel to Ferguson and St. Louis in the United States of America."" Another German reporter, Lukas Hermsmeier of the newspaper Bild, was arrested early Tuesday morning, along with Ryan Devereaux, a reporter for The Intercept, an online news start-up best known for covering NSA mass surveillance. Hermsmeier and Devereaux met Monday when they were seated in the same row on a flight to Missouri. John Cook, the editor in chief of The Intercept, said it was unknown why Devereaux was detained. ""But needless to say, it's an outrage that he was stopped and handcuffed by police in the course of lawfully doing his job on the streets of Ferguson,"" Cook said. Devereaux's last Twitter message before the arrest came around 2 a.m. ET Tuesday. ""So much smoke in this neighborhood right now, seems like the police succeeded in clearing out the rest of the demonstrators,"" he wrote. He said around 9:45 a.m. that he had been released. ""Out of jail. Too many still in there,"" he wrote. Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said at a news conference early Tuesday morning that 31 people had been arrested amid Monday night's protests. When asked about the journalists, he said, ""In the midst of chaos, when officers are running around, we're not sure who's a journalist and who's not. And yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I'm pretty sure. But some journalists are walking around and all you have is a cell phone because you're from a small media outlet. Some of you may just have a camera around your neck."" ""So yes, we are -- we may take some of you into custody,"" Johnson said. ""But when we do take you to custody, when we've found out you're a journalist, we have taken the proper action."" Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa informed Broadwell's attorney Robert Muse of the decision in a brief letter dated December 14. ""As the target of our investigation, we believe that it is appropriate to advise your client that our office has determined that no federal charges will be brought"" regarding allegations of cyberstalking, Assistant U.S. Attorney W. Stephen Muldrow wrote. Muse told CNN he was ""very pleased that the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa very promptly resolved this matter."" A source close to Broadwell said the letter had been received Monday. ""She's pleased with the prosecutor's decision and glad it's been resolved,"" the source told CNN. Read more: After Petraeus scandal, Broadwell grapples with 'normal life' Petraeus resigned November 9 after revealing that he'd been involved in an extramarital affair. U.S. officials said the FBI discovered Petraeus was involved with Broadwell, a woman who was under investigation for sending allegedly harassing and anonymous e-mails to Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who was friendly with Petraeus and his wife. Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus. During the investigation the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered she had classified materials. Investigators also searched Broadwell's home in North Carolina. Sources said the materials were technically classified but not highly sensitive. Still the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have not resolved whether Broadwell will face charges for having such materials in her personal possession. Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that issue has not been resolved. Broadwell, 40, wrote a biography of Petraeus, a retired general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later in Afghanistan. A former Army reservist, Broadwell's security clearance was suspended after details surfaced about her possessing classified materials. During the investigation it also came to light that Kelley and Army Gen. John Allen were exchanging e-mails, some of which might have been considered inappropriate. That matter was turned over to the Pentagon's inspector general for investigation.

"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... An Empire has spread across the galaxy, and the few remaining Jedi defend themselves against the Sith. At the same time, a dispute over trade and treaties is interrupted by ... General Luke Skywalker? A little confused? That's because these familiar elements from ""Star Wars"" lore are part of George Lucas' rough draft for the first movie (""Episode IV: A New Hope"" for the uninitiated), illustrated for the first time by Dark Horse Comics as ""The Star Wars."" The first of eight issues of the comic book series is out now. When Luke is a much older man, Vader doesn't wear a helmet, Han Solo resembles a lizard and there is a character named Kane Starkiller, it might take some getting used to. But it's a fascinating part of movie history, no doubt. CNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew. CNN: What captured your interest when adapting this script? Rinzler: It's so similar and yet so different at the same time. All the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture. You've got Sith and Jedi, you've got a desert planet. You've got a planet with twin suns, an imperial city and a cloud city. When I read the rough draft, it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book. It's such a great story, George is a great storyteller. CNN: Was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago? Mayhew: Not at all. I've been in comics 20 years, and when I read the rough draft, I thought, I can make a comic of this tomorrow. It was just a very well-written screenplay, and that's what a comic book script is. This is genuinely George's first complete screenplay story of this tale, and it's wildly different. You can see why some of it was changed because there's no way they could have done it. It was just too ambitious. When you look at movies now like ""Avatar"" and ""The Avengers,"" it seems prophetic. Audiences expect all that action and set pieces, and one thing after another. I'm sure back then they looked at this and thought, ""What's this guy thinking?"" The other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love. Darth Vader is kind of a general, he's one of the main heavies but he's not a lord of the Sith. Here, Vader is really three characters: General Vader, this Lord of the Sith named Valorum, and this mechanical man. You think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins. CNN: What do you think fans will take away from this book? Rinzler: Based on early fan feedback from the first issue, they're really enjoying this alternate universe, and they're getting to read a story that's being told by George. Even through my adaptation, you feel his voice. You see many of the things you love in ""Star Wars"" but in a slightly different way. You have the Tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars, except it's not a Tusken raider, it's a different character. Fans are saying they're reading it two or three times to take it all in. Mayhew: This to me is the greatest ""what if"" story in comics. What if this made it to the screen? The mind reels at the possibilities. CNN: Is there one particular thing that is farthest away from the ""Star Wars"" we know and love? Rinzler: Everyone seems to latch onto the fact that Han is a big green alien. That's pretty far! He doesn't have his own ship. His character is probably the most different, although he can already talk to Wookies. It's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out, in a way. What's really fun is that R2-D2 talks in this one. There's a couple of points where I felt like ""R2-D2 should say something here,"" and I added a line and that was really fun. Mayhew: The characters in this story are much different than the characters in ""Star Wars."" The relationships are a lot different and to me, more intense. Leia's story is a little more complicated, and she's more a part of the action. Annikin is more of a trained Jedi than Luke was. The older General Skywalker to me is so much cooler than Obi-Wan. This character is like Captain America, a bigger than life hero. CNN: Is there a possibility that this alternate version of ""Star Wars"" could live on beyond these eight issues, at least in the fans' minds? Rinzler: Fans have been asking already about this, because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue, about the past, or characters in the periphery, or just spoken of and not seen. They'd love to see those mysteries explained, but we have a little movie called ""Episode VII"" coming up and that will take precedence. 'Star Wars' cinematographer Gilbert Taylor dies at 99 . J.J.

"""El-mo. We won't go!"" The twist on a popular protest chant echoed Saturday as people marched -- many in costume or with puppets -- in support of public broadcasting. The so-called Million Puppet March in Washington was inspired by comments GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney made during the first debate. Romney promised to stop funding to the Public Broadcasting Service, home to ""Sesame Street"" and Big Bird. Protesters met at Lincoln Park and marched to the Capitol Reflecting Pool. ""We came down to support PBS and to support freedom of speech in our nation's capital,"" said Jim Brett, who went to Washington with his kids, along with various puppets. Will Big Bird be downsized? ""PBS is important to me because I grew up on it,"" he said. ""It's a foundation for our children today."" One protester held a placard that read, ""Hundreds of channels to influence consumers! Zero channels to invest in citizens?"" Others were dressed like Cookie Monster and the Count, both popular ""Sesame Street"" characters. PBS is partially funded through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives about $450 million a year -- a fraction of this year's $3.5 trillion federal government spending. ""Sesame Street"" is produced by Sesame Workshop, which says 93% of its costs are funded by corporate sponsors and licensing. ""I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS,"" Romney said to Jim Lehrer, who moderated the first debate and anchors ""PBS Newshour."" ""I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird,"" he said. ""Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.""

"North and South Korea have agreed to reopen their joint industrial park on a trial basis next week, nearly five months after it was shut down, according to a press release from the South's Unification Ministry. The Kaesong Industrial Complex is seen as a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. According to the press release, ""companies will begin re-operation from September 16 on a test run."" The date was set after hours of intense negotiations between the two sides. The complex was shuttered in April by North Korea amid soaring military tensions. North Korea agrees to family reunions with the South . North Korea expelled South Korean workers and suspended activity at the zone, which sits on the North's side of the Koreas' demilitarized zone. But the tensions have since eased, and the generally secretive North recently allowed a large Western media contingent to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953. On August 14, the two sides reached a five-point agreement to open the complex. As part of the agreement, both governments said the zone's operation would no longer be ""affected by political situations under any circumstance."" The agreement also called for a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies hurt by the closing. The zone, which made its debut nine years ago, is considered an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime. About 53,000 North Koreans worked at more than 120 South Korean companies at the complex. It produced hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods yearly.","Kaesong Industrial Complex is seen as a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation .

"Actress Amanda Bynes appeared to tweet Tuesday that she's been diagnosed as bipolar and is on medication, but it wasn't long before that admission became less clear. Although the initial tweet about Bynes' presumed diagnosis was posted to her verified account early Tuesday, within hours, a separate tweet appeared to dispute it. ""I was at a friends apartment last night and one of my friends tweeted my phone ,"" the post said. ""sorry guys !"" It's the latest in a series of confusing missives from Bynes, who made headlines in October when she turned to Twitter with shocking allegations of abuse. Those posts, which accused her father of verbally, physically and sexually abusing her, have been removed. But the more recent tweets suggesting that Bynes, 28, has been diagnosed as bipolar were still visible on Tuesday. ""I was diagnosed bi - polar and manic depressive so I'm on medication and I'm seeing my psychologist and psychiatrist weekly so I'm fine :D,"" read one of Tuesday's initial tweets. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, causes intense emotional periods called ""mood episodes."" These range from manic (extremely happy) to depressive (extremely sad). The disorder often appears in the late teens or early 20s and can be controlled with medication. Bipolar disorder and the creative mind . Last month, Bynes was admitted to a Pasadena, California, facility on an involuntary emergency psychiatric hold, not long after she appeared to disavow responsibility for the accusations of abuse. ""My dad never did any of those things,"" said a tweet on Bynes' account on October 10. ""The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me."" Later, a conservatorship hearing was held in which case a judge ruled that her parents will have control over her cash. Mental health help: Where to turn . ""I need to get a restraining order against Sam Lufti,"" said another tweet posted to Bynes' account Tuesday morning, referring to celebrity manager Sam Lutfi. Yet another said her parents have limited her cash flow to $50 a day. ""I got discharged for not being gravely disabled,"" the tweet read. ""But i am conserved and my parents only give me $50 dollars a day and it's really annoying. ... I need to get an apartment and my parents won't give me access to any of my funds."" And so goes the latest chapter in Bynes' very public history of odd behavior and criminal charges. The ups and downs of Amanda Bynes . Bynes was arrested on a DUI charge in Sherman Oaks, California, in September. Her arrest report noted a ""disheveled appearance."" Bynes was charged with a hit-and-run in 2012, hospitalized for treatment last year after a psychological evaluation and put on probation after a DUI this year. And she was arrested after allegedly tossing drug paraphernalia out of the window of her New York apartment in May 2013. In September: Amanda Bynes arrested on DUI charge . The latest episodes of odd behavior come a year after her parents told CNN their daughter was ""making great strides towards recovery"" from mental illness.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- A day of strikes dubbed ""Black Thursday"" in France looked more like ""Gray Thursday,"" with officials reporting a mixed impact across the country. Commuters wait for a train at a metro station in central Paris on ""Black Thursday."" Union officials said 2.5 million people demonstrated across the country, while the Ministry of the Interior put the number at one million. No arrests or violence were reported, Paris police said. In Paris, all but three lines of the Metro subway system were operating Thursday, the RATP transport authority said. Buses and trains were operating normally with only slight disruptions, the authority said. Suburban trains lines into and around Paris were badly hit. At best, only one in five was operating Thursday, operator RER said. Public transportation workers and other civil servants planned the 36-hour strike over a range of concerns spurred by the world economic crisis. Specifically, workers are anxious about a range of problems, including low salaries, poor buying power and job insecurity. Their collective strike action challenges the way the French government has handled the economic crisis. Unions complain that the government has spent billions to bail out banks and the auto industry while allowing little of that money to filter down to workers. Students, teachers and government workers were striking alongside transportation employees. Under a law introduced last year, schools are required to provide a ""minimum service"" to ensure that children with nowhere else to go during a strike may still be able to go to school. The law doesn't require that classes take place -- only that caretakers are provided. Paris municipal authorities said it was difficult for them to ensure a minimum service Thursday because they were not given enough notice for the strike. City officials said a total of 90,000 children in the capital would be affected in some way. The strike began at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) Wednesday and is to end at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) Friday. Union officials plan to meet Monday to consider future strikes, they said. Hospital and postal workers, bank staffers, air traffic controllers and auto workers also walked off the job. Air France said it was operating 100 percent of its long-haul flights. In Paris. the airline said it suspended 30 percent of its short- and medium-haul flights at Orly airport and 10 percent at Charles de Gaulle as a precaution during the strike. The national state-owned railway SNCF said traffic was normal on trains from Paris to other European capitals such as London and Zurich. It said the national high-speed TGV trains were running normally in eastern France, with traffic at 50 percent to 80 percent of normal levels in other parts of the country. -- CNN's Jim Bittermann and Sujatha Samy contributed to this report.","NEW: French unions say 2.5 million protested government handling of economy .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A car bomb explosion near the airport in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killed two people and wounded four more Thursday, police Capt. Mohamed Hussein said. Those killed were civilians, and four security guards were wounded. The blast occurred when a suicide attacker drove an explosives-laden car into two bulletproof U.N. cars and detonated it, Hussein said. The area of the attack, Mogadishu's airport, is heavily guarded. It is considered one of the city's safe havens. No U.N. personnel were killed or injured, a U.N. spokeswoman in Mogadishu said. Terror network Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the attack. Spokesman Sheikh Abdiazia Abu Musab contradicted the U.N. spokeswoman and claimed that the blast killed three foreign U.N. employees. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States. It hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state by force but has launched attacks in other countries, such as Kenya and Uganda, that have killed dozens. The U.S. military conducted an airstrike in southern Somalia in late January against a suspected militant leader, a U.S. military official told CNN then. It is unclear if that leader was killed. On Wednesday, eight mortar rounds rained down on Mogadishu, security officials and witnesses said. No group has yet claimed responsibility for that attack.","Four others were wounded in the attack, officials say .

"Google Glass will help fight the antisocial and ""emasculating"" habit of compulsive smartphone checking, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said in a surprise appearance at the TED Conference Wednesday. In his 10-minute TED talk, Brin didn't provide concrete new details on Glass, a cross between a smartphone and a pair of glasses. But he did confess that, having used Glass, he felt emasculated and isolated every time he checked his regular smartphone. ""You're actually socially isolating yourself with your phone,"" Brin told the audience. ""I feel like it's kind of emasculating.... You're standing there just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. In contrast to a smartphone, Google Glass allows people to keep their head up as digital information is overlaid onto their world, no matter where their gaze is pointed. ""I whip this out and focus on it as though I have something very important to attend to,"" Brin added later, holding up his phone. ""This [Google Glass] really takes away that excuse.... It really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent secluded away in e-mail or social posts."" Opinion: Why life through Google Glass should be for our eyes only . Brin also said Glass helps advance a longstanding dream of his to let users receive highly relevant information without actually having to run searches. ""My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all — the information would just come to you as you needed it,"" Brin said.

"A Nebraska toddler who repeated a slew of profanities in an online video has been taken into child protective custody, Omaha police said Wednesday. While authorities found nothing criminal in the video, officials from the Omaha police's Child Victim Unit and the Nebraska Child Protective Services took the infant and three other children into custody on Wednesday, the police department said on its Facebook page. The joint investigation found safety concerns, the statement said. CNN learned of development through Twitter. In the video, the diapered child is bombarded with obscenities and racial slurs by the adults around him. The African-American toddler knocks down a chair and gives nearly as good as he gets, responding to some of the comments with an upraised middle finger and telling one of the adults at one point, ""Shut up, bitch."" The adults laugh and prompt him to repeat other crudities. Just another day on the Internet -- until the police union in Omaha, Nebraska, posted the clip on its website to highlight what it called the ""cycle of violence and thuggery"" the community faces. Police union draws fire over swearing toddler 'thug' video . The Omaha Police Officers Association came under fire from the city's police chief, the ACLU and at least one community leader. They say the move needlessly antagonizes the city's minority communities, who make up about a quarter of Omaha's 409,000 residents. Sgt. John Wells, the union's president, said the video was ""disturbing"" and ""offensive."" ""The focus here isn't on any particular ethnic group. The focus here is on the troubling behavior towards this child,"" Wells said. ""This behavior is going to potentially lead this child down a path that is completely unhealthy."" On the website where the video is hosted, the union said the clip came from ""a local thug's public Facebook page."" ""We here at OmahaPOA.com viewed the video and we knew that despite the fact that it is sickening, heartbreaking footage, we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in,"" the police union wrote in a post accompanying the video. ""Now while we didn't see anything in this video that is blatantly 'illegal,' we sure did see a lot that is flat out immoral and completely unhealthy for this little child from a healthy upbringing standpoint,"" it added. Wells said one of the adults mentions a local street gang in the video. ""That is why when we talk about the culture, the criminal culture, that this is to try to break the cycle and deal with the culture of violence and the culture of gang activity,"" he said. But in a city where police officers' treatment of minorities led to lawsuits, criminal charges against two officers and the firings and reassignments of several others in the past year, critics say the video is poking at raw wounds. Willie Hamilton, president of the community activist group Black Men United, said the union ""crossed a line by doing this."" ""For them to take a video out of context -- a 2-year-old who doesn't have the brain capacity to know what's going on --  and to say that this child, because two adults acted inappropriately, is going to end up in a life of crime is totally inappropriate,"" Hamilton said. And the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which filed an excessive-force suit against the Omaha Police Department on behalf of an African-American family on Monday, said the union's use of ""racially charged language"" was ""very disconcerting."" Police Chief Todd Schmaderer tried to distance his agency from the controversy in a statement issued Tuesday, saying that the union's website and Facebook page are separate from those of the Omaha Police Department and that he has little authority over the public statements of union members. ""With that background and understanding, I want to make it explicit and clear that the views expressed on the OPOA Facebook page do not necessarily reflect the official stance of the Omaha Police Department,"" Schmaderer said. ""I strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our community or an obstacle to police community relations."" Wells said union members have turned the video over to the department's child victim unit, which will work with child-welfare agencies to investigate the circumstances. He said the organization ""didn't think we'd get this big of a reaction."" ""Hopefully, the impact is, it gives law-abiding citizens what law enforcement deals with on a daily basis, and it sort of throws back the blinders that  these type of problems are going on,"" he said. ""And we can have a very frank and open discussion on how to tackle these issues and come up with solutions.""","Authorities say there was no crime committed, but safety concerns existed .

"A little more than two years ago, Ted Harada felt his left leg weakening, and he found himself quickly running out of breath. Doctors first thought he had asthma, but in May 2010 they told him he probably had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. In August 2010, doctors confirmed Harada, then 38, had the fatal disease, and he knew it was progressing. ""Every month they [doctors] could see deterioration,"" Harada said. ALS patients lose muscle function in the lungs until they can no longer breathe. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms, according to the National Institute of Health. The disease causes nerves to wither and the lungs to stop working. About 10% of ALS patients live 10 years or longer. Harada joined a clinical trial at Emory University in Atlanta, where doctors were injecting neural stem cells -- the precursors to nerve cells -- into the lower spinal cord of ALS patients. Before the procedure, Harada walked with a cane and would get winded just by walking to the mailbox.  He had to quit his job as a manager for a shredding company.  He was so tired he couldn't play with his three children. He was too weak to pick up his youngest child. He couldn't even open a Ziploc bag. Harada hoped the treatment would help, but he didn't expect it to. However, two weeks after getting the stem cell injections in March, he says he started to feel better. ""It's been nothing short of miraculous,"" he says. ""I cannot begin to explain the difference it has made."" He hasn't touched his cane in months, he says, and his breathing has improved. ""I was afraid I would wake up and the improvements would be gone,"" Harada said. Dr. Jonathan Glass, who is overseeing the clinical trial at Emory, and Dr. Nicholas Boulis, who invented the surgical procedure used to inject the stem cells, explained to patients that participation in the trial would not cure or even benefit them personally, but it would help doctors learn more about how to treat ALS in the future. The first phase of any clinical trial is to prove that a treatment won't injure patients, not that the treatment works, said Dr. Eva Feldman, who designed the clinical trial at Emory. The first part of the ALS study, sponsored by the Maryland-based biotech company Neuralstem, is designed to show that the surgical procedure to inject the stem cells into the spine is safe, and that the patients' bodies won't reject them. According to researchers, the cells did not harm any of the 12 patients in the Emory study, nor did they accelerate the progression of their ALS. ""I need to temper my excitement because it's a very small patient population,"" said Feldman, president of the American Neurological Association. But the facts are not discouraging. She presented early data from the study Monday at the neurological group's annual meeting in San Diego. ""We have cautious optimism that a few of the patients may have slowed in their progression of lower extremity weakness, and one patient may have improved,"" her report said. Of the 12 patients in the trial, two have died. John Cornick's disease had progressed further than Harada's by the time he received the stem cell injections in 2010. He was already in a wheelchair, and he knew participating in the clinical trial wouldn't cure him. But he told CNN in April 2010 that the only way doctors were going to figure out how to cure ALS was to have people willing to participate in clinical trials. ""For me it just seemed like the right thing to do,"" he said. Cornick died of ALS in May.  Another patient in the study, a 39-year old man, died of a heart attack. Feldman said the conditions of eight of the remaining 10 patients have not changed. Based on these results, she and her team in Georgia are asking the Food and Drug Administration to allow them to move to the next part of the trial: Injecting stem cells higher on the spine - into the cervical spinal cord, which is in the neck. Harada is optimistic that research like this will give other patients hope and lead to treatments in the future. He realizes he hasn't been cured, but it's like his clock has been set back, he says. He feels like he did when symptoms first started to appear in 2009. ""I know I still have ALS. I am so grateful for this gift regardless of how long or short it lasts,"" he said. ""I can go through most days without thinking I have ALS.""","Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms .

"(CNN) -- How does it feel? It's the subtitle of D'Angelo's biggest hit song and a question many are sure to ask the R&B singer after the release of his first album in 14 years. ""Black Messiah"" follows belatedly on the heels of ""Voodoo,"" the album that launched D'Angelo to superstardom in 2000. What took so long for ""Black Messiah"" to take shape? D'Angelo offered a glimpse into the cause of the delays and his legendary reclusiveness in a 2012 GQ magazine profile. The singer, whose full name is Michael ""D'Angelo"" Archer, opened up about substance abuse, weight gain and a car crash that kept him out of the public eye and his fans craving new music for years. Perfectionism in the studio stalled the new project even after the singer was able to put his demons in check. But with club appearances over the last few years, a performance at the BET Awards and a cover set at the Bonnaroo music festival in 2012, D'Angelo has eased back into the spotlight. ""Black Messiah"" was released at midnight on Monday morning, causing fans who never thought they'd see the day to praise the R&B gods. ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" bandleader Questlove, who collaborated with D'Angelo and his band The Vanguard on ""Messiah,"" deejayed a listening party Sunday evening. ""It's a passion project, and it's everything,"" Questlove told the audience, according to Rolling Stone. ""I don't really want to give a hyperbolic or grandiose statement, but it's everything. It's beautiful, it's ugly, it's truth, it's lies. It's everything."" D'Angelo has announced a 2015 European tour dubbed ""The Second Coming."" ""Black Messiah"" is D'Angelo's third album in a career that has spanned more than 20 years. His 1995 debut album, ""Brown Sugar,"" featured the hit ""Lady,"" which put him on the R&B map. With ""Voodoo,"" his popularity expanded beyond the R&B genre. The video for Voodoo's ""(Untitled) How Does It Feel"" helped transform the singer into a sex symbol and a highly sought after performer. It featured the singer on a stripped down set, bare from the waist up, singing directly to the camera. Fans were hooked, and the song netted D'Angelo a Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance. .","D'Angelo released ""Black Messiah"" on Monday .

"Militants carried out a deadly attack on Somalia's presidential palace Friday, officials and eyewitnesses said. An explosion at the gate was followed by an exchange of gunfire between the fighters and security guards, police officer Abdi Mohamed said. A U.N. representative said in a post on Twitter that President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told him by phone that he was unharmed. Terror network Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the attack. Somalia's national security minister, Adbikarin Hussein Guled, said at least 12 people, seven of them Al-Shabaab attackers, were killed in the attack . Two government officials who died were named as the secretary to the Prime Minister and the former deputy national intelligence agency chief, Gen. Nur Shirbow. Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman, said the group had achieved its objectives in the attack. The attack comes just over a week after a car bombing near the airport in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killed two people and wounded four more, according to police. Al-Shabaab also claimed responsibility for that attack. The group has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States. It hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state by force but has launched attacks in other countries, such as Kenya and Uganda, that have killed dozens.","Militants in Somalia carry out a deadly attack on the presidential palace .

"U.S. Sen. John McCain says this summer's ouster of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was ""a coup,"" a description that goes against the statements so far from the Obama administration. The White House has avoided using that term for the Egyptian military's ouster of Morsy. ""We have said we share the democratic aspirations and criticism of the Morsy government that led millions of Egyptians into the streets ... . We've also said that the circumstances of (Morsy's) removal was a coup,"" McCain told reporters in Cairo on Tuesday. McCain also referred to the ouster as a ""coup"" in July, but he chose to reiterate that description on Egyptian soil at a time when the country is roiling with unrest and violence in the ouster's aftermath. He and Sen. Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, met with officials there to press for a quick return to civilian life. The senators were visiting the country for the first time since its president was removed from office. McCain said they were not in Egypt to dwell on the past but to help the country move forward in a peaceful, democratic manner. He and Graham also urged the government's release of political prisoners. Graham said violence will destroy a future for Egypt, but he expressed optimism. U.S. aid to the country is one of the best investments in the world, he added. ""We're here to help find an Egyptian solution to an Egyptian problem,"" Graham said. For the past 35 days and counting, the country has been strafed with violence during protests by Muslim Brotherhood supporters against Egypt's military-backed interim government. McCain and Graham are expected to meet with government officials Tuesday. They'll also meet separately with the Muslim Brotherhood another time. The conflict erupted when Egypt's top general overthrew Morsy, who became Egypt's first democratically elected president in June 2012, after popular protests forced the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for 30 years. But a year into Morsy's term, many Egyptians wanted him out, too. That's when the military stepped in, naming an interim president and cabinet, who are laying the groundwork for a transition to a new, democratically elected government. But the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters want none of it, taking to the streets and demanding that Morsy be reinstated. Clashes between the two sides have left more than 200 dead.  Human rights groups have accused the military of using excessive force. Egyptian minister meets with U.S., EU diplomats about violence . No coup here . The stalemate puts Washington in a difficult spot. While widely labeled a coup, the Obama administration has refused to refer to Morsy's ouster as such. If the United States formally calls the move a coup, it would have to cut off $1.3 billion in aid.  And that ""would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the Egyptian armed forces,"" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said. The United States helps Egypt because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that have made peace with Israel. If Washington pulls its aid, it could affect prospects for peace in the Middle East. Egypt explained: 6 key questions . In the past 30 years, only Israel has received more U.S. aid than Egypt. The American senators, who are making the trip at the request of U.S. President Barack Obama, will press for an end to the political stalemate. ""The Egyptian military must move more aggressively toward turning over control to the civilian population, civilian organizations,"" Graham, of South Carolina, said when asked about the purpose of the trip on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. ""The military can't keep running the country. We need democratic elections. The (Muslim) Brotherhood needs to get off the streets and back into the political arena and fight your differences there, and we need to put Egypt back to work. If this continues, it's going to be a failed state. That's why we're going."" Embassies close in face of intercepted message .","Sen. Graham wants ""an Egyptian solution to an Egyptian problem""

"Oklahoma will seek the death penalty for Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman at his former workplace, District Attorney Greg Mashburn said in a court document Thursday. Nolen also faces an attempted murder charge in the stabbing attack on another woman, as well as a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, Mashburn said previously. Nolen should be punished with death, Thursday's ""bill of particulars"" states, because his crime was ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel,"" the defendant knowingly put multiple people at ""great risk of death,"" the defendant probably poses a ""continuing threat to society,"" and Nolen was previously convicted of a felony for using or threatening violence. Mashburn said Sunday that he would probably seek the death penalty after consulting with the victim's family. Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, is accused of carrying out the attacks last week at a Vaughan Foods processing plant soon after he learned he'd lost his job there. Nolen was trying ""to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible"" for his job loss, Mashburn said. The large kitchen knife used in the attack came from Nolen's home, Mashburn said. The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen ""was saying Arabic terms in the attack,"" Mashburn said. The Oklahoma Department of Homeland Security is also investigating the incident. ""That investigation is still ongoing, and it is unclear at this time whether the crime was an act of terrorism, workplace violence or a gruesome combination of both,"" Fallin said in a statement. Police said Nolen walked into the Vaughan Foods front office September 25 and attacked one of the first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54. He severed her head with a knife and then attacked Traci Johnson, 43. Johnson was one of three people Nolen was targeting, authorities said, and he wasn't able to reach the other two. Hufford was attacked despite not being one of the three intended targets, the prosecutor said. Court papers said Nolen grabbed Hufford from behind and ""immediately began cutting her across the throat with the large knife, with a back and forth sawing motion."" Nolen then grabbed Johnson and ""cut her across the throat and left side of her face with the knife"" in an attempt at a second beheading, according to a police affidavit. See copy of court papers and police affidavit (PDF) Mashburn said that while Nolen was employed at the plant, he made statements ""saying he didn't like white people,"" which prompted Johnson to file a complaint with the plant's human resources department. Mark Vaughan, the company CEO and a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, confronted and twice shot Nolen, authorities said. Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said. In unrelated incidents, Nolen was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, escape from detention and possession of marijuana, all in January 2011, according to court papers filed by prosecutors.","Document says crime was ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel""

"(CNN) -- While President-elect Barack Obama will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on January 20, he'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used during the inauguration of 1861. The 1861 Lincoln Inaugural Bible against the backdrop of the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress. The Constitution does not require presidents to be sworn in on a Bible, though almost every chief executive since George Washington has chosen to do so. Presidents have differed greatly, however, on the question of which passage the Bible should be opened to during the swearing-in ceremony. It brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage Obama will emphasize. If what is past is prologue, as Shakespeare famously wrote (a quote now engraved in front of the National Archives), he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance. According to Gleaves Whitney, a presidential historian at Michigan's Grand Valley State University, II Chronicles 7:14 was used for three swearing-in ceremonies: ""If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."" In this season of economic distress, however, the president-elect may prefer to follow the lead of Franklin Roosevelt. When FDR first took the oath of office in 1933, the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the Great Depression. ""Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,"" Roosevelt said in his inaugural address. Urging his fellow Americans to lend a helping hand, Roosevelt had the Bible opened to I Corinthians 13: ""And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."" Obama campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation's bitter partisan divide. ""We have never been a collection of red states and blue states,"" Obama said in his Election Night victory speech. ""We are, and always will be, the United States of America."" If Obama wants to stress that theme again on January 20, he may prefer to follow Bill Clinton's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the Bible to Isaiah 58:12: ""Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach."" Questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president's mind. Obama campaigned in part on a promise to end America's war in Iraq. Shortly after winning the White House on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in Vietnam -- Richard Nixon took the oath with a family Bible opened to Isaiah 2:4: ""And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."" With the polls showing an overwhelming majority of Americans convinced the country is on the wrong track, Obama might hint at a back-to-basics message by doing what Woodrow Wilson did in 1913. During his first inaugural, Wilson opened the Bible to Psalm 119, which concludes ""I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments."" Speaking of a return to basics, what about America's first president? What did George Washington do? Almost 220 years ago, in 1789, Washington opened the King James version of a Masonic Bible to Genesis 49:13 -- ""Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon."" Was America's first president trying to send a deep, profound message? Not exactly. It turns out that, for the nation's first inaugural, the Bible was hastily opened to a completely random page. The same thing was done 72 years later when Lincoln was sworn in. CNN's Brendan Polmer contributed to this report.","Barack Obama will be sworn in using same Bible as Abraham Lincoln .

"Washington (CNN)Mitt Romney told an audience of Republican donors in New York on Friday that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid. ""Mitt told the group of 30 or so guys that were there that he is considering a run for the White House and that they could go tell their friends,"" a source in the room told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the comments. Though his loyalists and supportive donors have floated his name as a potential candidate for the better part of a year, Romney himself has been more reticent about mounting another White House bid after his 2008 and 2012 losses. But Romney's outlook has changed in recent weeks, according to people who have spoken with him recently, and he seems to be more serious than ever before. Romney has kept in close touch with his donors, many of whom have become close friends over two presidential cycles, according to one source close to Romney who was not at the meeting in New York but is familiar with his thinking. Romney hosts an annual retreat each year in Park City for policy discussions—and used the two most recent gatherings in 2013 and 2014 to introduce them to potential 2016 presidential candidates including Rand Paul and Chris Christie. (Jeb Bush was invited to speak last summer, but could not attend because of previous commitments, including his father's birthday). Many of Romney's New York donors, who are in frequent touch with him, had suggested a lunch or get-together when Romney was in New York, which resulted in the meeting with donors on Friday as he was on his way back from Charlie Baker's swearing in as the new governor of Massachusetts, this person said. Former aides to Romney have said that his thinking about the race has evolved over several months, particularly after he had time to reflect on being back on the campaign trail for the midterm races. As former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has moved toward a bid, many donors had pressed him for a signal about his level of interest. ""He had not closed his mind on this, and today was the day that he decided to share that with the group of people he was with,"" the source familiar with Romney's thinking said. ""His conviction that the country is on the wrong track is very strong. He's very concerned with America's role in the world. Nothing has changed on that."" As far as re-entering the field for the Republican nomination, the source said, ""He knows he would have to earn it, he knows no one is handed the nomination, but he's giving it some thought....His head hasn't changed, I think he was just formalizing it a little bit,"" at the Friday meeting, the source said, to let donors know he was considering a bid more seriously. Romney's comments come in the wake of Jeb Bush's stepped-up political activity. Bush, Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — all favorites of the Republican establishment and New York donor community — would presumably draw from the same pool of financial backers. ""I think he is serious,"" said the person at the New York meeting. ""One of the first things he said he said was, 'People ask me, do you want to be president? Well, yes, I did run twice."" Romney said that his wife, Ann, is ""very encouraging"" about 2016, the source said, but his sons are split about the idea, the source who was in the room said. The source familiar with Romney's thinking also said Ann is ""supportive of it"" if that's what Romney wants. ""I don't think he would have come to this without talking to his family."" At the heart of this, this source adds, is that ""the state of the country hasn't settled for him. he won't be happy sitting on the sidelines."" The former Massachusetts governor told the crowd that a potential campaign would ""have to have a positive message."" He also said, somewhat obviously, that he ""would run a different campaign from what he's run in the past."" Romney entertained questions about the rest of the potential 2016 field but had only positive things to say about his would-be rivals, the source said. The news comes after a week chock-full of high-profile potential Republican presidential candidates taking the first steps toward announcing their candidacy for the 2016 election. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a Leadership PAC this week, just days after resigning his position on various corporate and nonprofite boards. And former GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee quit his show on Fox News last week to give 2016 some serious consideration. And CNN reported Wednesday that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is assembling a team for a potential 2016 presidential bid. The revelation of Romney's overtures to top GOP donors is yet another addition to the long-term game of footsy Romney has played with the media and other Republicans who would like to know whether Romney is in or out -- though it's certainly the most definitive and serious indication that Romney might actually launch a third presidential bid. Romney was rumored to be through with his presidential ambitions after a grueling 2012 run, but this summer he made several head nods that he was considering. Romney told the Washington Post this summer that ""we'll have to see what happens"" and said in another interview that the chances were very slim -- but conceded there was nonetheless always a chance. ""We never say never,"" Ann Romney said on CNN's ""New Day"" this summer. Gloria Borger contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney told donors Friday that he's considering a third presidential bid in 2016 .

"Satellite images of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility have again raised questions about whether the country has restarted its plutonium production reactor -- regarded by western experts as a key component in the development of a nuclear weapon. Researchers from U.S.-based groups examined satellite images from August 31. They showed two columns of steam rising from a building, believed to house the reactor's steam turbines and electric generators. The steam indicates that the reactor is in or nearing operation, wrote Nick Hansen and Jeffrey Lewis, in a 38 North blog post, a program of the U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS. Work to reopen the reactor progressed throughout this spring and summer, they wrote. ""This is something they (North Koreans) very much need to arm their arsenal, and that is really linked into what they see as marketing power on the international plane,"" Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, told CNN. ""Without this type of nuclear capability, or at least the perception of the threat of having nuclear capabilities, North Korea really has few bargaining chips."" But Pyongyang has gone down this path before. First completed in the 1980s, North Korea agreed to shut the Yongbyon facility in 1994 after backing down from a threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.  It restarted the reactor in 2002, before it was once again disabled in 2007 after a six-party agreement between China, the United States, North and South Korea, Japan and Russia. In April this year, North Korea stated that it would be ""readjusting and restarting all the nuclear facilities"" in Yongbyon, which includes the uranium enrichment plant and the reactor, the country's state-run news agency KCNA said. ""This work will be put into practice without delay,"" the North Korean report stated at the time. Analysts say it appears North Korea has fulfilled its word. David Albright and Robert Avagyan, from the Institute for Science and International Security, examined the latest satellite images and agreed the venting appeared most likely connected to the operation of the reactor. They also wrote last month that North Korea appeared to have greatly expanded a building used in the uranium enrichment process. The expansions and developments ""provide North Korea with the ability to expand its stocks of plutonium, as well as produce more highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons,"" wrote Albright and Avagyan. They estimated that North Korea would likely need two to three years to produce plutonium, which is essential in creating nuclear weapons. ""There remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons"" they added. ""If a shutdown is achieved in the next six months, the reactor would have produced very little plutonium.""","Researchers point to steam at North Korean facility .

"New York City's attempt to keep people from fattening up on sugary soft drinks, by banning some of them, would disproportionately hurt small, minority-owned businesses, according to the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation. The two groups have filed a joint brief supporting a lawsuit by the American Beverage Association in which they say New York's unelected Board of Health overstepped its power in approving the ban the sale of sugary drinks bigger than 16 ounces in certain city venues. Due to take effect in March, the ban is meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles, according to the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office. But many have decried the ban as a sign of the growing ""nanny-state"" and an unfair intrusion on personal freedom. It was passed in September by the New York City Board of Health, following weeks of intense debate. In their jointly-filed amicus brief, the NAACP New York State Conference and the Hispanic Federation repeatedly claim that small, minority-owned businesses will suffer from the ban while their much-larger competitors will get a pass. The ban will ""selectively and unfairly harm small and minority-owned businesses by discriminatorily preventing them from selling large 'sugary beverages' while allowing their large competitors such as 7-11 and grocery stores to carry the banned sugary beverages,"" according to the brief. Read more: New York businesses file suit against ban on large sodas . 7-Eleven -- manufacturer of perhaps the most iconic oversized drink vessel, the Big Gulp -- and other grocery stores and convenience stores will indeed be exempt from the ban, because they are regulated by the state, not the city. The uneven implementation of the ban will harm the very businesses that can least afford it, said Hispanic Federation spokesman Jose Davila . ""Any little thing is going to hurt them ... they're just subsisting,"" he said. The mayor's office reiterated its commitment to the ban on Wednesday, citing the prevalence of obesity among minorities as one of the very reasons why the ban is needed. ""The obesity crisis impacting the nation, and disproportionately affecting minorities, calls for bold action and we are confident support will grow as more people learn about the unique impact sugary drinks have on this epidemic,"" said Samantha Levine, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bloomberg. Coca-Cola has also donated thousands of dollars to an NAACP health education program called Project HELP, which included $75,000 over the past two years. The Hispanic Federation received an equal amount from the beverage giant in 2012, according to Jose Calderon, the group's president. ""If this was the first time that Coca-Cola had given us money, sure it would raise questions,"" said Hazel Dukes, president of the NAACP's New York chapter. ""But it's not the first time ... Coca-Cola has been supporting the NAACP national and locally through the years."" At 44.1%, non-Hispanic blacks have the highest rates of obesity in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mexican Americans have the second-highest at 39.3%. At a hearing in New York City Wednesday, an attorney representing the American Beverage Association laid the groundwork to request a stay of the ban, according to American Beverage Association spokesman Chris Gindelsperger. ""For an unelected board of political appointees to make decisions that will seriously harm the family-owned businesses I grew up with is unacceptable,"" said Councilwoman Letitia James, who has also filed an amicus brief in support of the American Beverage Association's suit, in a statement after Wednesday's hearing. In opposing the ban, both the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation stress that they acknowledge that obesity is a major problem for their respective communities, but that the ban is the wrong approach to the issue. ""We've been screaming bloody murder for decades now"" about an obesity crisis in the Latino community, Davila said. In their court filing, both groups contend the problem would be better addressed ""through education and community programs"" that ""encourage physical activity and a balanced diet."" In addition to justifying the proposal on health grounds, Bloomberg has cited cost-saving as an impetus for the policy. New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor has said.

"Andrew Wale is a writer and actor. His partner, Neil Allard, is a guesthouse owner. Together, they helped make history. After the clock struck midnight on Friday, the couple were among the first men marrying men and women marrying women in a range of ceremonies across England and Wales as a historic law legalizing same-sex marriage finally comes into force. Wale and Allard have long known they wanted to commit officially and have waited five years for gay and lesbian couples to be able exchange vows legally in their home country. That day has finally come. ""When we were born, it was illegal to be gay, let alone get married,"" Wale, 49, said during last-minute preparations ahead of the wedding. ""I didn't think about the possibility for most of my life. It is only really recently that suddenly the option seemed to be on its way."" The marriage law was the final victory in a long battle that has secured the same age of consent as heterosexuals and the right to adopt. England and Wales are among 15 countries as well as parts of the United States and Mexico that allow same-sex marriage. The Netherlands was the first in 2001, and last year Brazil, Uruguay, New Zealand and France also joined the list. 'They are equal' Going through final details with the wedding's organizers earlier this week, Wale and Allard said they were excited beyond measure. The same-sex marriage bill was published by Britain's coalition government in January last year. In July, the legislation was approved to allow same-sex couples to officially marry in England and Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron faced vocal opposition from some members of his Conservative Party. The Church of England also objected, and was given an exemption from conducting same-sex ceremonies. But in a shift in tone ahead of the weddings, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, leader of the world's 80 million Anglicans, signaled the Church of England would mount no more resistance to gay marriage among churchgoers as Parliament had spoken. ""I think the church has reacted by fully accepting that it's the law, and should react on Saturday by continuing to demonstrate in word and action, the love of Christ for every human being,"" he told the Guardian newspaper. In an article on Pink News, an online magazine that focuses on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered community, Cameron said this weekend marked ""an important moment for our country."" ""It says we are a country that will continue to honor its proud traditions of respect, tolerance and equal worth,"" he wrote. ""It also sends a powerful message to young people growing up who are uncertain about their sexuality. It clearly says 'you are equal' whether straight or gay."" A rainbow flag flew above government offices in London in celebration. Battles remain . Scotland, which will hold a referendum on independence from Britain in September, last month became the latest to give the green light to gay marriage. The fourth British link, Northern Ireland, has stated it does not intend to introduce same-sex marriage legislation. Gay couples in Britain have spent years campaigning for gay rights. Civil partnerships were introduced in England and Wales in 2005, effectively giving gay couples the same legal rights as heterosexuals. But campaigners insisted that only full equality would do. Unlike France, where legalizing same-sex marriage prompted fierce opposition from many social conservatives and the Catholic Church, there were no mass protests in Britain. But for all the joy the weddings will bring, discrimination and bigotry remain issues in Britain. In January, a local councilor was suspended from the anti-immigration UK Independence Party (UKIP) after blaming devastating floods on the legalization of gay marriage. ""We never really hold hands in the street, we're quite careful about those kind of things -- simply because it was always quite a dangerous thing to do. It's still not entirely safe. Our friends were beaten up six months ago for holding hands in the street,"" Wale said. ""Now I am feeling slightly more relaxed about that kind of thing. I feel I have rights to be affectionate with this person that I am going to marry -- otherwise what does it represent?"" A recent Yougov poll in Britain showed that most people support the new change in law allowing same-sex couples to marry, but a third still think gay people are treated worse than straight people. Making a statement . For Wale and Allard, the Royal Pavilion is where they met when they first started dating, so it was a fitting venue for the next step in their relationship. They put much thought into personalizing the ceremony, which was attended by friends from as far away as New York, and there was a cellist and songs sung by friends. The media also attended -- as with many of the first other same-sex weddings on Saturday. The attention has been so huge that the local council has even received requests from ordinary Britons from across the country asking to attend Wale's and Allard's ceremony. For the couple, exchanging vows is not just about making a statement to each other, but to the world. ""I think it's important to make those kind of statements, be visible, be proud of who you are and what you are in a world which seems to be stepping backwards in lots of different places,"" Wale said. ""There are gay people struggling to be allowed to form relationships."" Many couples getting married say they hope to send out messages of support to other gays facing discriminatory laws in their own countries. Last month, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison. In Russia,  a ""propaganda"" law bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it. ""There are a lot of countries where it is illegal. We can show other countries that we are stepping forward,"" Allard, 48, said, adding he felt lucky and privileged. Instead of gifts, the couple asked their guests to make a donation to Stonewall -- a charity that campaigns for equality and justice for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. ""I want the wedding day to be a fully celebratory experience but at the same time, I don't want to forget that it's a relative freedom,"" Wale said. ""We haven't reached the end of the line. There is still a long way to go.""

"There was a time when Thursday night on NBC was truly ""must-see TV"" -- and it was thanks to comedies. The lineups changed gradually over the years, but they always brought in huge ratings and trounced the competition. The golden age began in the 1980s with a lineup of classics including the top-rated ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Family Ties,"" ""Cheers"" and ""Night Court."" The 1990s brought the debuts of ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends,"" which went on to become two of the decade's top TV sitcoms. Those days are long gone. On Friday, NBC announced a new midseason schedule completely absent of Thursday night comedies. ""Parks and Recreation,"" the last of the string, is set to finish its run on Tuesdays. The new Thursday will have hit drama ""The Blacklist"" as its centerpiece. The day has been on the horizon for years. After ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock"" ended and ""Community"" was canceled, Thursday comedies began to dwindle. Shawn Pasternak, a hardcore TV watcher who posts his musings at @ShawnCP92, said ABC and CBS have made strides on Thursdays in recent years, loosening NBC's grip on the night. ""What was really interesting to me was what happened last season, when NBC made a concerted effort to sign NBC Must See TV Thursday alumni Sean Hayes and Michael J. Fox to very prominent sitcom deals, both of which flopped completely in the 9 p.m. hour,"" he observed. It's also a sign of changing TV viewing habits, Diane Gordon of The Surf Report said. ""Today's viewers watch TV in entirely different ways than they did in the 1980s and 1990s and broadcast networks are hit hardest by this change,"" she said. ""Many viewers, especially younger viewers, watch shows on demand via DVR and via streaming services like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon. This means there are almost no TV shows that are appointment TV like there were in the '80s and '90s."" That could have signaled the real end for NBC's comedy legacy on Thursdays. Nows, NBC's Monday hit drama ""The Blacklist"" will make the move to that night, following a prime showcase after the Super Bowl. NBC is hoping to make a ratings dent in ABC's Thursday night dramas, not to mention CBS' Thursday night comedy lineup, led by ""The Big Bang Theory."" This comes in a season where many of the canceled shows have been comedies, including NBC Thursday night shows ""Bad Judge"" and ""A to Z."" ""As a longtime fan of TV comedy, it's sad to see a broadcast network make this decision,"" said Gordon. ""I hope they're not permanently abandoning the Thursday comedy lineup.""","NBC announces that Thursday comedies will be replaced by drama in the new year .

"As vacation deals go this one isn't bad. The beautiful southern Spanish village of Genalguacil is offering free accommodation for more than two weeks during the summer peak season. There's a catch of course. The offer is open only to artists who must produce sculptures or other work during their stay, and bequeath at least one to the village. Call it ""Artbnb."" Long before Airbnb began undercutting hotels with cheap deals in other people's homes, this sleepy Andalucian community came up with it's own version. The biennial ""art encounters"" festival was dreamed up in the 1990s by a local mayor hunting for ways to turn Genalguacil from a dead-end village to a genuine tourist destination. Artists are offered cottages or other accommodation and all the materials they need to produce their work. Ambitious art festival . It seems to have paid off. The Andalucian village's immaculate streets of whitewashed houses -- and its contemporary art museum -- are now filled with dozens of works of art. And the idea has reportedly inspired proposals for a similar project in Canada. This August, to celebrate the festival's 20th anniversary, Genalguacil is hosting its most ambitious edition to date, with 10 selected artists receiving a stipend of €1,000 ($1,340) on top of their board and lodgings. Among those selected this year is Eugenio Merino, a controversial artist whose latest exhibitions have included mannequins of dead leaders -- including Spain's General Francisco Franco -- stuffed inside refrigerators, and one of President George W. Bush in the shape of a punch bag. This year's festival runs from July 31 to August 14.","Spanish village of Genalguacil offers free two-week stays to artists in exchange for their work .

"Thai anti-government demonstrators massed Wednesday outside the Prime Minister's makeshift office, a day after clashes with police in the streets of Bangkok killed five people. The protesters have been rallying in the city for months, demanding that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra step down. Their long-running campaign has deepened political divisions in Thailand, undermined the functioning of the national government and stirred outbreaks of deadly violence. The demonstrators want to rid the country of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who they say controls the government from self-imposed exile. They are calling for the creation of an unelected ""people's council"" to oversee electoral and political changes. 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand? Deadly clashes . With Thailand still scarred by a severe bout of civil unrest in 2010 -- in which a crackdown on pro-Thaksin protesters by security forces left scores of people dead -- police had until recently largely refrained from using force on the current demonstrations. But last week, police began attempts to clear sites occupied by protesters for months. Government officials said the protesters' actions were blocking public access to government services. The police measures encountered strong resistance from protesters in central Bangkok on Tuesday, and clashes between the two sides erupted into gun fire. Five people, including a police officer, died in the violence, and more than 70 were wounded. Police have suspended efforts to seize the protest sites for the time being, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, the national security chief. Protesters gather . The anti-government protesters, meanwhile, are trying to keep up the pressure on Yingluck by gathering Wednesday outside Defense Secretariat offices in the suburbs of Bangkok where the Prime Minister has set up a temporary office. She has had to relocate there after the demonstrators blocked access to Government House, the office of the Prime Minister and appointed cabinet ministers in central Bangkok. Thousands of demonstrators assembled near the Defense Secretariat compound, arriving by foot, on bikes and in pick-up trucks. Some of them waved flags and others blew whistles, a trademark of their movement. About 1,000 police officers in riot gear were positioned outside the compound. It wasn't immediately unclear whether Yingluck was inside the offices Wednesday. She gave a televised speech from there on Tuesday. Political uncertainty . The Prime Minister is also facing difficulties over her government's controversial rice subsidy program. Thailand's anti-corruption commission said Tuesday it was bringing charges against Yingluck over allegations she failed to act on warnings of corruption in the program, which paid farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems. Yingluck said Tuesday that the program had been successful and that there was ""no conspiracy to corrupt."" The current protests in Bangkok were sparked in November by Yingluck's government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray in earnest. Yingluck called elections in December in the hope that they wcould help ease tensions. But the main opposition party boycotted the vote earlier this month, and protesters caused widespread disruption, making the outcome of the election inconclusive. That has left Yingluck's caretaker administration unable to operate fully.","Demonstrators assemble outside the Prime Minister's temporary office .

"Ending energy poverty is central to my vision of a resurgent Africa. I am an entrepreneur -- one born, raised, and educated in Africa, creating businesses that span the continent. I have experienced how lack of reliable power has constrained human potential and stifled economic growth. Currently, 589 million of my fellow Africans have no access to electricity and many millions more lack reliable access. This holds back education, drives up the cost of business, and negatively impacts healthcare. We are a continent of entrepreneurs, some of the smartest in the world. But how many aspiring business people can really succeed, and create critical jobs, if they do not have light or the cost of electricity is more than 55% of the operating costs of their business? Last week I joined officials from the U.S. agencies, OPIC, USAID and EXIM, along with representatives from American corporations GE and Symbion Power, in testifying before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the progress of President Obama's Power Africa initiative. The program, launched last July, has set a goal of generating 10,000 MW of additional power in the next five years, and targets an initial six countries, my home country Nigeria included. Power Africa calls for $7 billion in U.S. financial support and has already leveraged an additional $9 billion in private-sector commitments. Recognizing the centrality of power to Africa's ability to sustain its own development, Congress is now looking to enact legislation that would ensure that the Presidential initiative defines the future of U.S. engagement on the continent. The House Foreign relations Committee last month passed the Electrify Africa Act which seeks to double the target of new generation capacity to 20,000 MW. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to introduce its own legislation in the coming weeks. In both houses of Congress there is broad-based bipartisan support. Power Africa has already served to focus the American private sector on Africa as the new frontier for energy investment and has encouraged African countries not selected as Power Africa countries to undertake reforms of their regulatory structures, so as to participate in future power deals and partnerships. My own company, Heirs Holdings, through our subsidiary, Transcorp, committed to invest up to $2.5 billion to generate 2,000MW of electricity over five years, 20% of the U.S government's initial goal. Our first transaction has been the Ughelli power plant in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The initial investment in the Transcorp Ughelli plant was $300 million. When we first took over the plant in November 2013, its power output was less than 160MW; today, that has been more than doubled. We project that Ughelli power plant will be generating 725MW by the end of this year. We are also partnering with Symbion Power and GE on a 1000 MGW expansion costing $1 billion USD. We are on track to fulfill our commitment to Power Africa and we will be producing the equivalent of almost half of the current total output in Nigeria. In 2015, we will begin plans to generate power in other West and East African countries. The program also has allowed African businesses to show to the world that they can be equal partners in the process. We are bringing capital and know how, creating genuine partnerships, which benefits all sides. I coined the term ""Africapitalism"" to describe our approach to business -- our belief that long-term investment in key sectors, like in power, can create economic prosperity and social wealth, benefiting investors and Africa's development future. Yet Power Africa must be viewed by the administration and Congress as only a start. The initiative is valued at $7 billion and Africa's power infrastructure needs are estimated to be $300 billion. So there is more that we all need to do. Congress should pass legislation before the end of this Congress to secure the expansion of access to electricity in Africa as a development and foreign policy priority. Given the long-term nature of investments in the power sector, these policies must by codified so that they carry over to the next Administration and the next Congress. Like the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act more than a decade ago, such legislation would lay the foundation for a new U.S.-Africa relationship: one based on partnership for mutual economic benefit and the empowerment of the private sector. The U.S. Government should also continue to encourage policy reforms by African governments and institutions. There is no amount of capital investment or entrepreneurial zeal that will provide affordable and sustainable access to electricity for Africa's one billion people, without the full buy-in and energetic support of African governments. Congress should also make engagement with the African private sector a priority in oversight and new policy-making. Public-private partnerships are critical to developing the African continent, particularly in the power sector. It is important to recognize the revolution that has taken place in the African private sector -- a sea change in terms of innovation, know-how and governance values. Corporate Africa has taken up the challenge. We have a long way to go, but like all long journeys, the journey to infrastructure sufficiency begins with the first step -- or, in this case, the first $300 million. We believe that the Power Africa initiative, which places Africans as partners in their own development, will help the continent to emerge as a strong player in the global economy and we are confident that history will remember those who played a role in making it happen.

"Starting a company can feel like a lonely business. But for a little more than $100 a month, Hong Kong resident Ken Chan can develop his start-up, network with like-minded people and relax with a game of ping-pong -- all under the same roof. He is one of a growing number of go-it-alone entrepreneurs and freelancers in Asia leaving their apartments and cafes, and settling into ""co-working"" spaces. At these shared offices, they get to work in what is usually a laid-back but professional environment. However, almost just as important for these nomadic workers are the social and emotional benefits of mingling with their own kind. ""Coming here, you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone,"" said Chan, who goes to the co-working space CoCoon, where he works on his Internet start-up, wholedaybuy.com. But Chan says not to underestimate the practical advantages of having actual office space in Hong Kong, where high rent makes a permanent office out of reach for many who are just starting out. ""If you want to meet a client, you want to have the space. It's a physical location to gather people,"" he says. Thought to have first started in San Francisco in 2005 with Citizen Space, co-working spaces are now widespread in the U.S. and Europe and are making headway in Asia, courting mostly people in their 20s and 30s working on projects solo or in small teams. There are now dozens of such places in Tokyo, and a handful have opened in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The congested cities seem ready-made for co-working, with cramped apartments that could make working from home unpleasant -- and unimpressive for investors or clients. And going it alone is just starting to catch on in Asia, where people traditionally strive to work for large corporations. ""It's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start-ups or being a freelancer,"" says Constant Tedder, the British founder of The Hive in Hong Kong, a co-working space that opened in May. The cost of going to The Hive ranges from $40, for a day pass, to over $750 per month for a dedicated desk. Tedder sees the demand throughout Asia and is looking to expand to other cities in the region. For freelancers, who often work in creative industries like design, stuffy cubicles just do not cut it, Tedder said. ""There's definitely this emerging segment of people who don't want to project a corporate image, but they want a comfortable space to work,"" he says. The Hive touches all the hallmarks that make co-working an attractive alternative to sitting in a coffee shop with a laptop: The space is open, desks equipped with power outlets are meant for sharing, members each get their own lockers, and enclosed meeting rooms provide privacy when needed. And, it hosts informative talks and networking events. Most co-working spaces have a heavy component of building community and encouraging entrepreneurship -- some operators say breaking even is nice but not the primary goal. At CoCoon, which occupies a sprawling 14,000 square feet and has a ping-pong table and meditation room, members must pass an application process, showing that they have something to offer the co-working community, whether it be a solid start-up idea, programming skills, mentorship or investment potential. ""We think Hong Kong can use another place to foster entrepreneurs, and we hope talent can collaborate amongst themselves,"" says Erica Ma, one of CoCoon's founders. CoCoon charges $125 per month, which is unusually low, but the founders see the program as a kind of social enterprise to support start-ups and smaller businesses. The space organizes regular events, including a recent talk on brand licensing and BarCamp, a technology conference that originated in the U.S. Entrepreneurs say in the daily grind, which often means hours sitting in front of a laptop, it helps to know that others are doing the same thing. Yet people working on Internet start-ups do not get much support, as the field is still seen as unconventional in Hong Kong. So for Jah Ying Chung, who is starting launchpilots.org, a site that helps young people get involved in social causes, going to CoCoon provides motivation. ""It's different when you're always seeing people doing stuff that's cool. It's a big impetus,"" she says.","Co-working spaces widespread in U.S., Europe and making headway in Asia .

"(CNN)Fandom is a tricky thing. People are willing to do some unusual and sometimes dangerous things because of their devotion for a team, player or entertainer. Music fans often reach the height of fandom as they crush themselves to the front of the stage in an effort to get as close to the performers as possible. Entertainment photographer Gabriel Quintao has been capturing the faces in the crowd for a few years now and likens their devotion to a battle scene. ""The idea of the essay is to drive the audience into a war environment,"" Quintao said about his ""Front Row"" project. ""The shades of gray with a lot of contrast associated with the dramatic faces and the desperate acts of the crowd gave me the drama I wanted."" Indeed, the images he captures depict the agony and frustration someone might feel in conflict. But amid the pain, there is also joy and excitement as music lovers get a taste of something most people at a concert do not. Quintao's photographs from the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro are up-close, personal and intimate. The festival is one of the largest music concerts in the world and has brought together some of the most popular acts of their time: Queen, Prince, Elton John, Katy Perry and, more recently, Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica. It draws hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world to see and hear their favorite acts. But for some people, it is the chance to show the performers how they feel about them. ""I realized that people who stay at the first row in these situations don't want just to listen to the music better or to see their idol closer,"" Quintao said. ""They want to prove love to the person on the stage and to prove to themselves that they're brave."" The 30-year-old photographer, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, said the crowds who press forward during the music festival is mostly younger and male. However, there is a woman he thinks is in her 60s who is ever-present at many of the venues and somehow makes her way to the first row. From Quintao's photos, it might appear that the action on the stage is secondary to the rush in the crowd. Quintao trains his camera on what he believes is the most unpredictable places to get the most emotional images at the events. ""Sometimes the artist behind the microphone just doesn't move, the light doesn't change and a few pictures already present what the gig was,"" he said. ""But the front row is always unpredictable; it changes every time. People reaching their physical limit just to be as close as possible to their idol is much more interesting than the planned and controlled situation happening on the stage."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The subjects of his lens have described themselves as proud to go through such pain for their musical adulation,  and they proclaim ""the front row is only for the real ones"" on the Facebook page of his projects. ""People who face this situation until the end of the concert go home feeling they've received an honor medal for being strong,"" Quintao said. ""Who wants to see the concert comfortably from an empty space?"" While he's never seen a serious injury from his position in the pit, the space between the stage and the crowd, Quintao hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of fandom. He thinks the people in the front row believe they answer to a higher calling. ""The aim of this work is to show the power of fanaticism,"" he said. ""I wanted to show how a rock concert can be similar to a religion cult, where sometimes people submit themselves to suffering just to prove their love to their idol.""

"An angry Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman, warned again Monday she would investigate why the FBI did not notify oversight committees about its investigation into CIA Director David Petraeus after the bureau determined he was having a secret and risky extramarital affair. ""... A decision was made somewhere not to brief us, which is atypical,"" the California Democrat told NBC's Andrea Mitchell about how the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate intelligence committees are usually briefed on key developments. ""This is certainly an operationally sensitive matter. But we weren't briefed. I don't know who made that decision."" Opinion: How Petraeus courted the press . Section 501 of the National Security Act of 1947 spells out the requirements for the executive branch to inform the congressional intelligence committees of key intelligence-related activities. ""The president shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed on the intelligence activities of the United States, including any significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by this title,"" the statute reads. Feinstein described the unfolding scandal, which she first learned about on Friday when Petraeus announced publicly his resignation, ""like peeling an onion. Every day another peel comes off, and you see a whole new dimension to this."" Spokesman: Rep. Eric Cantor knew of inquiry in October . ""My concern has actually escalated the last few days,"" she said. On Sunday, she told Fox News an investigation of the FBI was needed because the illicit affair ""could have had an effect on national security."" One specific national security concern deals with whether Paula Broadwell, the woman with whom Petraeus had an affair, was privy to classified information. In a speech at the end of October, Broadwell suggested the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, took place because the U.S. was housing Libyan prisoners there -- a theory, she noted at the time, that had not been vetted yet. ""I do not know how she got that information,"" Feinstein said. ""We should find out."" The claim by Broadwell has since been discounted by administration officials. Scandal is about much more than sex . Feinstein also was incensed that an FBI whistle-blower -- who may have feared the investigation into Petraeus wasn't proceeding properly -- had complained to the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, who then was aware of the investigation even before President Barack Obama was informed. Feinstein's committee will meet privately Tuesday to determine how it will proceed on the FBI matter. It is important ""that we have an orderly process, that we not jeopardize anyone's rights, that we be respectful,"" she said, adding that some of the investigation will be done in public and some of it will be behind closed doors. Separately, the committee is conducting an investigation into the fatal attack on the consulate in Benghazi. Petraeus was to testify before a closed hearing Thursday into the attack, but he will now be replaced by Acting CIA Director Mike Morell. ""Disciplinary action"" could be in order, Feinstein said. Profile: Who is Paula Broadwell? Feinstein said she wants to read a ""trip"" report that she was told Petraeus filed on his just-concluded visit to Benghazi, where he personally investigated the circumstances of the attack. But after a second person told her the report had not been written yet, Feinstein warned she would move to have it subpoenaed if necessary. She said also that Petraeus will testify before the committee on Benghazi at some point, probably in closed session. Timeline of the Petraeus affair .","Sen.

"The American bears a broad grin, flashing an ""OK"" sign to the Russian support team tending to him after his descent from space. It's not exactly the image of two countries at extreme odds over the Ukraine crisis. But in the world of U.S.-Russian relations, space is impervious, as demonstrated by the joint effort to bring American astronaut Mike Hopkins and his cosmonaut counterparts, Soyuz Cmdr. Oleg Kotov, a native of Crimea, and fellow flight engineer Sergey Ryazanskiy, home to Earth. The Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan early Tuesday after the trio spent more than five months aboard the International Space Station, leaving the multinational astronaut delegation of Japan's Koichi Wakata, America's Rick Mastracchio and Russia's Mikhail Tyurin to finish the orbital laboratory's Expedition 39. Those three are expected to return home in mid-May, after being joined by another international team: Steve Swanson (U.S.), Alexander Skvortsov (Russia) and Oleg Artemyev (Latvia) are in Star City, Russia, training for their March 25 launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, NASA says. Kotov is a space veteran returning from his third mission and 526th day in space. Hopkins and Ryazanskiy are rookies. This mission marked their first 166 days in space, NASA says. Hopkins conducted a pair of U.S. spacewalks for a total 12 hours and 58 minutes. Ryazanskiy conducted three Russian spacewalks during his mission working outside the station for 20 hours and five minutes. On Earth, the United States may be trading bitter accusations with Russia over Ukraine, but in space, it's a different story. Putin vs. Obama: Facing off over facts in Ukraine . The space collaboration between the two nations has survived other diplomatic kerfuffles -- most recently, the war in Syria and asylum for NSA leaker Edward Snowden -- and there's no need to worry, NASA says. ""We do not expect the current Russia-Ukraine situation to have any impact on our civil space cooperation with Russia, including our partnership on the International Space Station program,"" said Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman, pointing out that it's in both countries' best interests not to disrupt ""operations that have maintained continuous human presence on orbit for over a decade."" Beutel added, ""NASA and its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, have maintained a professional, beneficial and collegial working relationship through the various ups and downs of the broader U.S.-Russia relationship and we expect that to continue."" 'Reluctant co-dependency' The two nations can't afford temporary tussles to upend a costly relationship -- one that James Oberg, a former space engineer, describes as ""reluctant co-dependency."" In 2011, NASA retired its space shuttle fleet, its only means of getting to and from the station. Now, Russian Soyuz capsules ferry U.S. astronauts and cosmonauts, together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft. In turn, the United States brings to the table technology far more advanced than Russia's capabilities, Oberg told Politico. At the same time, many of the Russian systems are more reliable because they are simpler and have been operating longer, Leroy Chiao, former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander, told CNN. The space station itself has an intricate blend of both countries' contributions -- from U.S. solar arrays and power systems to Russian core life-support systems, to a navigation system that comes from both countries, he said. Americans and Russians train on each other's systems, but one country can't run the station alone, he said. The mission control centers in Houston and Korolyov, near Moscow, have to coordinate commands sent to the station, he said. ""We need each other to operate the station,"" Chiao said. ""Otherwise we run the risk of losing that asset."" A pretty penny . What's more, the agreement between the two nations isn't exactly cheap. According to a new deal NASA signed with the Russian space agency, the United States will pay Russia $71 million to ferry each astronaut to the space station. The emergence of private companies in the space transport business may change the game. NASA has a $1.6 billion contract with SpaceX to fly at least 12 cargo resupply missions to the space station, and a $1.9 billion contract with Orbital Sciences for eight such missions. SpaceX is gearing up for its third commercial resupply mission this month; Orbital Sciences completed its first in February. As for transporting astronauts, NASA said in November that it's seeking to partner with U.S. companies for human trips to the station as well, by 2017. That could end U.S. reliance on Russia for space voyages. But for now, experts say, the U.S.-Russia relationship on space remains a marriage of convenience.","American Mike Hopkins returns to Earth with Russian, Crimean cosmonauts .

"(CNN) -- Soul singer and arranger Isaac Hayes, who won Grammy awards and an Oscar for the theme from the 1971 action film ""Shaft,"" has died, sheriff's officials in Memphis, Tennessee, reported Sunday. Singer Issac Hayes seen performing in the U.K. last year. Hayes was found dead Sunday at age 65. Relatives found Hayes, 65, unconscious in his home next to a still-running treadmill, said Steve Shular, a spokesman for the Shelby County Sheriff's Department. Paramedics attempted to revive him and took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 2 p.m., the sheriff's department said. No foul play is suspected, the agency said in a written statement. Hayes was a longtime songwriter and arranger for Stax Records in Memphis, playing in the studio's backup band and crafting tunes for artists such as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave in the 1960s.  See photos of singer Isaac Hayes » . He released his first solo album in 1967, and his 1969 follow-up, ""Hot Buttered Soul,"" became a platinum hit. In 1971, the theme from ""Shaft"" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks and won an Academy Award for best original theme song. The song and the movie score also won Grammy awards for best original score and movie theme. Hayes won a third Grammy for pop instrumental performance with the title track to his 1972 ""Black Moses"" album. From the late 1990s through 2006, Hayes provided the voice of ""Chef"" for Comedy Central's raunchy animated series ""South Park,"" as well as numerous songs. The role introduced him to a new generation of fans, but he left after the show lampooned his own religion, the Church of Scientology. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. In a CNN interview at the time, Hayes credited his success to ""adjusting and constantly evolving, expanding and trying to stay as young as I can."" The new generation of popular musicians, he said, ""could use a little more substance like we had in the day."" ""They're standing on our shoulders. Some of them don't realize [it] because they sample me so much,"" he said. Hayes credited his role on ""South Park"" with expanding his fan base, and said that he had almost passed on the job. ""I started to walk out. I thought it was a Disney thing. I [had] never heard of this thing,"" he said. But his agent persuaded him to tape some episodes. ""Toward the opening I started having trepidations -- 'Oh my god, what have I done? I've ruined my career.' But when it aired, the ratings went through the roof,"" he said. A 1992 visit to the royal family in Ghana was a life-changing experience for Hayes, he said. ""I went back on speaking engagements and encouraged African-Americans to go to Africa [to] interact socially, culturally and/or economically,"" he said.","Hayes found unconscious by treadmill at his Tennessee home Sunday .

"Ukrainian special forces moved against pro-Russian demonstrators in the eastern city of Donetsk late Monday after the country's acting President vowed to resist efforts to ""dismember"" his country, his office reported. The troops cleared armed protesters from the headquarters of Ukrainian security services in Donetsk, one of three cities where pro-Moscow uprisings took place over the weekend, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov's office announced Monday night. There were no casualties in the operation, Victoria Sumar, deputy secretary of the National Defense and Security Council, told reporters. Police battled protesters in one of the other two cities, while authorities set up a committee to negotiate with a self-declared ""army"" in the third. The reports came several hours after Turchynov blamed ""separatist groups coordinated by Russian special services"" for the revolts, which he said echoed events leading to the Russian annexation of Crimea three weeks ago. ""Enemies of Ukraine are trying to play out the Crimean scenario, but we will not let this happen,"" Turchynov said in a televised message. Pro-Moscow protesters seized government buildings, raised Russian flags and declared new governments in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkov on Sunday. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the goal of the protesters was ""to destabilize"" Ukraine, allowing ""foreign troops to cross the border and seize the territory of the country."" ""We will not allow it,"" Yatsenyuk said. Russia, which has an estimated tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, said it was ""watching closely"" and told Ukraine to quit blaming it for Ukrainian problems. President Vladimir Putin's government pushed Ukraine to set up a federal system in which regions with ethnic Russian majorities would have more autonomy, and its foreign ministry urged Ukraine to enter into talks over the issue. ""Ukrainian people want to get a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims,"" a Foreign Ministry statement read. The Ukrainian government was acting ""irresponsibly,"" it said. But in Washington, U.S. officials urged Russian President Vladimir Putin's government to disavow the protests and warned further Russian intervention in Ukraine would bring stiffer economic sanctions than those already imposed over the Crimean annexation. ""If Russia moves into eastern Ukraine, either overtly or covertly, this would be a very serious escalation,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. ""We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine. And we caution against further military intervention."" In Donetsk, demonstrators took over a regional administrative building in the mining city on Sunday. Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported that a self-proclaimed legislature, representing what it called the Donetsk People's Republic, had called a May 11 referendum on whether the area should join Russia. The Russian news agency also said the Donetsk group asked Putin to send a ""temporary peacekeeping contingent."" The report could not immediately be independently verified. Protesters also seized the regional administrative building in Kharkov on Sunday. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who was in the city, said on his Facebook page Monday that the building had been cleared and that public employees had returned to work. But demonstrators returned Monday night to battle police, throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks and setting fire to barricades around the building, Ukrainian news outlets reported. Police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse the protesters late Monday. But about 50 others stormed the headquarters of a local television station, while others attempted to seize its tower to air Russian television channels, the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform reported. And in Luhansk, where demonstrators had taken over the offices of the security services and seized weapons, the regional government set up a working group to defuse the standoff peacefully. The group includes ""authoritative public organizations and associations"" in the region, as well as conflict-resolution experts, the regional government announced. ""The working group is ready for an open dialogue in order to return the life to a peaceful course, to restore the public order and to ensure the safety of citizens,"" it said. Earlier, a group of armed, uniformed men in Luhansk declared themselves the ""Army of the Southeast"" and called on the population to turn out in support of ""our rights and values."" ""Within the last 24 hours, our army has increased many times,"" a spokesman for the group said in a video posted on YouTube. ""We are ready to send a reserve unit to Donetsk if needed. But without the total people's support, we will not be able to change anything."" Donetsk is the hometown of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose pro-Russian government was toppled in a popular revolt in February. Russia has called his removal a coup and dispatched thousands of troops to Crimea in support of a pro-Russian movement that seized power in that semi-autonomous Black Sea peninsula shortly after Yanukovych fled to Russia. That new Crimean administration held a referendum on independence that passed overwhelmingly, despite being condemned as unconstitutional by the new Ukrainian government and by Western powers. Within days, the territory was annexed by Russia. In mid-March, Yatsenyuk warned that demonstrations by what he called ""political tourists"" with foreign passports were under way in the east and warned that Russia might attempt to follow the model used to wrest Crimea from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are still evacuating military installations in the territory, and Kiev's defense ministry reported that a Ukrainian naval officer was shot and killed by a Russian soldier on Sunday as the officer prepared to leave. Russia based its intervention in Crimea on allegations that the territory's Russian-speaking majority was being mistreated. Carney said the claim ""bore no resemblance to the actual truth at the time."" U.S. officials have said Russia had about 40,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week that he'd ordered a withdrawal of some Russian troops from his country's border area with Ukraine, Merkel's office said. But NATO later said it saw no sign that Russia was pulling its forces back from the border. And a small number of additional Russian troops are believed to have moved toward Russia's border with Ukraine, essentially negating any previous withdrawal, two U.S. officials told CNN on Monday. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said the EU was monitoring the situation in eastern Ukraine closely with concern. ""We reiterate our call for de-escalation and the avoidance of further destabilization of Ukraine,"" she said.","Police, protesters battle in Kharkov .

"Americans are generally excited about the new technology they expect to see in their lifetimes. But when confronted with some advances that already appear possible -- from skies filled with drones to meat made in a lab -- they get nervous. Those are the findings in a report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, which sought to gauge public opinion about our rapidly changing world of science and tech. ""The American public anticipates that the coming half-century will be a period of profound scientific change, as inventions that were once confined to the realm of science fiction come into common usage,"" reads the report. Overall, respondents to Pew's survey were upbeat about how technology will shape the near future. In the report, 59% of Americans think tech developments will make life in the next half-century better, while only 30% said they will make life worse. More than eight out of 10 respondents (81%) said they think that in the next 50 years, people who need transplants will be able to get them with organs grown in labs. And more than half (51%) think computers will be able to create art as skillfully as humans do. They're a little less optimistic about some science-fiction staples, though. Only 39% think it's likely scientists will have figured out how to teleport things (or, presumably, people), 33% say we'll have long-term space colonies by 2064 and a mere 19% expect humans will be able to control the weather. Interestingly, some of the advances that may be closest to becoming reality are the ones survey respondents were most worried about. Nearly two out of three Americans think it would make things worse if U.S. airspace is opened up to personal drones. A similar number dislike the idea of robots being used to care for the sick and elderly, and of parents being able to alter the DNA of their unborn children. Meanwhile, only 37% of respondents think it will be good if wearable devices or implants allow us to be digitally connected all the time. With the advent of Google Glass and other wearable technology, that may not be such a distant dream. And already, researchers are developing robots to provide elder care, 3D printers are replicating parts of the human body and government regulators are considering allowing nonmilitary drones to legally operate in U.S. airspace. ""In the long run, Americans are optimistic about the impact that scientific developments will have on their lives and the lives of their children -- but they definitely expect to encounter some bumps along the way,"" said Aaron Smith, a senior researcher at Pew and the author of the report. ""They are especially concerned about developments that have the potential to upend long-standing social norms around things like personal privacy, surveillance, and the nature of social relationships."" Other responses shined a light on what may be our cautious human nature. While generally excited about future tech, many survey participants weren't so keen on testing out those advances themselves. People were split almost evenly (48%-50%) on whether they would ride in a driverless car. But only 26% said they'd get a brain implant to improve their memory or intelligence, and a mere 20% said they'd try eating meat made in a lab. While they were imagining the future, Pew gave respondents the chance, in their own words, to share the one piece of futuristic technology they'd most like to own. Some 9% said they'd like to be able to time travel. A similar number said they'd like something that would keep them healthy or extend their lives, 6% said they wanted a flying car (or bike), 3% said they'd take a teleportation device and a mere 1% said they want their own jetpack. The report was based on telephone interviews conducted February13-18 with 1,001 adults from all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.","Survey: Many Americans are wary of futuristic tech advancements .

"Polls closed Sunday after voters streamed into polling stations in eastern Ukraine to vote in controversial referendums held by pro-Russian activists eager to declare independence from Kiev, an official said. Voters in the city of Donetsk faced this question on the ballot: ""Do you support the Act of Independence of the People's Republic of Donetsk?"" The options are ""yes"" or ""no."" A similar question is being put to voters in Luhansk. Many of the voters were not on the outdated registration lists but were allowed to vote after showing identification documents. There also seemed to be no system in place to prevent one person from voting at multiple polling stations. A CNN crew saw several people vote twice at one polling station, where the ballot boxes were decorated with new Donetsk independence flags. There was also a report of video showing three men arrested near Slovyansk with boxes of ""yes"" ballots in their car. But in a Sunday afternoon news conference, the head of the People's Republic of Donetsk Central Election Committee, Boris Litvinov, disputed reports that people  were voting twice in some areas. Litivinov said the lines were so long that many people had a hard time voting once, let alone twice. He also denied the report about ballot fraud. Litvinov said there was no reason for pro-Russian activists to cheat because voter turnout was so high. The polls were told to stay open for 14 hours, rather than the usual 12, to allow time to add people to the voter list if necessary, the election committee said, adding that access to the most recent electoral rolls has been barred by Kiev. Litvinov was the official to announce that polls had closed. Results are expected later. Two incidents heightened tensions at polling places Sunday. Rubber bullets were fired into the air at a station in Donetsk, said election committee member Sergey Tretyakov. Tretyakov also said police in Krasnoarmeysk tried to prevent people from voting. The central government in Kiev has declared the polls illegal. Russia's mixed messages . The message coming from Moscow on the referendum appears mixed. Russian police officers oversaw voting at a Moscow polling station erected for expat Ukrainians to vote in the Donetsk and Luhansk referendums. But last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin also urged the pro-Russian sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue ""the conditions it needs to have a chance."" Putin's unexpected call appears to have dented the confidence of some pro-Russian activists. However, representatives of the pro-Russian groups in Donetsk and Luhansk voted to go ahead with it. Meanwhile, in Slovyansk, a Russian government-controlled TV channel was periodically showing a banner along the bottom of the screen that told viewers where they can vote in Sunday's referendum. That channel, Russia 24, is available over the air to residents of Donetsk, who can access it in their homes. The banner listed the location and voting hours and advised voters to bring a passport. The banner was shown only on the Russia 24 channel, not on other channels. Blood and balaclavas . A vote for autonomy is a vote for the self-destruction of the east, Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov has said. It would cut residents off from the national economy and social programs, he said. ""It is a step [to] nowhere for these regions. It is euphoria that may lead to very complex consequences, and many people can already feel them."" They have felt the pain in bloodshed, at graves and in burned-out ruins still smoldering in the east, where ethnic Russian militiamen have battled Ukrainian security forces. At least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured Friday in the southeastern city of Mariupol, regional sources said. The electoral commission office in Donetsk was ringed with sandbags and barbed wire on Saturday. Men in balaclavas lounged outside tents pitched nearby, looking relaxed. They wore the orange-and-black St. George ribbon, which has become a symbol of the pro-Russian separatists. A dozen men lined up in front of the regional administration building to sign up for ""military service"" with the pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic. They showed their ID documents and registered at a small tent. Deadly clashes have also stained Mariupol and Odessa, as well as Slovyansk, where separatists hold key government buildings and remain in a standoff with Ukrainian military forces. Militants have erected concrete barricades on the roads into town there. 'Illegitimate' vote . If the referendum passes, it would offer a stark contrast  to recent polling by the Pew Research Center, which found  70% of people in eastern Ukraine want the country to remain united. Litvinov said Sunday that if voters agree to secede from Ukraine, the next logical step is another referendum in the next several months on joining Russia. Whatever the outcome, the vote has already been condemned as illegitimate by several Western powers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday, ""We consider the referendum ... illegitimate and focus on the (presidential) election on May 25 in the entire Ukraine."" The interim government in Kiev, which took power after ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia in February, is due to hold presidential elections May 25. Russian meddling? Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have warned that Russia could face consequences if the presidential vote does not go ahead as planned. ""If no internationally recognized presidential election were to take place, this would inevitably further destabilize the country,"" Merkel said. In that case, she said, ""we are ready to take further sanctions against Russia."" Merkel and Hollande also said that Russian troops along the Ukrainian border ""should undertake visible steps to reduce their readiness."" Putin announced a troop pullback Wednesday, but NATO says it has seen no signs of a withdrawal of Russian forces from the border area. Russia annexed the southern region of Crimea after announced results in a separatist referendum showed more than 90% in favor of joining Russia. In an independent Pew survey, 54% of Crimea residents showed support for secession. The Kremlin has said that it has no interest in annexing other parts of Ukraine. But it is pushing for the country to adopt a constitution that would give regions where Russian is widely spoken a larger voice in policy-making. Critics fear that the creation of autonomous pro-Russian regions in Ukraine would cement alliances with the Kremlin that would give it essential control over them.

"Gay and lesbian rights advocates continued their undefeated run Thursday when a federal judge ruled Florida's same-sex marriage ban to be unconstitutional -- though he didn't go so far to allow such marriages as to take place right away. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle noted in his ruling that his is now one of 19 federal courts that have struck down state laws that bar gay and lesbian couples from marrying. While most of the time those decisions were put on hold as appeals work their way through the system, they have all reached the conclusion. Like those other judges, Hinkle said the Florida ban -- first put into law in 1977 and written into the state's constitution after a 2008 referendum -- violates the ""due process"" and ""equal protection"" provisions in the U.S. Constitution. His ruling applies both to whether same-sex couples can marry in Florida as well as to whether such marriages elsewhere should be recognized in the Sunshine State. ""The Florida provisions that prohibit the recognition of same-sex marriages lawfully entered elsewhere, like the federal provision, are unconstitutional,"" Hinkle writes. ""So is the Florida ban on entering same-sex marriages."" Yet his decision, while firmly in support of allowing same-sex marriage, won't take effect immediately. Hinkle's reasoning: It doesn't make sense to open up and allow such unions, only to have higher courts later reverse his decision and leaving some couples potentially in legal limbo. Judges hear four states defend same-sex marriage bans . Earlier this summer, state Circuit Court Judge Sarah Zabel wrote a similar ruling, based on a similar rationale. She, too, immediately stayed her own order ""pending the outcome of the expected appeal."" For all their celebrations Thursday, the fact that none of these rulings have taken effect, in full, is high on the minds of LGBT rights activists and groups. One of them, Equality Florida, called on state leaders to stand with them as the issue continues to move through the courts. ""Florida put this discriminatory ban in place, and Florida should end it,"" the group said on its website. ""Our families have waited too long already."" The state's top elected official, Gov. Rick Scott, has a different opinion. His re-election campaign spokesman Greg Blair said Thursday that while Scott ""respects the many views Floridians have on this issue, he believes in traditional marriage consistent with the constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2008."" ""There are several cases going through the court system,"" Blair added, ""and the governor respects that process."" Fast Facts: Same-sex marriage .","Gov.

"Get off the roads, and stay off. That was the message in Georgia and the Carolinas as a snow and ice storm swept through Wednesday, bringing some of the Southeast's most populous cities to a standstill. The warnings came as freezing rain brought heavy ice accumulations from Atlanta to Charlotte. Across a large swath of the South, hundreds of thousands of people were without power and thousands of flights were canceled. Calling ice the biggest enemy, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency. School districts canceled classes and government offices were shuttered in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the traffic paralysis caused by a storm last month. Up to three-quarters of an inch of ice was expected to accumulate in Atlanta and up to 10 inches of snow and sleet were expected in Raleigh and Charlotte, making travel treacherous. Also in the storm's path were Virginia and Washington, with much of the Northeast to follow. All federal offices in the nation's capital were ordered closed, and thousands of employees were being told to stay home, according to the Office of Personnel Management. 'Stay home, if you can' While most of the major thoroughfares in and out of the city of Atlanta were reportedly devoid of traffic, a different scene was playing out to the northeast where the storm appeared to take people by surprise despite days of warnings. ""Stay home, if you can,"" North Carolina's Department of Public Safety said in posts on Twitter. ""Quickly deteriorating road conditions, numerous car accidents in Durham/Franklin/Johnston/Wake counties."" Collaborate and listen: A catchy school closure . Gridlock gripped portions of the state, including Raleigh, Durham and Charlotte, as cars and trucks got stuck on snow- and ice-covered roads. ""We saw so many people ... cars piled up and left on the side of the road, and wrecks,"" said Christina Martinson, who was stuck in the snow-bound traffic with her husband and son for hours in Durham. ""It's really, really bad, and it got so bad so quickly that people just weren't ready. Even though we were warned, it just happened more quickly than you would think possible."" For some, there just wasn't enough time. Michael Crosswhite, 44, planned on leaving work in Raleigh, in Wake County, by midafternoon, well ahead of when forecasters initially predicted a snow and ice storm to hit the area. But by noon, the snow and icy rain was coming down. 'Nothing you can do but hope you don't get stuck' ""We just passed an 18-wheeler that spun out into a ditch,"" he said by telephone more than two hours into his journey home to Durham, a trip that typically takes less than 30 minutes. School's out: That's a rap . Moments later, a car ahead of him spun out in front of him. ""It's kind of slushy, and there are just icy spots that there is nothing you can do but hope you don't get stuck,"" Crosswhite said. The images out of Raleigh and Charlotte recalled a similar scenario in Atlanta, a city shut down by 2.6 inches of snow two weeks ago when thousands of commuters were stuck on highways. Some drivers spent up to 20 hours in their cars. ""Right now we've got people traveling up and down the highways in special four-wheel vehicles to make any rescues that we need to make, and more than anything else we're just encouraging people to be smart, and don't put their stupid hat on during the next 48 hours,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said. The North Carolina Department of Transportation is urging people not to abandon their vehicles. ""There are some people abandoning their vehicles. We are urging them not to. It is very dangerous for them to be on foot with cars sliding near them and it blocks access for our sand trucks and plows and causes gridlock,"" said Communications Supervisor Steve Abbott. Track the storm . It appeared people in Atlanta had learned their lesson. Deal applauded Atlantans who kept the roads clear, saying during a midday news conference, ""That's a good starting point."" Even so, there were thousands without power across the state after ice caused tree limbs to snap, knocking out power lines. With temperatures below freezing, the National Guard opened up 35 armories across the state to be used as shelters and warming centers, CNN affiliate WSB-TV reported. In Durham, the Streets at Southpoint Mall opened up as a shelter. ""We are here for people that need to get off the road,"" general manager Todd Anderson said.  ""We had a few people here earlier, now there is just a handful of people left but we will be available through evening."" ""We are just trying to do the right and get people out of the cold,"" he added. The Red Cross, meanwhile, reported hundreds sought shelter overnight at its facilities stretching from Louisiana to North Carolina. In North Carolina, Kim Martin Rehberg's typical 25-minute commute was turning into an hours-long ordeal Wednesday as she tried to make it from her office in Durham to her home in Raleigh. Three hours later, she still had miles to go. So, too, did the rest of her family who were stuck in traffic across the region. ""My daughter was stranded trying to get from her gymnastics class in Apex. My ex-husband is trying to get her and he got trapped,"" she said by telephone, referring to a Raleigh suburb. ""My husband is in Charlotte and says things are bad. All the gas stations are shutting down, and I had trouble trying to gas up."" 'Our own trucks are stuck' There are snowplows on the roads but ""unfortunately some of our own trucks are stuck in the same traffic jams that a lot of other people are and they're having a hard time getting to the roads that need to be cleared,"" said Dan Howe, Raleigh's assistant city manager. The low-pressure weather system bringing the snow and ice to the Southeast is expected to move up the East Coast, dropping snow on the Northeast. Six to 8 inches are predicted for Washington, with especially heavy snowfall Thursday morning, and 6 to 10 inches on New York from midnight Wednesday into Thursday, with a combination of snow, sleet and rain continuing until Friday morning. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told state agencies to prepare ""for an impending nor'easter"" and asked residents to avoid unnecessary travel. Power outages . More than 729,000 customers were without power in the Southeast, power companies told CNN. More than 210,000 were Georgia Power customers, the utility said. South Carolina was the hardest hit, with about 220,000 customers without electricity, while Wilmington, North Carolina, accounted for more than 58,000 outages. The utilities said Wednesday morning they expect those numbers to rise over the next 24 hours. Georgia Power, the state's largest utility, warned that hundreds of thousands could be without electricity for days. ""This has the opportunity to be a huge event when you're talking about the amount of ice you're looking at,"" Aaron Strickland, Georgia Power's emergency operations chief, told reporters. The utility staged fleets of trucks across the area. Teams from Florida, Texas and Ohio bolstered local line crews. Transportation woes . The storm system also was taking its toll on travel. Amtrak suspended some rail service in the Northeast, South and Mid-Atlantic regions for Wednesday. Nationwide, more than 3,400 flights were canceled Wednesday and even more than 4,100 were scrubbed for Thursday, according to FlightAware.com. Among the canceled flights were more than 1,600 in and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Internationanl Airport. Charlotte Douglas International and Raleigh-Durham International airports accounted for the majority of other flights canceled. Deadly toll . At least 10 deaths have been blamed on the weather, including a 55-year-old man who was killed in a head-on collision in Virginia, authorities said. Two people were killed in Georgia, and two died in North Carolina, they said. In Texas, three people died when an ambulance driver lost control on an icy patch of road outside of Carlsbad, the state Department of Public Safety said. A patient, a paramedic and another passenger were pronounced dead at the scene. In Mississippi, authorities blamed the storm for two traffic deaths. Stir-crazy? How to stay sane .

"Strong condemnations and accusations were traded Sunday night as the U.N. Security Council held an urgent, previously unscheduled meeting to discuss the worsening crisis in Ukraine. Speaking first, Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, U.N. assistant secretary-general for political affairs, set the tone for discussions, saying that Ukraine ""teeters on the brink. ""However, it is not just Ukraine that will suffer from a scenario where the likelihood of further bloodshed and violent clashes grows by the hour. ""Russia, which shares a large border with Ukraine, as well as the broader European region faces spillover effect of potentially severe consequences. Such scenarios will also have repercussions for the entire international community,"" he said. Ukraine and its allies blamed Russia for the unrest, while both sides agreed the situation is dangerous and should not be allowed to get any worse. ""Further escalation of this must be swiftly stopped,"" said Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations. ""It is the West that will determine the opportunity to avoid civil war in Ukraine,"" he added, calling for national dialogue. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia of spreading disinformation and inciting instability. ""The human stakes of what is happening in Ukraine are extremely high. The lives of innocent civilians are at risk yet we are being bombarded by Russian disinformation and propaganda, while the Ukrainians are being confronted by incitement and violence,"" she said. Power added: ""This instability was written and choreographed in and by Russia."" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev vowed not ""to let the Crimea scenario repeat in eastern Ukraine,"" stressing that the government is readying a counterinsurgency plan to strike the ""armed terrorists."" ""We demand to leave us in peace,"" Sergeyev said. ""It's really the final warning cry."" The meeting came the same day that Ukraine acting President Oleksandr Turchynov issued a promise of amnesty for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but warned that anyone who continues to support the takeover of government buildings would be held responsible for their actions. The acting President added a warning to ""terrorists"" who did not comply, saying they would be subject to an army anti-terrorism operation if they did not comply by 2 a.m. ET Monday. Similar deadlines have been set and allowed to pass with no consequence. ""We'll not allow any repetition of the Crimean scenario in the east of Ukraine. I have signed a decree that would allow those who did not shoot at our officers to lay down their arms and leave the occupied buildings by Monday morning without fear of being prosecuted,"" he told a national television audience, according to a CNN translation. Turchynov added that anyone who supports violence will be punished. ""We are ready to consider a significant expansion of regional powers of all regions and the wider reform of local self-government. However, all those supporting aggressors and occupiers in an armed struggle against our country will not escape punishment and will be prosecuted,"" he said. Ukraine puts blame on Russia . Turchynov said Russia was responsible for bloodshed; at least one Ukrainian soldier was killed in clashes between pro-Ukrainian crowds and pro-Russian separatists, a high-level source in Ukraine's Security Services told CNN. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tweeted Sunday that Ukrainian authorities must ""stop war against their people"" and asked the U.N. Security Council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to give ""urgent attention"" to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Earlier, Ukrainian officials placed blame for unrest in the eastern section of their country squarely on their neighbors in Russia in a written statement Sunday from Kiev. The new Ukrainian government said the security operations were launched against terrorists who are attempting to ""destroy our country."" ""In the eastern regions of Ukraine, the Russian special service and saboteurs embarked on the large-scale separatist operations to seize power, destabilize the situation threatening the lives of citizens of Ukraine, as well as the separation of the regions of our country,"" the Foreign Ministry said. Map: See how language, culture divide Ukraine . Giving no further details, it also said it had ""concrete evidence of Russian special service involvement"" in the pro-Russian protests and storming of buildings in the east in recent days and would present it at an international meeting on the Ukraine crisis on Thursday. Ukrainian security forces launched an operation Sunday to clear pro-Russian separatists from a police headquarters in the eastern city of Slaviansk, officials said. However, a CNN crew in the city saw no sign of a large presence of Ukrainian security forces -- with the exception of a single police car and a helicopter flying above -- nor any confrontation with the occupiers. Gunmen dressed in camouflage had stormed and seized the police building a day earlier in Slaviansk, a town about 100 miles from the Russian border, and set up barricades around it. 'Sanctions can bite' Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the attacks in Slaviansk were ""professional"" and ""coordinated"" -- similar to Russia's incursion into the Crimean Peninsula last month. ""There's nothing grass-roots seeming about it,"" Power said on ABC's ""This Week,"" noting the latest action ""gives credence"" to the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants control over eastern Ukraine. The United States is prepared to step up sanctions against Russia if the recent actions in Ukraine continue, she said Sunday. Power said told ""This Week"" the latest events in Ukraine bore ""the telltale signs of Moscow's involvement."" ""I think we've seen that the sanctions can bite. And if actions like the kind that we've seen over the last few days continue, you're going to see a ramping up of those sanctions,"" she said. The unrest is the latest show of spiraling anger in eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population. The region was the support base for pro-Moscow former President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in February after months of protests in Kiev. Speaking Sunday to reporters in Russia, Yanukovych said the Ukraine is in a new situation now that blood was shed. ""Ukraine made the first step toward civil war. The Kiev gang decided and ordered to use force and dispatched the military forces against the population of southeast Ukraine,"" he said, state-run Russia-24 TV reported. Yanukovych accused the United States of dictating to the government in Kiev what to do, claiming that CIA Director John Brennan ""effectively sanctioned the use of arms and bloodshed and therefore the United States should be held responsible for starting a civil war in Ukraine."" CIA spokesman Dean Boyd declined to comment on Brennan's travel itinerary. ""But the claim that Director Brennan encouraged Ukrainian authorities to conduct tactical operations inside Ukraine is completely false. Like other senior U.S. officials, Director Brennan strongly believes that a diplomatic solution is the only way to resolve the crisis between Russia and Ukraine,"" the spokesman said. Troops massed on eastern border . Kiev's fragile new government and the West accuse Russia of destabilizing the region as a pretext to potentially send in troops to protect the local Russian-speaking population. NATO says Russian armed forces are massing on Ukraine's eastern border, while Moscow says they are merely carrying out military exercises. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second most populous city, police outside City Hall offered no resistance when protesters took over the building Sunday afternoon, according to a witness. It is not clear why the police stepped aside for protesters. Russian and local Ukrainian media reported that pro-Russian demonstrators had seized the city hall in Mariupol, in the southeast, with no violence. Some showed pictures of Russian flags in the city. The reports could not immediately be independently confirmed. Distrust among the population in the region grew as political power in the national government shifted rapidly in a pro-Western direction. A short time later, pro-Russian elements occupied the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia quickly annexed. Since then, pro-Russian protesters have taken to the streets in eastern Ukrainian regions and in some cases stormed and occupied buildings. EU foreign minister to meet . The United States has accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest in its neighbor as a pretext for military intervention. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, on Saturday, expressing ""strong concern that attacks today by armed militants in eastern Ukraine were orchestrated and synchronized, similar to previous attacks in eastern Ukraine and Crimea,"" a senior State Department official said. The official said Kerry warned Lavrov there would be ""additional consequences"" if Russia did not take steps to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine and move its troops back from its border. The official also noted that militants involved in Saturday's unrest in eastern Ukraine ""were equipped with specialized Russian weapons and the same uniforms as those worn by the Russian forces that invaded Crimea."" NATO described the appearance in eastern Ukraine of men with specialized Russian weapons and identical uniforms without insignia -- as previously seen in Crimea -- as a ""grave development."" European Union Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton is to meet this week with foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and Ukraine in Switzerland to discuss efforts to de-escalate the situation. In a written statement, she urged Moscow ""to call back its troops from the Ukrainian border and to cease any further actions aimed at destabilising Ukraine."" EU foreign ministers will meet in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the crisis. Get the Fast Facts on Ukraine .

"At least 14 people, including a general, were killed Thursday when a Ukrainian military helicopter was shot down by ""terrorists"" near Slovyansk, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov told Parliament. Turchynov said the chopper, which was carrying soldiers for a troop rotation, was shot down with a Russian rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Militants in the rebel stronghold claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter, a spokesman for the militants said. The aircraft had flown there from Kramatorsk, he said, where the Ukrainian military has a substantial presence. The large loss of life will be a major blow to the Ukrainian military, which on Monday toughened its approach to the separatist movement when it launched a fierce assault on militants who'd taken control of part of Donetsk airport. Also in Slovyansk, the self-declared mayor said pro-Russia separatist militants are holding four European observers who have been missing since Monday. But he declined to say where. ""Our militants got them,"" Vyacheslav Ponomarev said Thursday. ""They were detained because they didn't respect my request. I asked them not to leave Donetsk (city). They decided they were smarter and could come here."" Ponomarev added that the monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were not being held in the town. They also are not ""exchange material,"" he said, indicating that they were not being held to swap for separatists detained by Kiev authorities. Ponomarev said he had been in contact with the OSCE, and they were assessing the situation. He said he would probably release the monitors soon but wouldn't say when. On Wednesday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebynis said that a pro-Russia group was holding the monitors and that negotiations for their release were ""in process."" The four team members, who are Swiss, Turkish, Estonian and Danish, were on a routine patrol Monday east of Donetsk city when last heard from, according to the OSCE. The last time an OSCE team went missing in the Donetsk region, its members also turned up in the hands of the militant separatists in Slovyansk and were described by Ponomarev as ""prisoners of war."" They were freed just over a week later. There were fears Wednesday for the safety of another group of 11 monitors who went missing after being stopped at a roadblock in Marinka, west of Donetsk city, but the group later re-established contact with the OSCE. The OSCE said Thursday that the 11 had been abducted for seven hours by a dozen-strong armed group but were released. Separatists: Bodies to be returned to Russia . Dozens of pro-Russia separatists were killed after Ukrainian security forces launched their assault on Donetsk International Airport on Monday, following the militants' seizure of a terminal. The military's move -- only hours after President-elect Petro Poroshenko declared his election win -- was interpreted by some as an indication that he will take a tougher stance as he seeks to unify the country. Now, the grim task of returning the dead to their families is under way. At least 33 Russian citizens are among the militants killed during the violence, a spokesman for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic told a CNN team at the morgue. The bodies have been identified, and there is an agreement with the local police to escort the remains back to Russia soon, several separatist representatives said. The bodies will be taken across the border to the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. From there, they will be transported to different cities according to where they are from, reportedly including Moscow and Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya. The CNN team at the morgue in Donetsk city saw at least 10 coffins. The separatist spokesman at the morgue said the men were volunteers from across Russia who had come to help stand with the separatists against the authorities in Kiev. The spokesman also said that there are still about 15 bodies left at the airport that the separatists haven't been able to collect or identify. About 20 of those killed are Ukrainian, he said. The Donetsk mayor's official website put the airport death toll at 40 Tuesday, including two civilians, but did not specify how many were separatists. But the separatist spokesman said the death toll could be as high as 70. If confirmed, this would make Monday the deadliest day in Ukraine since the bloody clashes in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, which triggered the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in February and led to the current spiral into violence in the east. The separatists have until now insisted that their movement is homegrown, so their very public acknowledgment of so many Russian citizens among those killed Monday marks a shift in approach. It could be intended to goad Moscow into a response at a time when the separatist movement is under pressure to find a way forward and has shown signs of division within its ranks. Kiev and the West have accused Russia of coordinating and supplying the separatists, a claim Moscow has denied. Russia has said it will respect Sunday's election results. On Thursday, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest intelligence said 30,000 Russian troops that had been amassed along the Russia-Ukraine border have been moving back to their home bases over the last several days. About 10,000 troops -- mainly infantry -- remain along Russia's border with eastern Ukraine, the official said, and there are some signs those troops will be pulling back as well. NATO this week also reported signs that some Russian troops near Ukraine's eastern border may be preparing to pull back. The United States has been using satellites to track Russian troop movements for weeks, and both the United States and NATO have released imagery to bolster their case that Russia had amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border. Several U.S. officials have said it appears the Russians have decided to try to work with the new Ukrainian government, but officials also point out that it wouldn't take much to bring a large number of Russian forces back to the border via transport aircraft at any time. Governor in talks with separatists . Serhiy Taruta, the billionaire governor of Donetsk, acknowledged in a CNN interview in Kiev that a Ukrainian military operation was under way in the Donetsk region, but he was unable to comment further. Taruta said he was in talks with pro-Russia separatist leaders in the region to try to calm the situation, adding that the aim was to ""reach real understanding,"" rather than just a deal. ""We are having dialogue, which is dragging out because they seem to have a constant rotation of their leaders, but I hope that in the final analysis we will reach an agreement and reconciliation to work together,"" he said. Taruta has met with Poroshenko in Kiev, he said, adding that the President-elect will visit the Donetsk region ""we hope in the first half of June."" Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk People's Republic said that some barricades were being cleared away from in front of the regional administration building in Donetsk city that the separatists have made their headquarters for weeks. She said that separatists were ""cleaning up"" and ""instilling order"" and that a news conference would soon explain more. Earlier, militants surrounded the building and said they were searching it for looters but explained little more. Russia and Ukraine bicker in U.N. meeting . Clashes in eastern Luhansk . Amid the ongoing tensions, Ukraine's National Guard base in the eastern Luhansk region was attacked Wednesday by what the country's Interior Ministry described as ""terrorists."" ""There have been losses among military personnel as well as among the attackers,"" a statement from the ministry said. The Luhansk region is, with neighboring Donetsk, at the heart of the separatists' bid to declare independence from Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine was a key support base for Yanukovych, and many people there oppose the authorities in Kiev, favoring closer ties instead to Russia.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The party of Turkey's ruling prime minister sailed to an easy victory in parliamentary elections on Sunday, winning a third term in office with 49.9% of the vote with 99.9% of the votes counted. But marring the night, 10 people were wounded at a post-election party, the country's Anatolian news agency said. For nearly a decade, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics while also defining his country's assertive new role as an economic and diplomatic power in the region. Campaigning on his record of unprecedented economic stability and prosperity during nine years in power, Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) succeeded in slightly increasing his mandate. The AKP won 49.9% of the vote, an increase of nearly 4 percentage points from the party's performance in the 2007 parliamentary election. ""We are thrilled after winning one out of every two voters' votes in the country,"" Erdogan said late Sunday night. In a victory speech delivered from the balcony of his party headquarters in Ankara, Erdogan made a pledge to serve all Turks, regardless of ethnicity or religious sect. ""To the Turkish nation, whether you voted for AKP or not, the real winner of the 2011 elections is Turkey,"" Erdogan roared, to a crowd of flag-waving supporters. ""No one should have any doubt, whether you voted for us or not, all of your beliefs and values and lifestyles are our pride."" ""The obvious result is another landslide big victory for the incumbent, the AKP,"" said Omer Taspinar, a Turkish political analyst with the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""People voted overall for stability. It's the same rule in most democracies, 'It's the economy, stupid.' People vote on bread and butter issues. They vote based on their living standards. The fact that Turkey's economy is growing at 9%. The fact that interest rates are low. People can borrow, people can spend. Consumption is very high."" Prime Minister Erdogan added another electoral victory feather to his cap. But he fell short of capturing the two-thirds majority in parliament that would have allowed the AKP to unilaterally rewrite Turkey's constitution. Erdogan has made no secret of the fact that he intends to rewrite the constitution, a deeply flawed document drafted by a military junta that seized power in 1980. And on Sunday night, Erdogan made it clear a new constitution would still be a top priority. ""The nation has assigned us the task of creating a new constitution,"" he said. ""We are not going to close our doors. We will go to the opposition. If they accept, we will sit down and work towards consensus with civic groups, with parties outside of the parliament, with academics."" The largest opposition party, the secular Republican People's Party (CHP) won 26% of the vote. That marked a boost of 5 percentage points over its performance in 2007. But it also fell short of predictions by the CHP officials that the rebranding of the party under new leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu would lead to a big win at the polls. Nonetheless, Kilicdaroglu declared victory during his own brief post-election speech to supporters. ""Within a short period our party won 3.5 million new votes,"" he said. ""We wish AKP success. But they should not forget. That there is a stronger CHP now."" A big winner on Sunday was the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), the country's most influential Kurdish nationalist party. Young men waving yellow BDP flags raced around Istanbul in cars, celebrating the party's capture of an additional 10 seats in parliament. A blast Sunday night at a BDP post-election celebration in the southeastern town of Sirnak wounded 10 people, six of them critically, the Anatolian news agency said. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The party captured an additional 10 seats in parliament. Turkey still bears the scars of a long guerrilla war waged between Kurdish separatist guerillas and the Turkish state. More than 30,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in the early 1980s. ""We have a very difficult challenge ahead with the Kurds,"" said Taspinar of Brookings. ""They have high expectations. They really want radical reform. The new constitution will have to reflect a different understanding of Kurdish citizenship. After polls closed Sunday, clashes erupted in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. A city government official, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, confirmed reports that police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse Kurdish youths hurling firecrackers and gasoline bombs. In his victory speech, Erdogan addressed the Kurds, Turkey's largest -- and long-oppressed -- ethnic minority. ""We will work harder to end mothers' crying and end the bloodshed,"" he said. ""We did away with assimilation policies ... we say peace, freedom and democracy in the region."" Erdogan and the AKP first swept to power in 2002, after the party won 34% of the vote, bringing an end to years of weak and crisis-prone coalition governments. The party won a much stronger mandate in 2007 parliamentary elections, capturing 47% of the vote. In the run-up to Sunday's election, Erdogan unveiled ambitious plans titled ""Turkey 2023,"" which include digging a canal through Istanbul from the Black Sea to the Marmara Sea, which would parallel the Bosphorus Strait. Despite obvious flaws, Turkey's messy democracy and its booming economy are an inspiration for many in the turbulent Middle East. During the height of the revolution in February in Cairo's Tahrir Square, many Egyptians pointed to Turkey as a possible model for future democratic development. And more than 5,000 Syrians have fled across the border to Turkey in recent days to escape a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. One of the big successes of the Erdogan era in Turkey has been the assertion of civilian control over the once-meddlesome military, which overthrew four elected governments in 50 years.

"(CNN) -- It's been three years since Japan was hit with its worst-ever earthquake, causing serious damage to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 9 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami sent three of Fukushima's reactors into melt-down, shocking the world. Japan, a fully industrialized country with high safety requirements, was facing a nuclear disaster of a similar scale to the deadly 1986 Chernobyl accident, in Soviet Ukraine. As a result, many countries decided to review their energy policies. Before the accident, 442 nuclear power reactors in 30 countries produced 14% of all world's electricity. This number dropped to just 11% in 2012, as 15 reactors exited service -- mainly in Germany and Japan. Today, 435 reactors operate in 31 countries, and a further 68 are under construction. After the Fukushima disaster, Japan pulled back its nuclear ambitions, ordered large-scale inspections and introduced new safety regulations. All of its 48 remaining reactors have been kept offline and a proposal to restart the program awaits parliament's approval. Germany shut down eight of its oldest reactors almost immediately after Fukushima, focusing instead on renewable energy, and phase-out all of its nuclear power by 2022. Switzerland adopted a similar approach when the government decided not to build any new reactors and phase out its nuclear production by 2034. This was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors. But not all countries got scared. Both France, which has the world's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production, and the U.S., the world's largest producer, reaffirmed their positions on the power source. Both countries continue to invest heavily into safety improvements. All four ""BRIC"" countries are boosting their nuclear power production, with India aiming to supply 25% and Russia 45% of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050, and Brazil planning to build five new reactors by 2030. China is facing pressure to cut its pollution levels and reliance on coal. China already operates 20 reactors and aims to more than triple its nuclear capacity by 2020.

"When you click ""Like"" on your friends' Facebook posts, do you really mean it? If seeing your Facebook friends living wonderful, fun-filled lives gives you a case of the blues, you're not alone. A new University of Michigan study found that the more people checked Facebook, the more likely they were to feel worse about their own lives. To measure people's feelings and Facebook usage, the team enlisted a small group of young adult Facebook users in Michigan and texted them five times a day for two weeks. Each text linked to an online survey that asked how they were feeling. In addition to reporting how much they were checking Facebook, the subjects rated their worry and loneliness levels at that moment as well as their overall satisfaction with life. The authors also asked people to rate their level of life satisfaction at the start and end of the study, and found that the more participants used Facebook over the two-week study period, the more their life satisfaction levels declined. By contrast, the study found that face-to-face interactions with others led people to feel better over time. ""Over a billion people belong to Facebook, and over half of them log in every day,"" said University of Michigan social psychologist Ethan Kross, lead author of the study. ""On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. But rather than enhancing well-being, our findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may have the opposite result for young adults."" What is it about the social network that bums some people out? One theory is that people are comparing themselves to their friends' seemingly fantastic digital lives and feeling inferior. Though the sample group of 82 people was small, the findings are similar to other studies about Facebook use and mental health. Facebook has become a tempting subject for researchers because of its role as a constant presence in so many people's lives. Psychologists, sociologists and other academics are curious about what kind of impact it has on its users' brains, emotions and self-worth. Some researchers have tapped directly into the gold mine of data generated by the social network (Facebook has its own staff of data scientists and sometimes teams up with universities), while others conduct their own independent studies. In early 2012, a study out of Utah Valley University also found that many people had a case of the blues after checking Facebook. The researchers talked to a group of 425 students and found correlations between the amount of time people spent checking Facebook and negative feelings about their own lives. The more time their subjects spent on the social network, the higher probability that they would think their friends lived better, happier lives. In January, a study from Germany found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on Facebook. Seeing updates of friends' successful careers, cute babies and fabulous vacations inspired feelings of envy, loneliness and even anger.","Study: The more people check Facebook, the worse they feel about their lives .

"(CNN) -- Turks have picked prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be the country's first directly elected president. Erdogan secured 52% of the votes in the first round of the presidential election, narrowly avoiding a runoff, according to Turkish election board. Turkey is a parliamentary democracy and the prime minister is the head of its government. The president's role is more formal, and represents the country as the head of the state -- similar to the Queen in the UK. But Erdogan has already indicated he would like to see more powers being transferred to the presidential palace, speaking about a ""new era"" in his victory speech. ""With the president elected directly by the citizens, all barriers between the people and the presidential palace have been removed,"" he was reported as saying in his speech by the Turkish media. Here is what you need to know about the historic election. Why does Erdogan want to be president if he is more powerful as prime minister? The former mayor of Istanbul and the leader and co-founder of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003 and has been serving his third term as prime minister. While the constitution would have allowed Erdogan to run again when his term finishes next year, his own party rules prohibited him from seeking fourth term. His transition to presidency was seen as a logical step for a politician who wanted to maintain political power. Karabekir Akkoyunlu, researcher at the London School of Economics, said the country's constitution -- drawn up by the military junta in 1982 -- gave the head of state significant authority. Erdogan, Akkoyunlu said, would likely push those to the limit by "" invoking the 'national will' he claims to embody."" What issues will he face next? The Kurdish peace process is one of the most pressing issues of the coming months. Turkey passed a law in July establishing a legal framework for peace talks with the Kurdish militants to end three decades of insurgency. ""The Kurdish peace process is also linked with regional dynamics and the rise of the Islamic State, which is now threatening the Kurds in northern Iraq and Syria,"" Akkoyunlu said. Erdogan will also have to work with the government in trying to tackle Turkey's economic troubles. The IMF and OECD have both warned Turkey's economy remains vulnerable to dangers outside its borders. High inflation, low employment and the country's chronic inequality are putting it at risk. Who else was running? The main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had nominated Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu as their joint candidate. The former secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was campaigning on the idea of national unity and secured 38% of the vote. Selahattin Demirtas, a left-wing politician popular with Turkey's Kurdish minority, ran for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and finished third with 10%. Around 25% of people in Turkey identify themselves as Kurdish. Why does this matter? Turkey's geographical position and cultural make-up has contributed to the country being seen as a powerful bridge between Asia and Europe. Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance. The country's $800 billion economy is among the 20 biggest in the world and attracts $200 billion in foreign direct investment every year. Turkey also plays a key role in the Middle East, bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran. Read more: How Turkey turned into economic mess . Opinion: Turkey's Teflon politician targets top post .

"Films such as ""Django Unchained"" carry with them an uncommonly high concentration of influence and opportunity. Due to the scarcity of diverse and inspiring representations on screen, Quentin Tarantino's latest movie casts a longer shadow than many are willing to acknowledge. In a recent interview with UK Channel 4, Tarantino stated his goals and interpretation of the Oscar-nominated film's impact: ""I've always wanted to explore slavery ... to give black American males a hero ... and revenge. ... I am responsible for people talking about slavery in America in a way they have not in 30 years."" He went on, ""Violence on slaves hasn't been dealt with to the extent that I've dealt with it."" My personal biracial experience growing up on both sides of segregated hoods, suburbs and backcountry taught me a lot about the coded language and arithmetic of racism. I was often invisible when topics of race arose, the racial adoptee that you spoke honestly in front of. I grew up hearing the candid dirt from both sides, and I studied it. The conversation was almost always influenced by something people read or saw on a screen. Media portrayals greatly affect, if not entirely construct, how we interpret ""otherness."" People see what they are shown, and little else. It's why my dad forced me to study and value history from an absurdly young age -- to build a foundation solid enough to withstand cultural omissions from the curriculum and distortions from the media. It's what led me to become a teacher of American and African history out of college. There is a glaring difference in outlook between those who have mined the rich, empowering truth about how we've come to be, and those who just accept that there's only one or two people of African descent deemed worthy of entire history books. If, like Tarantino, you show up with a megaphone and claim to be creating a real solution to a specific problem, I only ask that you not instead, construct something unnecessarily fake and then act like you've done us a favor. Vote for your Oscar favorites . ""Django Unchained"" is being projected on screens around the world, out of context: A slim percentage of consumers have any real understanding of what took place during slavery, one of history's most prolonged, barbaric and celebrated human rights violations. Sadly, for many Americans, this film is the beginning and the end of that history lesson. This film follows a brave, cunning and fearless lead character whose name starts with a ""D."" Viewers of the film's trailer would think that character is Django, played by Jamie Foxx. In fact, his name is Dr. King Schultz, a German portrayed by Christoph Waltz, (spoiler alert) who sacrifices his life in the pursuit of freedom and justice for the black man. It is the white Dr. King, who after sharing a motivational tale about a man reaching a mountaintop, nobly gives his life for ""black justice."" Tarantino rightly claims that the abundant use of ""nigger"" in the film was authentic and of the time. Of course it was. So was chattel slavery and the back-breaking manual labor that kept these massive plantations thriving. Tarantino's plantations are nearly empty farms with well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves. It's the opposite of the exploration of the real phenomenon of slavery about which he boasts. Sometimes we sacrifice accuracy for story, but these inaccuracies are completely unnecessary. How does depicting slave plantations like circus campgrounds, fit with delirious, babbling overseers wielding bull whips and overdressed rabble wandering aimlessly, further Django's truth? The film's antagonist, Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, supposedly runs one of the very worst plantations in all of Mississippi. Yet on the road he dines with his slaves, and at home, his fields are mostly empty and he only seems to have slaves in his house. Is this one of those rare slave plantations that primarily trades in polished silverware and gossip? That authenticity card that Tarantino uses to buy all those ""niggers"" has an awfully selective memory. In the film's opening sequence, shackled blacks literally hold the key to their shackles and don't use them, choosing instead to trudge forward, hindered by biting chains, to kill a white man. In the third act, after seeing Django kill the Australians, the blacks sitting in an open cage neither communicate with each other or consider stepping outside of the cage. Review: 'Django Unchained' In fact, in this entire, nearly three-hour film, there are no scenes with black people interacting, or even looking at each other, in a respectful or productive way. If only one black person (Django) displays the vaguest interest in gaining freedom, while the rest consistently demonstrate that they wouldn't do anything with that freedom, were they to obtain it, then we're not able to become invested in them or their pursuits: We can't relate to shiftless characters. Being illiterate, and/or brown, does not remove the ability to think, or observe or yearn or plan or develop meaningful relationships. Despite the repeated suggestions that they are similar narratives, ""Django Unchained"" has little in common with  ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Tarantino's 2009 fantasy involving a band of American soldiers taking revenge against the Nazis.  The latter's title characters choose to form a band of men who risk their lives for a generous and creative endeavor to stop the Holocaust completely, saving all of their people, not just one. ""Django"" is just a random guy, who, to no credit of his own, was plucked from slavery by an impressive white man and led on a journey to save his wife. ""Inglourious"" did not walk us through provocative scenes of concentration camp torture, gas chambers and ethnically stereotyped victims. Nor were Jewish characters subjected to the indignities of being torn apart by dogs. And while we have our trusty authenticity card out, did the Jewish people not suffer the repeated verbal onslaught of ""kike,"" ""rats"" and other grotesque terms? Were such words used in ""Inglourious Basterds"" more than 100 times? How about 70? OK 30? 10? Thankfully, Tarantino knew that he was perfectly able to tell a story without such gimmicks. (He also knew the community he claimed to be avenging wouldn't stand for it.) Hey, remember when Tarantino was selling those emaciated Jewish prisoner action figures with the concentration camp tattoos? So funny and ironic and harmless, right? No. That would have been cheap and disgusting. Yet the filmmakers agreed to the release of action-figure slave and slaver dolls to help promote ""Django."" It was an especially offensive decision because selling slave figurines falls directly in line with the centuries-old American tradition of desensitizing us to the horrors of slavery with cute, palatable commodities. Tarantino didn't invent this tacky strategy; he just dug it back up. Opinion: Why 'Django' stirs race debate . Think for a moment of the lengths that Tarantino went, to create a heroic triumph for his ""Inglourious Basterds."" He created an imaginary  scenario wherein his characters could outwit and ultimately incinerate Hitler and his top advisers in a movie theater. It was choose-your-own-adventure heroism to create figures that took complete agency in the acquisition of their freedom. A very cool idea. A big reason slavery is avoided in American storytelling is guilt. Unlike the Holocaust, when it comes to slavery, our people were the bad guys. But we're not German, so we can rail on Hitler and the Nazis all day without thinking critically about our legacy. For descendants of slaves, and all Americans, our ovens -- the slave plantations -- are tourist destinations and wedding venues, home to preservation societies and guided tours. The ""good ole days,"" when faceless black folks with zero potential were merely quiet, collateral damage. America's minimal comprehension of slavery combined with the kind of trivialization ""Django"" offers renders us ill-equipped to empathize with its victims. This is a chicken or the egg manipulation: ""Do I know nothing about the complexity of slavery because it's not that big a deal, or must it not be that big a deal because I'm only vaguely informed?"" None of my criticisms would be different had the person in the director's chair been a different color (though all widely released American films heavily involving slavery in the United States have been directed by white men). My concerns are limited to the onscreen material, its advertised aims and the consequences. We try so hard to distance ourselves from the generations that made a business out of systematically crippling a people and the public's vision of their abilities and intentions. We're so different now, aren't we? We are civilized. By popular measure, so were they. And we deserve better, than this lazy, oversimplified reduction of our history.

"Nina Pham was the first person to catch Ebola on U.S. soil, and now, 13 days after testing positive, she has been declared free of the deadly disease. Her first order of business will be to hug her dog, Bentley, she said Friday. She invoked God and science in expressing gratitude for her ongoing recovery from a disease that has no established cure. ""I feel fortunate and blessed to be standing here today,"" she said. ""Throughout this ordeal, I have put my faith in God and my medical team."" Later Friday, President Barack Obama met Pham in the Oval Office and gave her a big hug. Prayer sustained her, and she thanked people around the world who prayed for her, Pham told reporters Friday at a National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. The nation saw a cheerful and composed Pham, dressed in a bright turquoise top and matching necklace, when she strode to a bank of microphones moments after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she was free of the virus. Complete coverage of Ebola . She thanked Dr. Kent Brantly, the American physician who also survived Ebola, for donating his plasma to her while she was sick. But she's not entirely out of the woods, she said. ""Although I no longer have Ebola, I know that it may be awhile before I have my strength back,"" Pham said. ""So with gratitude and respect for everyone's concern, I ask for my privacy and for my family's privacy to be respected as I return to Texas and try to get back to a normal life and reunite with my dog, Bentley."" Bentley, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, remains in quarantine until the end of the month in Texas, but Pham ""will be able to visit, hold and play with him tomorrow,"" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Friday. ""I know that will be good for both of them,"" said Jenkins, who oversees the Ebola response in Dallas. A 'stressful and challenging' time . Pham, 26, who grew up in a Vietnamese family in Fort Worth, Texas, graduated with a nursing degree in 2010 and just months ago received a certification in critical care nursing, which deals with life-threatening problems. The Ebola experience, she said, was a ""very stressful and challenging"" time for her. Without direct reference to the continent, she alluded to how Ebola has ravaged West Africa in an unprecedented outbreak that the World Health Organization says has caused almost 10,000 confirmed or probable cases of infection and 4,877 deaths as of this week. ""I am on my way back to recovery even as I reflect on how many others have not been so fortunate,"" she said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest called Pham's case ""a pretty apt reminder that we do have the best medical infrastructure in the world."" ""The track record of treating Ebola patients in this country is very strong, particularly for those who are quickly diagnosed,"" Earnest said. ""The fact that she has been treated and released I think is terrific news."" The first to catch virus on U.S. soil . Can pets get or spread Ebola? Pham was among the doctors and nurses in Dallas who treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. His diagnosis came after he returned from a trip to West Africa, and he died on October 8. Three days later, Pham tested positive for the Ebola virus, becoming the first person in the United States to contract Ebola on American soil. That sent waves of anxiety through the network of health care workers -- and beyond. Latest Ebola developments . Those anxieties deepened on October 15 when a second nurse in Dallas, Amber Vinson, tested positive for Ebola. Vinson had flown from Dallas to Cleveland and back, prompting an airline to warn passengers on both legs of her trip as well as passengers who took subsequent flights on an aircraft she used. Some schools closed. Health departments monitored dozens of people. None of them has tested positive for Ebola. Pham said Friday that her thoughts are with Vinson, who is getting treatment for Ebola at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. Vinson is steadily regaining her strength, and her spirits are high, her family has said. Doctors can no longer detect the virus in her body, but they have not yet determined when she will be discharged, the hospital in Atlanta said Friday.","President Obama gives a big hug to Nina Pham in the Oval Office .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The chairman of the New York Post, Rupert Murdoch, personally apologized Tuesday for an editorial cartoon published by the newspaper that drew charges of racism. This New York Post cartoon by Sean Delonas sparked a debate over race and cartooning. ""Today I want to personally apologize to any reader who felt offended, and even insulted,"" said the statement from Murdoch, who is also chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, which owns the paper. ""I can assure you -- without a doubt -- that the only intent of that cartoon was to mock a badly written piece of legislation. ""It was not meant to be racist, but unfortunately, it was interpreted by many as such. We all hold the readers of the New York Post in high regard, and I promise you that we will seek to be more attuned to the sensitivities of our community."" The cartoon by Sean Delonas referenced the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police. In the caption, one of the officers says, ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" The cartoon was published on Wednesday, a day after President Obama signed the stimulus bill. The Post issued a statement the following day, apologizing but noting that the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an ""ineptly written"" stimulus bill. Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama, the nation's first black president, to the chimpanzee. Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of Delonas. Delonas called the controversy ""absolutely friggin' ridiculous."" ""Do you really think I'm saying Obama should be shot?

"It's about making an entrance. Dramatic entries are a given with air travel, and airports should convey a sense of welcome and arrival to travelers landing in a new city, like the great train stations of yesteryear, says architecture critic Paul Goldberger. That doesn't usually happen. ""An inspiring grand welcome to a place is not something you get in most of them,"" says Goldberger, contributor to Vanity Fair, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his architecture criticism at The New York Times and author of ""Why Architecture Matters."" ""Most only aspire to a sense of efficiency and most don't even achieve that."" Where they exist at airports, the more impressive spaces are usually located in the airports' departure halls. Those passengers are rushing to clear security and catch flights and don't have time to appreciate their space. The arrivals hall usually doesn't inspire much. Check in: World's best airport hotels . ""When you arrive, you're shunted to a lower level to baggage claim and go through what feels like a service (exit),"" says Goldberger, who regularly flies through New York and New Jersey's bustling but not very beautiful airports. Although most airports don't meet his wish for a ""grand welcome"" -- even the ones he likes --  some architects are designing lovely airports that are worth admiring. Here are some of the airport designs Goldberger has appreciated or is hankering to see for himself. Madrid-Barajas Airport (Spain) The design by architect Richard Rogers for Barajas' Terminal 4, completed in 2006, is one of Goldberger's favorites. ""He took what is really a conventional plan, and he did a traditional airport beautifully,"" he says. Rogers' elegant architecture includes ""magnificent steel tresses and columns, and a very long concourse that gradually changes colors,"" says Goldberger. ""The colors fade over the course of what must be half a mile. It's quite breathtaking."" Beijing Capital International Airport (China) Sir Norman Foster has been ""more successful than anyone else at rethinking the airport and designing it in a new way that pretty much works,"" says Goldberger. Foster's international terminal design in Beijing was completed in 2008 in time for that summer's Olympic Games. Instead of a stretched-out layout or satellite terminals, Terminal 3 ""is essentially two huge triangular shapes, where the points face each other and are connected by a train,"" he says. ""That works quite well and is attractive."" 5 great get-fit retreats . Kansai International Airport (Osaka, Japan) Architect Renzo Piano's most remarkable achievement in this case may have been winning a design competition in 1988 for an airport that would sit on a man-made island that did not yet exist. Located 25 miles away from Osaka, Japan (and three miles off the coast), Kansai airport was completed in 1994 and can handle air traffic 24 hours per day. The island is now connected to the mainland by a 2.5 mile-long, two-level bridge. The airport is lovely, but ""it's more the achievement than the architecture itself,"" says Goldberger. King Abdulaziz International Airport (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) Completed in 1981, Skidmore, Owing and Merrill's design of the Hajj Terminal in Jeddah seems to capture the essence of Saudi Arabia's nomadic tradition. The firm developed tent-like structures using little energy to keep the space cool in the desert. Pictures of the terminal impressed Goldberger, which is why it's on his bucket list as an airport to visit. ""Jeddah seems like a fascinating attempt to marry the nomadic tradition of desert tents with monumental modern architecture,"" says Goldberger. ""A seeming impossibility, but I think they pulled it off."" World's best airport spas . Raleigh-Durham International Airport (North Carolina) Often overlooked as an example of good airport architecture, Raleigh-Durham International Airport's Terminal 2 was designed by Fentress Architects of Denver and completed in 2011. Inspired by its Southern roots and its service to the Research Triangle hub of companies and universities, ""it's a terminal that has a lot of wood and glass inside, a nice alternative to steel and glass,"" says Goldberger. Aeropuerto de Carrasco (Montevideo, Uruguay) Seeking to modernize and expand the airport serving Uruguay's capital, airport operators turned to native son and world renowned architect Rafael Vinoly. Completed in 2009,  the Carrasco airport's structure seems inspired by the rolling dunes along the country's coastline. The design is intriguing to Goldberger, which is why the Carrasco airport is also on his list of airports to experience. ""I've wanted to see Uruguay because Vinoly's swooping shape looks wonderful in photographs,"" says Goldberger. ""It looks like something inspired by Eero Saarinen's design"" for Trans World Airlines at John F. Kennedy International Airport (then called Idlewild Airport). Airlines collect $27 billion beyond ticket revenue . TWA Terminal (John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York) It's not in use anymore, but Goldberger says it still stands out as an architectural marvel. (Maybe if it was still open, Goldberger would like flying out of John F. Kennedy International Airport better.) Designed by Eero Saarinen and opened in 1962, this gorgeous terminal had a significant flaw: It wasn't built to change and grow with the growth of travel and the enormous aircraft that would soon come to Idlewild Airport, now JFK International. ""It was one of the great airport designs of all time, and it was completely unworkable for security and the volume of traffic (to come),"" says Goldberger. ""It remains a beautiful and incredibly inspiring building."" Matteo Pericoli mural (John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York) No, this doesn't mean Goldberger likes flying out of the American Airlines terminal where this mural is located. Italian architect and artist Matteo Pericoli was commissioned to paint a mural of the great architecture of the world on a wall at the American terminal. So while Goldberger isn't crazy about the airport, the mural ""is one of my favorite things at any airport."" A pleasant experience matters, too . When Goldberger is trying to get from one city to another, sometimes his requirements for a nice airport are the same as anyone else. At the last minute, that's why he also tacked on these ""fairly ordinary terminals that are nevertheless pleasanter to be in than the norm"": San Francisco International Airport's newly redone Terminal 2 and the JetBlue Airways terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. ""Lots of light, nice places to eat, wide-open spaces, views of (the) field, places to work, rest, etc.,"" he wrote, via e-mail. ""Great architecture isn't always necessary to raise an airport above mediocrity."" What's your favorite airport anywhere in the world?

"Rafael Nadal completed his preparations for the U.S. Open by claiming the title in Cincinnati for the first time with a hard-fought 7-6 7-6 win over home hope John Isner Sunday. It was his 26th victory at a Masters 1000 tournament and second in succession after lifting the trophy in Montreal last week. Nadal, who has won nine titles in 2013 in a remarkable run since returning to the ATP circuit after injury in February, has moved to No.2 in the world off the back of that success. It has relegated Britain's Andy Murray, who will be defending his U.S. Open crown when the action starts at Flushing Meadows on August 26, to third seed when the draw is made later this week. Only a shock first round exit at Wimbledon has interrupted Nadal's charge to the top of the rankings with three of his successes coming on hard courts on top of his traditional dominance on clay. Isner, who had beaten World No.1 Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, forced two set points at 6-5 on Nadal's service in the opener, but could not punish his Spanish opponent. Nadal eventually took the subsequent tiebreak 10-8 before another closely fought second set. He could not force a single break point on the service of the giant Isner, but in the second tiebreaker forged a 5-1 lead to take control. A typical cross court winner gave Nadal victory in a shade under two hours, collapsing to the ground in trade mark fashion. It was his 15th straight victory on hard courts and he will be the man in form for the final grand slam of the season, looking at add to his French Open success earlier this year. ""This title is very important for me, the Open is still a week away,"" he told the crowd after his victory. ""This is the time to enjoy this one. In a few days I'll start thinking about the Open,"" he added. But there was an upset in the women's final as Victoria Azarenka recovered from a set down to beat World No.1 Serena Williams 2-6 6-2 7-6 in two and a half hours. The second seed from Belarus had beaten Williams earlier this year in Doha, just after claiming the first grand slam of the season in Australia. But the latest triumph was only her third over the American in 15 attempts, giving her a morale boost ahead of next week in New York.","Rafael Nadal wins Cincinnati Masters title .

"Imagine being out to dinner with the love of your life and your beautiful, smiling, 3-year-old child.  It's a double celebration: your birthday and the end of your young boy's difficult recovery from surgery for a heart defect. As you cross the street afterward, holding hands and swinging the little one up in the air, you think, ""This is what it's about."" You know it's one of the best days of your life. For Michael Morton, that day was August 12, 1986.  He had just turned 32. The next day, it was all taken away.  The dream became a nightmare. Christine, his wife, was attacked and killed at their home in Williamson County, Texas, just outside Austin.  Michael Morton was at work at the time. Still, authorities suspected him. ""Innocent people think that if you just tell the truth then you've got nothing to fear from the police,"" Morton says now.  ""If you just stick to it that the system will work, it'll all come to light, everything will be fine."" Instead, Morton was charged, ripped away from his boy, and put on trial.  The prosecutor, speaking to the jury in emotional terms with tears streaming down his face, laid out a graphic, depraved sexual scenario, accusing Morton of bludgeoning his wife for refusing to have sex on his birthday. ""There was no scientific evidence, there was no eyewitness, there was no murder weapon, there was no believable motive,"" Morton says.  ""... I didn't see how any rational, thinking person would say that's enough for a guilty verdict."" But with no other suspects, the jury convicted him.  ""We all felt so strongly that this was justice for Christine and that we were doing the right thing,"" says Mark Landrum, who was the jury foreman. Morton spent nearly 25 years in prison. He saw his son Eric only twice a year.  ""I would love seeing him, I was fascinated with his every move,"" Morton says.  But Eric ""was becoming more distant,"" Morton says.  ""He was becoming less mine."" As a teen, Eric had no memories of his father outside of prison.  Letters his dad wrote him were ""just a window into a life that never happened,"" he says.  His father ""barely existed in my life.  I didn't have memories of him outside of the visits to prison."" Eric decided to stop visiting.  ""I think it was embarrassing for me to think that I had to go to jail to see my dad."" Michael Morton wrote Eric saying he had to come and tell him that in person.  He did. ""It was another one of those numb, painful things,"" Morton says.  ""I just looked at my sister-in-law and said something like, 'Take care of my son.'"" Eric also changed his last name to that of the relatives who raised him. Opinion: How to fight prosecutors who abuse the justice system . Trial didn't include critical evidence . A few years ago, a group of attorneys, working pro bono on Morton's behalf, managed to bring the truth to light.  Not only was Morton innocent, but the prosecutor, Ken Anderson, was accused of withholding crucial evidence. DNA exonerations by the numbers . The little boy, Eric, had seen the attack and told relatives that daddy was not home at the time.  He described the man who did it.  Neighbors had described a man parking a green van behind the Mortons' house and walking off into a wooded area. A blood-stained bandana was found nearby.  None of that evidence made it into the trial. It took years of fighting, but Morton's attorneys finally got the bandana tested for DNA.  It contained Christine Morton's blood and hair and the DNA of another man -- a convicted felon named Mark Norwood. Norwood had killed Christine Morton.  And since no one figured that out after her death, he remained free.  He killed another woman in the Austin area, Debra Baker, in similar circumstances less than two years later, authorities say. Norwood has now been convicted in Morton's killing, and indicted in Baker's killing. Morton was freed in October 2011.  He was 57 years old. ""I thank God this wasn't a capital case,"" he said. Morton's story, told in the CNN Films' documentary ""An Unreal Dream,"" shines a spotlight on wrongful convictions in the United States.  More than 2,000 wrongfully convicted people were exonerated between 1989 and 2012, according to data compiled by the University of Michigan Law School. But Morton's case has paved new ground that could affect cases nationwide. Last month, Anderson -- Morton's prosecutor who in 2001 became a judge -- pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause for withholding exculpatory evidence. A judgment of contempt from the clerk's office of the 26th Judicial District, Williamson County, Texas, said the court found ""Anderson in criminal contempt of court on the matters set out in the show cause order..."" Anderson's punishment pales in comparison to Morton's experience. The former prosecutor stepped down from his position as a judge and agreed to 10 days in jail.  He then served only five of those days, under Texas laws involving good behavior behind bars. He also agreed to a $500 fine, 500 hours of community service, and the loss of his law license, according to the Innocence Project, a legal clinic affiliated with Yeshiva University's Cardozo Law School. It's ""an extremely rare instance, and perhaps the first time, that a prosecutor has been criminally punished for failing to turn over exculpatory evidence,"" the Innocence Project said. The ""historic precedent demonstrates that when a judge orders a prosecutor to look in his file and disclose exculpatory evidence, deliberate failure to do so is punishable by contempt,"" said Barry Scheck, the project's co-director. The organization is working with the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association and the Innocence Project of Texas to coordinate a review of Anderson's cases. Anderson, meanwhile, has not publicly acknowledged any personal wrongdoing.  In court, he said he couldn't remember details of the case, and that he and his family have been through false accusations over it. ""I apologize that the system screwed up. I've beaten myself up on what I could have done different and I don't know,"" he said, acknowledging Morton's ""pain."" Morton asked a judge to ""do what needs to be done, but at the same time to be gentle with Judge Anderson."" In prepared remarks outside the courthouse, Anderson repeated that he wanted to ""formally apologize for the system's failure to Mr. Morton and every other person who was affected by the verdict."" A statement released by Anderson on Thursday said, ""This resolution resulted in a finding of contempt only.  As stated on the record, this resolution did not involve any plea by Mr. Anderson to any criminal charge."" The former prosecutor also commented that he ""hopes, for the sake of all persons involved, that this resolution brings an end to the tragic situation that began with the brutal murder of Christine Morton in 1986 and that was followed by the incorrect conviction and incarceration of Michael Morton.  Mr. Anderson continues to believe that Mr. Morton's conviction resulted directly from a medical examiner's assessment of Christine Morton's time of death at 1:30 a.m. -- a time when Mr. Morton was indisputably at home with his wife. Regardless of the cause of the wrong result reached in the Morton trial, in light of the DNA results obtained in 2011, Mr. Anderson has consistently expressed -- and continues to express to Mr. Morton and his family -- his regret for Mr. Morton's prosecution and incorrect incarceration."" Morton now works on programs to help other innocent people behind bars.  Earlier this year, Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed the Michael Morton Act into law, requiring prosecutors to turn evidence over to defense lawyers in criminal cases, upon the defendant's request, without the need for a court order. The law will make the state's criminal justice system ""fairer and helping prevent wrongful convictions,"" Perry said. 'Life has come full circle' ""Other people often feel far more anger than I do,"" Morton says.  ""Vindication is very, very good, but it's something I knew all along. ...  It's really nothing new for me."" He had a religious epiphany in jail, and credits his newfound inner peace with the knowledge that God ""loves me."" He's now close with his son -- and daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, who is named after Christine.  ""I've never seen a more perfect child,"" Morton says. ""Life has come full circle,"" his son Eric says.  ""...I do love him."" ""The conundrums of life, the philosophical paradoxes, the metaphysical problems -- I feel like I get it now,"" Michael Morton says with a smile.  ""I understand suffering and unfairness. I can't think of anything better to receive than that. I'm good with this."" After 15 years on death row, freedom .

"Reader's Digest seems to be on life support, filing for bankruptcy protection this week for the second time in four years. But at one time, what's now seen as grandma's magazine was an influential and powerful force in politics and culture. When I began my book on the Reader's Digest, people were incredulous.  ""But no one takes that seriously,"" they'd say. ""People only read it when they're waiting to see the dentist."" Yet, those who dismiss the magazine as trivial underestimate the Digest's impact on millions of Americans' view of the world. From its humble beginnings in 1922, Reader's Digest became the highest circulating general interest magazine in the United States, reaching more than 16 million readers a month.  From 1938 on, the Digest could be read in 17 languages.  In the U.S., Reader's Digest had the highest subscription rate of any magazine except TV Guide. Reader's Digest started life not long after the emergence of the USSR. Initially, the magazine was sympathetic to the Russian revolution, seeing it as a movement against what it regarded as undemocratic, aristocratic European society. By the 1930s, however, it had identified the USSR with communism. Later, it began to publish stories that portrayed the Soviet state as the primary danger to post-World War II America. The Digest presented the U.S. and USSR as polar opposites. As well as running clearly political articles that explained international relations and threats to peace, the magazine's ostensibly apolitical stories reinforced this image of two incompatible societies. Descriptions of everyday life in America and the Soviet Union detailed how different Americans were from Russians, how different Russians' music was, their food, their sense of humor -- even Russian sex lives were different. At the extreme, in 1981 a story about an American in Siberia seemed to suggest biological differences when it reported the American's body rejected a Russian blood transfusion. These types of stories earned the Digest a reputation as a leading voice in anti-communism. As it gained prominence, Reader's Digest drew criticism. Despite the publication's determination to celebrate individual freedoms, it was accused of being nothing more than state propaganda.  There were claims of CIA funding and editorial control, especially in its foreign editions in Latin America. Whether these accusations were true or not, the magazine's influence in popular culture could perhaps be seen as even more powerful and pernicious.  As a digest, the magazine sought not to reflect the immediate news but issues and ideas of ""lasting interest.""  Famously, Ronald Reagan was said to have a box full of Digest articles that he had collected for reference. Reader's Digest meant to provide readers with all of the information they needed to know about what was important in the world, what America's role in the world should be and what they, as good citizens, should do to preserve the American way.  It became a trusted source of news. In the days before electronic communication, it was perhaps the only source  that many people, particularly those in rural areas, could access regularly. Reader's Digest presented itself as a guardian of American morality and values. In June 1960, a Reader's Digest advertisement quoted President Dwight D. Eisenhower as saying, ""Our magazines are a leading force for moral and cultural growth in our country and one of the surest guarantees of an informed public."" Exactly what the relationship was between Reader's Digest and state foreign policy is unclear, but its role in encouraging American readers to think about and actively engage in world affairs is beyond doubt. In the February 1969 issue, apparently fearing a lack of support for the Vietnam War, Reader's Digest launched a ""Fly this Flag Proudly"" campaign, inserting flag decals into the 18 million copies of the magazine.  A follow-up survey indicated that 78% of readers had detached the flag, and half of those people had put it to use. A few years earlier, an article on how Brazil resisted a communist takeover was deemed to contain such ""vital, useful information for every nation menaced by communist subversion"" that readers were encouraged to send it -- and free reprints -- to friends abroad, or to place it into ""the hands of concerned people [whom readers] may meet"" on vacation. When relations with the USSR began to thaw, the Digest feared that Americans were overlooking the danger presented by the Soviets. During detente and the beginnings of the end of the Cold War, articles warned readers not to trust those who suggested that the Soviets could change. The fall of the Berlin Wall heralded a collapse of the Digest's moral certainty about the difference between America and its old enemy. Perhaps the decline of Reader's Digest's fortunes was inevitable with the longer-term social and political influences of 60s counterculture, the failure of general interest magazines, the rise of global media targeted at specific niches and the advent of the internet. But of equal importance was the end of the Soviet threat:  With the fall of its arch enemy, the Evil Empire, there was no mirror against which it could present an alternative image of America and its historic mission.","Joanne Sharp: Reader's Digest once had a huge role in shaping opinion .

"President Barack Obama might be trying to distance himself from MIT economist Jonathan Gruber who has drawn heat for saying the ""stupidity of the American voter"" was a key factor in passing the President's signature health care law, but in 2006 then-Sen. Barack Obama said he pulled ideas from the academic ""liberally."" Speaking at a Brookings Institution event the same day as Gruber, Obama praised him and other academics as ""some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles, many of them I've stolen ideas from liberally,"" according to a video reported Monday by The Washington Free Beacon. Obama goes on to list four of the seven panelists at the April 2006 event, including ""Jon Gruber."" Gruber was hired in 2009 as a consultant to the Obama administration as it began crafting the Affordable Care Act, now commonly known as Obamacare. Gruber netted nearly $400,000 for the year-long job spent modeling the impact of proposals that would later be shaped into Obama's signature health care law. Obamacare: Voters, are you stupid? Democrats have tried to extinguish the scandal that flamed after a half-dozen years-old videos of Gruber surfaced in recent weeks in which he suggests advocates of the law exploited ""the lack of economic understanding of the American voter"" and said ""people are too stupid"" to understand the nuances of the law and its language. Obama on Sunday dismissed Gruber as ""some adviser who never worked on our staff"" and insisted his administration and other proponents of the law never misled voters about the legislation. ""We had a yearlong debate"" Obama said. ""The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run."" Obama is not the first official to walk back on his praise of Gruber. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed outright that she did not ""know who he is"" and said he ""didn't help write our bill"" when in fact she had cited the economist's work approvingly in 2009 and even mentioned Gruber by name in an interview that same year.","Obama speaking of Gruber and other academics in 2006: ""Many of them I've stolen ideas from liberally""

"As evidenced by media stories and public awareness campaigns, Americans have resolved to get tough on bullying. In that spirit, it's time to send a message to bullies with badges. We need to tell police who prey on the vulnerable: ""No more! When you pile on a suspect and beat him to death, we will treat you just like any other alleged criminal. We will arrest you and prosecute you. And if convicted, you will go to prison for a very long time. We will make an example out of you so that other police officers will think twice before abusing their power."" The messenger could be the jury that will hear the case against two police officers in Fullerton, California, a city about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles. A judge ruled Wednesday that the officers will stand trial in the beating death last July of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man afflicted with schizophrenia. Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Officer Manuel Ramos faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder, because prosecutors believe he took a more active role in the assault. Both officers have pleaded not guilty. This week, at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial, prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating. The footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on Thomas' chest, firing electric shocks from a Taser stun gun, all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest. Early on, Ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up!"" Another police officer is heard saying: ""We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell."" By the end of the video, Thomas is lying in a pool of blood. According to prosecutors, the young man suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions. He died five days later. What we see in that 33 minutes of footage, including a defenseless Thomas screaming in pain, saying he's sorry and pleading for help, should never happen in the United States of America. When it does happen, it can't be tolerated, justified, or excused. That's coming from the son of a retired cop. My father wore a badge for 36 years, and he has no stomach for police brutality. In fact, about 20 years ago, when another piece of videotape surfaced -- that of the Rodney King beating by police officers in 1991 -- I remember my father telling me that, as far as he was concerned, those out-of-control law enforcement officers wailing on King had ceased being cops and become little more than thugs and criminals. As it turns out, Thomas' father is also a retired law enforcement officer. After his son died, Ron Thomas made it his mission to make sure the story got out and would not be forgotten. He used social media and the Internet to show the world what those officers had done to his son, complete with graphic photos that he took at the side of Kelly Thomas' hospital bed. This is a good dad. But he was also, apparently, a good cop who trained fellow deputies on the right way to take down suspects. This is the wrong way. Thomas described the officers' actions as nothing less than a ""hate crime against the homeless and mentally ill."" Last year, Fullerton city officials offered Thomas nearly a million dollars to settle the case. He turned it down, and instead pushed for a criminal trial. This should bring some small comfort to Ron Thomas. He needs it. He has to carry around with him for the rest of his life that, as his son was fighting for his life, he cried out for his father to protect him from these bullies. On the video, we hear Kelly Thomas screaming: ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!"" As a father myself, those words break my heart. ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!"" He was killed. And now, if the cops are convicted of this crime, they have to pay.","Two police officers are charged in the beating death last July of Kelly Thomas .

"A defiant Barack Obama dives into what could be a defining period of his presidency this week, after repeatedly enraging Republicans from afar during his Asia tour. Obama faces showdowns with the GOP over immigration, the Keystone XL pipeline and his drive for a nuclear deal with Iran, all of which have huge consequences for his political legacy. Far from being chastened by the Republican capture of the Senate, Obama is setting out to prove he is no lame duck and can still set the agenda. But the GOP insists the mid-terms gave them a share of power in Washington, and believe Obama risks usurping his authority and even the constitution with his bold new strategy. Obama drawing lines on immigration, climate change . Obama chose a highly symbolic setting to set the tone for two final White House years in which he will face a unified Republican Congress. Side-by-side in Myanmar with the world's most famous dissident, Obama refused to bow to what Republicans regard as the capital's new political ""reality."" On the veranda of the lakeside villa from where Aung San Suu Kyi faced down a junta, Obama said he had long warned House Republicans he would use executive power to reform the US immigration system if they failed to. ""That's gonna happen. That's gonna happen before the end of the year."" The president doubled down in Australia on Sunday, before boarding Air Force One for home, saying he would be derelict in his duties if he did not act. ""I can't wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that at least for the next two years can improve the system,"" he said. White House officials have not said when Obama will wield his executive powers in a move that could remove the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented people. But they say it will be soon. While Obama was abroad, post-election tensions escalated sharply on Capitol Hill as happy talk from both sides about working together quickly ebbed away. Senior aides dispute the idea the elections were a referendum on the President and say Obama is at his best when he is on ""offense"" and believe that's  what Americans want to see. So, as he trekked through Asia, Obama rattled Republicans almost every day. Related: On the other side of the world, Obama determined as ever to bypass Congress . He surprised everyone with a new climate deal with China that the GOP slammed as costly and ""ridiculous."" He popped up on video to discuss new Internet regulations that may spark another row. He refused to budge on approving the Keystone XL pipeline to take oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. He may veto a bill on the project that Congress is expected to pass this week. While in Asia, the president debunked the idea that the plan, opposed by environmentalists in his political base, would create lots of jobs and lower gas prices. Obama says he still wants to work with Republicans on tax reform and infrastructure spending bills. But it looks like he has decided that he won't compromise his legacy priorities to get that done. GOP promises retribution, but avoids specifics . Republicans are fuming over Obama's go-it-alone attitude since voters handed the GOP the Senate and expanded its majority in the House. ""We'd like for the president to recognize the reality that he has the government that he has, not the one he wishes he had,"" said the next Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Obama could spark a backlash over immigration. ""If he goes it alone he is going to run into the ire of the American people,"" Graham said, though said Congress also had a responsibility to act. Republican Senate leadership member Roy Blunt warned however that Obama will eventually have to play ball, or he will end up with Republican bills he doesn't like. ""At that point, his choice is to sign it or veto it."" Republican leader John Boehner said his goal was to stop the president from violating his oath of office and the constitution. ""There are things he is just not going to get."" Republican anger is however masking a serious problem the party has yet to resolve : how to hit back at what it sees a presidential power grab. Other than warning that Obama would ""poison the well"" for future cooperation, GOP leaders won't say whether they will use pending federal funding bills as leverage. That route led to a damaging government shutdown for which the GOP paid a heavy political price last year. One response could be to pass a series of short term funding measures, that keep administration priorities in limbo and maximize Republican leverage. House Republicans could also chose to expand the lawsuit they have already lodged against Obama alleging he usurped his authority in implementing Obamcare. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer stirred buzz on Friday by declaring executive action on immigration would even be an ""impeachable"" offense. GOP leaders are already braced for pressure from the right for a tangible and not merely symbolic reflex when the president acts. ""If the president moves forward and does his executive action, the Republicans have no choice but to respond,"" said Dan Holler, communications director of Heritage Action for America, a conservative non profit group. ""That response needs to be legislative. The vehicle that makes most sense is denying funding for the activity that they say is unconstitutional and inappropriate."" Obamacare: Voters, are you stupid? Obama's strategy could divide Republicans . Holler's point reflects a secondary benefit some Democrats see in Obama's strategy â€” it will cause a big political headache for Republican bosses. Obama's immigration move is certain to ignite a firestorm of grass roots conservative anger. That will in turn pile pressure on rank-and-file Republican House members who campaigned for office slamming what they see as an imperial president. Some conservative lawmakers were already skittish at leadership warnings that it might be impossible to repeal Obamacare with a Democratic president in the White House. Nothing worries Republicans in deeply conservative districts more than the prospect of a primary challenge, and many simply cannot afford not to mount the kind of rowdy response to Obama which will rock Boehner's restive caucus. Several House Republicans are arguing that it's time to quickly get to work on holding hearings and drafting an immigration bill to demonstrate their party has its own reform ideas, and is not just about blocking the president's policies. ""Ultimately we all know we've got to deal with this problem, so why not start dealing with the problem - even though it's the lame duck, even though you're not going to get anything through to final passage,"" Idaho Republican Rep Mike Simpson told reporters Friday. ""Now we could start showing some seriousness that we're going to address this problem."" Executive orders on immigration will also detonate as the 2016 presidential race dawns, trapping Republicans between the party's activist base and a desire to engage Hispanic voters vital to GOP White House hopes. Republicans are also adamantly opposed to the nuclear deal with Iran which could emerge from down-to-the-wire talks in Vienna starting this week and are threatening to upend it with new sanctions. Obama appears to reject the idea Republicans have a mandate for change at all. He stressed in his post-election news conference that two thirds of Americans did not even vote and he was ""the guy who's elected by everybody."" But he knows a tough political fight looms and reflected Friday on the contrast between polarization at home and the welcome he gets on his travels. ""You are always popular in somebody else's country. When you're in your own country, everybody is complaining.""","Obama stakes out defiant tone toward GOP .

"FBI Director Robert Mueller acknowledged the law enforcement agency uses drone aircraft in the United States for surveillance in certain difficult cases. Mueller told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that drones are used by the FBI in a ""very, very minimal way and very seldom."" He did not say how many unmanned surveillance vehicles (UAVs) the FBI has or how often they have been used. But a law enforcement official told CNN the FBI has used them a little more than a dozen times but did not say when that started. The official said drones are useful in hostage and barricade situations because they operate more quietly and are less visible than traditional aircraft such as helicopters. The FBI said it used a UAV earlier this year to monitor the situation where a boy was held hostage in a bunker in Alabama. Bureau spokesman Paul Bresson said their use allows ""us to learn critical information that otherwise would be difficult to obtain without introducing serious risk to law enforcement personnel."" Bresson said the aircraft can only be used to perform surveillance on stationary subjects and the FBI must first get approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly in a ""very confined geographic area."" Surveillance fallout . Mueller's comments come as the Obama administration grapples with political and other fallout from the public disclosure of top-secret surveillance programs, which has triggered new debate over reach of national security vs. privacy rights. National security and law enforcement officials have defended National Security Agency telephone and e-mail surveillance of overseas communications as an effective tool in fighting terror. President Barack Obama has assured Americans the government is not listening to their phone conversations or reading their e-mail. But Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, asked Mueller whether the FBI had guidelines for using drones that would consider the ""privacy impact on American citizens."" Mueller replied the agency was in the initial stages of developing them. ""I will tell you that our footprint is very small,"" he said. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein expressed concern over drone use domestically. ""I think the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans is the drone and the use of the drone, and the very few regulations that are on it today and the booming industry of commercial drones,"" the California Democrat said. Mueller said he would need to check on the bureau's policy for retaining images from drones and report back to the panel. ""It is very narrowly focused on particularized cases and particularized needs and particularized cases,"" said Mueller. ""And that is the principal privacy limitations we have."" Sen. Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, said he was concerned the FBI was deploying drone technology and only in the initial stages of developing guidelines ""to protect Americans' privacy rights."" Grassley wants answers from Holder . Grassley sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder following the hearing asking why written information Holder sent him last month about federal law enforcement use of drones included related information about the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and the Drug Enforcement Administration, but not the FBI. Grassley sought answers to several questions and asked Holder to reply by June 28. He wants to know who at the FBI authorized drone use and information on the uses and limitations of their use and whether any are armed or capable of being armed. The Justice Department said it was reviewing Grassley's letter. Mueller said Wednesday the drones were used for surveillance. Members of Congress and privacy advocates have pressed for regulations on the use of drones, and their use in counterterror operations overseas was a controversy that flared publicly during confirmation hearings for CIA Director John Brennan earlier this year. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, delayed a vote on Brennan with a filibuster over the possible use of drones against American citizens on U.S. soil. Attorney General Eric Holder told Paul in a March 4 letter that ""the U.S. government has not carried out drone strikes in the United States and has no intention of doing so."" Last month, Paul introduced legislation to prevent ""unwarranted government intrusion"" by drones. The bill proposes that law enforcement officers be prohibited from using drones to gather surveillance or collect evidence without a warrant, unless there is an imminent danger to life or a high risk of a terrorist attack. The measure also makes an exception so that drones can be used to patrol the nation's borders. The Senate has not taken up Paul's proposal. A similar one was previously introduced in the House. Drone use more common . Unmanned drone use is becoming more common in the United States although it is not lawful in many cases. The FAA forecasts some 10,000 civilian drones will be in use in the United States within five years, including those for law enforcement and commercial purposes. Amie Stepanovich, of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has previously said law enforcement should not use drones as an alternative to police patrols. She said that they should be used for specific operations and that Congress should pass a law requiring legal permission. Because they are cheaper to use than helicopters, unmanned aircraft can be used to monitor crops and livestock, look at damage to buildings and for other uses. The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country.","FBI Director Robert Mueller says agency uses drones in certain difficult cases .

"A former senior member of President Barack Obama's national security team is panning the administration's decision to rule out the use of ground troops to fight ISIS and questioning Obama's leadership style. ""I take the position that when you're commander in chief that you oughta keep all options on the table ... to be able to have the flexibility to do what is necessary in order to defeat the enemy,"" former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta told CNN. ""We're conducting airstrikes. But to make those airstrikes work, to be able to do what you had to do, you don't -- you don't just send planes in and drop bombs. You've gotta have targets. You've gotta know what you're goin' after.  To do that, you do need people on the ground."" Panetta's comments are a stinging rebuke of Obama at a crucial point in his administration as the President battles multiple national security threats, including ISIS, a resurgent Russia and the spread of Ebola. His memoir, ""Worthy Fights,"" describes a White House that did not use its ""leverage"" to try to keep a residual force in Iraq. ""Those on our side of the debate viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,"" he wrote in the book. The White House has argued it could not convince then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to come to terms. But Panetta told CNN the White House did not use its power to pressure al-Maliki enough. ""What I'm saying is that Maliki was the kind of leader that you had to constantly put pressure on to direct him in the right direction,"" he said. ""We had, with Iraq -- made a commitment with regards to military assistance, F-16 fighter planes, other types of military aid, that I think if we had said, 'Look, you know, if you're not gonna give us -- the agreement that we need to maintain our forces there, you know, we may not provide this kind of assistance."" Panetta: Should have armed Syrian rebels sooner . The White House, he said, needed to do more ""to try to push him."" ""You need to threaten guys like that, who won't come along. And everybody knew that,"" he said. ""I think what happened was -- is that because Maliki kept resisting this effort, that there was a sense that, 'Look, why should we want this more than the Iraqis want this?'  And if they're -- if they're putting up a fuss about this, then -- we might as well just pick up and leave."" Panetta describes a leadership vacuum on the issue, calling it a lack of ""active advocacy"" by the President on the issue. In the end, he said, ""I think the kind of push and direct involvement that I think could have had an impact simply never developed."" As to whether ISIS would be as much a threat today had a residual force been left in Iraq, he told CNN, ""I do think that if we had had a presence there, it might not have created the kind of vacuum that we saw develop in Iraq."" Panetta was aligned with much of the President's national security team on this argument -- and on the question of arming the Syrian rebels in 2012, which the President also resisted. ""I mean, it's understandable,"" Panetta said, explaining Obama's argument that the weapons could get into the wrong hands. ""But at the same time, if we're going to influence the rebel forces, if we're gonna try to establish a moderate element to those forces, so that they can, in fact, provide leadership not only to confront (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad, but also to help us in terms of a political transition, that it was important to provide this kind of assistance in order to have some leverage over what they -- they -- they were gonna do."" There was honest disagreement -- but then no decision. ""To a large extent it wasn't that the President kind of said -- said, 'No, we shouldn't do it.'  The President kind of never really came to a decision as to whether or not it should happen,"" Panetta said in the interview. ""I think it basically sat there for a while and then got to the point where everybody just kind of assumed that it was not gonna happen."" In the book, he described some hesitation and half-steps regarding this issue. ""I mean, it was that kind of just a hesitation to really, you know, do what needed to be done. Now, you know, don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""I think he was very strong in terms of the war on terrorism.  And he made some tough decisions.  But there were these decisions that basically never were confronted, that I think-- in many ways-- contributed to the problems we're facing today."" Panetta told CNN the President is now taking appropriate, decisive action on ISIS -- albeit a bit late. ""He's made the decision to put troops on the ground in Iraq, to try to help the -- security forces,"" he said. ""He's made the decision to -- arm and train rebel forces in Syria.  And he's made the decision to conduct air attacks. So in many ways-- he's made the right decisions now.  I think those decisions should've been made two years ago."" The portrait Panetta sketches of Obama sometimes looks more like a professor than a President. ""He relies on the logic of his presentation, with the hope that ultimately people will embrace that logic and then do what's right,"" he said. ""You know what?  In 50 years, my experience is logic doesn't work in Washington. You gotta basically go after people and make them understand what they have to do. And that means you create a war room.  You go after votes.  You have to push people."" Panetta described to CNN a sense the President found that work unrewarding at the very least, even distasteful. ""I think it -- it offended him that people would not really get serious and work on the issues,"" he said. ""I think as a result of that, he just felt, you know, 'How -- how can I deal with people that simply won't -- don't wanna do the right thing for the country?' Well, the reality is, if you wanna govern in this country, you have to deal with people you don't like."" While Panetta had left the administration by 2013, he argues that the President made a mistake by not acting when Syria used chemical weapons against its own people -- violating his own clearly drawn red line. ""I think at that point the President very clearly should've said, 'You have crossed that red line.  And we're not gonna allow that to happen.'  And I think initially my sense was they were gonna do exactly that.  But somehow they backed away from it."" The airstrikes against Syria did not happen. It's clearly a struggle for Panetta -- who said he admires and likes the President -- to reconcile the decisive Obama who approved the raid against Osama bin Laden with the President who vacillated over Syrian airstrikes. ""A President that made the decision to go after bin Laden, and made a very gutsy decision to do that, in spite of whatever was being recommended to him, but he -- he knew that this had to be done.  And I really respected that decision.  I just could not have imagined him -- not making the same decision with it came to the credibility of the United States on drawing that red line in Syria."" To no one's surprise, the White House has not warmly welcomed Panetta's version of history. Vice President Joe Biden last week said it was ""inappropriate"" for former administration officials to write books criticizing the policies of the White House. ""At least let the guy get out of office first."" Asked if Biden has a point, Panetta told CNN, ""You know, I'm of the view that you don't put a hold on history. History is what it is,"" he said, adding, ""I recommend the President and Vice President Biden take the time to read the book. Because I think -- you know, when you read it, it's a pretty balanced presentation of what happened.""","Panetta writes that Obama was not forceful enough to try to keep a residual force in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- I grew up under the impression that I was the best trick-or-treater in the whole wide world, because my grandmother invented it! The whole thing was her idea! My grandmother and her friend UNICEF started it way back when she was born in the early 1500s. I thought UNICEF must be a pretty cool lady if she was hanging out with my grandmother. Occasionally I'll ask people if they know about UNICEF, and sometimes they don't. But if I then mention the little orange Trick-or-Treat boxes on Halloween, suddenly everyone knows UNICEF. We grew up carrying those Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF boxes on Halloween night, and now our kids do. These days, the candy bags may be fancier than pillowcases, and the costumes may come from the store, but the orange boxes remain the same. In 1950 when Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF began, kids simply decorated old milk cartons to collect change. The idea was as simple then as it is today: On Halloween, besides asking for candy, why not also ask for UNICEF donations? Nothing that might sting, nothing big -- just the pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters that normally languish behind the couch, in old winter coats, on the floor of the car, or in the good ole spare-change-bowl-by-the-door. The money that falls through the cracks -- so American kids may raise a little money for their peers who are suffering, far away from costumes and candy. Since Halloween 1950, that ""simple plan,"" that ""nothing big,"" has raised more than $144 million for UNICEF. That's $144 million in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters! For many kids who are threatened by disease, natural disasters and war in places like Somalia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and too many other developing countries, this spare change has meant the difference between thriving and merely surviving, health and illness, even life and death. In fact, the $144 million in small change has contributed to some remarkable news: About 50 years ago, the number of children who died every day from preventable causes before their fifth birthday was more than 50,000. Three years ago, that number was 25,500. Despite a recession, despite the continuing effects of a global food crisis, despite other seemingly unbeatable odds, that number has now dropped to 24,000. Trick-or-treaters like you and me, your kids and mine, and members of civic groups like Key Club, can feel some pride that we have helped make this happen. But the appalling fact remains: 24,000 children die every day from preventable causes like hunger, measles, pneumonia and tetanus. The vaccines, medicines and technologies that can prevent and treat such illnesses already exist. Not one child should die from these illnesses in the year 2009. It's projected that Americans will spend about $4.75 billion on Halloween this year, buying everything from candy and costumes, smoke machines and life-size inflatable lawn ornaments. But I bet that this year, like last year and many years prior, there's still change behind that couch and in those old coats. We need that simple plan: A ""nothing big"" again this year. Not only to help those children, but to teach our own kids. We can get 24,000 down to zero. And we can show our kids that they can make a difference; that every penny counts, that they can save a child and change the world. So they'll carry the boxes now, you and I can fill the bowl by the door to the brim and be ready, and this year Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF can make that change. It turns out that although my grandmother did establish the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, and was president for over 25 years, and while she was a great lady, she did not, in fact, invent Halloween. Or trick-or-treating. She just perfected it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Téa Leoni.","Téa Leoni suggests that trick-or-treaters ask for UNICEF donations along with candy .

"Egypt's interim government officially declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization on Wednesday, blamed it for a bombing this week that killed 16 people, and announced that anyone who is a member of the group will be punished. Hossam Issa, the interim minister of higher education and a deputy prime minister, announced the Cabinet's decision on state-run al-Masriaya television. ""The government reiterates that there will be no return to the past under any circumstances and Egypt, the state and the people, will never succumb to the terrorism of the Muslim Brotherhood whose crimes have gone far beyond all moral, religious and human limits,"" he said. The government also will punish anyone giving the group financial support, Issa added. Hundreds of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood took to the streets in towns and cities across Egypt after the announcement. In Alexandria, some protesters threw fireworks at authorities and set fire to police cars as young people marched through the streets chanting ""Sisi is a traitor,"" according to the official Facebook page of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. ""Sisi"" refers to Egypt's new leader, Gen. Abdel Fatah El Sisi. ""The terrorist coup authorities that are agents for the Zionists announced the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorists, similar to declaration made against the Palestinian resistance movement by Israel. The coup is terrorism,"" the group said in an online statement. Explosion rocks university in Cairo, injures 5 . In Cairo, demonstrators holding up the four-finger sign in honor of Rabaa (""four"" in Arabic) flooded the residential neighborhood of Dokki. Police violently cleared the Muslim Brotherhood's protest camp at the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque earlier this year, killing hundreds of people in the single bloodiest day in Egypt's modern history. Tamarod, the grass-roots political faction responsible for organizing the petition campaign that led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy in July by the Egyptian military, issued a statement on its official website. ""The government's decision announcing the Brotherhood group a terrorist organization is a good step, and it came late but better to come late than never,"" it said. Issa made the announcement despite the fact that Ansar Jerusalem, a jihadist group responsible for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, has claimed responsibility for the attack on a security forces headquarters. On Sunday, Ansar Jerusalem issued an online statement calling on army and police members to quit. ""With your staying in these institutions from evening to morning, you are incurring the anger of Allah,"" the statement said. But Issa said it was an ""ugly crime"" perpetrated by the Brotherhood. In addition to the 16 people killed in the early morning twin bombings, 130 people were wounded. More than 40 people remained hospitalized Wednesday. CNN first learned of the blasts from Twitter. U.S.: Concern over current political conditions . The United States issued a strong reaction to the news that the Muslim Brotherhood was labeled as terrorists. ""We think it is essential for Egypt to have an inclusive political process; it is the best means of restoring the stability that the Egyptian people want and that is necessary to the country's economic recovery,"" said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department. ""There needs to be dialogue and political participation across the political spectrum."" She repeated the United States' condemnation of the bombings, noting the Muslim Brotherhood denounced the bombing and Ansar Jerusalem, in Arabic called Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, had taken credit for the attack. She said the United States has designated Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis as a terrorist group. ""We are concerned about the current atmosphere and its potential effects on a democratic transition in Egypt,"" she said. Russia also condemned the bombings. ""Political differences, no matter how sharp they may be, should be resolved by peaceful means in the ways of a broad dialogue with the participation of leading political and social forces of the country,"" the Foreign Ministry said. State media; Egypt's Morsy faces trial for 2011 prison break . Upcoming vote on proposed constitution . Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July 2013, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Morsy faces charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule in December 2012. He has refused to recognize the court. The interim Egyptian government has cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood. The military and police have detained large numbers of Brotherhood officials and supporters since Morsy's ouster. Several hundred people have died in clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him. The blasts come in the lead-up to Egypt's referendum on a new constitution, which will be held January 14-15. The draft constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military. Morsy has endured a series of other legal troubles. He and 132 others will face trial for escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported Saturday. Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas, the Al-Ahram state newspaper reported. He is also charged with raiding other prisons, and killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, according to the newspaper. Morsy has been in custody since his ouster.","U.S. worries political process in Egypt is being negatively affected .

"(CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called President Bush ""a total failure"" on Thursday, among the California Democrat's harshest assessments to date of the president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says ""I disapprove of Congress' performance in terms of ending the war."" ""God bless him, bless his heart, president of the United States -- a total failure, losing all credibility with the American people on the economy, on the war, on energy, you name the subject,"" Pelosi told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview. The comments came two days after the president sharply criticized Congress over what he described as relative inaction over the course of the legislative term. At the White House on Wednesday, Bush noted that there were only 26 legislative days left in the fiscal year and said Congress would need to pass a spending bill every other day to ""get their fundamental job done."" ""This is not a record to be proud of, and I think the American people deserve better,"" Bush said.  Watch Pelosi respond to criticism of Congress from the president » . In the interview, Pelosi said the president was in no position to criticize Congress and brushed aside the criticisms as ""something to talk about because he has no ideas."" ""For him to be challenging Congress when we are trying to sweep up after his mess over and over and over again -- at the end of the day, Congress will have passed its responsibility to pass legislation,"" she said. iReport.com: Why isn't impeachment on the table? But Pelosi's comments come as a new Gallup poll registers the lowest level of congressional approval among Americans in the polling organization's 30-year history of conducting that survey. That poll showed that its approval rating had reached an anemic 14 percent, while more than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job Congress is doing. The House speaker said she doesn't consider those numbers a negative referendum on the Democrats in charge, saying she thinks they stem largely from Congress' failure to end the war in Iraq. ""Everything I see says this is about ending the war -- 'I disapprove of Congress' performance in terms of ending the war,' "" she said. ""In the House, we, of course, have over and over, five or six times, sent to the Senate legislation for a time certain to reduce our deployment in Iraq and bring our troops home safely, honorably and soon. We haven't been able to get it past the Senate or the president of the United States. iReport.com: Why haven't Democrats done more? ""So, on the basis of that, count me among the 70-some percent,"" she continued. ""But that is one measure. The other measure that I'm more interested in is the one that talks about what is their view of Democrats. And the generic, who do you prefer to run the country on all of these issues? We're in double digits in any poll that you can take."" Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant derided Pelosi's comments as ""the sort of partisan politics that Democrats once decried and promised to change."" ""Rather than personally critique others, Speaker Pelosi should reconsider her own out-of-touch stance against oil exploration,"" he said. ""With Americans paying record prices at the pump and Congress in gridlock, this is no time for the speaker to only offer personal attacks."" In the wide-ranging interview, the entirety of which will air Sunday on CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer,"" Pelosi also reiterated her longtime opposition to lifting a congressional ban on offshore drilling as well as opening up areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration. Bush and congressional Republicans have pushed for those two policy changes. Pelosi has long opposed drilling offshore, a popular policy position among Californians, many of whom fear its environmental consequences along the state's coastline. But a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that more than 73 percent of Americans polled approved of lifting the 1981 ban, and the move holds support among many in Pelosi's own party, whose constituents are growing increasingly angry over rising gas prices. Pelosi said the oil industry is not aggressively exploring large amounts of federal areas already leased to them and approved for drilling, including 33 million offshore acres and 68 million acres in the lower 48 states. She has sponsored legislation calling on oil companies to increase their production in those areas before they are allowed to go into the offshore areas currently banned. ""Thirty-three million acres offshore are allowed for leasing,"" she said. ""And we're saying to them, use it or lose it. You have the opportunity to drill there. When you have exhausted those remedies, then you can talk about something else."" She's also calling on the president to release 10 percent of the more than 700 million barrels of oil housed in the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Bush said Tuesday that he is against any release from the reserve, saying that stash is for emergencies only. He also disputed that it would have any effect on lowering gas prices. ""What we are saying is, Mr. President, free our oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Pelosi said. ""We're saying, let's take 10 percent of that, which has been paid for by the American taxpayer, and use that to put on the market so that we increase supply, reduce price."" ""And when the price comes down, we can buy back the oil at a lower price, put it in the SPR, use the spread for renewable energy resources."" The House speaker has faced heavy criticism from House Republican leader John Boehner, who is leading a congressional delegation to ANWR this weekend and has said Pelosi's action does not adequately address the problem. He's also said Pelosi is leading the moderate faction of her party ""off a cliff"" by refusing to allow a vote in the House on offshore drilling. ""Just because John Boehner, who is my friend, has my respect, says it doesn't make it so,"" she responded, reiterating that she will block any vote to allow lifting the ban.","House speaker says president losing all credibility with the American people .

"A prominent human rights activist whose 18-month house arrest in eastern China and dramatic escape attracted worldwide attention is in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a close friend said Saturday. ""When Chen Guangcheng first fled to Beijing, we had to keep moving him from place to place to ensure his safety -- and we agreed the U.S. Embassy is the only absolutely secure location in town,"" said Hu Jia, a fellow activist and one of the few people who've seen him since he arrived in the capital. ""I understand he's now in a 100% safe place and that place is the U.S. Embassy."" Quoting an anonymous source, Texas-based nonprofit group ChinaAid said Chen is ""under U.S. protection and high-level talks are currently under way between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding his status."" ""Because of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama administration must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law,"" said Bob Fu, the head of ChinaAid. A U.S. Embassy spokesman and Chinese officials declined to answer questions about Chen. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials on strategic and economic issues. The activist, who is blind, was driven to Beijing on Sunday after evading his guards in a tiny village in Shandong Province, according to He Peirong, a friend and fellow activist. Chen addressed Chinese premier Wen Jiabao in a video posted on YouTube on Friday, detailing ""cruel"" abuses he said he and his family suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home. ""They broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife,"" he said. ""They pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter, beating and kicking her for hours. They also similarly violently assaulted me."" Journalists and supporters were prevented from visiting Chen during his house arrest. One of those supporters is Hollywood actor Christian Bale, who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in December. After learning of Chen's escape, Bale urged China to free his family, who were also under house arrest but did not escape with him. ""While it gives hope that, for now, Chen Guangcheng is safe, his family is not,"" Bale said in an e-mail to CNN Saturday. ""As a world leader, China must now show its wisdom and compassion, and remind the world of its rich cultural history, by permanently freeing Chen Guangcheng and his family and never allowing thuggery and corruption to tarnish China's reputation again."" Chen, 40, is a self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family-planning officials. A local court sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison in 2006 on charges of damaging property and ""organizing a mob to disturb traffic"" in a protest, charges that his supporters called preposterous. Since his September 2010 release from prison, he had been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter. According to He, Chen's friend, Chen prepared for his escape for months by lying in bed for long periods so guards wouldn't be suspicious if they didn't see any activity from him for a long time. Fellow activist Hu said Chen scaled a high wall at night and hurt his leg after jumping off. ""He stumbled and fell hundreds of times, and crossed a muddy creek -- it took him hours to evade layers of security,"" Hu told CNN by phone. ""As a blind man, his other senses are heightened,"" he added. ""To him, night means nothing and darkness is protection."" Hu, himself released from prison last June after serving 3 1/2 years for ""inciting to subvert state power,"" has known Chen since 2001. His wife posted a photo online of the men's reunion at an undisclosed location, showing both sporting black jackets and wide grins. ""He called me 'brother, brother,' and gave me a big hug,"" Hu said. ""He has a lot more gray hair and is sick, but his spirits are high."" Chen's high-profile breakout appears to have angered the local officials who were holding him captive, with supporters saying at least four members of his family already detained. In the Friday video, the blind activist appealed to the Chinese premier to investigate his case and expressed concern about the welfare of his wife, mother and daughter. Their whereabouts were unknown Saturday. ""Although I'm free, my worries are only deepening,"" he said. ""They have been persecuting my family for a long time, and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge."" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay echoed those sentiments, saying in a statement released Friday that she is ""disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detained."" Noting she has raised concerns about Chen's case before, Pillay urged Chinese authorities ""to investigate the treatment of both him and his family, to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials."" Repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in Shandong went unanswered. The authorities' reaction also seems to have ensnared Chen's supporters, especially those suspected in helping him escape. After speaking to CNN, Hu was taken away by police for questioning, his wife posted on Twitter. Chen's friend He disappeared Friday, shortly after CNN interviewed her via Skype. The last message she sent out, said Fu of ChinaAid, was that state security agents had arrived at her home in the eastern city of Nanjing. ""I'm not concerned about my own safety,"" she said during the interview. ""I hope they'll arrest me, not my friends.""","A fellow activist says Chen is 'under U.S. protection' with talks under way on his status .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- At a prize ceremony honoring peace, Adán Cortés says violence and injustice sent him rushing toward the stage. In a matter of seconds, the 21-year-old Mexican student's face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of Malala Yousafzai at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway. ""Please Malala, Mexico,"" he repeated as he unfurled a Mexican flag on the stage at Oslo's City Hall, where the 17-year-old laureate was about to become the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious award. Oslo police have come under fire over the incident, with critics asking how someone who wasn't on the ceremony's guest list managed to slip through security checkpoints and make it to the front of the room, standing just steps away from Yousafzai and other dignitaries before security hauled him out of the auditorium. Speaking to CNN at an Oslo detention center on Sunday, Cortés said he knows it was a drastic move. But he felt like he had no choice and wanted only a few seconds to speak about Mexico's problems on a global stage. ""My motivation was to show solidarity with all the things that have happened in my country, ultimately, well, the 43 missing students, who are suspected to be dead and burned, that was my main motivation,"" he said. ""I am tired of so many injustices that we have lived in Mexico, for decades."" The students' case has sparked national outrage in Mexico and drawn global attention to the country's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug-related violence. Authorities have said the students from a rural teachers college were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor, then delivered to the drug gang to be executed. Mexico's attorney general says the students' remains were burned at a landfill, placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river. But so far, only one student's remains have been identified. Cortés said he was seeking asylum in Norway, but authorities there have informed him that he'll be sent back to Mexico on Monday, Cortés and his attorney said. Before learning that he was getting kicked out of Norway, he told CNN he was scared to return to his home country. ""I do not want to be one more student who disappears and who later turns up dead and the government later says that it was organized crime,"" he said. Cortés told CNN he went through a security checkpoint with invited guests at last week's ceremony, but no one asked him for identification or stopped him as he approached the stage. ""I was really nervous. I was saying, 'This is my moment and this is my opportunity to speak out for all the people who I have seen suffer in Mexico,' "" he said. Oslo police said Cortés had been fined 15,000 kroner ($2,040) for nuisance and for entering the City Hall illegally. Even critics who question the appropriateness of disrupting the Nobel ceremony would have done the same thing, he said, ""if they had a little bit of empathy toward what all the families of so many people who have been killed and disappeared in Mexico have felt, this desperation and this impotence to not have a way to express themselves and demand justice."" CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Oslo. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.","Mexican student Adán Cortés interrupted last week's Nobel Peace Prize ceremony .

"German sports apparel maker Adidas has withdrawn its plans to sell a controversial sneaker featuring affixed rubber shackles after the company generated significant criticism when advertising the shoe on its Facebook page. The high-top sneakers, dubbed the JS Roundhouse Mids, were expected to be released in August, according to the Adidas Originals Facebook page. ""Got a sneaker game so hot you lock your kicks to your ankles?"" a caption below a photo of the sneakers read. The June 14 post prompted plenty of criticism from around the Web, with many commenters saying they felt the shackle invoked the painful image of slavery. ""Wow obviously there was no one of color in the room when the marketing/product team ok'd this,"" said a commenter, identifying herself as MsRodwell on nicekicks.com. ""I literally froze up when I saw a new design from Adidas set to hit stores in August,"" Dr. Boyce Watkins said in a post for the website Your Black World. Though dismissing the criticism in a written statement by defending the sneaker's designer, Jeremy Scott, as having a ""quirky"" and ""lighthearted"" style, Adidas nonetheless said Monday that it planned to cancel the shoe's release. ""The design of the JS Roundhouse Mid is nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery,"" the statement said. ""We apologize if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace."" Scott, for his part, posted a tweet Tuesday saying, ""work has always been inspired by cartoons, toys & my childhood."" He attached a photo of a ""My Pet Monster"" -- a bright, plush character with its wrists shackled. One of Adidas' most high-profile condemnations came from the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ""The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive,"" he said in a statement Monday, before Adidas' decision to withdraw them from the marketplace. He said Tuesday that civil rights groups had contacted NBA Commissioner David Stern, asking him to intercede. Jackson said the groups could engage in a boycott in about 50 markets if the shoes went on the sale. The photo of the sneakers was still in the photo section of Adidas' Facebook page Tuesday morning.  And whether Adidas wanted it or not, the sneakers were still inspiring a spirited debate about race in the comment section of its Facebook page.

"A global travel alert issued Friday by the State Department warned al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks, a threat that prompted Sunday's closure of 21 embassies and consulates. The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as North Africa, said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified. ""The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long time,"" said a senior national security official in Yemen, where the government is ""on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come."" Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat, according to two U.S. officials. According to three sources, the United States has information that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula members are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. One of the sources said that such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. In particular, Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, which is one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar. Said one U.S. official: ""It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future."" Based on intelligence, U.S. officials said, there was particular concern about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday.  President Barack Obama -- who, amid regular updates on the situation, has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans -- praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House. Photos: Attacks on U.S. diplomatic sites . Still, it's unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly, and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed. The expected time of an attack also isn't known, with the U.S. travel alert noting the threat extends through the end of August. ""Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests,"" the alert states. ""U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."" New York Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called the information ""the most specific I've seen."" While the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula, he stressed  to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that""we can't rule anything out."" ""We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace,"" said King. 21 embassies, consulates ordered closed . The State Department made public Friday a list of 21 embassies and consulates that will close Sunday, which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected. The 17 affected U.S. embassies are in  Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt,  Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Yemen. The U.S. embassy in Israel will be closed as normal Sunday. See the whole list . Consulates in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also being shut down for the day. Embassies and consulates in the region typically close their doors or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays. The shutdowns could extend beyond Sunday, a senior State Department official said. Retired Gen. James Mattis -- who until earlier this year was head of U.S. Central Command, responsible for a 20-country area that includes the Middle East -- said the decision to close the embassies shows the reality of the threat and the wisdom of U.S. policymakers. U.S. embassies have been targeted before in places such as Yemen, Turkey and Tanzania, he pointed out. Moreover, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of the terrorist network's most active and most destructive branches. ""We have to remember that we're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women, children, diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets,"" Mattis told CNN on Friday. ""They are showing some proactive discretion here, making certain that we don't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them."" Questions, concerns after Benghazi . House leaders have been briefed on the situation, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided ""some understanding of the seriousness of the threat."" King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's decision to close its diplomatic missions. ""I give them credit,"" the Republican said of the Obama administration. ""I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here."" Such bipartisan agreement in Washington come at a time politicians are still pushing to seek answers regarding the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Since then, Republicans have been pressing President Barack Obama's administration for answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers. Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration's inquiry thus far has been ""simply unacceptable,"" according to a draft letter obtained by CNN. Earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden and senior State Department officials went to Congress to discuss embassy security. Biden also briefed congressional leadership, key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns, a source who attended the meeting said. Another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the Benghazi attack, given the political firestorm it created for the Obama administration. On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution.

"Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos died Wednesday when a small plane carrying him to a campaign stop crashed into a residential neighborhood, state media reported. All seven people aboard the the Cessna 560XL were killed when the aircraft crashed in the coastal city of Santos, Brazil, about 40 miles south of Sao Paulo, state-run Agencia Brasil reported. As the aircraft prepared to land, it swerved because of bad weather. The air traffic control tower immediately lost contact with the plane, Agencia Brasil said. One witness, a pilot trainee, said he heard a loud noise and saw the plane flying low before it crashed into a house and then the ground. It was pitched down at 70 degrees, and ""hit the ground like a rock,"" Matheus Giovannini said. Campos, 49, was a well known politician running in his first presidential election as a candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party. He was most recently the governor of Pernambuco state and was a federal lawmaker from 1998 to 2003. He was married and had five children. An adviser, photographer, two pilots, and two others from Campos' political team were also killed in the plane crash. A dozen people on the ground were injured when the plane crashed, Agencia Brasil reported. Messages of mourning appeared on Campos' campaign website hours after the crash. ""We lost Eduardo Campos when Brazil most needed his patriotism, his selflessness, his fearlessness and his competence,"" said Roberto Amaral, the party's first vice-president. ""It is not just Pernambuco and its people who lose their leader, not just the Brazilian Socialist Party that loses its leader. It is Brazil that loses a young and promising statesman."" Campos' death sent shock waves across the South American country's political landscape less than two months before the October 5 presidential vote, leaving supporters stunned and wondering who would replace him on the ballot. Campos was among the serious contenders in the election, steady in third place in the polls at about 8%, according to pollster Datafolha. The two leading candidates are incumbent President Dilma Rousseff and center-right candidate Aecio Neves. Eight other candidates are polling at 3% or lower. According to Agencia Brasil, Rousseff will suspend her campaign for three days. Neves said on his Twitter account that he would also  suspend his campaign activities. ""All of Brazil is in mourning. Today we lost a great Brazilian, Eduardo Campos. We lost a great friend,"" Rousseff said via Twitter. Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal, which runs the country's elections, announced that Campos' coalition had 10 days to nominate a new candidate. Campos' vice presidential running mate, Marina Silva, a former senator and environmental minister, is also a well known politician with a solid base of supporters. She ran for president in 2010 for the country's Green Party. The country's Air Force said Wednesday's plane crash was due to bad weather, but it is continuing to investigate the accident. The plane had departed from Santos Dumont airport in Rio de Janeiro en route to Guaruja airport in Sao Paulo state, Agencia Brasil reported. Its maintenance and inspection records were up to date, the state outlet said.","Messages of mourning appear on Eduardo Campos' campaign website .

"Last year's Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) show wasn't bad but the greatest natural light display in a decade is coming this December, according to NASA. Solar activity will hit the peak of an 11-year cycle at the end of the year -- and the more intense the solar flares, the more magnificent the aurora display. ""The vast majority of auroras occur in a band known as the Auroral Zone,"" says Alistair McLean, founder of a similarly named tour agency -- the Aurora Zone -- that specializes in Northern Lights trips. ""This band can expand when solar activity is high."" The best chance to see the Northern Lights will be somewhere between 66 to 69 degrees north -- a sliver of the world that includes northern Alaska and Canada and bits of Greenland, northern Scandinavia and northern Russia. Before venturing into any of these freezing wildernesses, it's worth checking out the kp index, a measure of electromagnetic activity in the atmosphere. A reading of two or higher is considered good for Northern Lights spotting. You can also head south, for the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights), lighting up from around March 2014 onwards. Here are some of the places the auroras will be showing up. Jokulsarlon, Iceland . Best spot: By the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon. ""You can see the Aurora everywhere in Iceland,"" says Moyan Brenn, who's spent the past year photographing the Northern Lights. ""You just need to stay within the boundaries of the Arctic circle, find a clear sky and check for electromagnetic activity on the kp index."" For him, the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon, on the southeast coast of Iceland about 250 kilometers from Reykjavik, makes for a perfect shot. The iceberg-filled lagoon reflects the lights, making the experience all the more awesome. On a boat tour of the lagoon ($31 per person) you can concentrate on looking upwards and marveling. Brenn recommends checking the weather forecast before setting off. Rain or snow -- both common in Iceland -- tend to dampen the experience. Fairbanks, Alaska, United States . Best spot: In a hot spring. Two major challenges when hunting the Northern Lights are the cold and fatigue. Watching them in a hot spring asolleviates both. The city of Fairbanks, in Alaska, is often cited as the best place to see the Northern Lights in the United States. It's home to the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, which issues forecasts on  Aurora viewing conditions. If you fancy soaking while you watch, Geophysical Institute researchers recommend Chena Resort and Manley Springs. Chena is better equipped and better connected with Fairbanks's airport. The resort also provides an aurora alarm service, alerting guests if the lights ""switch on"" in the middle of night. Chena Resort, Chena Hot Springs Road, Fairbanks; +1 907 451 8104; rooms from $189 per night; return bus tickets from the airport to the resort cost $150. The resort in the tiny village of Manley Hot Springs went bust but you can watch the lights for a small fee from spring-fed hot tubs provided by a local couple. More information from the Fairbanks-Alaska.com website. More: CNNGo in Reykjavik -- Thermal pools and comfy sweaters . Paatsjoki, Finnish Lapland . Best spot: From the Paatsjoki Bridge, Nellim, near the Finnish-Russian border. ""Paatsjoki Bridge provides unparalleled Aurora sightings,"" says McLean. ""The chances of success here are at least 90%,"" writes Markku Inkila, an Aurora photographer and guide, on the Aurora Zone blog. Aurora Zone's four-night  Nellim Aurora Quest tour runs from December to the end of March; from $2,700 for two people. Muonio and Kilpisjarvi, Finnish Lapland . Best spot: A cabin in the Lapland wilderness. Aurora viewing is so good around these two Finnish towns that one of the best aurora photographers and guides in the world -- by McLean's estimation -- Antti Pietikainen, is based here. Aurora Zone runs a trip between the two towns, following the lights. Adventurous options on the tour include a snowmobile safari to the shared border of Sweden, Finland and Norway, husky-sledding with a stay in a cabin in the wilderness, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing. ""Sometimes, the dogs start howling when the aurora appears here,"" Mclean says. ""It's so primeval, it sends shivers down your spine."" The seven-night Muonio to Kilpisjarvi tour is available in 2014 from Feb 23, March 2 and March 23; prices from $3,540 for two people. For families, McLean suggests tours around the reindeer-herding village of  Menesjarvi and the ski resort of Luosto, both run by the company Activities Abroad. More: Not just for Christmas -- 10 reasons to hit Finnish Lapland . Kangerlussuaq, Greenland . Best spot:  On a dog-sledding expedition. With the only international airport in Greenland, Kangerlussuaq is the gateway to the rest of the country. With an average 300 clear-sky days per year, it's also another top location for aurora hunters. World of Greenland -- Arctic Circle (Wogac) offers short Northern Lights tours from October to April, but from February to April it also has a three-day dog-sledding expedition to the west coast town of Sisimiut. Hotel Kangerlussuaq (rooms from $290), at the airport, is a convenient place to stay. Keep your curtains open and you may even see the Northern Lights from your room. The hotel also organizes an ice cap tour nearby. Wogac's short Northern Lights tour costs $65 per person, the dog-sledding expedition $1,445. Yellowknife, Canada . Best spot: On a heated viewing chair. Not only do you have a great chance of seeing the Northern Lights around the city of Yellowknife, but the surroundings -- and seating -- are especially congenial. A 25-minute drive from the city center, Aurora Village is a teepee campground where you lounge in specially designed, heated viewing chairs, with guides offering background in various languages on the lights. You'll need your warm seat -- it can hit 40 C below zero here. Aurora Village also has daytime activities such as dogsled riding and snowmobiling. Follow the village's activities on Twitter or visit astronomynorth.com for Aurora updates. More: 27  sights that remind you how incredible Earth is . Tromsø, Norway . Best spot: On the deck of a traditional steamer ship. Sometimes called the ""Paris of the North,"" the city of Tromsø is a beautiful and accessible location for catching the Northern Lights. The Norwegian tourism board recommends a voyage on the Norwegian Coastal Steamer Hurtigruten to see the lights along a fjord. An Astronomy Voyage runs from September to March, following the Aurora Borealis, with astronomy lectures on board. The trip also includes a visit to the Northern Lights Planetarium, in Tromsø. Another option is the village of Ersfjorden, 40 minutes from Tromsø, in the countryside between towering snow mountains and a fjord. A bus service between Tromsø and Ersfjorden runs until midnight. Or you could join a Northern Lights chase with knowledgeable bus drivers. The Astronomy Voyage costs from $1,900 per person. More information about  Northern Lights viewing can be found on Tromsø's official site. Abisko, Sweden . Best spot: While tucking into a four-course Swedish dinner. Cloud cover -- the aurora hunter's arch enemy -- shouldn't trouble you around the village of Abisko, in northern Sweden. ""Mountains and favorable prevailing winds combine to create some of northern Scandinavia's most cloud-free skies,"" McLean says. Aurora Zone's tour there includes a night's stay at an Ice Hotel. Travelers can also spend a night at the Aurora Sky Station, arriving by chair-lift and having a four-course dinner before stepping out to view the Aurora. The Abisko Aurora and IceHotel four-night tour, running from December to March, costs $2,811 for two people. A night visit to Aurora Sky Station costs $95 or from $260 including dinner. Gallery: How to build a Swedish ice hotel . Southern hemisphere . Best spot: At the end of a continent. Antarctica's the best spot to view the Aurora Australis -- the Southern Lights -- but it's also the most inaccessible, unless you're a scientist or a supporting person (cook, doctor, pilot, etc) on a research expedition. However, you can still see the lights from the southern tips of South America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. New Zealand's Stewart Island (""Rakiura"" in Maori, meaning the land of glowing skies) is a good option. It has only 400 inhabitants and is covered with great wildlife and natural scenery.

"President Barack Obama appeared to have his most promising window yet in the coming months to keep his promise to close the military-run prison at Guantanamo Bay. Then he made the Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl swap. The trade of five Taliban members at Guantanamo to free Bergdahl, the last remaining American captive in the Afghanistan war, ignored congressional restrictions President Barack Obama signed in the annual defense policy law that require him to notify Congress 30 days before transferring prisoners. In the weeks before, administration officials and Democratic aides working on the closure issue were optimistic that they could find a way to remove the most difficult congressional restrictions when a new law is approved later this year. Hints at that optimism showed up in Obama's recent speeches, where he has mentioned his hopes to close the prison housing terror detainees after long largely avoiding the issue. House and Senate versions of the upcoming defense authorization law still contain hurdles. The Senate version would allow transfers of Guantanamo prisoners to the United States on the condition that the administration first submits a closure plan and Congress has a chance to disapprove. Sen. Carl Levin, the Armed Services Committee chairman, who for years was cautious about Obama's closure plans, has warmed to the idea that shutting the prison can be done safely if the administration has laid out a plan. To that end, the Justice Department in recent weeks issued a legal opinion saying that Guantanamo detainees transferred to the United States for trial or indefinite detention under the laws of war don't have rights under immigration law to be released on U.S. soil. The House version of the bill still blocks transfers. The White House has also issued a veto threat if the restrictions survive the period of legislative negotiation that produces a final law. Administration officials note that Obama attached a notice when he signed the current defense policy law calling the restrictions unconstitutional and reserving the right to bypass the notification requirement if there was a national security interest. The administration has said the exchange that led to Bergdahl's freedom was expedited due to fears his life was in jeopardy, though the administration had notified Congress that an exchange was a possibility. Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was angered by the Bergdahl swap and appears to have stiffened his opposition. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, McKeon said despite Obama's plan to close Guantanamo, ""Congress has passed a law and he has signed a law that he will not close Guantanamo. Whatever his desires are, that does not conform to the law and he is the chief administrator of the law of the nation and should uphold his constitutional obligation to follow the law."" A senior administration official told CNN that Obama knew his decision to secure Bergdahl's release through a prisoner exchange would generate debate and would spark a discussion about both winding down the war in Afghanistan and closing the prison at Guantanamo. ""With respect to the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the President has said repeatedly -- in last year's speech at (National Defense University), in this year's State of the Union, and in last week's speech at West Point -- that he believes the continued operation of the detention facility harms our national security,"" Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. ""Our policy on Guantanamo Bay is the same now as it was prior to Sergeant Bergdahl's recovery -- the United States will repatriate, resettle, or prosecute detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the greatest extent possible, consistent with U.S. national security interests and our humane treatment policy,"" she said. The Bergdahl exchange muddled the administration's claim of laying the blame on Congress for blocking the Guantanamo closure. Obama demonstrated that he believes he is justified in releasing prisoners without congressional approval. Administration officials have said Obama prefers to work with Congress to carry out the closure. Some Democrats also have expressed qualms about Obama's handling of the Bergdahl swap. Sen. Diane Feinstein said she would like Obama to brief the Intelligence Committee. Levin said he plans to question administration officials about what impact the 30-day notification would have had on the prisoner exchange. Still, he said the administration satisfied the law. ""We received a detailed classified notification from the secretary of defense that satisfies the many substantive certification requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014,"" Levin said in a statement Tuesday. Levin said later that the classified notification came two days after Bergdahl's release, but Congress had been given due notice last December that the President may choose to not follow the requirements set out by Congress. ""The President put Congress on notice on December 23, 2013, that he intended to exercise his powers as commander in chief, if necessary, 'to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers.' While the President cannot change the law with a signing statement, given that notice, members of Congress should not be surprised that he acted as he did in the circumstances that existed.""","President Obama appeared to be on track to keeping a major campaign promise .

"(CNN)President Barack Obama will address the country Wednesday to explain to the nation ""what our game plan is going forward"" in the fight against ISIS. In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Obama expressed confidence that the United States, with help from regional partners, will be able to wipe out the terror organization. ""I just want the American people to understand the nature of the threat and how we're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we'll be able to deal with it,"" the President told interviewer Chuck Todd. He said action will include military, diplomatic and economic components. He laid out a three-stage plan that starts with actions the U.S. has already taken: gathering increased intelligence on ISIS, and using airstrikes to protect American personnel, critical Iraqi infrastructure like the Mosul Dam, and cities such as Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. U.S. airstrikes target ISIS fighters near 2nd-largest dam in Iraq . ""The next phase is now to start going on some offense,"" he said. ""We have to get an Iraqi government in place, and I'm optimistic that next week we should be able to get that done."" He said his speech won't announce the involvement of U.S. ground troops. ""We're not looking at sending 100,000 American troops,"" he vowed. The President gave his most direct and detailed assessment of ISIS since the terrorist group has brutally decapitated two American journalists and killed thousands of Iraqis. It is a vastly different message than he gave nearly two weeks ago, when he said the U.S. didn't have a strategy ""yet"" to deal with ISIS in Syria, and in January, when he called it and other groups the JV team. ""Well, they're not a JV team,"" Obama said in Sunday's ""Meet the Press"" interview. The President received praise from recent critics who had said he was too timid as the scope, depth and capabilities of ISIS continue to grow. ""I want to congratulate the President. He is now on offense,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's overdue, but the President is now there,"" the California Democrat added. Her counterpart in the House, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed Feinstein's sentiment, also on CNN. ""This is the toughest talk that we have heard from the President, and I agree with Sen. Feinstein -- that's a good thing because they are a threat."" But not everyone applauded. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and has criticized Obama for not acting quickly or strongly enough, said, ""American foreign policy is in the hands of someone who does not know what he's doing."" ""I believe this president has committed a presidential malpractice in his foreign policy,"" Rubio added on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Congressional 'buy-in' Congress returns to Washington this week from a five-week break and will immediately face questions about ISIS. Obama said he will meet with members of Congress on Tuesday to discuss the administration's strategy, let lawmakers ""have buy-in"" and debate the plan. But asked by Todd if he was seeking congressional authorization of his strategy, Obama appeared to say no. ""I'm confident that I've got the authorization that I need to protect the American people,"" he said. But Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who is also considering a 2016 presidential run, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that any additional military action ""should absolutely take congressional approval."" His colleagues in the House, however, didn't agree, saying the President has the constitutional authority to act without Congressional authorization. The top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said, ""I believe as commander in chief he has the absolute power to carry out these attacks."" Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington agreed, saying the President doesn't need authorization but that ""it would be better if Congress would authorize it."" He added, however, that it would be ""extraordinarily difficult"" to get through the partisan body, especially less than two months before an election. Syria . While the U.S. plan to help Iraqi and Kurdish troops take back areas under ISIS control is key to defeating the militants, Obama said the strategy will also have economic and political prongs. His plan will involve working to ""attract back Sunni tribes that may have felt that they had no connection to a Baghdad government that was ignoring their grievances."" As for the military, he insisted U.S. troops will not take the lead. ""We don't have the resources"" to ""occupy"" numerous countries, he said, so a more ""sustainable strategy ... means the boots on the ground have to be Iraqi."" But what's unclear still is if he will authorize airstrikes in Syria. ISIS gained power and strength there trying to defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's complex civil war, and foreign policy hawks have been pushing for the U.S. to strike ISIS command centers and weapons stockpiles. Obama didn't indicate in the interview aired Sunday whether he was going to move forward with airstrikes but said the U.S. will ""need to put more resources"" into vetted groups that oppose both al-Assad and ISIS in Syria. ""We're going to have to develop a moderate Sunni opposition that can control territory and that we can work with,"" he said, insisting there will be no U.S. troops on the ground.  ""The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground, I think, would be a profound mistake. And I want to be very clear and very explicit about that."" ""The boots on the ground have to be Syrian,"" he added. The U.S. has no plans to move forward alone. After a NATO summit in Wales last week, the President announced the support of nine countries that are committed to pushing back against ISIS. He said his next effort will be to obtain the support of allies in the region. Secretary of State John Kerry is going to spend the upcoming week attempting to gain support from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, the President said. As strategy firms up, U.S. courts partners to target ISIS . Threat to the U.S. The President maintains that the terror group, which gained power in war-torn Syria and expanded into Iraq, is not an immediate threat to the U.S. But he noted that ""over time"" it could become a ""serious threat to the homeland"" if it is able to continue to expand territory under its control while amassing arms and fighters, especially Western fighters. Wednesday's speech, which will come a day before the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks, will help the American public better grasp the administration's plan, he said. ""What I want people to understand is that over the course of months, we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of (ISIS), we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities, we're going to shrink the territory that they control and ultimately, we're going to defeat them,"" Obama said.

"Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Michael Brown before Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown in August, told remarkably similar stories in an interview with county and federal authorities in August and in testimony to the grand jury in September. The first interview, conducted by an FBI agent and a St. Louis County crimes-against-persons detective, was part of a Friday document dump by the prosecutor who presented the case to the grand jury. Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch initially released grand jury documents in late November, but didn't include Johnson's August interview. That was a mistake, he said in a letter accompanying Friday's documents. ""It was brought to my attention that I omitted the FBI interview of Dorian Johnson. Upon review of the files, I discovered that I had inadvertently omitted a number of witness interviews and a few other documents which had been presented to the grand jury,"" he wrote. ""It should be noted that the sworn testimony of these witnesses, including Johnson, was released on November 24, 2014."" One challenge for Ferguson grand jury: Some witnesses' credibility . The prosecutor apologized for any confusion and said he now believes he has released all evidence presented to the grand jury that declined to indict Wilson last month. If he finds anything else he unintentionally omitted, he will release it promptly after it's discovered, he said. That doesn't include autopsy photographs, photographs of Brown at the scene and any material that might identify any of the witnesses. According to an examination of the transcripts of Johnson's two accounts -- delivered 28 days apart -- Brown's friend had roughly the same recollection of what he saw on the afternoon of August 9. He was consistent on many of the broader points: . • The two went to the store to buy cigarillos so they could smoke marijuana. At the store, Brown nonchalantly stole several cigarillos and left the store. • Johnson was worried about the police after the theft, but Brown didn't seem fazed, even when Wilson pulled up to them several blocks from the store and told them to ""get the f*** on the sidewalk."" Wilson pulled off but quickly reversed and tried to exit his car, but  the car door bounced off of Brown and Johnson. • Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck, and the two engaged in a sort of tug of war before Wilson twice threatened to shoot and fired, hitting Brown, before finishing the second threat. Brown and Johnson took off running and Wilson didn't immediately pursue them. • Johnson hid by a vehicle as Wilson exited his vehicle, pursued Brown and fired once, prompting Brown to turn around with his hands up in surrender. Wilson then fired a volley of shots. Brown hit the ground. The discrepancies in Johnson's stories were minor and perhaps a product of the questions he was asked. For instance, in one account, he said he and Brown had spoken to construction workers about getting high on marijuana. In another account, he said a construction worker told him and Brown that he smoked only ""wax,"" a form of hashish. Another example is Johnson's assertion to the grand jury that before he and Brown went to the store for cigarillos, he originally intended to purchase them from someone living in the apartment complex. There is no mention of this in the account Johnson provided the FBI and county detective. His recollection of what Brown said to Wilson about being unarmed differs slightly as well. Johnson at first said Brown told Wilson he wasn't armed as they tussled at the car and again before the fatal volley of shots. In his account to the grand jury, he said Brown said it only after being shot. Johnson may have changed one aspect of his story after his interviewers pointed out he was relaying an assumption rather than an actual eyewitness account. While speaking to the FBI and county, Johnson said Wilson definitely shot Brown in the back as he fled. ""As he's runnin' passed the third car, the officer behind him pointed his weapon with his weapon drawn and he fired a second that did strike my friend Big Mike in his back 'cause that's when he stopped runnin',"" he said. Later in the interview, he reiterated this claim, saying, ""That's why I know he was hit because he stopped runnin'."" And on a third occasion, he told the interviewers, ""It definitely struck him in his back. I don't know verbatim where at."" When the interviewers press Johnson -- did he actually see Wilson shoot Brown in the back, or was he just speculating based on what he saw? -- Johnson conceded, ""OK, so for the purposes, no. I did not see a hole in his shirt rip while I'm in shock."" About a month later, before the grand jury, Johnson made it clear he saw Wilson fire at Brown as he fled, but he wasn't sure if the bullet hit his friend. ""The second time he shot, I didn't know if it hit him or not, but he kind of jerked and that's when he stopped running. He just kind of stopped and turned around at the officer,"" Johnson said. Portions of Johnson's account are not supported by other witness statements, and there are myriad inconsistencies in the witness testimony. Wilson's statement also doesn't jibe with Johnson's. Among the discrepancies: Wilson and some witnesses said Brown attacked the officer, prompting Wilson to fire twice from his police vehicle; Wilson and some witnesses said Brown fled at first but then charged him; and witnesses varied on whether Brown had his hands up when the fatal shots were fired.","In interviews 28 days apart, Johnson told similar stories about Michael Brown's death .

Many inconsistencies minor, possibly the result of different questions .

"Water tests after a chemical spill in West Virginia are encouraging, the governor said, but it's unclear when people might be able to use their taps again. About 300,000 residents in nine counties in the southwest section of the state can't use tap water. ""Our team has been diligent in testing samples from throughout the affected area. The numbers look good and, like last night, they are very encouraging. I believe that we're at a point where we can say that we see light at the end of the tunnel,"" West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin told reporters Sunday. Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water -- a company affected by the spill -- said that officials will begin lifting the water bans by zone. Certain areas will be prioritized, including downtown Charleston, but decisions will also depend on test results. He declined to put a timeline on when the do-not-use orders will be lifted. ""I don't believe we're several days from starting to lift, but I'm not saying today,"" McIntyre said. Officials have warned water customers to watch for symptoms of exposure to the chemical, which is used to clean coal, such as skin irritation, nausea, vomiting or wheezing. Karen Bowling, secretary of the state's Department of Health and Human Resources, said Sunday that more than 1,000 people had called the West Virginia Poison Center, concerned about their exposure to contaminated water. There have also been more than 60 animal exposures reported. A total of 10 people have been admitted to three hospitals, none in serious or critical condition, and 169 patients have been treated and released from emergency rooms, Bowling said. Water restrictions were imposed Thursday after it was discovered that about 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal --  4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- had leaked out of a storage tank a mile upriver from the West Virginia American Water plant. Residents were told to use bottled water to wash hands, brush teeth or take showers. The federal Department of Homeland Security sent 16 tractor-trailer loads of bottled water to help and the water company also provided truckloads. The medical impact was hard to assess. ""We've had a lot of worried-well calls,"" Dr. Rahul Gupta of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department said over the weekend. He cited complaints of irritation of the skin, throat, chest and stomach that some residents have linked to possible exposure. The unknowns made residents anxious. ""They don't even know what the health risks are,"" Stacy Kirk of Culloden told CNN affiliate WSAZ. ""We had bathed, cooked and everything right before the news came on yesterday."" ""I don't know anything about the chemical to say too much good or bad about it, so we're all up in the air,"" said Arthur Taylor. ""We're common folks -- we're not chemists."" No quick fix for water woes . Anxiety about effects of chemical . Water company spokeswoman Laura Jordan urged people to get medical attention ""if they are feeling something ... isn't right."" Many did just that. ""Our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms,"" said the Charleston Area Medical Center. Dr. Robert Maha, chief medical officer for MedExpress, a group of seven medical clinics in the area, said many patients sought treatment for symptoms they worried were tied to the chemical exposure. He said the water crisis may contribute to the spread of flu because people are having a difficult time finding clean water to wash their hands. ""That's one of our biggest concerns for the community,"" Maha said. The goal: Less than 1 part per million . Officials will know that the water is safe for more than firefighting and toilet flushing -- its only sanctioned uses now -- when tests find less than 1 part per million of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in treated water, said McIntyre, with West Virginia American Water. Four laboratories have been set up to measure the levels in a uniform manner. ""The treatment plant must consistently produce samples at or below this level before the current do-not-use order is lifted,"" he said. West Virginia National Guard  Maj. Gen. James Hoyer said Sunday that sampling and testing at the water treatment facility showed a consistent number of below 1 part per million for 24 hours at the outflow of the facility. ""This allows us to move forward to the next phase of sampling and testing throughout the system,"" he said. Though the water woes since Thursday have led scores of businesses to close, Gupta said that some restaurants were reopening after devising alternative plans. The problem affected people of all ages. ""I'm here to get some water for the baby because she has to make formula,"" Deborah Williams, who was caring for a granddaughter in Culloden, told WSAZ. ""Right now, we're in desperate need of washing baby bottles and filling them up."" 7,500 gallons leaked . The chemical overflowed a containment area around the tank run by Freedom Industries, which supplies products for the coal-mining industry. It migrated over land and through the soil into the river. The leak happened about a mile upriver from the West Virginia American Water plant. Mike Dorsey, chief of the Department of Environmental Protection's Homeland Security and Emergency Response group, said officials estimate that 7,500 gallons -- the equivalent of about 10 hot tubs that can accommodate eight people each -- leaked through a 1-inch hole in the tank's stainless steel wall. ""It's an old system,"" he said about the physical plant, adding that the company had planned to upgrade it. C.W. Sigman, the deputy emergency manager for Kanawha County, said the tank appeared to be ""antique."" ""When I see a riveted tank I know it's an old tank,"" he said. Dorsey expressed confidence that the chemical, which smells like licorice, did not start leaking long before Thursday morning, when it was reported. ""We would have gotten odor complaints earlier than that if it had been going on longer,"" he said. After concluding late Thursday afternoon that the tap water was contaminated, officials issued a stop-use warning to customers in Boone, Cabell, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam and Roane counties. Since then, the offending material has been hauled from the site, officials said. Some residents have directed their anger at Freedom Industries, the coal industry company from whose storage tank the chemical leaked. ""It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,"" said Danny Jones, the mayor of Charleston, the state's capital and most populated city. ""It's a prison from which we would like to be released."" Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper told CNN on Saturday that more than 100,000 customers were affected, bringing the number of people affected to about 300,000. ""It was scary because I went to brush my teeth this morning, and I went to turn the water on, and it was like, you can't turn your water on yet,"" Evelyn Smith of Rand said. ""You have to change your mindset of how you do things right now."" An investigative team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board on Saturday deployed to the scene of the spill. The CSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern said two Freedom employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. They contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some from the nearby ground, he said. ""We have mitigated the risk, we believe, in terms of further material leaving this facility,"" he said. But Sigman, the emergency management official, said it didn't appear the company was in emergency mode when his team began to arrive Thursday. ""They didn't appear to understand the magnitude of the incident at the time, and we didn't either because we just got there,"" he said, adding that investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency had also arrived and took the lead in the investigation. ""It took a little bit of time to get a determination how serious it was,"" he continued. ""I never got a good indication from the plant folks how bad the leak was, how much was going to the river, anything else. It was probably a little ways into the incident before we realized how bad it was getting into the river.""","Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin says he can see light at the end of the tunnel .

"The Federal Aviation Administration took the initial steps Thursday toward introducing privately operated unmanned aircraft into the heavily populated U.S. skies, issuing two documents it hopes will pave the way for manned and unmanned aircraft to co-exist. One of the documents outlines the many steps federal agencies must take; the second is a road map for the FAA itself. Currently, the FAA approves of the use of unmanned aircraft on a case-by-case basis. They are largely limited to military airspace and the U.S. borders, along with use in special circumstances, such as reconnaissance over forest fires. Delivering textbooks using drones . But there is a big and growing demand to use remotely piloted vehicles for private and commercial purposes. The documents released Thursday set forth a process to increase access to airspace in the next five to 10 years, the FAA said. Report: Former drone operator shares his inner torment . The mission is complicated, requiring the mixing of manned aircraft, which operate under see-and-avoid rules, with remotely piloted aircraft, which operate under sense-and-avoid rules. And the new rules must address everything from small aircraft used by hobbyists to large Predator-type drones currently used by the military. ""Government and industry face significant challenges as unmanned aircraft move into the aviation mainstream,""     Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a prepared statement. The road map ""is an important step forward that will help stakeholders understand the operational goals and safety issues we need to consider when planning for the future of our airspace."" Your personal $849 underwater 'drone' The FAA said its road map stresses that the unmanned aircraft community must understand the system is not static, and that many improvements are planned for the airspace system over the next 15 years.

"Two men have been charged in the Albany, New York, area in a bizarre plan to use a device loosely described as a ray gun to ""target people they didn't like,"" a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Wednesday. Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, and Eric J. Feight, 54, were arrested Tuesday after an undercover operation by the Albany FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. They were charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. The suspects intended to use the device to harm and kill enemies of Israel, a Department of Justice news release said. If convicted, each faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and five years of supervised release. The suspects, expected to appear in federal court Wednesday, apparently planned to use the homemade X-ray machine to attack high-ranking government officials and other targets with radiation, the source said. They do not appear to belong to any terror group or subscribe to any particular ideology, the source said. The public was never in any danger, the source said. The device created by the defendants was deemed inoperable and not a threat to the public. Beginning in April 2012, authorities received information that Crawford was searching for people at local Jewish organizations to help him build a device capable of killing human targets silently from a distance, according to a criminal complaint. ""This investigation revealed unthinkable plotting and planning of terrorist activity that targeted unsuspecting innocent citizens,"" New York State Police Superintendent Joseph A.

"The 50-foot Christmas tree decorating downtown Reading, Pennsylvania, was supposed to spread holiday cheer, but instead it made some residents unhappy. ""It looks sad,"" City Council President Francis Acosta told CNN affiliate WFMZ last week. ""Everybody's calling it a Charlie Brown tree."" A group called Christmas for Downtown Reading raised $1,000 from business and community donations toward purchasing a replacement tree, but a last minute change of heart means the original tree that was denigrated far and wide on the Web will stay in place. Acosta had earlier vowed to replace the tree that observers called ""pathetic,"" ""ugly"" and an ""embarrassment."" The puny Norwood spruce had already lost many of its branches, even though it's not yet December, and it was sparsely decorated with a simple string of lights. ""If there was a squirrel looking for a place to live in the winter, it wouldn't even go into the tree,"" remarked one passerby. City workers arrived Monday to remove the lights and prepare the old tree for transport to City Park to make room for a newer, better tree. But Acosta granted the tree a last-minute reprieve, according to WFMZ, saying he now wants to leave the tree that has gained so much notoriety in place as a draw for visitors to the downtown area. ""We will keep this thing here and we will call it the 'ugly tree' that everyone and national television is calling it, and we're going to see it as an opportunity to bring people to downtown Reading,"" said Acosta. He told WFMZ that letting the old tree stay put would free up municipal workers to prepare the city for a coming snowstorm. Acosta is soliciting more donations to help decorate the tree better. The new tree is still being delivered and will be on display elsewhere in the city, say officials. The debate over whether to replace the tree is annoying some residents even more than the ""ugly"" tree did. ""It's frustrating that they can't make a decision on their own and go with it,"" Reading resident Zachary Lee told the local news station. ""We can't afford to just be sending these [public works] guys here. There's a lot of other stuff these guys need to be doing, and we want to complain about this tree when there's other parts of the city that are nowhere near as pretty as this tree, that people don't find any beauty in.""","UPDATE: Reading, Pennsylvania, will keep the Christmas tree some called ""ugly"" downtown .

"What is it about Americans and guns? How much time do you have? ""I can tell you that I don't think there's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said after the shooting rampage at a Colorado theater in July killed 12 people. Now, a school shooting in Connecticut  claims 20 young children and six adults, possibly more once the full story is known. In between, there have been other shootings including at a shopping mall earlier in the week in Oregon. Opinion: Now is the time to talk guns, mental illness . There are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the United States, making Americans the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. Yemen, a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law, comes in a distant second. From Washington to the well-stocked shelves of Walmart stores nationwide, guns are regarded in the United States as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law-abiding hunters, collectors and citizens concerned about their safety. They are also in the hands of thousands of killers, too; a Washington-based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides, suicides and accidental deaths are tallied. Read more: Obama treads carefully on gun ban . America's collective memory -- of the Wild West in the 1800s, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King half a century ago and rampages like Columbine in 1999 or Virginia Tech in 2007 -- is marked time and time again by guns. ""It's undeniable,"" writes Clayton Cramer, author of ""Armed America: the Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie."" ""Guns are at the center of much of America's history, its legends, and its horrors."" There were guns in America long before the America we know today was even born. Early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense. By the time the United States was established, its citizens had taken up arms not only against their Native American neighbors but the army of their own king. Their new Constitution reflected that in its Bill of Rights, declaring that ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" Opinion: Mourn, and take action on guns . For more than two centuries, that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee, subjected to a modest series of controls. But in 2008 and 2010, landmark Supreme Court rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power, dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership. Gun-friendly state lawmakers have been active, too. Roughly half of the 50 U.S. states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places. About as many states have ""stand your ground"" laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat, even, in some cases, if they can escape the threat without violence. The laws are being driven by politics, and the politics are being driven by groups such as the National Rifle Association. Once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters, it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country. The Washington Post estimates that the NRA succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the 2010 congressional election. In addition to that extraordinary impact in Congress, it has been working to overturn gun-control laws in the courts. Timeline: School violence in the U.S. The NRA and other gun-rights groups have allied themselves with the Republican Party and, especially, a sector of the American public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to Washington. ""When they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer, don't you believe it, not for a second, because it's a lie just like the lies they've told you before,"" NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told a gathering of his members in 2011, after a gunman killed six people and wounded 13, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. ""Their laws don't work."" Poll results suggest most Americans wouldn't agree. CNN and Gallup surveys going back years suggest that Americans are split between those who approve of current gun-control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive. Americans who'd like no controls at all are a small minority. Last year's nearly fatal shooting of Giffords didn't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures. America is by no means unique to this type of gun crime. But America seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence.

"What was supposed to be a celebratory lesson in American history has sent three children to the hospital. They were a part of a Civil War re-enactment group watching a parade in Orem, Utah, when a cannon set off an explosion Saturday. Witnesses said two of the three children injured were initially engulfed in flames, according to CNN affiliate KUTV. ""When the flames went up in the air these three children started crying. One little girl's clothes were on fire, we're told,"" witness Brittany Tait told KUTV. ""People were running with water to douse her."" The blast happened at the start of the parade, the city's Department of Public Safety said. The cannon was fired, and a spark landed on a pouch containing additional charges for the cannon. The smoldering ember set off the contents of the pouch, blowing it up and injuring all three children, the press release explained. The extent of the children's injuries was not immediately known Sunday, but authorities said they were in stable condition when they were transported to a nearby hospital.","An explosion at a Civil War re-enactment sends three children to the hospital .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Hundreds of people gathered outside Arizona's Capitol building on Sunday in a largely peaceful protest against the state's tough new immigration law. Chanting ""Yes we can,"" waving American flags and holding signs reading ""We have rights"" and ""We are human,"" demonstrators kept up a festive spirit as they denounced the bill signed Friday by Gov. Jan Brewer. The new law requires police to determine whether a person is in the United States legally. It also requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. Protesters worry that the law will foster racial profiling. ""What is 'reasonable suspicion?' "" protester Jose Acosta asked Sunday. ""Are we going to get pulled over just because of a broken taillight or because of the color of our skin? ... If so, is everybody going to be pulled over?"" Kearny Police Chief Joe Martinez called critics' concerns unfounded, saying the Arizona law enforcement community includes a large number of Hispanics. ""We've never had a policy of racial profiling,"" Martinez said Saturday night at a town hall meeting in Casa Grande. ""In fact, quite the contrary, it's been outlawed."" Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon appeared at the rally in support of the protest, calling the law unconstitutional and ""just plain wrong."" ""America is a country that is compassionate and that welcomes everyone,"" he said. ""This is not what this country and this state was founded upon."" Gordon vowed to take the fight through the state's judicial system. ""We'll go to the state courts and we'll go to the federal courts and we'll go all the way to the Supreme Court,"" he told the cheering crowd. ""I promise you."" Gordon told CNN on Saturday that he will bring up an item calling for legal action against the law at Tuesday's City Council session. Others were also vowing this weekend to legally challenge the law. The Rev. Al Sharpton, along with leaders from the National Action Network and the Hispanic Federation, announced Sunday that he will legally challenge the law. The law ""is an affront to the civil rights of all Americans and an attempt to legalize racial profiling,"" Sharpton said in a statement after the bill's signing Friday. ""As one who helped to make racial profiling a national issue and who has in the last year visited Arizona several times to rally against these draconian immigration policies, I am calling for a coalition of civil rights organizations to work with those in Arizona to resist and overturn this state law."" The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, a group that represents 30,000 Latino churches worldwide, also said Saturday it plans to file a lawsuit against the bill. ""In addition to this law being illegal, if this law goes into effect, we expect it to have a dramatic affect on the state with U.S. citizens, legal residents and others moving out of the state out of fear of being singled out,"" William Sanchez, an immigration attorney representing the coalition, said in a statement. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Hundreds gather to denounce bill signed Friday by Gov. Jan Brewer .

"If the federal government shuts down starting Tuesday because of a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law, more people say congressional Republicans rather than President Barack Obama would be responsible, according to a new national survey. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday morning, hours before funding for the government is scheduled to run out, also indicates that most Americans think Republicans in Congress are acting like spoiled children in this fiscal fight, with the public divided on whether the president is acting like a spoiled child or a responsible adult. And six in 10 questioned in the survey say they want Congress to approve a budget agreement to avoid a government shutdown, and if it happens, most people say a shutdown would be a bad thing for the country. The poll's release comes one day after the GOP-dominated House of Representatives approved a spending plan to fund the government that would delay the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, for a year, and repeal its tax on medical devices. 10 ways a shutdown would affect daily life . That measure now heads back to Senate later Monday, where the Democratic majority has said any changes to the health care law would be a deal-killer. If no deal is reached on a temporary funding measure, a government shutdown would kick in at 12:01 a.m. ET Tuesday. According to the poll, which was conducted Friday through Sunday, 46% say they would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, with 36% saying the president would be more responsible and 13% pointing fingers at both the GOP in Congress and Obama. ""The number who would hold congressional Republicans responsible has gone down by 5 points since early September, and the number who would blame Obama is up 3 points in that same time,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Those changes came among most demographic groups."" The CNN poll is similar to a CBS News/New York Times survey released late last week that indicated 44% blaming congressional Republicans and 35% pointing fingers at the president. Two other polls conducted in the past week and a half, from Pew Research Center and United Technologies/National Journal, showed a much closer margin but their questions mentioned Republicans in general rather than the GOP in Congress. While most Democrats questioned in the CNN poll would predictably blame congressional Republicans and most Republicans questioned would point fingers at the president, independents were divided on which side they would blame. In a separate question, 49% of all people in the poll say that Obama is acting like a responsible adult in this budget battle, with 47% describing him as a spoiled child. While that's nothing to brag about, it's better than Congress. Read the entire CNN/ORC poll . According to the poll, 58% say congressional Democrats are acting like spoiled children, with that number rising to 69% for the GOP in Congress. Only one in four say congressional Republicans are acting like responsible adults. Some 68% say a shutdown for a few days would be a bad thing for the country, with that number rising to nearly eight in 10 for a shutdown lasting a few weeks. Six in 10 questioned in the CNN survey say that it is more important for Congress to avoid a shutdown than to make major changes to the new health care law, with only a third saying it is more important for lawmakers to prevent major provisions in the new health care law from taking effect by cutting the funds needed to implement them. (Note: When CNN began interviews for this poll on Friday evening, the Senate had just stripped out of its bill the House Republican measure to defund the health care law. What the House passed this weekend doesn't specifically call for a defunding of Obamacare -- instead it delays its implementation for a year -- but the repeal on medical devices would cut key funding for the law.) The drive to overthrow the health care law, which was passed in 2010 when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, is being fueled by GOP lawmakers voted into office the past two elections with the strong support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives. ""A majority of Republicans think that blocking Obamacare is more important than approving a budget agreement,"" said Holland. ""So do tea party supporters, regardless of their partisan affiliation."" ""Who's driving this strategy: 40 to 50 of the most conservative members of the House, and four or five of the most conservative members of the Senate,"" says CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""Fifty-six percent of tea party supporters say it's a good thing to shut down the government. These are the folks those most conservative members of Congress are listening to. Those lawmakers think back home they're on safe ground even though nationally shutting down the government is a non-starter."" The poll indicates that Obamacare is not popular, with 57% saying they oppose the law, up 3 points from May, and 38% saying they support the measure, down five points from May. But only about four in 10 oppose it because it is too liberal, with about one in 10 saying they don't like the law because it is not liberal enough. If you add the 38% who favor the law to the 11% to oppose the law because it's not liberal enough, you get 49%, compared with the 39% who say they oppose the law because it's too liberal. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 27-29, with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

"One of the men accused of the brutal daylight killing of British soldier Lee Rigby told police he took little joy in slaying. Michael Adebolajo's interview with police was played to jurors at the Old Bailey criminal court in London on Wednesday, day four of the trial in which he and co-defendant Michael Adebowale have pleaded not guilty to the murder of Rigby in Woolwich on May 22. In the interview, Adebolajo identified himself as Mujahideen Abu Hamza and began a long and uninterrupted statement by praising Allah and expressing his surprise and gratitude for the way he had been treated by police and medical staff, given what he described as ""the serious nature of events."" ""There still remain some great qualities in this nation,"" the British-born Adebolajo told police before saying he was ashamed to be called British. ""That title -- British -- is associated with the pillaging and rape of innocent people. This disgusts me to the core."" He went on to say that he did not enjoy watching horror movies or seeing blood spilled. ""It brings me little joy to approach anybody and slay them. Can you believe me?"" The jury has seen graphic mobile phone and CCTV footage of Adebolajo brandishing a machete and knife with his hands covered in blood after the attack on Rigby. Adebolajo told police he would answer only questions he believed would help the British people. ""I am not here to satisfy your supervisor,"" he said. ""I'm only here to prevent such an incident as happened on Wednesday, the 22nd of May, from ever happening again."" He did answer one direct question from police in the interview, and it concerned what he did to Rigby. ""Lee Rigby was killed on the 22nd of May,"" he said. ""He was struck in the neck with a sharp implement and it was sawn until his head, you know, became almost detached, and may Allah forgive me of I acted in a way that is displeasing to him."" Pathologist Simon Poole told the court Wednesday that drummer Rigby suffered ""numerous and very deep wounds"" to the neck and that the cause of death was ""multiple incised wounds."" During Adebolajo's two-hour interview with police, he also criticized British rulers whom he described as ""wicked and black-hearted humans"" from privileged schools like Eton, who wore expensive suits and drove expensive cars. He singled out Prime Minister David Cameron; brothers David and Ed Milliband, the political veterans; and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. He expressed particular disappointment with Cameron, who he said is trying to emulate a man he described as ""using the magic of the tongue to dodge questions. He goes by the name of Tony Blair. Nobody realizes the wickedness and corruption of this man."" Earlier in the day, the court heard the statement of forensic psychiatrist Tim McKinley, who interviewed Adebolajo three times while he was being treated in a hospital after being shot by police shortly after the attack on Rigby. The psychiatrist described the defendant as polite and said he showed no signs of mental disorder, remorse or regret. Adebolajo told him he posed no threat to civilians, police or medical staff but would be a continued threat to the British military.","Jurors hear Michael Adebolajo's police interview on the fourth day of his murder trial .

"Calling all Elizabeth Gallaghers in Canada: Would you like a free trip around the world? Toronto resident Jordan Axani, 28, is looking for a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to take a couple of airline tickets off his hands. Axani posted on Reddit that he booked this ""fairly wicked"" trip in March when he and the original Elizabeth Gallagher were still together. After they broke up, he didn't want the tickets to go to waste. ""Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible,"" he wrote on the site. If you're lucky enough to be Canadian and have the name Elizabeth Gallagher, here is your itinerary: . December 21: NYC to Milan . December 28: Prague to Paris . December 29: Paris to Bangkok .

I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front of the Christmas Market in Prague,"" he wrote. ""If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness."" Better hurry, though. Axani says he has received thousands of emails from around the world in response to his Reddit post, including ""dozens of emails from Elizabeths who are Canadian."" No word on how he's going to make the final selection. There's probably not enough time before the trip to do it ""Survivor"" style. The real question is whether it's possible for another Elizabeth Gallagher to travel under a ticket purchased for Axani's ex. Airline policies typically forbid the transfer of tickets, but in this case, how would they know? Axani says he booked it on Priceline using Elizabeth's first and last name only (no middle name). And we know security agents at the airport generally don't check birth dates, which are required to purchase a ticket. CNN has reached out to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to find out whether they have any security measures in place that would prevent Elizabeth Gallagher 2.0 from traveling.","A 28-year-old Toronto man is looking for a Canadian woman named Elizabeth Gallagher .

"(CNN) -- The Hole in the Wall experiments, known as HiW, were first implemented in 1999, when a computer with an internet connection was embedded into a wall for children to discover and use unsupervised. The wall adjoined a slum in India. Only a month later, it was evident that the children had taught themselves to use the computer and also picked up some skills in English and mathematics. This kind of design was then set up in more and more remote areas across the nation with almost identical results. These were computers embedded in walls or kiosks in easily accessible and highly visible public spaces, facilitating peer interaction, discovery and learning in groups of children. We concluded that groups of children from disadvantaged and remote settings can learn to use computers and access internet resources, on their own, if given appropriate free, public and unsupervised access. Watch an interview with Sugata Mitra . These earliest experiences also showed that children could develop some skills in English and mathematics. What came through unequivocally in this and further work on self-organizing systems in education was that groups of children -- irrespective of who or where they are, or what language they speak -- given free and public access to computers and the internet can: . 1. Become computer-literate on their own -- that is, they can learn to use computers and the internet for most of the tasks done by lay users. 2. Teach themselves enough English to use e-mail, chat and search engines. 3. Learn in a few months to search the internet for answers to questions. 4. Improve their English pronunciation on their own. 5. Improve their mathematics and science scores in school. 6. Be prepared to pass examinations several years ahead of grade level. 7. Change their social interaction skills and value systems. 8. Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination. We then went on to show that the quality of traditional schooling declines the farther schools are from the urban center of New Delhi. A similar decline is visible in the UK as one goes to more economically disadvantaged areas. This has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas. TED.com: Bill Gates on mosquitoes, malaria and education . Two landmark events took this work further. The first was a comment by the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke to me: ""Teachers that can be replaced by a machine should be"". The second was an experiment in a Tsunami-hit Indian village, where I was trying to prove that Tamil-speaking 12-year-olds cannot teach themselves biotechnology in English. At the end of the experiment, a little girl told me, ""Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease, we have understood nothing else."" Finally, we found that the presence of a friendly, but not knowledgeable, mediator can enable children to reach levels of learning similar to formal schools with trained teachers. TED.com: Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity . We went on to set up a ""cloud"" of ""eMediators,"" mostly retired schoolteachers with broadband access from their homes. Schools can access this ""cloud"" over Skype and children can interact with the mediators over free videoconferencing. Interestingly, in the hands of good teachers, these methods can be powerful motivators for children, resulting in better performance. What started out as a solution for remote areas turned out to have universal applicability. Both HiW and the work done later are based on the concept of Minimally Invasive Education, a pedagogic method that motivates groups of children to learn in an environment with little or no intervention from teachers or other adults, and that formed the basis of the design of the 'HiW' computers. It is now possible to formulate a new approach to learning, using these findings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sugata Mitra.","Sugata Mitra: Experiments show students can teach themselves with computers .

Adult mediators can help further this kind of learning even without formal teacher training, he says ."
"The vast blue sky stretched above Clara Bohitile's pick-up truck as it trundled down a dirt road deep in the Kalahari bushveld. Stopping in a whirl of red dust, one of her workers jumped off the back to open the wire gate to her ranch. It was a typical African rural scene, but with a difference: traditionally the driver would have been a white Afrikaans male farmer, but Bohitile is a black woman. Originally from a township in the capital Windhoek she now runs her own cattle farm, known locally as a ""kraal"". Bohitile represents the changing face of Namibia. Under both German colonial and South African apartheid-era rule, political power, wealth and the ownership of productive land were deliberately dominated by whites. But since the country's independence in 1990 there have been concerted efforts to change the legacy of discrimination. ""The percentage of black farmers is still very small in comparison to white farmers,"" said Bohitile.  ""But, indeed, we are entering that market, as black farmers we go through a lot of training, we do practicals on farms and we just get wiser and wiser and we try to do the right thing."" Land reform in Namibia is one of the county's most emotive issues and changing the old patterns of ownership is not easy.  Bohitile is making a success of her venture, but she is former Deputy Minister of Education and a prominent businesswoman today, which gave her access to capital and a head start. iReport: send in your views on the country . Next to Bohitile's ranch is a former white-owned farm on which eight resettled black families are struggling to make a living. Some assistance came last month when a white Namibian mentor, sponsored by German money and directed by the government-owned Agricultural Bank of Namibia arrived to advise one of the new owners, Naftali Katjiuongua. ""We are making money,"" said Katjiuongua.  ""But its not enough to help us. Things are very expensive. We need more help from the government."" Problems remain but Namibia has come a long way from when I first visited the country as a teenager in 1976.  I will never forget the long rows of dusty, mostly dilapidated cars parked in the port of Walvis Bay. They had been left behind by white Portuguese settlers fleeing the revolution and civil war in neighboring Angola. Read more: moving on from a difficult past . In South Africa, the flames of the Soweto uprisings were filling the air, while the war against white rule raged on the Namibia borders. The future for many in southern Africa seemed hopeless then. There seemed to be no way out of the conflict between white and black over who should rule the land and own the wealth. I could never have imagined that over 35 years later Namibia would be such a peaceful country, although serious issues remain: unemployment is estimated to be over 50% and over 70% among youth, the gap between rich and poor is too high, and skills development is low. Test your knowledge of Namibia . Yet black Namibians have made huge strides. The CEO of the country's largest diamond mining company, Namdeb, is Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi, a black woman who is leading a new struggle in the country. ""The war for talent is an ongoing challenge,"" she says.  ""We don't believe we can ever say we have trained enough.  When there is progress and you are moving forward you will need to keep up with skills development."" Bohitile and Zaamwani-Kamwi are two women who encapsulate the new Namibia, and the possibilities open to them today were virtually unimaginable in the past. Namibia's success is that black advancement has not meant white diminishment. German and Afrikaans culture is still strong. There remains a strong sense of shared identity among Namibians of all races, and a common belief that their future can be better. Hamilton Wende is a freelance writer and television producer. He has written six books and is a producer for CNN's Eye on Namibia coverage.","Namibia is slowly moving on from its history of discrimination .

"Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Monday the West and his political opponents can commit suicide if they cannot accept his recent re-election. ""Those who can't stomach the defeat, you can commit suicide. Even dogs will not sniff their carcasses,"" said the 89-year-old leader while addressing an event to commemorate veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence. It was his first public speech since the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared him winner, with 61% of the vote, of the July 31 elections, beating Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change last week challenged the election results, accusing the electoral commission of rigging the polls for Mugabe's ZANU-PF. ""We will never go back on our victory. We do not know what is retreating,"" Mugabe said. To the West ""we are delivering democracy on a platter. Will you take?"" asked Africa's oldest leader. ""We say take it or leave it. We will never go back on our victory."" Some of the people that attended the event Monday had placards reading ""Which Africa Observed Elections in Europe or America?""; ""Come on, concede defeat""; ""Obama: Zimbabwe will never be a second Chile"";  ""Thank you Zimbabwe for defending our sovereignty""; and ""Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.""

"""Mohawk Guy,"" a Mars rover flight director, isn't just a social media sensation -- he made an impression on President Barack Obama, too. ""I, in the past, thought about getting a mohawk myself, but my team keeps on discouraging me,"" Obama told scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a phone call Monday broadcast on NASA TV. ""And now that he's received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think that I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense,"" he said to the sound of laughter from dozens of NASA employees. Obama called NASA mission specialists to congratulate them on the successful landing of the rover Curiosity, which reached Mars one week ago. He praised them for their achievements in the phone call, which was both laudatory and lighthearted. ""Mohawk Guy,"" whose real name is Bobak Ferdowsi, has become famous for his look during the rover landing last week. As the world waited for Curiosity to touch down, Ferdowsi sported a red-and-black mohawk; the sides of his head featured yellow dyed stars. Decoding the workplace dress code . ""It does sound like NASA has come a long way from the white-shirt, black dark-rimmed glasses and the pocket protectors,"" Obama told Jet Propulsion Laboratory Director Charles Elachi and colleagues. ""You guys are a little cooler than you used to be."" More seriously, Obama thanked the scientists for devoting their lives to the cause of exploration outside our planet. ""What you've accomplished embodies the American spirit,"" he said. ""Our expectation is that Curiosity is going to be telling us things that we did not know before,"" he said, and that the rover will lay the groundwork for an even more ""audacious undertaking,"" which would be ""a human mission to the red planet."" What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Curiosity is about the size of a sport utility vehicle and weighs 2,000 pounds. The mission costs about $2.6 billion. The rover, after traveling for more than eight months, safely landed on the surface of Mars before 2 a.m. E.T. on August 6. The landing process was dubbed ""seven minutes of terror"" and involved the world's largest supersonic parachute and a sky crane. Despite the complicated landing mechanism, the rover landed about 1.5 miles from its target, which was still well within the range where scientists expected it to arrive. ""It's really mind-boggling what you've been able to accomplish,"" the president told the NASA mission specialists. ""And being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team."" 5 reasons to be excited about Curiosity . The rover will head toward Mount Sharp, a 18,000-foot high mountain about 7.5 miles south of where it landed. Curiosity will climb at least a small portion of this mountain, which is composed of layers of rock that have built up over time. Using its science tools, the rover will test for organic molecules, which would indicate the planet could have once hosted life. Meet a rover driver: His other car is on Mars . Curiosity is supposed to last for two years on the red planet, but previous missions suggest that it could go longer. NASA had  planned for twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity to last only 90 days, but Spirit persevered from 2004 to 2010, and Opportunity is still chugging along. Obama may be busy with the upcoming election, but he said he'd still like to know immediately whether Curiosity finds life -- even microorganisms -- on Mars. ""If in fact you do make contact with Martians, please let me know right away,"" he said, receiving more laughter. He added,  ""I've got a lot of other things on my plate, but I suspect that that will go to the top of the list.""","President Barack Obama congratulates NASA scientists on Mars rover landing .

"We've yet to hear all the details surrounding Chris Brown's alleged altercation with Frank Ocean, but it would seem in the court of public opinion, Brown's already been tried. If you've been following your celebrity feuds, you know there was tension between Brown and Ocean in 2011 thanks to an argument on Twitter. But with Brown's history of violent behavior and the examples of questionable decision-making in recent years, the presumption by some is that the ""Don't Wake Me Up"" singer is the guilty party in the standoff. As with controversial celebrities before him, at the core of the reaction to Brown are those age-old questions: What are our behavior standards for our celebrities, who sets them, and can they be enforced? If someone does something heinous, should we cease to find them entertaining? And just how much should a star's personal life override his or her work? The answers to those questions are debatable and shift with the times, but they're also made all the more charged by the context of Brown's case. Following his 2009 assault on his then-girlfriend Rihanna, which the world saw through a leaked photo of the singer's bruised and beaten face and a detailed police report, Brown has developed a reputation to rival showbiz's biggest repeat offenders. In the past four years, he's created a baffling rinse-and-repeat history of misdeeds, with a few apologies to match. Just within the last seven months, the R&B/hip-hop artist has been in two other highly publicized fights -- one physical, with fellow musician Drake in New York, and one digital, with writer/comedian Jenny Johnson on Twitter -- in addition to now being investigated for the third brawl over the weekend. CNN hasn't heard back from either Brown or Ocean for more clarification on what transpired in the 7200 block of Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California, but authorities have confirmed that it was a physical throwdown involving six men. As deputies work to get to the bottom of what occurred, they've said that Brown is under investigation for allegedly punching an unnamed victim -- and over a parking space, no less. Yet the frequent feuds are just the beginning of Brown's tenuous public image. Equally damaging has been his defensive attitude, a brash, short-sighted bravado that he'll sometimes temper with notes of aspirational positivity. The highlight reel of 2012 alone gives enough examples: . Last February, he won no favors by telling those opposed to his 2012 Grammy awards appearance to ""hate"" all they wanted to, because he'd won an award that night. (That, in his opinion, was the ""ultimate f*** off."") In October, Brown incurred skeptical looks with a Halloween costume that was perceived as emulating the stereotypical image of a terrorist. The month prior to that the controversy was a tattoo of a ""sugar skull"" on his neck, one that made enough people think of a post-assault Rihanna that his rep had to clarify that the ink wasn't of the pop star. In December, he again rankled onlookers by sharing a photo of himself in Amsterdam smoking enough ""medicinal marijuana"" for three people, which he later apologized for. (Perhaps realizing the pot-stirring effect his social media posts have, Brown pulled away from Instagram on Tuesday with the post: ""Social media takes away the essence of why we are even special or icons. So with that, I'm detaching myself from that world."") As a result, any conversation that remotely mentions the 23-year-old star tends to push observers into two camps. There are the defending supporters, who accuse Brown's critics of being self-righteous and coldly disbelieving in an individual's power to change. And then there are the affronted, who see his defenders as dismissive of Brown's influence and unwilling to hold the singer accountable for his actions -- not to mention turning a blind eye to the gravity of domestic violence. The media aren't above taking sides. Marlow Stern of The Daily Beast offered a ""preponderance of evidence"" that Brown is ""one of the most infuriatingly awful people in show business."" Gawker posited that ""it's not hard to choose between those two versions"" in the Ocean/Brown fracas, because in one corner you have ""a violent, angry, abusive a**hole,"" and in the other, a singer who ""has never been accused of assault and isn't known for hitting people."" Influential supporters like Justin Bieber -- who recently told Billboard magazine that he's pulling for the R&B/hip-hop singer on Grammy night -- chime in, reminding consumers that it's about a product, not a personality. ""I'm a fan,"" Bieber said of Brown. ""His music is really good. That's what they should focus on: the music."" It might be tough to remember, but Brown caught our attention in 2005 with the promise of becoming pop's next prince, earning the distinction at the time of being the first male artist in over a decade to land a No. 1 on the Billboard 100 with a debut single. He was top 40 radio-ready and appearing in Doublemint gum commercials, singing alongside an ""American Idol"" winner and charmingly chatting about wanting to be the next Michael Jackson. Along the way, he's developed a strong fan base -- sometimes referred to as Team Breezy -- that's been consistent in his corner even as we've watched that careful artist package come apart at the seams. One thing that's held his ship upright in waves of backlash, said Yahoo! Music senior editor Billy Johnson Jr., has been his music. ""It does help when you have really good products in the marketplace, because I think at the end of the day that will supersede everything,"" Johnson said. ""You're trying to repair a damaged image, one way to shift the focus is to put out good music."" Whether you personally find Brown's music to be ""good"" or not is a matter of taste, but it is clear that he's being accepted by both the industry and the music-buying public. The same month he allegedly broke the window of his ""Good Morning America"" dressing room after storming off the set, he notched his first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with 2011's ""F.A.M.E."" That same record also earned Brown a best R&B album Grammy the following February, and his 2012 album, ""Fortune,"" was another No. 1 and is nominated in the best urban contemporary category at the 2013 ceremony. Brown is far from the first to whip us into a backbiting frenzy over where we, culturally, can and/or should draw our lines, and it's seriously unlikely he'll be the last. Charlie Sheen is one of the most notorious examples, and while he's a touchy subject when it comes to public acceptance, he's nonetheless been successful in terms of output. Even before he was ""winning,"" Sheen cultivated a bad-boy reputation thanks to his predilection for paying for ""sexual services"" and time spent in rehab. In the mid-to-late '90s, his shine further lost its luster with allegations of domestic violence. In 2009, Sheen's then-wife Brooke Mueller alleged that he threatened her, a storyline that was the precursor to his at turns confusing, laughable and upsetting meltdown in 2011, during which he was let go from the popular show ""Two and a Half Men."" After coming down off the tiger blood, Sheen's now on FX with another comedy, ""Anger Management."" In Brown's case, he's similarly continued to press forward with his music and acting career. Prior to making his Instagram account private, he posted that he's at work on a new album, showing once again that what happens for a star personally doesn't always interrupt what occurs professionally, even while we continue to hash out whether it should.","Although details aren't clear, some have assumed Brown is guilty in his latest fight .

"Ukrainian forces began military operations in the east of the country Tuesday, marking a definite end to a unilateral cease-fire that had been in place for 10 days. The speaker of Ukraine's parliament, Oleksandr Turchynov, told lawmakers the government's ""anti-terror operation"" against pro-Russia separatists had been ""renewed."" Ukrainian armed forces have been conducting ""attacks on terrorists' bases and defended posts,"" he said. The announcement came hours after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that his country would not renew a cease-fire with the separatists, vowing instead to ""attack and liberate our land."" ""Termination of cease-fire is our response to terrorists, insurgents, marauders ... and (those who) deprive people of normal peaceful life,"" Poroshenko said. In a statement on his website, Poroshenko congratulated Ukraine's armed forces and border guards for re-establishing control over the checkpoint at Dolzhanskyi, in ""the first victory since the restoration of the CTO,"" a reference to the government's Counterterrorist Operation. He said the armed forces and the State Border Service of Ukraine regained control over the checkpoint and combat engineers removed mines from the checkpoint and adjacent roads. Violence flared Tuesday in Donetsk, one of the cities at the heart of the separatist unrest. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, on his official Facebook page, said that militants had launched an attack on a regional police headquarters building in Donetsk, killing one police officer and badly injuring two more. Avakov said the police were barricaded inside the building in the city of Donetsk and that the fighting was ongoing. The Interior Ministry later said three people were seriously injured -- one woman and two special forces policemen. Three others were injured and hospitalized, the ministry said. Police successfully fought back the attack, the ministry said on its website. On its website, the Donetsk regional state administration said Ukrainian forces attacked the central part of Kramatorsk from the air and ground. A bus attack in Kramatorsk left four people dead and five others injured. The statement did not say which side in the conflict carried out that attack. Yuriy Stets, information security head for the National Guard and a parliamentarian, told CNN that the National Guard had regained control of Zakotne, near Slovyansk, and were targeting two other towns. Cease-fire hopes dashed . The fragile cease-fire expired at midnight Monday, hours after Poroshenko spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Poroshenko also talked on the phone with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The cease-fire -- agreed on last month amid a volatile political crisis -- raised hopes that Ukraine could be moving back from the brink of full-fledged civil war. As part of a peace plan, Poroshenko urged the rebels to lay down their arms and engage in talks. He also called for the strengthening of Ukraine-Russia border controls, the freeing of hostages and changes to the constitution to decentralize power. In his statement, Poroshenko said the militants had failed to take up a ""unique opportunity"" to support the peace plan and had instead violated the unilateral cease-fire more than 100 times. Putin, addressing Russian diplomats in Moscow, said he regretted the decision to end the cease-fire. ""Unfortunately, President Poroshenko decided to resume a military operation. I and my EU colleagues could not convince him"" of the need to settle the crisis peacefully. Putin: 'Only on equal terms' Putin said Russia had been obliged to annex Ukraine's Crimea region in March in order to prevent NATO forces entering, which would have created ""a completely different alignment of forces."" He told the diplomats that they would ""face growing pressure in defending national interests"" and that ""the events provoked by the West in Ukraine have become a concentrated political expression of deterrence toward Russia."" Putin also referred to Russia's tense relationship with the United States, suggesting that the current crisis was born of the West's attempts to impose its own way of doing things on the rest of the world. ""Our relationship with the United States is not the best at the moment,"" he said. ""We have always tried to be predictable partners, handle business on an equal basis, but in return our legal interests were partially ignored and are still ignored. Russian and U.S. contacts have a great meaning for the entire world. ""We are ready for constructive dialogue, but again I emphasize only on equal terms."" Russia's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, said Tuesday that the refusal to extend the cease-fire is a ""negative sign,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Twitter. ""This makes it even harder to understand the logic of how the confirmation of the so-called 15-point peace plan correlates with the refusal to prolong truce,"" Chizhov was quoted as saying by state news agency ITAR-Tass. 'Enemies and invaders' Poroshenko declared in a late-night televised address that the cease-fire was over. In Kiev's Independence Square, known as Maidan, activists outside the presidential administration building applauded Poroshenko's stance. ""We need only military actions,"" a priest named Valentyn said in a Reuters interview. ""We were forced by those who entered our country as enemies and invaders."" The crisis has its roots in former President Viktor Yanukovych's decision last year to shun a European Union Association Agreement and turn toward Russia instead. The move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, Ukraine's loss of Crimea, and a pro-Russia separatist rebellion. Russia also massed troops along its western border with Ukraine. The Association Agreement, which will bring closer trade and political ties between Ukraine and Europe, was finally signed by Poroshenko and European leaders last week. After Monday's phone call, Poroshenko said his goal was peace but insisted it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability, noting violations of the cease-fire by pro-Russia separatists. The Ukrainian government ""has been completely fulfilling its commitments and unilaterally complying with the ceasefire regime for 10 days and paid dozens of lives for that,"" he said. Peace talks were held last week among Ukrainian government officials, pro-Russia separatists from the restive eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, Russian officials, and members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 'Bloody truce' Activist Vadym told Reuters there was no point in continuing the cease-fire. ""There is definitely no need for an extension of the truce,"" he said. ""Because a lot of our boys died during this truce."" Fellow activist Yulia agreed. ""Bloody military actions are better than such bloody truce,"" she said.  ""We must put an end to it once and that's all."" A statement from Putin's press office about the call said the Russian President ""stressed the need to extend the cease-fire and also establish a reliable mechanism for monitoring"" it.

"The Army will conduct ""a comprehensive, coordinated"" review into the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl -- the recently freed soldier whom some have deemed a hero, others a deserter -- the military branch's civilian leader announced Tuesday. Secretary of the Army John McHugh began a statement on Bergdahl's case by saying that ""we are grateful that an American soldier is back in American hands"" and insisting ""our first priority is ensuring Sgt. Bergdahl's health and beginning his reintegration process."" McHugh didn't address specific questions surrounding how the soldier ended up detained in Afghanistan or what he did while in that situation. But he did say that the military's review ""will include speaking with Sgt. Bergdahl to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity."" ""All other decisions will be made thereafter, and in accordance with appropriate regulations, policies and practices,"" McHugh said. Authorities haven't given any indication that such a decision is coming anytime soon. Speaking Tuesday in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama said that Bergdahl had not then been interrogated by U.S. officials because he is still undergoing medical care. Nor had he met yet with his family, according to the President. Bergdahl -- who was released by his Taliban captors in exchange for five prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- is at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. The five prisoners headed to Qatar as part of the exchange. Bergdahl will remain at that U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment, a U.S. defense official there told CNN. After that, Bergdahl will return to the United States and go to a San Antonio military base, the official said. In his statement Tuesday, McHugh suggested Bergdahl's medical treatment will be a driving force in what happens next and when it does. ""There is no timeline for this, and we will take as long as medically necessary to aid his recovery,"" McHugh said. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Hailed as hero, condemned as deserter . The release of Bergdahl, the last American soldier held captive from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, spurred celebration in many circles. But others challenged the move -- including some critical because he was let go in exchange for Guantanamo detainees, plus many of those who served with Bergdahl who characterized him as a deserter whose ""selfish act"" ended up costing others' lives. According to firsthand accounts from soldiers in his platoon, Bergdahl -- sometime before he was set to go on guard duty -- shed his weapons and walked off an observation post with nothing more than a compass, a knife, water, a digital camera and a diary. The team leader, Evan Buetow, recalled to CNN's Jake Tapper that Bergdahl ""did not agree with the war effort in Afghanistan"" and had said various things that, in retrospect, led him to believe the soldier had ""walked away."" ""It was a gut feeling I had,"" Buetow said Tuesday. ""... When he comes up missing and all of his sensitive items are left behind, it just kind of hit us in the head."" At least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for Bergdahl, according to soldiers involved in operations to find him. The Pentagon was not able to provide details on specific operations in which any soldiers killed during that time were involved. Also, many soldiers in Bergdahl's platoon said attacks seemed to increase against the United States in Paktika province in the days and weeks following his disappearance. Buetow conceded that he and others may never know if this violence was coincidental or if Bergdahl gave his captors information voluntarily or after being tortured. Yet he found it ""incredibly suspicious"" that attacks after Bergdahl disappeared seemed to become ""far more directed."" As to those U.S. soldiers who died, Buetow said, ""Those soldiers would not be on those patrols, in those specific areas when they were killed, unless Bergdahl left. And that's a fact to me."" All this said, the exact circumstances of his disappearance are very uncertain. Published accounts have varied widely, from claims that he walked off the post to claims that he was grabbed from a latrine. Noting everything that he left behind, an Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his 2009 disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. There was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. The investigation included interviews with members of Bergdahl's unit, none of whom reported seeing him go, the official said. In 2012, Rolling Stone reported that Bergdahl's unit had discipline and other issues during its time in Afghanistan. Addressing the matter Tuesday, Obama stressed that we ""we don't leave men and women in uniform behind"" and insisted prisoner swaps ""happen ... at the end of wars."" ""Whatever the circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity. Period. Full stop,"" Obama said. ""We don't condition that."" Bergdahl team leader: He sought talks with Taliban . 'He is innocent until proven guilty' Intelligence indicated where Bergdahl was being held a couple of times during his five years in captivity, a U.S. official said. But any mission to get him was deemed too risky -- especially for Berghdal. Instead, the United States worked through a third party to arrange a prisoner swap. The five Taliban prisoners freed from U.S. custody were transferred to Qatar, where Obama said he's confident they won't endanger the United States on the battlefield or elsewhere. Several factors help mitigate the risk of the exchange, two senior U.S. officials said. They include: . • They've been in Guantanamo for a long time and therefore likely don't have networks as extensive as they once had; . • Most U.S. troops will out of Afghanistan in a year; . • Personal assurances from Qatar's emir to closely monitor them. The detainees won't be under house arrest, yet one U.S. official says, ""We think the Qataris are going to keep a very, very close eye on them."" Asked about why Congress wasn't consulted about the exchange, the President said that over the years, the White House had talked with Congress about the possible need for such an exchange, and that officials had to move quickly when the opportunity arose. ""This was likely the last, best opportunity to free him,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, adding that ""we did the right thing"" in negotiating a deal much like ""we exchanged prisoners"" with the Germans and Japanese after World War II. As to Bergdahl, he is in stable condition at Landstuhl for treatment of conditions related to five years of captivity, the hospital said Tuesday. Citing privacy laws, the medical center did not provide specifics about his medical condition. He is undergoing a period of ""reintegration"" that includes decompression and help from doctors, security officers, lawyers, chaplains, his family and more, the hospital said. ""The goal is to return him to family and society and on the path to complete recovery,"" the medical center said, adding that there is no timeline for the recovery process. McHugh's comments Tuesday followed those of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey, who stressed that questions of Bergdahl's conduct is separate from the effort to recover any missing U.S. soldier. ""As for the circumstances of his capture, when he is able to provide them, we'll learn the facts,"" Dempsey said. ""Like any American, he is innocent until proven guilty."" He added: ""Our Army's leaders will not look away from misconduct if it occurred.""

"(CNN)      -- China has killed 13,000 birds in the country's far northwest to control what it called an epidemic of bird flu, state media reported Tuesday. Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected birds in over 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Five hundred fowl that had died in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region tested positive for the H5N1 virus, according to China's Ministry of Agriculture. In late January, China confirmed its sixth case of bird flu in a human. The ministry said at the time that, although further human bird flu cases were possible throughout China, there wouldn't be a large-scale outbreak, state run news agency Xinhua and CCTV reported. The country also announced it was setting up a nationwide network to test for the H5N1 virus. Following a bird flu outbreak in late January, India culled more than 4,000 birds in the remote northeastern state of Sikkim. Health officials also detected dozens of cases of upper respiratory infection among humans, but none of the patients had any history of handling sick poultry, a government spokesperson said. Sikkim borders Nepal and China. Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected many species of birds in more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. It has not been found in birds in North or South America or the Caribbean, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but the virus has passed from poultry to humans in some cases. It has killed more than 200 people since 2003. China reported its first human-to-human infection case in 2005. Of the 34 cases confirmed to date in the country, 23 had been fatal, the World Health Organization said in late January.","China kills 13,000 birds in northwest to control what it calls an epidemic of bird flu .

"Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai's inspiring speech at the United Nations on every child's right to go to school is just the beginning of a major push on education, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Saturday. Yousafzai -- who on Friday gave her first public remarks since she was shot by the Taliban last year for advocating that all girls should go to school -- will return to the United Nations in September to press her point, according to a statement from Brown's A World at School campaign. Accompanied by Brown, she will address an education summit of world leaders during the week of the full General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, it said. There, the 16-year-old will demand action on behalf of 57 million children around the world who have no access to any schooling. Meanwhile, Brown, who's the U.N. special envoy for global education, will travel to Pakistan in July to discuss education issues with the country's new government. He also intends to visit Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, in the fall. Between them, Pakistan and Nigeria have 16 million children out of school, the statement said, most of them girls. Malala's journey from near death to recovery . Brown and Yousafzai met with the United Nations' Pakistan high commissioner on Friday to discuss the plight of more than 5 million children who are out of school in the country, the statement said. ""Malala's speech was just the start of a momentous push for change in the run up to 2015, to deal with the education emergency,"" Brown said. The Millennium Development Goal on education set by U.N. member states in 2000 pledged to have every child in school by 2015. In her speech Friday, Yousafzai said the masked gunmen who shot her in the head in October, who also injured two other girls, had not silenced her ambitions but rather made her stronger. Gordon Brown: The story of Malala's friend . ""They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed,"" she said. ""And then, out of that silence came thousands of voices."" She said that she doesn't seek revenge against the Taliban, who have threatened to hunt her down again and end her life, and that she's against no one. Malala's global voice stronger than ever . ""I am here to speak up for the right of education of every child,"" she said. ""I want education for the sons and the daughters of all the extremists, especially the Taliban."" She also reflected on the very real dangers faced by teachers and students in Pakistan. Earlier this summer, a teacher was gunned down in front of her son as she drove into her all-girl school. A school principal was killed and his students severely injured when a bomb was tossed onto a school playground at a girls' school in Karachi in March. In January, five teachers were killed near the town of Swabi in the volatile northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the United Nations says. And, in June, a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying 40 schoolgirls as it made its way to a girls' campus in Quetta. Fourteen students were killed. The speech, given on her 16th birthday, was not about her, Yousafzai added, but rather to give a voice to all the voiceless millions around the world fighting for their rights. ""Let us wage a global struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism, and let us pick up our books and pens. They are our most powerful weapons,"" she said. ""One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world. Education is the only solution. Education first.""

"Holding a shotgun and shooting skeet, the Democratic candidate out to topple Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell attempts to flip the script in a new television ad. The ad shows Alison Lundergan Grimes blasting away, then pops in a picture of McConnell brandishing a gun upside down over his head at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year. ""Mitch, that's not how you hold a gun,"" Grimes says. Grimes is not Barack Obama, she says, no matter what McConnell ""wants you to think."" ""Mitch was the same guy who thought Duke basketball players were UK."" That reference is to a McConnell campaign ad that mistakenly placed video of Duke University's basketball team celebrating a 2010 NCAA championship win instead of the Kentucky Wildcats' 2012 win. McConnell has painted a vote for Grimes as a vote for Obama, and a CNN/ORC poll from earlier this month showed about two-thirds of Kentucky voters harbor an unfavorable view of the President. McConnell's pitch is that the only way to alter the balance of power in Washington is through a GOP Senate takeover on Election Day that would put him in charge -- if he can beat Grimes, who would be Kentucky's first woman senator. CNN poll: McConnell holds slim edge in biggest Senate race of 2014 . Grimes says in the new ad that McConnell is ""attacking me on coal after doing nothing while we've lost thousands of coal jobs."" McConnell has vowed to roll back Obama regulations that Republicans loathe, especially Environmental Protection Agency rules on coal that Kentuckians see as harmful to their coal-rich economy. ""He even said it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky,"" she says in the ad before firing another shot. 2014 midterm elections: Key Senate races . ""I'm not Barack Obama,"" she says, ""I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA.

"(MNN.com) -- If you're a dog owner and call yourself eco-conscious, guilt might set in after reading the book ""Time to Eat the Dog? The Real Guide to Sustainable Living"" by Robert and Brenda Vale, which reveals dogs are worse for the environment than SUVs. The authors, who designed the first sustainable settlement in the United Kingdom in 1996 and are architecture professors at Victory University of Wellington in New Zealand, measured the environmental impact of our lifestyles from the food we eat to how we travel to sports, hobbies and pets based on the Ecological Footprint technique created by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees. Bottom line: Our pooches cost the Earth more than a Toyota Land Cruiser. According to the Vales' research, a medium-sized dog has twice the impact of driving the luxury SUV 10,000 miles. Why? ""Basically dogs are bad for the environment because they are large carnivores, so it takes a lot of land to provide their foods,"" says Robert Vale. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to get Fido out of the proverbial doghouse. MNN.com: Photos: 7 pudgy pets that should lay off the kibble . Put your dog on a diet . Since your canine's carnivorous diet is the biggest factor in his environmental impact, start by looking at what goes in the dog bowl. Most dog food isn't produced in an eco-friendly way, and the heavy bags of kibble or cans of wet food have to travel miles to get to your door. Dr. Viv Harris, veterinarian and author of ""Natural Remedies Dogs and Cats Wish You Knew: A Holistic Care Guide,"" suggests making your own dog food using locally grown or organic veggies. Your vet can help you work out the perfect mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins to meet your dog's needs. And with all of the tainted pet food scandals in recent years, your dog may be better off eating home-made meals anyway. After all, many dog foods that claim to be natural still contain byproducts or low-grade meats. If the do-it-yourself doggie diet sounds like too much work, look for smaller, locally made dog food brands. Or select chicken or rabbit based-kibble, which have a lower impact than beef. MNN.com: Nutrition tips for your pet . Do your doodie duty . If you ask the Vales, dog poo isn't such a big deal compared to what goes in the other end. However, if you don't scoop up the poop, it can contaminate our waterways. If you're a city dweller and use plastic bags to clean up, choose biodegradable poop bags. Shop smart . Just like when you shop for yourself, think about the impact of the products you buy for your pets. Choose dog shampoos that are free of sodium lauryl sulfate. For toys and dog beds, avoid plastic and synthetic products and look to natural fibers like organic cotton or hemp as well as products made from recycled goods. Use birth control . Spaying and neutering your dog might sound inhumane, but it's the eco-conscious thing to do. ""Reducing the overpopulation of dogs is crucial,"" Harris says. If your dog alone creates a impact bigger than an SUV, just think what its accidental litter of puppies could do! MNN.com: 10 ways owning a pet benefits your health . Choose safe flea and tick treatments . According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), some flea control products pose a cancer risk to children up to 1,000 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency's acceptable limits. Keep these chemicals off little fingers and your pet's fur by talking to your vet about safer treatments or by choosing from the NRDC's list of safer flea control choices. You can also make natural solutions at home. In her book, Harris suggests creating a DIY flea wash. Start with a base of castile soap and add 10 drops of lavender, five drops of eucalyptus, five drops of rosemary and five drops of cajuput oil. Consider other pets . We're not suggesting you part ways with your pooch right now, but if you don't have a dog yet or are considering a second pet, you might want to think outside the dog box. According to the Vales, a goldfish is equal to the impact of just two cell phones; two hamsters or four canaries can be compared to a plasma TV; and a cat is only as bad as a Smart Car. Even smaller dogs are better than big dogs. Change your own habits . Just like you can buy carbon credits when you take a long-haul flight, you can try to balance out your dog's impact by making some changes of your own. If you don't want to give up Fido, maybe you should give up meat or your car instead. Of course, smaller changes or buying carbon credits can help, too. © Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network .","Authors Robert and Brenda Vale reveal dogs are worse for the environment than SUVs .

"In an old office building at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, there's a room stacked high with plastic containers of synthetic urine. Researchers dip small white paddles into the liquid, wait for a grid of squares to change colors, and snap a photo with a custom smartphone app. It's all part of a futuristic self-diagnosis kit from startup Scanadu, which is competing to be the future of DIY health care. Scanadu is one of 10 teams taking part in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize contest to create an affordable, handheld device that consumers can use to diagnose their medical conditions at home. The goal is to make a working version of ""Star Trek's"" tricorder, the television show's fictional diagnostic device. In the series, the ship's doctor would wave the portable black box over a patent's body and immediately know if a person had broken bones, a disease or if they were going to die. The real-life tricorder must weigh less than 5 pounds, monitor five vital signs and detect 15 medical conditions. It should let people measure their own blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Each system will be able to diagnose common health conditions including diabetes, anemia, sleep apnea and pneumonia. ""We're asking teams to put together an aggregation of technologies that's never been done before,"" said Dr. Erik Viirre, the technical and medical director for the Tricorder X Prize. ""We're spurring things to market faster, better and cheaper."" The multiyear contest is run by X Prize, a nonprofit organization that attempts to accelerate major technological advances. Last week, the judges narrowed down the field of 41 teams to 10, which now have until April to create working prototypes for consumer tests. The three groups that make the most successful tricorders will split a $10 million prize. In 2005, Walter De Brouwer's 5-year-old son jumped out of a window and fell 36 feet to the ground. After a year in emergency rooms, operating rooms and the ICU, De Brouwer had a whole new perspective on hospitals. He saw firsthand how powerless patients often were. Inspired by the less invasive medical devices from science fiction, he moved to Silicon Valley and started Scanadu. "" 'Star Trek' was not TV, it was a business plan,"" said 57-year-old De Brouwer. Scanadu is already close to having working prototypes of its tricorder system. In addition to the Scanaflo (a single-use urine test) the company has created the Scanadu Scout, a palm-sized disc you press to your forehead or temple for 10 seconds to take vital signs, including blood pressure, temperature, heart and respiratory rate. The readings are imported to a smartphone, analyzed and tracked over time. De Brouwer's vision is to have a constant collection of data that creates a baseline for each user. That information will allow the Scanadu app to detect issues early, even before there are noticeable symptoms. These types of devices are not meant to replace doctors, but to fill in when in-person medical care is not available, affordable or necessary. Every day, Dr. Basil Harris sees patients who have waited too long to seek treatment, often because they lack insurance or a primary care giver. There's a steady stream of them at the Chicago emergency room where he works, showing up days after the first symptoms of serious illnesses. Harris, who also has a Ph.D. in engineering, leads the Tricorder X Prize finalist team Final Frontier Medical Devices. His tricorder combines a regular tablet computer with a separate Bluetooth gadget that takes vitals and runs other tests. The companion tablet app walks the patient through the same types of questions Harris asks every patient who comes into his ER. ""It does everything you would expect a normal physician to do,"" said Harris. ""What an ER doctor does is make diagnoses. Doing that is somewhat an art and somewhat science."" His team is also working on a novel approach to a neurological exam. Using the tablet, they can test users' vision, picking up on subtle defects caused by illness. For example, if a person has suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke, they might lose some vision on just one side. The tests could detect the issue and tell the person to seek medical help immediately, cutting down on the chance of permanent disability. Inventing a new medical device is only the first step to getting it into the hands of real people. Perhaps even more useful than the money is how the X Prize is working with the Food and Drug Administration. Getting regulatory compliance for a new product is notoriously difficult and expensive, and it requires clinical trials. But the FDA is working closely with the X Prize organization. The X Prize will also manage the vigorous final tests that determine which devices will win. Each team must produce 30 working prototypes of their tricorders for consumer testers. They'll be used and reviewed by people who have one of the conditions the tricorders are required to detect. The final teams hail from six countries. They include doctors, engineers, undergrads, entrepreneurs and researchers, and all have unique approaches to the technology. Many, like Scanadu, Final Frontier and Slovenian team MESI Simplifying Diagnostics, are creating small gadgets that work with existing mobile devices. Some are taking a more traditional approach with things like blood pressure cuffs and finger pricks. The Danvantri team from India is working on a low-cost device worn around the neck specifically for developing countries. One thing they all agree on is that this technology's time is now. ""This device, whether it's mine or someone else's, is coming,"" said Harris. ""It puts the information in the hands of the consumer where they can make actionable decisions. It really levels the playing field.""","Contest seeks a real tricorder that can measure vital signs and detect illnesses .

"The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that it was loosening restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug Avandia ""to reflect new information regarding the cardiovascular risk."" An advisory panel voted in June to recommend loosening restrictions put in place in 2010, when the FDA limited Avandia use to patients with type 2 diabetes who could not control their illness with other medications. That decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking Avandia, most notably a 2007 analysis by Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, showing a 43% increase in heart attacks. The finding led the FDA to order GlaxoSmithKline, the drug's maker, to conduct a thorough study of its safety. The full results of that study, known as RECORD, were made public in 2009. Results from RECORD ""showed no elevated risk of heart attack or death in patients being treated with Avandia when compared to standard-of-care diabetes drugs,"" the FDA said in a statement Monday. ""These data do not confirm the signal of increased risk of heart attacks that was found in a meta-analysis of clinical trials first reported in 2007."" ""Our actions today reflect the most current scientific knowledge about the risks and benefits of this drug,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the statement. ""Given these new results, our level of concern is considerably reduced; thus, we are requiring the removal of certain prescribing restrictions."" Video: FDA restricts diabetes drug Avandia . Although GlaxoSmithKline said the safety data were reassuring, the study was heavily criticized by Dr. Thomas Marciniak, an FDA scientist who reviewed the data and said the company ignored several cases of patients who suffered severe adverse effects. Because there were multiple conflicting signals of cardiovascular risk associated with the drug, Woodcock recommended that Glaxo commission an outside independent group to review RECORD's results. GSK chose the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-examine the data and held a June hearing on the results. The institute's associate director, Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, said that it performed a comprehensive review and that its data were consistent with the RECORD results. In June, some members of the FDA panel questioned the severity of the current restrictions and the scope of cardiovascular events caused by taking the drug. ""I am considerably reassured ... that the magnitude of risk is not great,"" said Dr. Dale Hammerschmidt, one of the panelists who voted to modify the warning. He added that he thought the current warning was more severe than necessary but should not be removed entirely. As of June, only 3,000 patients in the United States were registered to take Avandia, according to GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman Mary Ann Rhyne. That's compared with the 120,000 patients taking the drug in 2010 before the restrictions were put in place.","Restrictions on Avandia were put in place in 2010 .

"Days after he left a nursing home, radio icon Casey Kasem was the subject of a welfare check at a residence in Washington state, officials said Thursday. Kitsap County sheriff's deputies went to an address provided by California Adult Protective Services, Scott Wilson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told CNN. Authorities on Tuesday afternoon found Casey Kasem and his wife, Jean, visiting longtime friends at the home. The couple was staying there on vacation, Wilson said. After staying 40 minutes and determining that Kasem was alert, not in distress and was receiving appropriate care, the deputies left. Kitsap County authorities would not release the address where they found Kasem, citing privacy reasons. The county is just west of Seattle. ""We are grateful to local authorities for finding my Dad. We are one step closer to bringing him home,"" daughter Kerri Kasem said in a statement Wednesday night. The family still has ""grave concerns about his medical care,"" the daughter's representative said in the statement. ""The Kasem family will do everything in their power to bring their father home,"" Danny Deraney said. Family members, judge concerned . New guardianship . Kasem, 82, is suffering from Lewy body disease -- a common cause of dementia, a spokesman for his daughter told CNN on Tuesday. On Monday, a judge named Kerri Kasem the temporary conservator until a June 20 hearing. But she hadn't been able to take on the responsibility without knowing where he was. Kerri Kasem has said she feared her father may have been taken out of the country. Kerri and her sister, Julie Kasem, told CNN they last visited their father a week ago in the California nursing home where he was staying. When the daughters' attorney, Troy Martin, called the day after the visit to check up on Kasem, he was told by the nursing home that he had been removed overnight, Martin told CNN. When asked whether there had been any wrongdoing in the Washington state visit, Wilson said: ""They're free adults. They can travel where they want."" Daughters vs. wife . Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, filed an earlier conservatorship petition claiming the retired radio host ""has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family"" by his wife. ""We tried everything to get her to let us see him when she stopped bringing him over to the house,"" Kerri Kasem told CNN in December. ""She had an assistant bring him over to the house so we could see him every weekend. She stopped. My sister went there, knocked on the door, and she was escorted off the property."" But the wife gave a very different take on the ordeal last November. ""These children single-handedly and irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter, the calm of their home and their neighborhood by engaging in uncalled for public demonstrations and personal attacks in the media,"" she said in court papers, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. ""They are doing so with a professionally orchestrated media and legal campaign that has disgraced their father and vilified their stepmother."" Last year, a judge ruled that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife. The judge denied a request by Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed. Attempts to contact Jean Kasem's attorney this week have been unsuccessful. Jean Kasem, 60 this year, was an actress with roles in ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Cheers."" Decades of fame . Casey Kasem, who hosted radio music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40"" for decades, retired in 2009. Besides the famed countdown shows, Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby-Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before ""American Top 40"" began in 1970. His case has drawn attention to Lewy body dementia -- the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's, according to the Mayo Clinic.

"Is the President doing a good job handling the Ebola crisis? That's one question the Democratic senator running for reelection in Arkansas said is hard to answer. When faced with the question, Sen. Mark Pryor couldn't come up with an answer because, well, ""it's hard to know."" ""Umm ... I would say that ... it's hard to know, uh, because I haven't heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details -- I mean, I read the paper and all, but,"" Pryor said in an interview that aired Tuesday on MSNBC. Pryor, who is locked in a tight contest this fall, said he is of course aware of the efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contain the virus and the efforts of medical and engineering professionals fighting Ebola in West Africa. So what gives? Has Obama done enough? ""Umm ... again I'd have to see the latest numbers,"" Pryor said. Pryor's nonresponse comes just over a month after he attacked his opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, in an August ad that gave the Ebola crisis a starring role. After rolling news clips about the crisis, the ad claims Cotton ""voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola"" and ""cut billions from our nation's medical disaster and emergency programs."" Pryor's hesitation on judging Obama falls in a state where support for the President could hurt any Democratic candidate, as just 33% of Arkansans approve of the President's job performance overall. No poll has shown what Arkansans think of Obama's handling of the Ebola crisis. But maybe Pryor will get some sympathy from voters. They haven't made up their mind yet on whether to give him another term. A CNN/ORC poll last month showed the race a dead heat, with Cotton holding a 2-point advantage that didn't break the margin of error.","Judging Obama's handling of the Ebola crisis?

"A jury on Saturday night convicted a Florida man on four charges related to his shooting into an SUV full of teenagers during an argument over loud music, but could not decide on the most serious charge -- murder. Michael Dunn was found guilty on four charges, including three for attempted second-degree murder, which could land him behind bars for decades. Yet there was no verdict on the first-degree murder charge tied to the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. As the jury's decisions became clear about 7 p.m. Saturday, Dunn looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears. His lawyer, Cory Strolla, told reporters later that his client was ""in disbelief."" ""Even as he sat next to me, he asked, how is this happening,"" Strolla said. ""... It has not set in. I don't think it will set in anytime soon."" The incomplete finale to this emotional, hot-button trial -- partly because of the fact Dunn is white and the teenagers who were shot at, including Davis, are black -- echoed George Zimmerman's trial for the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin about 120 miles down the road in Sanford, Florida. While stand your ground wasn't used by Dunn, his lawyers did argue that he fired in self-defense. Given the partially hung jury, State Attorney Angela Corey said prosecutors would press for a new trial in Duval County on the murder charge. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" said Corey, whose office also handled the Zimmerman case. Even without a final decision on the murder count -- and pending defense appeals -- the 47-year-old Dunn is looking at a lengthy prison term. Prosecutor Erin Wolfson explained Saturday night that each attempted second-degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years. There's also a 15-year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting in the teenager's vehicle. ""You are looking at basically at life in prison,"" Strolla said, even as he vowed to challenge the convictions. ""At 47 years old, that's a life sentence regardless of count one."" The decision to convict on these counts, and not on murder, didn't come easily for a jury that had deliberated for about 30 hours since getting the case late Wednesday. Judge Russell Healey acknowledged earlier Saturday that the jury of four white women, two black women, four white men, an Asian woman and a Hispanic man was ""struggling, obviously."" ""But it's not for want of trying to reconcile all of this,"" he said then. ""I think we've got some analytical people in there who are trying to do just that -- trying to analyze this from every possible angle."" The lack of a murder conviction upset some, including protesters who marched outside the Jacksonville courthouse calling for Corey to lose her job. ""The people united will never be defeated,"" they also chanted. Yet Davis' mother, Lucia McBath, didn't express any anger when she addressed reporters Saturday night. Her family, she said, is ""so very happy to have just a little bit of closure."" ""It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him,"" McBath said. ""And I've asked my family to pray for him."" Confrontation at a gas station . It was November 23, 2012, when Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red Dodge Durango full of teenagers. The teens had pulled in for gum and cigarettes; Dunn, meanwhile, had just left his son's wedding with his fiancee, who'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips. Dunn didn't like the loud music -- ""rap crap,"" as he called it -- coming from the teens' SUV. So he asked them to turn it down. What followed next depends on whom you believe. Dunn claimed Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matter into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. But prosecutors asserted that it was Dunn who lost control, firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he didn't like. Prosecutors challenged what he did next: He left the gas station and drove 40 miles away to a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine. There, Dunn walked his dog, ordered a pizza, then drank rum and cola -- ""stunned and horrified, (shocked how) things escalated the way they did over a common courtesy."" After learning almost six hours later that he had killed Davis, Dunn testified that he became ""crazy with grief,"" experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he testified. ""It just worked out that way."" Yet his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun, a stick, a barrel or a lead pipe -- unlike what Dunn had said. In fact, police found a basketball, basketball shoes, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers' Durango, but no gun. And Dunn himself never called police. The first contacts he had with them were at his home in Satellite Beach -- 130 miles south of St. Augustine -- as he was being apprehended. Arguing that he wasn't in a rational state of mind, Dunn admitted, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why."" Echoes of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman . Some were quick to compare Dunn to George Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of Martin. Martin's own parents were among them, claiming Davis' killing is another reminder that, in Florida, ""racial profiling and stereotypes"" may serve as the basis for illegitimate fear ""and the shooting and killing of young teenagers."" But Dunn's defense attorney, Strolla, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases aren't so similar. There was a physical confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin, and police gave Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt about defending himself, Strolla said. ""My client did not wait to become that victim,"" he said. ""My client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger,"" he said. Though a weapon was never found, Strolla maintains the youths could have had one and somehow ditched in and around the gas station. Regardless, the key point was that Dunn believed they were armed and that his life was in danger. ""Now, does it sound irrational? Of course it sounds irrational. But have you ever been in that situation?"" the lawyer asked. After Saturday's night decision, it seems unlikely -- unless he wins on appeal -- that Dunn will ever be in that or many other situations again. Instead, spending the rest of his life in prison seems a more likely outcome. Strolla said on Saturday the four convictions leave him with regret, even as he said he couldn't immediately think of anything he'd do differently in the case. At the same time, the prosecution didn't manage a conviction on what was by far the biggest charge: first-degree murder. This mixed bag means that no one can fully celebrate the jury's decision. ""Everybody lost something in this,"" the lawyer said. His client ""will live to fight another day"" in court, but he and his loved ones are suffering now. Strolla acknowledged, too, the pain felt by Davis' family. Especially on Sunday, which would have been Davis' 19th birthday.","""You are looking at basically at life in prison,"" Dunn's lawyer says .

"Argentinian lawmakers passed a new measure Wednesday lowering the nation's voting age to 16. Representatives in the South American country's lower house overwhelmingly voted in favor of the law Wednesday. A majority of senators approved it last week. The move to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 comes a year before a key mid-term election in  Argentina, and some critics have said it's an attempt by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her party to garner more votes.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Boston Herald and its cartoonist apologized Wednesday for a cartoon that quickly drew criticism on social media for being racist. A satire on the recent news that an intruder got farther into the White House last month than previously known, the cartoon depicts the intruder sitting in President Obama's bathtub, asking him if he has tried the ""watermelon flavored toothpaste."" Critics quickly pounced on the watermelon aspect of the cartoon, arguing the cartoonist was playing off a stereotype that African Americans are particularly fond of the fruit. The cartoonist, Jerry Holbert, said on Boston Herald Radio the watermelon reference was inadvertent. He argued he was ""naive"" about any racial undertones and ""wasn't thinking along those lines at all."" Holbert said he used the watermelon flavor because he found ""kids Colgate watermelon flavor"" toothpaste in his bathroom at home. ""I want to apologize to anyone I offended who was hurt by the cartoon,"" Holbert said. ""It was certainly, absolutely, not my intention."" The Herald also issued an apology: ""His cartoon satirizing the U.S. Secret Service breach at the White House has offended some people and to them we apologize. His choice of imagery was absolutely not meant to be hurtful. We stand by Jerry, who is a veteran cartoonist with the utmost integrity."" A syndicated version of the cartoon uses the term ""raspberry"" instead of watermelon. Holbert said the syndicate called him Tuesday night asking if they could change the flavor. Pressed Wednesday on whether Holbert should have called the Herald after his talk with the syndicate, Holbert said, ""I wish I had done that.""","The Boston Herald cartoon was published Wednesday.

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor, a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000. A former Alaskan lawmaker says it seems unlikely that Gov. Sarah Palin was unaware of Wasilla's policy. Former state Rep. Eric Croft, a Democrat, sponsored a state law requiring cities to provide the examinations free of charge to victims. He said the only ongoing resistance he met was from Wasilla, where Palin was mayor from 1996 to 2002. ""It was one of those things everyone could agree on except Wasilla,"" Croft told CNN. ""We couldn't convince the chief of police to stop charging them."" Alaska's Legislature in 2000 banned the practice of charging women for rape exam kits -- which experts said could cost up to $1,000. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president, often talks about her experience running Wasilla, population approximately 7,000, and that has prompted close scrutiny of her record there. Wasilla's practice of charging victims for their rape exams while she was mayor has gotten wide circulation on the Internet and in the mainstream media.  Watch CNN's Jessica Yellin check the facts in Wasilla » . Some supporters of Palin say they believe she had no knowledge of the practice. But critics call it ""outrageous"" and question Palin's commitment to helping women who are the victims of violence. For years, Alaska has had the worst record of any state in rape and in murder of women by men. The rape rate in Alaska is 2.5 times the national average. Interviews and a review of records turned up no evidence that Palin knew that  rape victims were being charged in her town. But Croft, the former state representative who sponsored the law changing the practice, says it seems unlikely Palin was not aware of the issue. ""I find it hard to believe that for six months a small town, a police chief, would lead the fight against a statewide piece of legislation receiving unanimous support and the mayor not know about it,"" Croft said. During the time Palin was mayor of Wasilla, her city was not the only one in Alaska charging rape victims. Experts testified before the Legislature that in a handful of small cities across Alaska, law enforcement agencies were charging victims or their insurance ""more than sporadically."" One woman who wrote in support of the legislation says she was charged for her rape exam by a police department in the city of Juneau, which is hundreds of miles from Wasilla. But Wasilla stood out. Tara Henry, a forensic nurse who has been treating rape victims across Alaska for the last 12 years, told CNN that opposition to Croft's bill from Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon was memorable. ""Several municipal law enforcement agencies in the state did have trouble budgeting and paying for the evidence collection for sexual assault victims,""  Henry said. ""What I recall is that the chief of police in the Wasilla police department seemed to be the most vocal about how it was going to affect their budget."" Croft has a similar memory. He said victims' advocates suggested he introduce legislation as a way to shame cities into changing their practice, and Wasilla resisted. ""I remember they had continued opposition,"" Croft said. ""It was eight years ago now, but they were sort of unrepentant that they thought the taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for that."" He does not recall discussing the issue with then-Mayor Palin. The bill, HB270, was before the legislature for six months. In testimony, one expert called the practice of billing the victim ""incomprehensible."" Others compared it to ""dust[ing] for fingerprints"" after a burglary, only ""the victim's body is the crime scene."" During a rape exam, the victim removes her clothing and a medical professional gathers DNA evidence from her body. There is also a medical component to assess her injuries. That component has led some law enforcement agencies to balk at paying. Henry, the forensic nurse, said charging victims ""retraumatizes them."" ""Asking them to pay for something law enforcement needs in order to investigate their case, it's almost like blaming them for getting sexually assaulted,"" she said. The Alaska Legislature agreed. The bill passed unanimously with the support of the Alaska Department of Public Safety, the Alaska Peace Officers Association and more than two dozen co-sponsors. After it became law, Wasilla's police chief told the local paper, The Frontiersman, that it would cost the city $5,000 to $14,000 a year -- money that he'd have to find. ""In the past, we've charged the cost of the exams to the victim's insurance company when possible,"" Fannon was quoted as saying. ""I just don't want to see any more burden on the taxpayer."" He suggested the criminals should pay as restitution if and when they're convicted. Repeated attempts to reach Fannon for comment were unsuccessful. Judy Patrick, who was Palin's deputy mayor and friend, blames the state. ""The bigger picture of what was going on at the time was that the state was trying to cut their own budget, and one of the things that they were doing was passing on costs to cities, and that was one of the many things that they were passing on, the cost to the city,"" said Patrick, who recalls enormous pressure to keep the city's budget down. But the state was never responsible for paying the costs of local investigations. Patrick was also a member of Wasilla City Council, and she doesn't recall the issue coming before council members, nor does she remember discussing the issue with Palin. She does recall Palin going through the budget in detail. She said Palin would review each department's budget line by line and send it back to department heads with her changes. ""Sarah is a fiscal conservative, and so she had seen that the city was heading in a direction of bigger projects, costing taxpayers more money, and she was determined to change that,"" Patrick said. Before Palin came to City Hall, the Wasilla Police Department paid for rape kits out of a fund for miscellaneous costs, according to the police chief who preceded Fannon and was fired by Palin. That budget line was cut by more than half during Palin's tenure, but it did not specifically mention rape exams. In a statement, Jill Hazelbaker, communications director for Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, said that ""to imply that Gov. Palin is or has ever been an advocate of charging victims for evidence gathering kits is an utter distortion of reality."" ""As her record shows, Gov. Palin is committed to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice,"" Hazelbaker said. ""She does not, nor has she ever believed that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence gathering test."" Those who fought the policy are unconvinced. ""It's incomprehensible to me that this could be a rogue police chief and not a policy decision. It lasted too long and it was too high-profile,"" Croft said. The rape kit charges have become an issue among Palin critics who say as governor she has not done enough to combat Alaska's epidemic problem of violence against women. They point to a small funding increase for domestic violence shelters at a time when Alaska has a multibillion-dollar budget surplus. Victims' advocates say that services are lacking and that Palin cut funding for a number of programs that treat female victims of violence. In the past week, Alaska's challenges with sexual assault have been in the spotlight again -- in connection with an ongoing inquiry into whether Palin abused her power by firing the head of Alaska's Department of Public Safety. Palin's office released e-mails showing that one area of disagreement between her and Department of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan was his lobbying in Washington for $30 million to fund a new program of sexual assault response teams. The McCain-Palin campaign insists that fighting domestic violence and sexual assault are priorities for Palin. And they say she has been looking at other programs to support. As governor, Palin approved a funding increase for domestic violence shelters -- $266,200 over two years. And she reauthorized a Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.","While Sarah Palin was mayor, Wasilla charged victims for their rape exams .

"Washington (CNN) -- Dashing the hopes of Democratic lawmakers Sunday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman signaled he would oppose a health care bill that includes a proposal to expand Medicare to people as young as 55. The independent Connecticut senator has told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, that he would vote against the Medicare at 55 proposal. He also said he would oppose cloture and work with the GOP if it ends up in the final version of the bill, two Democratic sources told CNN Sunday. Unanimous Republican opposition so far means Senate Democrats need all 60 votes in their caucus, which includes Lieberman, to pass the sweeping bill. Earlier, on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Lieberman and moderate Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska cited necessary changes to the bill before they would vote for it. Lieberman outlined steps that he said would ensure the bill passes the Senate with support from Democrats and some Republicans. Forget about the government-run public health insurance option, Lieberman said, as well as the Medicare measure that was proposed last week as part of a package of alternatives to the public option. Lieberman's other conditions were eliminating a government insurance program focused on home health care for the disabled and strengthening cost-containment provisions. ""We don't need to keep adding on to the back of this horse until the horse breaks down and we get nothing done,"" Lieberman said. A senior Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that the ""Democratic leadership was shocked about how strident Lieberman was in his opposition to the Medicare proposal when he went on the Sunday shows."" However, Lieberman spokesman Marshall Whitmann said the senator first informed Reid on Friday that he had concerns about the Medicare 55 buy-in and ""reaffirmed it today."" Reid spend the afternoon trying to get the 60 votes, according to the aide, who said Democrats still believe the Senate can produce a bill by Christmas but acknowledged that they might have to look elsewhere for the 60 votes. Nelson said he cannot support the Senate bill without tighter restrictions on federal funding for abortion. The Senate last week defeated an amendment proposed by Nelson and two other senators that would adopt the tougher language contained in the House health care bill. A compromise on the abortion language is possible, said Nelson, one of 10 Senate Democrats who negotiated in private last week to seek a compromise to the equally controversial public option. The negotiators reached a tentative agreement on alternatives, including the Medicare expansion to people 55 and older who lack health insurance, as well as allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage under government supervision. Their agreement, hailed by President Obama and Democratic leaders as an important step forward, still must be analyzed for its total cost by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Several Democrats said Sunday they would decide on the compromise once they get the CBO analysis. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also on ""Face the Nation,"" signaled continuing opposition to any health care bill even if Democrats settle their differences. ""We do not believe this bill, this nearly 2,100-page monstrosity, is real health care reform,"" McConnell said. Most Democrats support the public option as a nonprofit competitor to private insurers that would expand coverage and bring down prices. Republicans and some moderate Democrats, along with the health insurance industry, oppose the public option, saying it would be a first step toward a government takeover of the entire health care system. The fate of the health care bill could hinge on the votes of as few as one senator from each party. If Democrats can get 59 of their 60 caucus members to support the bill -- for example, by changing the abortion language to secure Nelson's vote -- they can focus on gaining the vote of moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who has signaled an openness to compromise. If the Senate eventually passes a health care bill, its version will have to be merged by a conference committee with the House version passed last month. The final bill would then need approval from both chambers before going to Obama to be signed into law. The president and Democratic leaders have said they want the bill completed this year. The Senate would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Sen.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Four more deaths have been confirmed by German health officials Friday bringing the total number of European deaths from an E. coli outbreak to 31. All but one were in Germany. According to German health authorities the bacteria has been traced to sprouts found in a North Rhine-Westphalia household in western Germany. This is the first time the actual bacteria has been found in produce. The number of people infected with E. coli now stands at 2,988, of whom 759 have the severe form of the intestinal illness. Though the rate of infection is slowing, officials at the Robert Koch Institute said the number of infections will continue to rise. A spokesman for the German ministry of consumer affairs said sprouts were tested in the home when two members of the family became infected after eating the sprouts. The vegetables in question seem to originate from a farm in Northern Germany that has already been linked to the outbreak, ministry spokesman Stephan Melessa. Investigators determined bean sprouts were the cause of the outbreak after 17 people became ill after eating at the same restaurant, Reinhard Burger, president of the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters. Authorities questioned people about what they ate and asked the cooks where the ingredients came from, Burger said. The common denominator, he said, was only those who ate food containing the sprouts became ill. Farmers in Spain, France, Holland and Belgium have been seeking compensation for their losses. The European Commission has proposed that the European Union pay about $300 million, but Spain alone claims about $600 million in losses. In Spain, the fresh produce exporter Frunet filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit by a Spanish company against the Hamburg state government over its earlier allegations that Spanish products were to blame for the E.coli outbreak. The complaint, filed Thursday in Hamburg, demands the immediate release of all laboratory tests and other documentation that Hamburg officials used when they blamed -- wrongly it turns out -- Frunet's organic cucumbers as a source of the outbreak, Frunet's owner, Antonio Lavao, told CNN by phone on Friday. Frunet, based in Spain's southern Malaga province, expects to file another lawsuit against the Hamburg state government seeking 1 million euros ($144 million) in losses from fresh produce it had to destroy, Lavao said. ""My company was named specifically"" by German authorities, Lavao said. His exports remain blocked because even as German and European Commission officials have cleared Spanish cucumbers generally of any link to the outbreak, there remains suspicion among his clients since his firm was identified, wrongly, as a source of the bacteria, he said. ""We don't want to be collateral damage. We want a specific rectification,"" Lavao said. The lawsuit is the first of its kind by a Spanish company against German authorities, said Jose Maria Pozancos, managing director of Spain's fresh produce export federation Fepex. Frunet grows relatively few cucumbers; its speciality is premium tomatoes for export. Lavao said he was not confident that his firm would receive any public compensation, which is why it filed the lawsuit against German authorities. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","NEW: Contaminated sprouts found in west German home .

"The Pentagon is considering under what circumstances it will recommend President Barack Obama authorize the use of a missile-equipped drone to kill the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, CNN has learned. Any such mission to kill al-Baghdadi would have to be approved by Obama, according to several defense officials CNN has spoken to at length. All of the officials have direct knowledge of the intelligence gathering efforts in Iraq, but declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information. ""He is a person of great interest to us,"" one defense official told CNN. If the U.S. military were to recommend a drone strike against al-Baghdadi, there would have to be specific and detailed intelligence showing his location at the moment of a strike and  intelligence to assure that civilians would not be at risk.  In order to launch a kill mission, the U.S. has to demonstrate the target poses a threat to the U.S. Al-Baghdadi's ISIS organization does threaten the U.S. Embassy and U.S. citizens in Iraq, according to U.S. officials. It is also possible the U.S. could turn the information over to the Iraq government for it to conduct a capture or kill mission against the ISIS leader on its own. Another point of consideration would be the impact of a U.S. strike on the situation in Iraq and whether the U.S. would be seen by Sunnis as siding with the Shiite-led government. Al-Baghdadi already has a $10 million bounty on his head from the U.S. government's Reward for Justice program, which offers multi-million dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of certain high value terrorists around the world.   Last week, al-Baghdadi made a very public appearance at a prominent mosque in northern Iraq. Eyewitnesses said he drove up to the mosque in a large convoy and remained surrounded by civilians. But U.S. officials said capturing al-Baghdadi would be difficult because the U.S. military does not have combat troops on the ground in either Iraq or Syria, where al-Baghdadi and ISIS are known to operate. In addition, any covert capture mission by U.S. special forces or law enforcement inside Iraq could be seen as violating Iraq's sovereignty, though such a mission remains possible. That means al-Baghdadi is essentially on a U.S. ""kill list"" even though such a list in Syria and Iraq has never been openly acknowledged. Under U.S. policy, lethal drone attacks are generally authorized when there is no reasonable possibility of capturing a suspect. The possibility comes as part of the U.S. military effort to gather intelligence on so-called ""high value targets"" in Iraq and continues to collect intelligence for targeting airstrikes in Iraq. The targets fall into three categories, the officials said. They include information for  striking ""high value targets"" like al-Baghdadi; protection of key infrastructure such as the Haditha Dam; and blunting major ISIS offensives against Baghdad. Airstrikes by either drones or manned aircraft would have to be approved by the President. There are also electronic intercepts being conducted, according to one U.S. official. In recent days the U.S. military has again increased its reconnaissance missions over Iraq from the 30 missions a day it was conducting. ""It's up around 50 right now. And it's stayed there for a good many days,"" according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary. Who is the ISIS?

"Odd Future has no future in New Zealand -- at least for now. Immigration authorities there have barred the rap group from entering the country, saying that the group ""has been deemed to be a potential threat to public order."" Six performers from the group were set to be the opening act for rapper Eminem during a tour there later this month. ""Odd Future has been deemed to be a potential threat to public order and the public interest for several reasons, including incidents at past performances in which they have incited violence,"" Immigration New Zealand said in a statement. Karen Urwin, border operations manager for Immigration New Zealand, pointed to an incident in 2011 at an Odd Future concert in the United States that left a police officer hospitalized. Urwin also said that the group's leader, Tyler the Creator, riled up his fans last year against an Australian woman who had been part of an effort by a feminist group to have his visa revoked. He rewteeted her tweets, which led to threats and harassment, media reports say. The group, whose full name is Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, has been criticized by feminists for what they call misogynist lyrics. Urwin said it is the first time that the regulations have been used to keep a performer out of the country. ""It's a section in our legislation we don't use very often, but they are clearly on the extreme edge of the music spectrum"" she said, explaining that the law is more commonly used to block the entry of Holocaust deniers, Hells Angels bikers or hard-line Muslim preachers. Tyler the Creator fired back on Twitter. ""They said we were 'terrorist threats and bad for the society' or whatever,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Sick."" He went on to point out what he saw as a bit of hypocrisy by the government. ""The irony is that, we cant get in to open for Eminem.  HAHAHAHA, like he didn't make 'Kill You' or 'Kim',"" he wrote.  ""HAHAHAHAHA"" But he went on to say that although he was down on the government, he still ""loves NZ."" And Urwin said that this wasn't a lifetime ban. ""We would entertain the idea of having them come back,"" she said ""As long as they change the direction of some of their message and mellow their attitude.""","Odd Future are ""deemed to be a potential threat to public order,"" immigration service says .

"Lucifer cannot be born in New Zealand. And there's no place for Christ or a Messiah either. In New Zealand, parents have to run by the government any name they want to bestow on their baby. And each year, there's a bevy of unusual ones too bizarre to pass the taste test. The country's Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages shared that growing list with CNN on Wednesday. Four words: . What were they thinking? In the past 12 years, the agency had to turn down not one, not two, but six sets of parents who wanted to name their child ""Lucifer."" Also shot down were parents who wanted to grace their child with the name ""Messiah."" That happened twice. ""Christ,"" too, was rejected. Specific rules . As the agency put it, acceptable names must not cause offense to a reasonable person, not be unreasonably long and should not resemble an official title and rank. It's no surprise then that the names nixed most often since 2001 are ""Justice"" (62 times) and ""King"" (31 times). Some of the other entries scored points in the creativity department -- but clearly didn't take into account the lifetime of pain they'd bring. ""Mafia No Fear."" ""4Real."" ""Anal."" Oh, come on! Then there were the parents who preferred brevity through punctuation. The ones who picked '""*"" (the asterisk) or '"".""(period). Slipping through . Still, some quirky names do make it through. In 2008, the country made made international news when the naming agency allowed a set of twins to be named ' ""Benson"" and ""Hedges"" -- a popular cigarette brand -- and OK'd the names ""Violence"" and ""Number 16 Bus Shelter."" Asked about those examples, Michael Mead of the Internal Affairs Department (under which the agency falls) said, ""All names registered with the Department since 1995 have conformed to these rules."" And what happens when parents don't conform? Four years ago, a 9-year-old girl was taken away from her parents by the state so that her name could be changed from ""Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii."" Not alone . To be sure, New Zealand is not the only country to act as editor for some parent's wacky ideas. Sweden also has a naming law and has nixed attempts to name children ""Superman,"" ""Metallica,"" and the oh-so-easy-to-pronounce ""Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116."" In 2009, the Dominican Republic contemplated banning unusual names after a host of parents began naming their children after cars or fruit. In the United States, however, naming fights have centered on adults. In 2008, a judge allowed an Illinois school bus driver to legally change his first name to ""In God"" and his last name to ""We Trust.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration will not support a policy of taxing drivers based on their mileage, the Transportation Department said Friday after a published interview in which Secretary Ray LaHood called it an idea ""we should look at."" The mileage tax idea involves tracking drivers through GPS units in their cars. In a written statement, the department said, ""The policy of taxing motorists based on how many miles they have traveled is not and will not be Obama administration policy."" The idea -- which involves tracking drivers through Global Positioning System (GPS) units in their cars -- is gaining support in some states as a way of making up for a shortfall in highway funding. Oregon carried out a pilot program and deemed it ""successful."" Speaking to The Associated Press, Transportation Secretary LaHood, an Illinois Republican, said, ""We should look at the vehicular miles program where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled."" The remark was part of a discussion about various options to help make up for the highway funding shortfall on the federal level. When contacted by CNN, the Transportation Department said LaHood was unavailable. A spokeswoman provided the department's statement and said she could not elaborate. Officials in Massachusetts told CNN this week that there has been talk of proposing such a system for the state. Colin Durant, a spokesman for Gov. Deval Patrick, said ""privacy would be our top priority."" Patrick on Friday announced a different plan to help raise highway funds: a 19-cent increase in the state's gas tax. But he said that alone ""will not solve all our challenges,"" and some ""major reforms"" will be needed. Under a VMT (vehicle miles traveled) tax program, GPS units would allow the government to keep track of how much each car is driven and where -- though not necessarily with exact street locations. The government could also track other things, including the time each car enters a certain zone. For decades, the fuel taxes that drivers pay at the pump have been the central source of federal and state funding for roads and bridges. But they are no longer nearly enough. Last fall, Congress approved an $8 billion infusion into the depleted federal highway trust fund. The problem stems in part from something good: More and more Americans are buying vehicles that have better gas mileage. That means less gas tax money from each car, though the car is causing the same amount of wear and tear on the roads. Officials including LaHood have opposed raising the national gas tax, particularly in the current recession, and have said a new system is needed. A report by the Oregon Department of Public Transportation, published in November 2007, said a ""Road User Fee Pilot Program"" found that a VMT tax is ""viable."" ""Privacy is protected,"" the report argued, saying the pilot program included ""engineering requirements to maintain as much privacy as practicable while still allowing a feasible way to audit and challenge billings."" ""No specific vehicle point location or trip data could be stored or transmitted"" in the pilot program, and ""the only centrally stored data needed to assess mileage fees were vehicle identification, zone mileage totals for each vehicle and the amount of fuel purchased."" Some officials support using tracking zones and times of day in determining a VMT tax, so that more would be charged for driving on crowded roads during rush hour. But some people across the country have spoken up against a VMT tax. ""Is this a good idea? In a word, no,"" columnist Glenn Reynolds wrote in January for Popular Mechanics. ""At best, it's overcomplicated and intrusive. At worst, it's a threat to privacy and the environment."" Reynolds added, ""Gas taxes are a pretty good proxy for road usage -- the more you drive, the more gas you burn -- and there's a bonus: Gas taxes encourage people to use less gas. ... A mileage tax, presumably, doesn't care whether you're driving a Prius or a Hummer, giving no incentive to save."" The Civitas Institute in North Carolina -- which describes itself as standing for ""liberty and prosperity derived from limited government"" -- said it carried out a poll in North Carolina and found that voters disapprove of the idea. A federal blue-ribbon panel plans to issue a report next week on ways the country can make up for its highway funding shortfall. Other possibilities include tolls, higher registration fees and other types of taxes. In its interim report, the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission said new technologies could allow for a mileage gas tax that would take into account the type of vehicle and level of emissions. Programs of that type are being developed in other countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, the report said. It added, ""Such programs may not be ripe for widespread implementation in the U.S. yet, but are maturing rapidly."" CNN's Kara Yates contributed to this report.","Mileage tax idea would use GPS in cars to track drivers' usage .

"If you're rich and want to give money to a lot of political campaigns, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that you can. The 5-4 ruling eliminated limits on how much money people can donate in total in one election season. However, the decision left intact the current $5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle. Until now, an individual donor could give up to $123,200 per cycle. The ruling means a wealthy liberal or conservative donor can give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country, as long as no candidate receives more than the $5,200 cap. While most people lack the money to make such a large total donation to election campaigns, the ruling clears the way for more private money to enter the system. In effect, it expands the loosening of campaign finance laws that occurred with the high court's Citizens United decision in 2010 that eased campaign spending by outside groups. Are campaign donations a form of free speech? At issue was whether limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act on overall -- or aggregate -- campaign spending by individuals violate the First Amendment rights of contributors. ""We conclude that the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this court accepted as legitimate"" in a 1976 ruling, said Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion of the court's conservative majority. ""They instead intrude without justification on a citizen's ability to exercise the most fundamental First Amendment activities."" In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the majority opinion will have the effect of creating ""huge loopholes in the law; and that undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of campaign finance reform."" Republican leaders hailed the decision as an affirmation of free expression rights. ""It does not permit one more dime to be given to an individual candidate or a party -- it just respects the constitutional rights of individuals to decide how many to support,"" said Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. However, congressional supporters of tougher campaign finance laws expressed concern about more private money influencing elections. ""I am concerned that today's ruling may represent the latest step in an effort by a majority of the court to dismantle entirely the longstanding structure of campaign finance law erected to limit the undue influence of special interests on American politics,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform. New campaign finance reform? Some legislators called for new campaign finance legislation in response to the ruling, but such reforms appeared impossible in an election year. Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would hold a hearing on the impact of ""alarming Supreme Court decisions that have eviscerated our campaign finance laws."" Another top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, warned of further erosion of limits on special interest influence in elections. ""This in itself is a small step, but another step on the road to ruination,"" Schumer said. ""It could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it."" The case involved Shaun McCutcheon, the owner of an Alabama electrical engineering company, with support from the Republican National Committee. They objected to a 1970s Watergate-era law restricting someone from giving no more than $48,600 to federal candidates, and $74,600 to political action committees during a two-year election cycle, for a maximum of $123,200. McCutcheon argued he had a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wanted, as long as no single candidate got more than the $5,200 per election limit ($2,600 for a primary election and another $2,600 for a general election). ""Spending money on advertising, promoting ideas and supporting candidates is an exercise of our right to freedom of speech,"" McCutcheon told CNN on Wednesday after the ruling came out. Preventing corruption . Supporters of the limits struck down Wednesday said the law prevented corruption or the appearance of corruption. Without the limits, they argued, one well-heeled donor could in theory contribute to every federal race possible. The ruling leaves in place current donor limits to individual candidates, and donor disclosure requirements by candidates, political parties, and political action committees. ""What I think this means is that freedom of speech is being upheld,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""You all have the freedom to write what you want to write. Donors ought to have the freedom to give what they want to give."" But supporters of the limits expressed disappointment. ""The Supreme Court majority continued on its march to destroy the nation's campaign finance laws, which were enacted to prevent corruption and protect the integrity of our democracy,"" said Democracy 21 president Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate for election money reforms. ""The court re-created the system of legalized bribery today that existed during the Watergate days."" Congress passed the individual aggregate limits in the wake of the Watergate scandal, and the Supreme Court upheld them in 1976. The separate Citizens United case in 2010 dealt with campaign spending by outside groups seeking to influence federal elections. In that case, the conservative majority -- citing free speech concerns -- eased longstanding restrictions on campaign spending by corporations, labor unions, and certain nonprofit advocacy groups. The Citizens United ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections. It also led to further litigation seeking to loosen current restrictions on both spending and donations. What the ruling on campaign money means .","Supreme Court lifts limits on how much in total one person can donate .
Its 5-4 ruling means wealthy donors can give to as many campaigns as they want .
People can still only give a maximum of $5,200 to a single candidate .
Critics warn the ruling further undermines already weakened campaign finance laws ."

With a few random hairs protruding from his snout, a pair of squinty, beady eyes and thin, patchy skin, his genetics didn't do much for his exterior. But beauty isn't skin deep.

"Kezia and Mike Fitzgerald wish they had never seen the need to start their own business. They wish Kezia had never been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. They wish their daughter, Saoirse, had not joined Kezia in the hospital, to fight her own battle against an aggressive tumor. They wish Saoirse had won. But wishing to change the past, the Fitzgeralds know, is useless. ""When our daughter died, Kezia and I took some time away and re-grouped our life,"" Mike said in a CNN iReport. ""We made the decision that we were going to focus on positive things and do positive things in our lives."" Double diagnoses . During her pregnancy in 2010, Kezia noticed swollen lymph nodes in her neck. She ignored them, because she had experienced swelling before during allergy season. They didn't ache, she said, just made her neck appear uneven. In June 2010, the Massachusetts couple became first-time parents to a healthy seven-pound baby they named Saoirse. But the swelling on the right side of Kezia's neck persisted. By January, her doctors determined the cause: stage three Hodgkin's lymphoma. The cancer had spread to Kezia's chest, neck and abdomen. Through her monthly chemotherapy, Kezia dealt with nausea and fatigue. But her treatment was going well, and the side effects were mild, so she thought the worst would soon be over. Then one April morning, she and her husband noticed that Saoirse wasn't wandering around as she normally would. Even more startling, her eyes were swollen and her eyelids were black, blue and yellow. ""It looked like she had been in a fight,"" Kezia said. Saoirse was also cranky and vomiting. She had swelling in both her ears and a bulge the size of an egg on her right temple. ""Her head looked like it was exploding,"" Mike said. They rushed her to the emergency room. For three weeks, pediatricians and neurosurgeons focused on her head, taking CT scans to see whether she had bleeding there. The scans came out clean. Finally, doctors found a neuroblastoma tumor in Saoirse's abdomen. She was in stage four. Neuroblastoma is one of the most common types of cancer for infants and children, behind leukemia and brain cancer. There are about 700 new cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. It is an aggressive malignant tumor that develops in infants and kids when their immature nerve cells turn into tumors instead of cells and fibers. A woman and her toddler fight dual cancers . When her father heard the news, he went numb. ""I thought, 'My God, I'm at risk of losing both of my family members, the two most important people in my life.' "" The cancer had spread throughout her tiny body, to her adrenal glands, bone marrow and ears. Saoirse needed chemotherapy right away. Now she and Kezia shared more than their blonde hair, bright blue eyes and love for peaches. A simple solution . Cancer didn't slow Saoirse down much. In between needles and diaper changes, the toddler wandered the halls of Boston Children's Hospital, toting her stuffed purple gorilla named Grape Ape. But the peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC line, doctors placed in Saoirse's arm to administer treatment kept getting in the way. The long flexible tube that was giving Saoirse essential nutrition and medications kept getting tangled. ""This new attached toy was now a drumstick, teething toy and something to tug on,"" Mike said. ""When we asked the nurse how to secure the lines and caps the only suggestion they had was to use a sock or tape."" When Saoirse developed a bad rash from the medical tape, her mother knew they needed a better option. Kezia loved to sew -- winter hats, diaper bags, you name it -- but her projects had fallen to the wayside with the family's hospital schedule. One night Kezia went home and dug out her sewing machine, grabbed some cotton knit fabric and created a sleeve that would hopefully secure Saoirse's line comfortably. It worked. The wrap held Saoirse's line in place without letting it dangle, causing any itchiness or pain. Saoirse went back to playing with her toys and ignored the PICC line. A few weeks later, when a doctor inserted a central chest line, Kezia replicated her efforts to create a chest wrap for the toddler. The wraps became a hit in the hospital ward. Nurses loved that they could access Saoirse's lines easily without taking off a bunch of tape. Parents asked Kezia to create more wraps for their kids. Mike filed a provisional application for a patent on the popular product, then went back to caring for his wife and child. ""Kezia would have much rather designed and sewed something else besides the wraps,"" Mike said. ""But she did what she had to do to help our child. It worked and we solved a problem."" Kezia's cancer went into remission in September 2011. Saoirse passed away a few months later. 'I love my CareAline' The Fitzgeralds took some time after Saoirse's death to grieve. But they knew they wanted to help other patients with the wraps Kezia had created. They spent most of 2012 finding a sewing contractor in Massachusetts and a fabric producer in California before launching CareAline Products, LLC. They now offer the wraps on their website and on Amazon.com. Patients can purchase individual wraps; hospitals and treatment facilities can buy them in bulk. So far two hospital groups have purchased CareAline products for their patients, Mike said. ""Breaking into the medical product community is challenging,"" he said. ""But with every challenge there seems to be an equal reward. ... While we still have a long way to go before we can call ourselves a success, we feel like we are headed in the right direction."" The Fitzgeralds are working on developing more products, Mike said, so that every patient with a catheter can be given a wrap to keep their line in line. ""We know how stressful it is when that line is first put in, and how much you have to learn to take care of it,"" he said. ""We don't think that any patient should have to search for their own solution like we did."" The couple wishes they never saw the need to start this company, but they're glad they did. They know it's the best way to honor their daughter, and her courageous battle against cancer. A little boy walked up to the Fitzgeralds' conference table in Cape Cod this summer and said, ""I love my CareAline."" It's still Mike's favorite ""review."" ""It made us feel like we had truly made a different in that little boy and his family's life.""","Kezia and Mike Fitzgerald's daughter was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma .

"It had to happen. After four weeks of dominance, ""The Hunger Games"" finally didn't finish first at the box office. Instead, the relationship comedy ""Think Like a Man"" took the crown as it debuted to an impressive $33 million this weekend. Based on comedian Steve Harvey's bestselling advice book ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,"" the PG-13 film performed much better than expected. (Although I predicted the movie would win the weekend, I thought it would do so with a moderate $19 million.) ""Think Like a Man"" was produced for just $13 million by Sony-owned Screen Gems, which was also behind two other pictures that premiered at No. 1 this year: ""The Vow"" and ""Underworld Awakening."" The studio's marketing campaign targeted African American audiences via appearances on Harvey's morning show, screenings at historically black universities, and special promotions on networks like BET. The effort clearly paid off. For instance, ""Think Like a Man,"" which was directed by Tim Story (""Fantastic Four""), opened stronger than all of Tyler Perry's movies except ""Madea Goes to Jail."" And like Perry's films, the movie skewed toward adult women, with 63 percent of the audience being female and 62 percent at least 30 years old. It received an excellent ""A"" rating from CinemaScore audiences. In second was the PG-13 romance ""The Lucky One"" with $22.8 million. That's a return to form for star Zac Efron, as the movie performed more like ""17 Again"" ($23.7 million) than ""Charlie St. Cloud"" ($12.4 million). It's also a solid showing for author Nicholas Sparks -- the only Sparks adaptation that opened stronger was 2010′s ""Dear John"" ($30.5 million). Despite unfavorable reviews, the $25 million movie earned a respectable ""B+"" grade from CinemaScore participants. Young women represented the majority of the film's audience, with 76 percent of ticket buyers being female and 52 percent under the age of 25. ""Chimpanzee,"" Disney's fourth annual Earth Day nature documentary, captured a solid $10.2 million -- enough for fourth place. That's the biggest opening weekend among the four Disneynature pictures, beating ""Earth,"" ""Oceans,"" and last year's ""African Cats."" (However, it's not an entirely fair comparison since ""Earth"" opened on a Wednesday.) As was the case with ""Think Like a Man"" and ""The Lucky One,"" the movie drew a predominately female crowd -- women made up 68 percent of the audience. And CinemaScore moviegoers gave ""Chimpanzee"" an overall ""A"" rating. On a curious note, 5 percent of CinemaScore participants said a main reason for attending the film was its ""lead actor."" Were they referring to the film's two lead apes? Or narrator Tim Allen? Even stranger, 1 percent listed ""lead actress"" as their reason for buying a ticket -- and that 1 percent gave the movie a harsh ""B-"" grade. Clearly those individuals were upset by the documentary's lack of actresses. Among holdovers, ""The Hunger Games"" slipped just 31 percent -- its smallest decline yet -- for $14.5 million, pushing its domestic tally to $356.9 million. The sci-fi thriller crossed $350 million on Saturday, reaching the milestone in 30 days. Only seven other movies have ever passed that mark in less time. And in fifth place, the PG-rated comedy ""The Three Stooges"" dropped 46 percent for $9.2 million. In limited release, the critically acclaimed music documentary ""Marley"" debuted to $260,000 at 42 locations for a sturdy per-theater average of $6,190. And the Lawrence Kasdan comedy ""Darling Companion,"" starring Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline, picked up $46,300 at four locations. 1. ""Think Like a Man"" -- $33.0 mil . 2. ""The Lucky One"" -- $22.8 mil . 3. ""The Hunger Games"" -- $14.5 mil . 4. ""Chimpanzee"" -- $10.2 mil . 5. ""The Three Stooges"" -- $9.2 mil .

"Arieo Gonzalez had been waiting for an Xbox One since 1 p.m. Thursday. Brian Miller, in his own way, had been waiting since June. Both walked away from a Best Buy in Timonium, Maryland, early Friday with one of the newly released, next-generation gaming consoles from Microsoft. The box hit shelves a week after rival Sony's PlayStation 4, marking the official start of the latest battle in gaming's console wars. Console smackdown! PlayStation 4 vs. Xbox One . Miller, 40, who pre-ordered the Xbox One in June, said he loves everything Microsoft does. The Sparks, Maryland, resident prepared by playing his Xbox 360 ""into the ground"" with his 8-year-old daughter, Laci. ""We play co-op all the time whenever there is a chance,"" he said. ""I'm picking up 'Ryse' for myself. I'm getting 'Just Dance' for her. I can't wait to try out the new entertainment set up for it."" Arieo waited outside the store with his dad, Jose. The 13-year-old missed out on pre-ordering but didn't want to lose his chance for an Xbox One after making good grades in school and earning the right to get the console. ""I've only played Xbox 360 and didn't have the Kinect,"" Arieo said. ""This will be my first time, and I'm really looking forward to using it. Xbox One On!"" The Xbox One, which sells for $499, continues Microsoft's move toward making the console not just a gaming device but a central entertainment hub, too. With the Kinect voice and motion controller, users can call out favorite television shows or movies, split the TV screen between two different applications, or even record and share their gameplay with friends. Marc Whitten, corporate vice president of Xbox Live, said it's only the beginning of how Microsoft thinks people will use their consoles as home entertainment centers. ""One of the things that has been just so amazing for the Xbox One is the passion of the fans about play and Xbox Live,"" Whitten told CNN in a pre-midnight interview. ""Everything we do is really about how we build new experiences for them. It's awesome."" Whitten said Kinect, originally promoted as a tool for hands-free gaming, is increasingly becoming a focal point for the entire Xbox system. Jason Gelatka of Towson, Maryland, said the device is the biggest draw for him. ""It is more than just gaming. It is the multimedia experience,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to just calling out my movie or pulling up Netflix with my voice. It is a giant universal remote control."" Gelatka also pre-ordered his console this summer. He and his friends treated the midnight launch like opening night of a sports season or Hollywood blockbuster. ""We've been talking with each other, texting each other since we ordered. It really made the wait harder,"" Gelatka said. ""Today was the longest day ever."" Crowds rivaling those for last week's PlayStation 4 rollout lined up for the Xbox launch in 13 countries. In New York's Times Square, a concert featuring hip-hop artist Macklemore was part of the launch event. Early controversies, including concerns about the ability to resell and share games on the system, didn't appear to have hurt the turnout. But Miller said he was a bit bummed about the lack of a selection of games for launch, and Gelatka agreed. ""The Day One lineup of games is not fantastic,"" Gelatka said. ""I'm confident though. They haven't reached their peak and better games are out there waiting to be made. Xbox has always listened to what I wanted. That's why I'm getting the Xbox One.""","Big crowds greet Xbox One's midnight launch .

"(CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday night that the first time he spoke to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was in the summer of 2013. In the past, however, he has said otherwise. Last month, he said the two have known each other for ""the last five years."" In June of 2014, he said he first spoke to the Texas billionaire when he was running for governor for the first time in 2009. Why does it matter? Normally, it wouldn't. But when Christie went to the Cowboys playoff game against the Detroit Lions in Dallas earlier this month -- remember, the one with THE hug? -- his ticket and transportation were paid for by Jones. As it turns out, Jones partially owns a company that was awarded a Port Authority contract by New Jersey and New York in March 2013. So that's why reporters have been trying to nail down just when exactly Christie and Jones started their now famous bromance. Did they meet before or after that contract was awarded? Christie brushed off ethics concerns as ""just craziness"" and he maintains that, despite previous statements, the two began their friendship later in 2013, after the contract. Here's an exhaustive timeline of the publicly available information on the relationship of Chris Christie, Jerry Jones, the Cowboys and the Port Authority: . 2009 - Christie runs for his first term as governor and wins on November 4. June 14, 2010 - Christie reveals his Cowboys loyalty to sports writer Steve Politi of the Star Ledger. Q: I have to pin you down on this: Is it true you're a closet Cowboys fan? A: ""I am. My son is a huge Jets fan, so I've become a secondary Jets fan. Listen, I grew up in the early 1970s and became a huge Roger Staubach fan and a Cowboys fan. Believe me, it doesn't get me anything political around here because the Giants fans hate me, the Eagles fans hate me, it doesn't matter. But you grow up rooting for a team. That's just the way it works."" March 19, 2013 - Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announce that Legends Hospitality, the company partly owned by Jones, is awarded a contract by the Port Authority to build an observation deck at the top of One World Trade Center. June 19, 2013 - Christie gets jeered after telling a bunch of elementary school students that he's a Cowboys fan. The story becomes national news. June 26, 2013 - Christie defends his sports loyalty in an interview with New Jersey 101.5 radio. Summer 2013 - This is when the governor and Jones first spoke on the phone, according to Christie's ""Ask the Governor"" interview on Thursday (January 15, 2015). ""I remember it was the summer of 2013, and we were at the beach house one weekend,"" Christie says. "" And I got a call from Jerry Jones and he said, 'Listen, I can't believe you've been a Cowboys fan all these years. I'm a big supporter of yours. I'm thrilled you're a Cowboys fan. And I hope we get to meet sometime.' ""And I said 'Actually I'm going to be coming to Dallas this September to raise money for the Republican National Committee.' He said, 'Well if we have a game that weekend, I hope you come',"" Christie recalls. September 8, 2013 - Christie attends the Cowboys game against the New York Giants in Dallas, where he meets Jones on the field. June 9, 2014 - This is where things get complicated. Christie, in an interview with Sports Radio 94WIP Philadelphia, says he and Jerry Jones first spoke on the phone when he was running for governor. ""I got asked about it during the first campaign by a sports reporter who came in to interview me,"" Christie says. ""So that got out and it got national press that I was a Cowboys fan running for governor of New Jersey, and the next day I got a call from Jerry Jones,"" Christie continued, adding that Jones told him ""I'm so proud."" You may be thinking, 'Wait, I thought he didn't speak to Jones until 2013?' as mentioned earlier in this timeline. We asked Christie's office about the discrepancy, and they declined to comment. November 23, 2014 - Christie attends the Cowboys game against the Eagles in Philadelphia and sits with Jones in a private suite. December 14, 2014 - Christie again defends his Cowboys, this time in an interview with WPG Talk Radio. December 21, 2014 - Christie and his family go to the Cowboys game against the Indianapolis Colts in Dallas. December 22, 2014 - In an interview with NJTV's Steve Adubato, Christie says he's ""become friends with Jerry over the last five years."" January 4, 2015 - Christie is seen on camera celebrating the Cowboys victory against the Detroit Lions in Dallas. Overcome with excitement, Christie and Jones have their now widely seen bear hug. January 5, 2015 - Christie spends a good chunk of the day defending himself against ribbing from Dallas haters via social media. His fandom becomes national news again, especially given his prospects as a potential presidential contender. It's also revealed that Jones paid for Christie's ticket and transportation to the game. The governor's office says it was legal under a policy that says the governor ""may accept gifts, favors, services, gratuities, meals, lodging or travel expenses from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds."" January 6, 2015 - Questions arise after the Wall Street Journal and the International Business Times report that Jones had ties to the Port Authority through his company, Legends Hospitality. CNN: Democrats mull ethics probe over Christie's Cowboys hug . January 7, 2014 - Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts says the governor's friendship with Jones ""started in the summer of 2013."" ""Whether they first met or spoke in 2010 or 2011 in a passing way, I can't account for that,"" he adds. Rich Dalrymple, a spokesman for the Cowboys, also says Christie and Jones met at a Dallas football game in 2013 after Jones learned of Christie's love for the Cowboys that summer. ""Their relationship is totally based on the governor's following the Dallas Cowboys--there is nothing political about it at all,"" Dalrymple tells the Wall Street Journal. January 11, 2015 -  Christie attends the Cowboys playoff game against the Green Bay Packers in Wisconsin. He sits with Jones again but Christie's office says that Christie paid for his own ticket and transportation this time. January 15, 2015 - Christie says on NJ101.5 that he first spoke to Jones in the summer of 2013 and the two met a few months later in September when he attended the Cowboys vs. Giants game in Dallas. CNN's Chris Frates contributed to this report.","Chris Christie and Jerry Jones say they've been friends since September 2013 .

"(CNN)""Birdman"" flew high and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was truly grand at the nominations for the 87th Academy Awards, each earning nine nominations to top all films. ""Birdman,"" subtitled ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" -- which led to many multisyllabic mouthfuls during the Oscar announcements -- stars Michael Keaton as a former superhero actor trying to revive his career and his life by mounting a Broadway play. It earned nominations for best picture, best actor for Keaton, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, supporting actor (Edward Norton), supporting actress (Emma Stone), original screenplay and cinematography, as well as some technical nods. Others receiving nominations for best picture are ""American Sniper,"" ""Boyhood,"" ""The Imitation Game,"" ""The Theory of Everything,"" ""Selma,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Whiplash."" Complete list of Oscar nominations . The rush of honors for ""Budapest,"" about the denizens of a European hotel in the years between the world wars, was somewhat unexpected, though the film had won best comedy/musical at the Golden Globes (defeating ""Birdman,"" among others). The film was nominated for best picture and director (Wes Anderson), along with original screenplay, cinematography, score and a host of other awards. ""The Imitation Game"" received eight nominations. The drama stars Benedict Cumberbatch as British mathematician Alan Turing, who helped break the Germans' Enigma coding machine in World War II and was a pioneer of computer science. Cumberbatch earned a best actor nomination to go along with the film's nods for picture, director (Morten Tyldum) and supporting actress (Keira Knightley). ""Boyhood,"" which won the Golden Globe for best drama, also performed well, earning six nods. Director Richard Linklater picked up a nomination, as did supporting performers Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. The movie follows the maturation of a child over 12 years and was filmed for a week or two each year so that audiences could see the actors age in real time. Overlooked . A number of favorites were left off various lists. Though civil rights drama ""Selma"" did get a best picture nomination, actor David Oyelowo was snubbed despite earning raves for his nuanced portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Director Ava DuVernay, who would have been the first African-American woman to receive a best director nomination, was also overlooked. Jennifer Aniston had received a Golden Globe best actress nomination for ""Cake,"" and had been widely expected to get her first Oscar nomination. But she didn't make the list. Critical and commercial hit ""Gone Girl,"" adapted from the best-seller, did earn a best actress nomination for Rosamund Pike, but struck out in all other major categories. And then there were the lack of nominations for ""The Lego Movie,"" one of the biggest hits of the year both with critics and audiences. Widely seen as a favorite among animated films and a possibility for original screenplay, it earned just one nomination, for best song (""Everything Is Awesome""). The nominees for best animated feature are ""Big Hero 6,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon 2,"" ""The Boxtrolls,"" ""The Song of the Sea"" and ""The Tale of Princess Kaguya."" Some surprises . On the other hand, though ""Foxcatcher"" missed out for best picture, the tragic story of a du Pont heir and two wrestling brothers scored in a number of other categories, including director, actor (Steve Carell), supporting actor (Mark Ruffalo) and adapted screenplay. Also exceeding expectations: ""American Sniper,"" director Clint Eastwood's film based on the life of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. It earned nominations for best picture, actor (Bradley Cooper) and adapted screenplay. Glen Campbell picked up a nomination for best song, ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You,"" from the documentary ""Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me."" The musician is suffering from Alzheimer's, a battle depicted in the film. And though not really a surprise -- she's been here many, many times before -- Meryl Streep earned her 19th acting nomination Thursday morning. This one was for best supporting actress for her performance as the Witch in ""Into the Woods."" Streep was the movie's bright spot among the major categories, as ""Woods"" missed out on a best picture nomination. The announcements of the nominees drew some inadvertent laughs when Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs mispronounced the name of cinematographer Dick Pope, nominated for his work on ""Mr. Turner,"" as ""Dick Poop."" The malaprop quickly became a Twitter meme. The 87th Academy Awards will take place Sunday, February 22, at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre. Neil Patrick Harris will host.

"Michael and Jamira Dixon believe they were turned in for texting by shooting suspect Curtis Reeves two weeks ago at the same Florida movie theater complex where Chad Oulson was shot to death Monday. Reeves is charged with second-degree murder after an argument about texting ended with the 71-year-old former police officer shooting Oulson in the chest, prosecutors said. The Dixons said Wednesday night that in late December during a matinee showing of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" a man they identified as Reeves was in the same theater with them and was ""bothered by everything."" Jamira Dixon said she sent a text at 2:20 p.m. and an usher told her that she needed to put the phone away or she would have to leave the theater. The man she identified as Reeves was sitting in the same row and talked with the usher afterward and gesticulated at her and her group, she said. She said she was there with her husband, three of her children and a niece. Jamira Dixon is sure the man was Reeves because, she said, she made it a point to remember his face in case she went to file a complaint about him with theater management. CNN repeatedly tried Wednesday to get a comment about the Dixons' claims from Reeves' attorney Richard Escobar. He didn't respond to CNN's requests. The Dixons spent part of Tuesday night giving their version of the events of the December 28 movie to authorities, they said. They were interviewed separately, each for an hour, they said. CNN was unable to confirm Wednesday night that those interviews took place. In recounting the experience to reporters outside their home in Wesley Chapel, the Dixons said the man never used foul language toward them; he just angrily kept his eye on them from the end of the row. ""As the (day) went on he just glared and glared and was grumbling the whole (time),"" Jamira Dixon said. ""I don't think he saw much of the movie,"" Michael Dixon said. Another man's cell phone went off during the movie, Jamira Dixon said, and the man leaned over and snarled at the guy on the phone. ""Can you please, please turn that off. It's really disturbing me,"" the man said, according to Dixon. She said she heard about Monday's shooting through a Facebook post she noticed while driving that afternoon. Because the incident also involved someone texting at the same theater, she asked a friend to see if there was a picture of the suspect and send it. When she saw it she said she had to pull the car over. ""It sent chills down my spine,"" she said. ""I knew it was that person that I had an encounter with a few weeks prior."" She showed the picture to her husband, who agreed it was the same man. ""I was, like, that is the same guy,"" Michael Dixon said. ""It could have happened to us. We were in the same exact position."" In the aftermath, heroes responded . An argument, then a shot . The shooting happened early Monday afternoon at the Grove 16 theater, just before an afternoon showing of ""Lone Survivor,"" a film about a Navy SEAL mission. Reeves was with his wife and sat behind Oulson, 43, and his wife, authorities said. Oulson was using his cell phone during the previews before the film and Reeves told him to put it away, according to police and witnesses. The two men began to argue and Reeves walked out of the auditorium. Police said Reeves was going to complain to a theater employee. But Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told CNN Tuesday night that the manager was busy with another customer and Reeves never addressed his complaint with a supervisor. When Reeves returned, witnesses and authorities said that Oulson asked him if he had gone to tell on him for texting. Police said Tuesday that Oulson was texting his young daughter's babysitter. Voices were raised. Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, police said. Then, the former police officer took out a .380 semi-automatic handgun and shot Oulson, police said. Opinion: Texting killineg tells us one thing . Theater reopens . The Grove complex, including the theater where the shooting took place, reopened Wednesday. A thin crowd trickled in to see ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" CNN affiliate WTSP reports. Complex owner Cobb Theatres hired off-duty Pasco County sheriff's deputies to patrol the area -- at a level typical for a Friday or Saturday night, the station said. A theater employee told WTSP that the staff had actually gone through a training session the day of the shooting to help prepare them for an emergency, a precaution inspired by the theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, that occurred in the summer of 2012. Sheriff Nocco said the staff did an ""outstanding"" job of getting everyone out of the theater in an calm and orderly way. Nocco is preparing a report to make sure all the department's procedures were followed. Standing his ground? Reeves made his first court appearance Tuesday on a charge of second-degree murder. Escobar, Reeves' attorney, tried to persuade Circuit Court Judge Lynn Tepper that his client was actually the victim in the incident and that Oulson was the ""aggressor."" Police said despite Reeves' claim that he was in fear for his safety, this was not a case for Florida's ""stand your ground"" defense. ""Working with the state attorney's office it was determined that stand-your-ground does not fly here in this case,"" Nocco said. Authorities said a preliminary investigation determined that there was no physical contact during the incident. It was popcorn, thrown by Oulson, that struck Reeves. Tepper said there was no evidence to support the claim that the shooter was a victim. She denied him bond. Is this 'insanity' or 'just a matter of time?' Outside Reeves' home Wednesday were newly hung ""No trespassing"" signs. Who was the texting father? Chad Oulson was a former U.S. Navy petty officer, serving from 1990 to 1997, according to spokeswoman Lt. Richlyn Neal. Wednesday morning, a woman who said she was Oulson's sister answered the door at his home in the Tampa suburb of Land O' Lakes. She declined to give her name but told a CNN reporter and producer that the family wasn't going to make a public statement for a while, and that they were struggling with their grief and arranging a funeral for Oulson. She did say, however, that Oulson has a daughter who is just under 2 years old. Though the garage door was shut, a day earlier the Tampa Tribune reported that a reporter saw a motocross motorcycle was on a stand next to a gold pickup truck and a child's wagon. ""He loved his job, loved his family, loved motocross, loved the motorcycle world,"" friend Joseph Detrapani told the newspaper. ""He grew up riding motocross and loved to keep doing it, even at his age of 43, he's still out there every weekend riding."" ""It is just going to be a huge hole in everybody's lives for him and his family. He'd give you the shirt off his back if he needed to,"" Joseph Trapani told CNN affiliate WFTS. Theater security . Theater violence is nothing new.  Less than two years ago, an Aurora, Colorado, cineplex was the scene of a shooting massacre that left 12 people dead. Theater chains had already moved to ban handguns. Cobb Theatres, which owns the Grove 16 and more than 120 other theaters, says posters displaying its zero weapons policy are posted on its front doors. Other chains have also stepped up safety measures. Still, is that enough? ""The question is going to become:  how are they enforcing them?  Is a sign sufficient to give notice that you shall not bring a handgun on our premises?"" CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos asked. There are theater chains that take it a step further, employing security guards at some locations to keep patrons safe. ""If somebody were to bring in a bag, for instance, they're immediately going to spot something like that or if they're acting unusual or nervous they would spot something like this, whereas a metal detector is only looking at one thing,"" according to Howard Levinson, the president of Expert Security Consulting. The National Association of Theatre Owners doesn't comment publicly on theater security matters, but says ""we encourage our patrons to remember that they are sharing a common wish to be entertained and to treat their fellow moviegoers with courtesy and respect.""

"The United States may be touting its strikes on ISIS targets in Syria, but one of the terror group's fighters says the hits are trivial at best. In an exclusive interview with CNN, a Syrian ISIS fighter using the pseudonym Abu Talha said the militant group has been preparing for such attacks. ""We've been ready for this for some time,"" Abu Talha said. ""We know that our bases are known because they're tracking us with radars and satellites, so we had backup locations."" He taunted the U.S.-led coalition that has been pummeling ISIS targets in Syria over the past week, including attacks on mobile oil refineries and vehicles. ""We have revenues other than oil. We have other avenues, and our finances are not going to stop just because of oil losses,"" the 28-year-old militant said. ""They thought they knew everything. But thank God, they don't know anything. And God willing, we will defeat the infidels."" Abu Talha said he was among the ISIS fighters who took over Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in June. He said even if coalition attacks impede ISIS, they're not enough to stop ISIS' mission of fortifying an Islamic state across Sunni parts of Syria and Iraq. ""They hit us in some areas, and we advance in others,"" Abu Talha said. ""If we are pushed back in Iraq, we advance in northern Syria. These strikes cannot stop us, our support or our fighters."" U.S. President Barack Obama admitted the quick rise of ISIS in Syria had been underrestimated at first. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Obama said the U.S. government ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" during its civil war -- allowing the country to become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world."" ISIS defector speaks out . One man who recently left the ranks of ISIS also said the militants took precautions before coalition strikes. ""They almost entirely emptied out the headquarters,"" the defector, using the name Abu Omar, told CNN's Arwa Damon in Turkey. ""Some equipment they hid in civilian neighborhoods. Some they hid underground."" Abu Omar also said ISIS relies heavily on foreign members -- including Westerners -- to carry out its mission. ""The French, they have so much control -- they're even more extreme than we are,"" the defector said. ""They come from France, but it's as if they have been part of the 'Islamic State' for years."" The 29-year-old said he believed in ISIS' goal of creating an Islamic state and left his wife and 3-year-old son behind to go fight. Abu Omar initially tried to defend the group's atrocities -- including crucifixions, beheadings and indiscriminate killings. But eventually, the brutally became too much for him. ""I used to hope that they would fix their mistakes,"" he said. ""If they had, it wouldn't be like this."" When the United States and Arab partners started pounding the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa last week, many militants scattered. And Abu Omar found an opportunity to flee. But he still trembles when he talks, fearful he has a target on his back. Abu Omar said while he still dreams of a caliphate in the region, he is haunted by what he witnessed. ""I saw a 70-year-old sheikh killed in front of me,"" he said. ""The 'Islamic State' can't continue like this. ... There are a lot of youth who are joining -- 14, 15 years old. Maybe my voice can make them think again.""","An ISIS defector says the atrocities by the group were too brutal for him .

"(CNN) -- The town of Dublin, Georgia, is putting saggy, baggy pants in the category of indecent exposure, with violators facing fines of up to $200. Dublin Mayor Phil Best said he plans to sign this week an amendment to the municipality's indecent exposure ordinance. The amendment, which Best plans to put into immediate effect at the City Council meeting, prohibits the wearing of pants or skirts ""more than three inches below the top of the hips exposing the skin or undergarments."" ""We've gotten several complaints from citizens saying the folks with britches down below their buttocks was offensive, and wasn't there something we could do about it,"" Best said. The mayor said after about a year of fielding complaints, he put the city attorney to work researching how other localities have dealt with the derriere dilemma. The result was that council members decided to put exposure due to baggy clothing in the same category as masturbation, fornication and urination in public places. Patrolling for offenders will be left to local police in the town about 140 miles southeast of Atlanta. Violators could face fines ranging from $25 to $200, or court-mandated community service. ""That's not our intent, we'd (rather) not fine anybody but we are prepared to,"" Best said. Dublin residents are divided on the issue. Lashika Haynes supports the push to force folks to pull up, ""It's just disrespectful by showing your drawers to people,"" she said. But there are those who feel that the ordinance singles out a specific group of citizens. Jean Wolf, who volunteers with young black men in the community said, ""They're the ones wearing the saggy, baggy pants."" Wolf said she believes the ordinance will lead to profiling by authorities. Mayor Best said that accusation is ""ridiculous."" ""It's for white, black, man, woman. The ordinance is for everyone, and I've seen it violated by all races and sexes,"" Best said. Dublin is not alone in its pull-up-the-pants campaign. Riviera Beach, Florida, and Flint, Michigan, passed bans against sagging pants in recent years, but the Riviera Beach legislation later was declared unconstitutional after a court challenge. In the non-judicial realm, a state senator in Brooklyn, New York, announced plans earlier this year for a series of billboards featuring young men wearing low-hanging pants and the catchphrase, ""Raise your pants, raise your image."" And up the road from Dublin, 62-year-old Atlantan ""General"" Larry Platt made it all the way to ""American Idol"" and became an online one-hit wonder with his song ""Pants on the Ground."" (Sample lyrics: ""Pants on the ground, pants on the ground/looking like a fool with your pants on the ground."") It is not lost on the mayor and the City Council in Dublin that this ordinance opens the door to what could be a pretty tricky debate over what is indecent exposure. For instance, how much is too much cleavage, and are certain tattoos indecent? The mayor seems to welcome the discussion as a natural part of the law-making process. ""I don't know a law or ordinance that doesn't stand scrutiny by the people and the court system. So time will tell. There have been plenty of laws that have gone all the way to Supreme Court,"" Best said. According to the mayor, the local high school already enforces a strict dress code which puts a tight belt around students and their saggy pants, sending violators home for the day. ""It's time we all have a mutual respect for each other ... what a person does in the privacy of their home is fine,"" Best said. ""But if I had an 8-year-old daughter, I don't think she needs to be subjected to looking at someone's rear end.""","The mayor of Dublin, Georgia, plans to sign an amendment to an indecent exposure ordinance .

"The UK economy has shaken off the European crisis with growth figures that outshine its G7 peers. It is expected to grow 3.1% this year, according to a forecast by the prestigious EY ITEM Club, above earlier expectations of 2.9%. The growth is well above that expected of Germany, Europe's biggest economy and one which dragged the bloc out of crisis, at 1.8%. ""We have moved from the recovery phase to expansion. And furthermore, it's looking very durable,"" said Peter Spencer, professor of Economics and Finance at University of York and chief economic adviser to the ITEM Club. Figures released Friday show the British economy passing the pre-crisis peak from 2008, with second quarter of growth of 0.8%. Spencer said the growth is no longer financed by people tapping into their savings -- as was the case this time last year -- but by business expansion and a stronger labor market. Business spending is on the rise, meaning companies are investing into production rather than sitting on cash. Business investment by itself now generates more than half of the UK's growth. The government is trumpeting a record-high employment -- 73.1% of people were in work in the three months to May, matching up the previous record-high from 2004/2005. But there is a catch. While record numbers of Brits are working, their wages are growing at the slowest rate on record -- and at about half of the inflation rate. That fuels another problem of the UK's economy -- the chronic and rising inequality. Of all UK households, only the highest earning 20% increased their disposable income last year. The remaining 80% of households suffered a drop in their income, numbers released by the Office of National Statistics show. The Bank of England has also warned that the UK productivity has been ""extremely and uncharacteristically weak"" since the recession. Productivity growth, which indicates if the economy can produce more for less, remains below the pre-crisis levels, at 16%. Many economists are also warning the UK about a potential housing bubble. The average cost of a home in the UK is now 20% above the pre-crisis peak in 2007. The IMF has already warned the UK government that rising house prices and low productivity could hinder the economic growth and urged the country to put in place ""early measures"" to prevent housing bubble. But Spencer told CNN the fears of a bubble were overblown. ""This is not driven by mortgage borrowing. In London for example, it's mainly cash buying and overseas buyers,"" he said, pointing to relatively flat mortgage borrowing. The UK is also vulnerable to shocks from outside. Half of the country's international trade is with the European Union countries, many of which are still suffering from the consequences of the eurozone crisis. ""If Germany takes a hit, we'll suffer too. If Germany does well, we'll do well, like the rest of Europe,"" Spencer said.

"It's a truth of warfare in the digital era: Bullets and bombs often are augmented by status updates and tweets. The bloody conflict taking place in Iraq is no different. And Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, a terror group so extreme that al Qaeda has denounced it, is taking the lead with a social media propaganda war the likes of which has never been seen. From recruiting fighters to spreading word of their violent attacks, ISIS is taking to the Web in what analysts say is a more sophisticated manner than previous combatants. Perhaps as a result, Iraqis have been reporting widespread outages of social sites, a common refrain during recent unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere. CNN's Nick Paton-Walsh in Turkey interviewed a defector from ISIS who said he used to recruit Westerners for the cause through direct messages on Twitter. Opinion: Will ISIS brutality backfire? ""There was special treatment for the Europeans. One British guy said he was called Ibrahim, then told me he was from Manchester,"" said the man, who said he left the movement after it killed two of his relatives. ""One asked my boss if he should fight in his own country or come to Syria. He was told, 'If God doesn't give you martyrdom in Syria,' then he could wage war in his own country."" The man, now in hiding, said he was part of a team that ran an online chat welcoming new recruits to ISIS. ""There are things I am allowed to answer and things I must ask my supervisor about,"" he said. ""Specific questions about religion -- I have to get their permission to message anyone. I can't talk on Skype. Everything is written down so they can monitor everything."" As the Islamist group's fight has moved from Syria to Iraq, that savvy Web strategy has expanded to include online video posts much slicker than the grainy, shaky clips that have popped up from al Qaeda and other terror groups. Recently, a slickly produced, hourlong ISIS video titled ""The Clanging of the Swords"" surfaced, showcasing  killings, roadside bombings and other acts of terror for which ISIS claimed credit. The video vividly displays these scenes in a style reminiscent of Hollywood efforts like ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" complete with elaborate aerial shots. ""This is funded,"" said Nadia Oweidat, a Middle East analyst. ""This is geopolitics. There is money behind it. It's not just idiots; these idiots have somebody controlling them and providing them with equipment that is very expensive. You can't just get it in a cave."" On another front, at least one analyst says ISIS was recently using a mobile app made available in Google's Play Store to inflate its presence on social media. Called The Dawn of Glad Tidings, or just Dawn, the app was promoted as a way to keep up to date with news from ISIS. According to J.M. Berger, editor of national-security blog IntelWire, the Dawn app would post updates to users' Twitter feeds. By midafternoon Tuesday, Google appeared to have removed the app from its store. Google did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story. With the digital assault accompanying a ground offensive that saw ISIS fighting Tuesday just 40 miles north of Baghdad in the city of Baquba, access to social media has been disappearing across much of Iraq. There has been no confirmation that the Iraqi government is behind a blackout. But both Facebook and Twitter have reported a precipitous drop in the number of people in Iraq using their products in the past few days. ""Users in #Iraq are reporting issues accessing our service. We're investigating their reports and we hope service will be restored quickly,"" Twitter said on its global policy team's account Friday. Facebook has issued a similar statement. ""We are disturbed by reports of access issues in Iraq and are investigating. Limiting access to Internet services — essential for communication and commerce for millions of people — is a matter of concern for the global community,"" read a Facebook statement sent to CNN. Facebook's internal numbers show that, since June 12, the volume of visits to its site and apps were as low as 30% of their normal volume in Iraq. There are no technical problems on its end, Facebook said. Web software firm Akamai reports that visits to Twitter in Iraq dramatically plummeted early Saturday. A Twitter spokesman said its internal traffic reports mirror Akamai's. Iraqis have increasingly turned to Whisper, a mobile app that lets users post anonymous images, in an apparent effort to get around the social-media issues. Neetzan Zimmerman, Whisper's editor in chief, told CNNMoney that Whisper usage in Iraq more than doubled between June 12 and June 15. During Arab Spring uprisings in places like Egypt and Iran, as well as more recent conflicts in places like Syria, unrest has been met with Internet outages and the blocking of social media sites. In virtually all cases, the opposition has accused sitting governments, who control their nation's Internet infrastructure, of blocking access to make coordination more difficult and keep news of the conflicts from spreading.

"Sen. Rand Paul marked the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at a ceremony this week honoring the late Maurice Rabb, a renowned ophthalmologist and civil rights leader. It was part of his aggressive outreach to African-Americans and other nontraditional GOP voters as he works to expand the Republican Party and as he crisscrosses the country laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign. It's a community in which he has some fences to mend. While campaigning for the Senate four years ago, Paul sparked a firestorm for questioning parts of the historic law, especially its underpinnings that place restrictions on private property. The law gave the federal government too much power in telling business owners what they could and could not do, he argued. While he expressed strong abhorrence for racism, he said it was the job of communities, not the government, to fix discrimination in private places by boycotting such businesses. His argument lined up ideologically with his libertarian, limited-government leanings, but Democrats have used his comments to try to define him as a civil rights opponent. Paul is now considered a likely presidential contender. And as the most active Republican leader in the effort to recruit African-Americans to the GOP, his comments from four years ago have become a thorn in his side. Political strategists say the senator has gotten better at framing his arguments in a less divisive manner. But in order to lay to rest controversy over his 2010 remarks, he needs to keep doing what he's doing: Try to convince African-Americans and Democratic voters that he's an advocate for many of their views, and push his fellow Republicans to join him in the effort. ""If we're going to be the white party, we're going to be the losing party,"" Paul said Tuesday at the Shelbyville Rotary Club while he was in town for the event honoring Rabb. Paul's questions about the law . In April 2010, Paul was asked by the Louisville Courier-Journal about his thoughts on the Civil Rights Act. He hailed the law for striving to end discrimination in the public domain, but he didn't fully approve of the government's role in the process. ""I think it's a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant â€” but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership,"" he said. He added that he agrees any publicly-funded entities should not be allowed to discriminate, but the law shouldn't necessarily apply to private businesses. ""And that's most of what I think the Civil Rights Act was about in my mind."" So how would he resolve the problem? Consistent with his small-government philosophy, he said it should be up to the people to self-correct the issue. ""In a free society, we will tolerate boorish people who have abhorrent behavior. But if we're civilized people, we publicly criticize that and don't belong to those groups, or don't associate with those people,"" he added. His comments were similar to the views of his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, who famously protested a 2004 vote in the House commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. The then-congressman said the law did not improve race relations, and it diminished individual liberty. Defending his father, Paul said the problem with the law was the unintended consequences it had on property rights. ""It's not all about race relations. It is about controlling property, ultimately,"" he said on CNN in January 2012. But Patrick Maney, a history professor at Boston College, said the discussion around property rights was only a portion of the debate about the Civil Rights Act at the time of passage. ""Saying the Civil Rights Act was about property rights is sort of akin to those who say the Civil War was about states' rights,"" he said. ""The main objection, especially among the most rabid opponents, was to racial integration, assimilation, and race mixing."" 'Concerned about the ramifications' Paul also argued that the law set a dangerous precedent that's paved a way for other restrictions on businesses, such as calorie-count regulations and smoking bans. While visiting Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, Paul was questioned last year about his views on the law. He forcefully said he's never come ""out in opposition to the Civil Rights Act or ever introduced anything to alter the Civil Rights Act."" Rather, he's been ""concerned about the ramifications of certain parts of it beyond race, as they are now being applied to smoking, menus, listing calories and things on menus, and guns."" But historians say there's no direct connection between the 1964 law and the federal regulations he mentioned. ""I see absolutely nothing in the Civil Rights Act as opposed to any other law which would lead to smoking bans,"" said Ed Dorn, a professor and former dean of the Lyndon B. John School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. A more likely connection, Dorn added, would be linking smoking bans and menu restrictions to health laws mandating child vaccinations. There is one title (out of 11) in the law that addresses private businesses. It states that certain entities are exempt from the law, such as small bed-and-breakfast type facilities, known colloquially as ""Mrs. Murphy's Boarding Houses,"" in which there are five or fewer bedrooms and where the owner is a full-time resident. In a May 2010 interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Paul famously suggested that if he were around in 1964, he ""would have tried to modify that"" section of the law and ""there would have been some discussion"" on property rights. The Washington Post in 2013 ran a fact-check of Paul's comments about the Civil Rights Act over the years and gave him three out of four Pinnochios for what they described as ""rewriting history."" ""It would be better to own up to his mistake â€” if he now thinks it was one â€” rather than sugarcoat it,"" the article stated. An uphill battle . Perhaps more than any other Republican politician, Paul has been actively trying to expand the GOP by making it more attractive to African-Americans. He started his outreach following the 2012 presidential election, when Republican Mitt Romney garnered only 6% of that vote. Paul has made multiple trips to historically black colleges and urban centers, preaching a pro-school choice position and holding meetings with students and school leaders. Last month he helped open a Kentucky GOP office in a predominantly African-American area in Louisville. In late July, he'll address the National Urban League in Cincinnati. And in Congress, he's working to restore voting rights for people convicted of nonviolent felonies, many of whom are minority voters, and he's pushed his idea of ""economic freedom zones"" that would focus on improving struggling communities in urban areas. ""I think you'll find nobody in Congress doing more for minority rights than me, right now. Republican or Democrat,"" Paul told reporters Tuesday in Shelbyville. Paul's policy messages will resonate with ""the African-American of 2014,"" said Elroy Sailor, an African-American businessman who's traveled with the senator to urban areas and historically black schools -- though he stressed historical issues were still important to the black community. Sailor said Paul's actions will ultimately speak louder than any comments he made in the past. ""That's what's transcending a statement here, or a statement there,"" he argued, predicting Paul will win people over in the long run. ""I think you'll see a lot of Rand Paul Democrats."" But Paul still faces an uphill battle in courting those voters. While he's reaching out to African-Americans on issues they care about, his political associations and ideology may be an obstacle for some. ""The libertarian perspective has never been terribly strong in the African-American community precisely because it is tied to a private property argument that bears a very insidious connection to slavery and racial discrimination,"" said Dorn, the professor of public affairs, though he said he takes Paul at his word that the senator detests racism. ""Very few civil rights advocates have been libertarians,"" Dorn added, however. Learning a valuable lesson . As Paul works to appeal to African-Americans on the policy front, he'll need to continue sharpening his message skills. ""He learned a very, very valuable lesson: If it's too complicated to explain your position, you're probably in trouble,"" said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. He's tried to clean up and clarify his comments about the Civil Rights Act, and in May 2012, he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he would have voted for the bill in 1964 if he had the chance. He ""would have been there marching with Martin Luther King"" during the civil rights movement, he said. In a statement this week on the anniversary, Paul said the law ""changed the future of our nation by enforcing the belief that all men and women are created equal."" When running for the Senate in 2010, Paul was considered a newcomer to politics. He had campaigned for his father's presidential bids and had been involved in political activism, but Rand Paul's Senate run was his first big campaign of his own. Strategists say his comments about the Civil Rights Act were a rookie mistake; Paul, who had been a practicing ophthalmologist for 17 years, wasn't quite ready for the sound-bite friendly media. If Paul runs for president, Democrats are almost certain to make sure his comments about the Civil Rights Act overshadow any other efforts he's made to appeal to African Americans. On Tuesday for example, the Democratic National Committee quickly pounced on the statement Paul released on the anniversary. In an email blast, the DNC reminded people of his Louisville Courier-Journal interview. Paul is ""now trying to have it both ways,"" the email stated. ""No rhetoric can erase the number of instances where Paul has turned his back on the Civil Rights Act that's created a more fair and just America,"" it continued. The response offered a glimpse at how Democrats plan to target the likely presidential candidate. From a strategy standpoint, O'Connell said Paul has ""gotten a lot better"" at talking to the media and it's ""wise"" for him to be active in appealing to the African-American community, not only for his own political future, but for the Republican Party as a whole. ""His job between now and then is to continue what he's doing with minority outreach and try to bury this every way possible,"" he said.","Rand Paul got in some hot water over his 2010 comments about the Civil Rights Act .
Democrats will likely make the controversy a line of attack if he runs for president .
The Kentucky Republican is now trying to appeal to African-American voters .
Experts say he's made strides with his outreach efforts, but needs to keep it up ."
"Seven years after Tom Cruise famously jumped on a couch during an ""Oprah"" taping to declare his love for Katie Holmes, the actor and actress are ending their marriage, Cruise's attorney said Friday. Holmes filed for divorce Thursday, according to Cruise's lawyer Bert Fields. ""Tom is very sad about it and is concentrating on the kids,"" Fields said. Why you think TomKat split . Cruise's publicist, Amanda Lundberg, confirmed the pending divorce -- which was first reported by People, like CNN a division of Time Warner -- and urged people to respect ""their privacy to work this out."" Jonathan Wolfe, an attorney for Holmes, called the issue ""a personal and private matter for Katie and her family."" ""Katie's primary concern remains, as it has always been, her daughter's best interest,"" Wolfe said in a statement. Tom always wanted to be a father . The couple wed in Italy in November 2006, seven months after their daughter, Suri, was born. Pictures of the family have often appeared in tabloid magazines in the years since, though the couple have steered clear of controversy and frequently appeared together at events. In the June edition of Playboy, Cruise, 49, said he loved Holmes, 33, as much as when they got hitched 5½ years earlier. ""She is an extraordinary person, and if you spent five minutes with her, you'd see it,"" he said. ""I'm just happy, and I have been since the moment I met her. What we have is very special."" Cruise is one of Hollywood's most recognizable stars, starring in ""Taps"" and ""The Outsiders"" before breaking out in the 1983 film ""Risky Business."" He's appeared in a host of widely seen films since, including Oscar-nominated roles in ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Magnolia"" and the hit action series ""Mission Impossible."" Suri plays stylist for mom Katie Holmes . Holmes became known to America as an actress on the teen drama TV series ""Dawson's Creek,"" which aired between 1998 and 2003. She has since appeared in several productions, including the movie ""Batman Begins"" and TV miniseries ""The Kennedys."" The two began dating in 2005, and months into their relationship Cruise made headlines by jumping on a couch as an open-mouthed Oprah Winfrey watched because he couldn't contain his excitement about Holmes. ""It just happened,"" Cruise said, according to a story on Oprah.com recapping the interview. ""She's amazing, and I'd think the same of her even if she wasn't with me -- she's just amazing."" HLN: Yes, but... what will Suri blog about? Holmes mentioned on the talk show how she'd grown up dreaming that she'd someday marry the ""Top Gun"" star. Their marriage was Holmes' first and the third for Cruise, who'd earlier been married to actresses Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman. He had two children from his marriage with the Academy Award-winning Kidman before their divorce in 2001.

"(CNN) -- In the past, if you wanted to be able to be able to lift more weight you would have to spend months bulking up at the gym. Now, with a new invention from a group of engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania, you can just strap on an external bicep and you are ready to go. The bionic device, called the Titan Arm, is the brainchild of four mechanical engineering students who, in their final undergraduate year, built an upper-body exoskeleton that can be used in physical therapy and manual labor. The invention won its inventors $10,000 in the Cornell Cup for Innovation and has recently been shortlisted for the 2013 Dyson award. The Titan Arm straps directly to a user's right arm to help lift heavy objects that the user wouldn't normally be able to lift. Its inventors believe that it will be useful in aiding physical rehabilitation, both for people who have suffered upper body injuries and for those with pre-existing muscular-skeletal disorders. The Titan Arm's inventors say the exoskeleton can also be used by people whose jobs require heavy lifting such as warehouse workers, removalists and couriers. ""With the Titan Arm, we wanted to create something that could both augment a user's natural strength as well as help someone perform physical therapy in their own home,"" says Elizabeth Beattie, one of the Titan Arm's inventors. ""We wanted to create something that was low-cost and easy for a user to put on and strap to themselves."" According to the United States Department of Labour, back disorders are one of the leading causes of disability for people during their working years. The American National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health says that back problems afflict over 600,000 employees each year with a cost of around $50 billion annually to the U.S. economy. The problem is significant in other countries: the World Health Organisation says that worldwide, 37% of lower back pain is due to injuries sustained in the workplace. Beattie says that addressing this problem while being attentive to user comfort was one of the primary motivating principles in designing the device: ""We wanted something that was comfortable for the user, something that mimics the body's natural mobility and range, so we definitely went through a lot of testing in order to get to where the design is right now."" The Titan Arm attaches to a user's right arm with a power motor at its elbow joint. The bionic limb can lift approximately 40 pounds of weight, augmenting a user's natural strength. The arm is predominantly made of aluminum and steel components, and is powered by a DC battery. As well as helping lift weight, the arm can also be locked into any position with a ratchet brake to hold an object steady without any exertion from the user. JD Albert, an engineer and co-founder of E-Ink, calls the Titan Arm ""exciting,"" but adds: ""I would caveat that with the fact that it's a very tough product to launch for a lot of reasons ... it needs to feel right (and) I think there's also some pretty significant safety concerns ... We are taking a piece of machinery and integrating it with a person and so naturally you need to make sure that there's no way to injure someone."" Still, Albert says that for young engineers, the Titan Arm represents an impressive achievement: ""They've managed to combine a pretty wide variety of disciplines both dealing the mechanical side of things -- the design and the electrical -- and the software side of things as well."" Beattie says that the Titan Arm team intends to keep working on the exoskeleton with a view to one day bringing it to market: ""The four of us definitely want to use our engineering tool kits to better the quality of life of those around us. I think that's one of the things that technology really has the power to do.""","University of Pennsylvania students develop upper-body exoskeleton .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- They were roaming the halls of South Philadelphia High School looking for a fight. Their target, according to police: Asian students. By the end of the school day, as many as 30 students of Asian descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment, according to school and law enforcement officials. Wei Chen, who was a senior at the time, remembers December 3, 2009, like it was yesterday. ""They were sitting along the wall,"" he recalled. ""I saw the one student, his whole T-shirt [was bloody] because his nose is broken."" Wei was not injured in last year's melee, but he said the violence was racial tension between black and Asian immigrant students reaching its breaking point. After being attacked as a freshman and witnessing other attacks on Asian students, Wei founded the Chinese Student Association to help new Chinese students -- many who recently immigrated to the country -- adjust to life at South Philly High. He also kept track of the incidents of violence against Asian students. Last year's altercation was the final straw. Wei and 50 other students organized an eight-day boycott of the school. They wanted to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence leading up to the December 3 incident. ""School should be safe,"" he said. ""The school should be responsible for students' safety. This is important."" Bach Tong, a native of Vietnam, was one of the students who participated in the boycott. He said standing up for what he believed in helped him find his voice. ""You know, I see not everyone speak up, so I need to stand up for myself 'cause I see myself in there, I see trouble in there,"" said Tong, who was a sophomore at the time of the incident. ""I cannot be selfish and stay aside to watch other people fixing stuff for me. I mean, I need to stand up and [fix] stuff for myself."" During those eight days, Wei, Tong and the other students met in Philadelphia's Chinatown neighborhood during school hours, doing their schoolwork, holding rallies, and talking about ways to deal with violence at the school. Despite taking a stand, Tong transferred out of South Philly High a year later, fearing for his safety and concerned about his education. Nevertheless, the boycott helped trigger nationwide attention to the violence against Asian students at South Philly High. Months later, a federal investigation was launched following a formal civil rights complaint filed by the Asian American Legal Defense Fund. ""It's huge,"" said Cecilia Chen, staff attorney for the Asian American Legal Defense Fund. ""It's basically the federal government coming in and saying that the school district has failed to protect the constitutional rights of its students, which they have an obligation to do,"" Chen said. According to the complaint, ""the District and the School acted with 'deliberate indifference' to the harassment against Asian students and 'intentional disregard for the welfare of Asian students'"" at the school. The Justice Department, which announced its investigation in August, has instructed the school system to improve the treatment of Asian students. And today, the perception among students and their families is that things are slowly changing. The school's principal resigned in May, security has been increased, and the school district has said there have been fewer reports of student assaults. The superintendent of schools did not return CNN's calls for a comment, but the school's new principal, Otis Hackney, says security at South Philly High is his top priority. ""There is no room for bullying at school,"" Hackney said in a recent phone interview. ""As principal, my No. 1 priority is to make sure my building is safe."" Hackney is the fifth principal in six years at South Philly High. A West Philadelphia native, Hackney wants his school off the state's ""persistently dangerous"" list, as well as meeting the Adequate Yearly Progress requirements, something his school has not achieved, he said. Hackney used education ""to change his situation,"" he said. ""I care because I was built this way,"" he said. ""I just truly see education as the way."" Next month, South Philly High students will launch a campaign for nonviolent schools with the help of the city's youth-led Philadelphia Student Union. The campaign seeks to improve school climate and enhance the trust between students and staff. Student Union member Shania Morris was in the eighth grade when last December's violence erupted at South Philly. Moved by the boycott, she wanted to make a difference in schools. ""We just want to fight to make a change in our schools so that they're nonviolent,"" said Morris, now a high school freshman. ""What we believe is that nonviolence is power that helps people rather than hurts."" While things have improved, it is a bittersweet accomplishment, says advocate Helen Gym, a board member for Asian Americans United. ""For all the wonderful students that we've worked with who stood up around the issue, we've lost dozens more,"" said Gym, who helped many Asian students document their experiences. ""Kids who just dropped out, kids who just gave up, kids who are lost. You know this is some small consolation, but ... we lost a generation of kids."" But for Wei Chen, who now attends Community College of Philadelphia, speaking out helped him find his inner strength. ""We have the power to change; we can do something,"" he said. ""It's not only adults who can do something, we can do something. I trust this.""","Last December, as many as 30 Asian students were attacked at South Philly High .

"For 19 years, the cold case of two slain prostitutes weighed heavily on the small military town of Oak Grove, Kentucky, especially after the brothel's madam publicly accused two allegedly corrupt police officers of the killings. Because the madam's accusation was boldly made during a City Council meeting three years after the deaths, everyone in town has long known of the suspicions, but local police and the Christian County Sheriff's Office were unable to crack the case. Now, a seven-year investigation by the Kentucky State Police has resulted in charges against the two police officers, both of whom have since left the force, and a third man. One of the former officers was a detective who appeared at the crime scene with other officers to investigate the killings, said one former officer who was first on the scene. For now, Oak Grove, adjacent to the U.S. Army's Fort Campbell, is feeling relief from the tantalizing mystery, but the town's mayor said Wednesday he suspects the case could become even bigger. ""I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. I think there are more arrests coming,"" said Dan Potter, who wasn't mayor when the killings occurred in 1994. ""Wouldn't the other police officers know?"" One of the former officers, Leslie Duncan, 50, already is serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in September to tampering with physical evidence in the case, state police said. Duncan, of Central City, Kentucky, was charged this month with two counts of complicity to murder, police said. Former officer Edward T. Carter, 43, of Somerset, Kentucky, was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by the Warren County, Ohio, Sheriff's Office pending his extradition to Kentucky, said Kentucky State Trooper Stuart Recke said. It was not immediately clear if Carter has retained an attorney. A third man who was never a police officer, Frank J. Black Jr., 39, of Gadsden, Alabama, also was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by Alabama authorities pending extradition to Kentucky, Recke said. Black's father, Frank Sr., told CNN that his son -- who was living in nearby Clarksville, Tennessee, at the time of the killings -- is innocent and says he isn't sure how his son came to be associated with Duncan and Clark -- or if they were at all. Carter and Black are being held in lieu of $1 million bail, Recke said. Duncan's attorney, Stephanie Ritchie, said his client ""maintains his innocence and denies being involved in the murders or intentionally doing anything to cover up or conceal the identities of the murderer or murderers."" ""Mr. Duncan pled guilty in September of this year as a result of his mishandling of the police investigation immediately following the murders in 1994,"" Ritchie said. ""He expressed remorse and regret to the victims' families and to the court for his inadequacies as a young inexperienced detective with too much responsibility on his shoulders,"" Ritchie said. The charges against all three men stem from the 1994 killings of Candace Belt, 22, and Gloria Ross, 18, who worked as prostitutes at the New Life Massage Parlor, police said. ""Needless to say, since it's an open and active investigation, we can't get too much into the details,"" Recke said this week. ""The Kentucky State Police got the investigation back in 2006. Our investigators, once we get an investigation from another agency, we start from square one and go through all the information available with a fine-tooth comb."" A fellow officer's suspicions . Former officer Bob Combs, who was first to arrive at the scene of the killings, recalled his suspicions of Carter and Duncan at the time. ""I suspected that they may have been involved, but didn't have evidence,"" said Combs, who had joined the force only a year before. Belt, a mother of two, ""was still alive"" when he arrived, Combs said, ""but she died on the way to the hospital."" ""Once Duncan got there, he was the detective, so it became his scene,"" he said. In an interview this week with CNN, Combs claimed Duncan disturbed crime scene evidence. ""Duncan ran in there and messed up the scene. The phone was off the hook when I arrived, but then after Duncan was in there, the phone was back on the receiver,"" Combs said. ""No one had ever asked me -- the first officer on the scene -- anything about this case. No one ever asked me anything until the state police took over -- years after it happened."" Combs, who went on to be a city councilman and served until last year, said he and Duncan had been friendly back then. ""He could be a nice guy, but he could have a real temper,"" Combs said. Ex-madam: 'They knew we had stuff on them' Three years after the killings, then-Councilwoman Patty Balew announced that she, too, was a former prostitute at the massage parlor. She and other prostitutes gave police sexual favors at a discount or at no cost, she alleged. ""If they were police officers, that's what we had to do whether we wanted to or not, which we didn't like,"" Balew told CNN in 1997. This week, Combs recalled the city council meeting in 1997 when Tammy Papler, the massage parlor's madam, dramatically accused the police officers of extortion and murder. Papler couldn't be reached by CNN for comment this week. But in a 1997 interview, Papler alleged of police: ""They weren't getting any more money from us, and they knew we had stuff on them. The only way to keep us quiet is to kill the girls and put us in jail."" Papler made further accusations in the CNN article that year, when she had already quit being a madam. ""I did what they told me to do,"" she said. ""If they needed new police lights, I bought new police lights. If they needed birthday money, I gave them birthday money. If they needed money for a trailer to be moved ... basically anything they told me they needed, I gave them the money for it."" Belt and Ross were shot in the head, and their throats were slashed, Papler said. ""It was devastating to us,"" Papler said in 1997. ""They both had babies. One was breastfeeding her baby. It was just a few weeks old."" Taken: The coldest case ever solved . A pall in the aftermath . Also in 1997, the Christian County sheriff's department said crime scene evidence was botched by police, and then-Sheriff Thomas Scillian said Carter was a prime suspect. He had been at the scene 30 minutes before the slayings, according to authorities. ""There's other information that we have that leads us to believe that Carter would be a good suspect,"" Scillian said. Then-Mayor Bobby Mace said the killings cast a pall over the small town: ""There's a cloud hanging over us right now and there's no rain,"" he said. ""Let's get it to either rain or let the wind blow the cloud out and let's get moving forward to the future."" In 1998, a federal court in Kentucky ruled in favor of Ross' husband and her two children in their lawsuit against Tammy and Ronnie Papler, who owned the massage parlor business, court papers show. The court issued a default judgment against the Paplers for failing to respond to, or defend against, the Ross family's lawsuit, which accused the Paplers of negligence in Ross' death. A U.S. District Court judge, however, dismissed the Rosses' negligence claims against Louise Seawright, the owner of the building where the massage parlor was located.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former high-ranking CIA official who was involved in the Iran-Contra scandal has worked on an alleged ad hoc spy program that the Pentagon is investigating, CNN has learned. Duane ""Dewey"" Clarridge -- who was pardoned for his alleged role in the Reagan-era scandal by President George H. W. Bush in the waning hours of his presidency in 1992 -- is using contacts in Afghanistan and Pakistan to obtain information for the Pentagon, according to former government officials familiar with the current program. They declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Pentagon has launched an assessment of the roles of at least three contractor companies with more than $20 million in contracts, according to Pentagon officials . Defense Secretary Robert Gates wants to know if bounds were overstepped. He needs ""a factual baseline from which to determine whether or not systemic problems exist,"" and how to fix them if they do, Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The two-week survey will be led by a small team of senior military and Defense Department officials, he said. The assessment was prompted by an investigation -- currently under way -- into a program led by Michael Furlong, a Defense Department official who oversaw contracts aimed at gathering information about Afghanistan and Pakistan. The program was meant to be limited to gathering what is known as ""open-source information,"" in which publicly available facts are gathered from, for example, local media and public events. Some of the contractors with the program -- retired CIA officers and former military commandos -- may have instead hired local agents to gather information on the specific locations and movements of particular individuals and passed it along to military officials for possible lethal strikes, according to government officials and private-sector businessmen familiar with the investigation. Federal laws and regulations generally prohibit contractors from directly engaging in intelligence collection because it is considered a crucial government function. The Pentagon is seeking to find out both whether the law was violated and whether funds were inappropriately diverted to conduct these alleged operations. Furlong has denied wrongdoing. ""This is something that I need to know more about, but we do have reviews and investigations going on to find out what the story is here, find out what the facts are, and if it's necessary to make some changes, I'll do that,"" Gates said Monday. Documents provided to CNN detail sensitive information that contractors gathered, including word of a meeting between Afghan President Hamid Karzai's brother and Mullah Baradar, a top Taliban leader who was arrested weeks later in Pakistan. At another meeting with Taliban commanders, an audio message from the reclusive leader Mullah Omar was played, in which he directed who would lead operations after a key member was captured. Another document details the comings and goings at a safe house in Kabul, Afghanistan, used by suspected members of the Haqqani insurgent network. Concern within the Central Intelligence Agency about the contract played a role in prompting the investigation, according to officials. Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, a spokesman for the U.S.-led force in Afghanistan, told CNN last week that elements of Furlong's project were not clear. ""There was ambiguity about how they were going to collect information,"" he said, and about whether Afghans were to be used to do the work, and how the information might be used. ""None of us were comfortable with what this contract meant. We wanted to know how they were going to glean information,"" Smith said. Smith said he subsequently terminated Furlong's effort last year because of his concerns. He estimates $6 million to $7 million of the funds allocated were spent and does not know what happened to the balance of the contract money. Clarridge, the former CIA official allegedly involved in the ad hoc spy ring, worked for the agency for 33 years, heading the agency's Latin American and European divisions and setting up its Counterterrorist Center in 1986, according to a Publisher's Weekly review of his book ""A Spy For All Seasons."" He was indicted in 1991 on federal charges of lying to Congress and the Tower Commission, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair, the review says.

"A new bill would make it harder for Mexican drug cartels to get their hands on guns sold in the United States and would punish those buying firearms or ammunition for criminals, according to senators from both parties, who proposed the legislation. It would also stem the flow of guns purchased legally in one state from getting into the hands of people in other states where they are not legally allowed to own them, according to a statement issued Monday by Senator Patrick Leahy,  a Democrat from Vermont who is one of the bill's authors. If voted into law, the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013, would slap anyone caught purchasing a firearm or ammunition with the intent of illegally transferring it to someone else with jail time and a large fine. It comes down particularly hard on those who supply weapons to offenders who use them to commit violent crimes or drug trafficking offenses, according to the bill's authors. It also makes use of existing law to make smuggling guns out of the country a criminal offense. The measure combines anti-trafficking elements contributed by three Democrats, Leahy, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, with elements contributed by two Republicans, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk and Maine Senator Susan Collins. The senators from northern states, where gun laws are stricter, are appealing to their colleagues in both parties to support the legislation, to help law enforcement stop guns from being ""sold and re-sold across state lines."" The senators say they formulated the bill at the behest of law enforcement officials, who want new legislation that will empower police in their fight against gun traffickers. In the wake of skyrocketing gun crime in Chicago, police have bitterly complained about the flow of firearms there via straw purchases from other states. Violence in the city made headlines, when high school honor student Hadiya Pendleton was gunned down at age 15 in gang violence. She had performed as a drum majorette at an event during President Obama's second inauguration in Washington. First lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral, and her parents sat next to her during the president's State of the Union address, when he reiterated his pledge to take action on gun crime. Straw purchases are often made by a person assisting someone who is unable to legally buy a gun or doesn't want the weapon traced back to his name.  It is currently a federal crime to knowingly purchase a firearm illegally. Those convicted could face 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000. Perhaps in an appeal to fellow lawmakers adamantly opposed to gun measures, Leahy touted the proposed legislation as ""consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment."" He also said the law would help prevent repeats of the deadly bungles that occurred in Arizona along the border with Mexico during Operation Fast and Furious by giving border patrollers a solid legal framework to catch smugglers with. During Fast and Furious, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives attempted to apprehend smugglers by allowing them to purchase guns with recorded serial numbers in the Arizona and transport them towards the border with Mexico, in hopes of intercepting them. Nearly 2,000 firearms from the program went missing, some turning up at killing scenes in Mexico -- and at the site of a December 2010 gun battle in Arizona that left U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian A. Terry dead. ""I hope that those who have been concerned about Fast and Furious, whose investigation established that it was the local ATF agents in Arizona who initiated and so poorly implemented that effort, will join with us to close the loophole in the law that Mexican drug cartels are continuing to exploit,"" Leahy said. The Senate Judiciary Committee will consider the measure on Thursday, said Leahy, who is the committee's chairman. The meeting will likely also address three other pieces of legislation aimed at reducing gun violence, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein's controversial assault weapons ban.","The law should stop Mexican drug cartels from easily obtaining U.S. firearms .
New law will punish those who buy guns and ammo for others .
It stiffens penalties for gun smuggling .
If caught, violators could face 10 years in jail and a $250,000 fine ."
"French President Francois Hollande met with Pope Francis privately Friday amid media speculation over his alleged affair with an actress. Hollande also plans to meet Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and French clergy while in Rome. Hours before he arrived at the Vatican, a small bomb exploded in central Rome near a French foundation and French cultural center, police said. The blast damaged three cars and broke windows in two nearby buildings, said Agostino Vitolo, a spokesman for Italy's military police, or Carabinieri. There's been no claim of responsibility for the bomb. It's unclear whether its detonation is linked to the visit by the French President. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since claims in the French magazine Closer of a two-year affair with actress Julie Gayet. The allegations of an affair have left the position of the President's partner, Valerie Trierweiler, in some doubt. It's not clear whether she will accompany Hollande on a state visit to Washington next month. Hollande and Trierweiler are working to issue a ""clarification"" concerning their relationship, Trierweiler's attorney, Frederique Giffard, told the French daily newspaper Le Figaro in an interview published late Thursday. After the alleged love affair, Trierweiler ""truly wants to resolve the matter in order to come out of it in the most dignified way possible,"" Giffard told Le Figaro. Trierweiler has been Hollande's partner for several years. Last weekend, she left the hospital where she'd spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match magazine reported. The same magazine -- where Trierweiler is a longtime correspondent -- said Saturday that she would recover for ""several days"" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande may hope his visit to Rome will help improve his standing in France, a majority-Catholic country. His relationship with many Catholics was damaged by a bruising battle last year over the passage of a law allowing same-sex marriage and adoption. The measure was one of Hollande's election pledges. The Catholic Church in France opposed the legislation. Many of the faithful joined huge marches in protest against it, but they were unable to stop it from becoming law. Nationwide, Hollande has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election in 2012, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life. A recent survey by French pollster Ifop with French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than 80% of respondents had not changed their opinion of the President based on the allegations of an affair.","President Francois Hollande meets with Pope Francis at the Vatican .

"Ukraine's President announced progress on a ceasefire agreement Wednesday with Russia, but U.S. President Barack Obama greeted it with skepticism and Moscow downplayed it. Obama, speaking in Estonia ahead of a NATO summit in Wales, said he was aware of the reported deal, as conflicting accounts emerged from Russia and Ukraine. But he said it was too early to see if all sides would follow through. Any ceasefire effort has not worked up to now, he said, ""either because Russia has not supported it or pretended it is not controlling the separatists"" in eastern Ukraine. ""Having said that, if in fact Russia is prepared to stop financing, arming, training and in many cases joining with Russian troops' activities in Ukraine, and is serious about a political settlement, that is something that we all hope for,"" Obama said. Meanwhile, France, a member of NATO, won't be delivering the first warship it is due to deliver Russia as part of a 2011 contract, the office of French President Francois Hollande said. ""The President of the Republic has noted that, despite the prospect of a ceasefire that remains to be confirmed and implemented, the conditions for France to authorize the delivery of the first (warship) are not authorized,"" the statement said. Since mid-April, Ukrainian forces have been battling pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Kiev and the West say the rebels are supported by Moscow -- a claim Moscow denies. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office initially said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to ""a full ceasefire"" following a phone call, but subsequently indicated they had agreed on a process that could lead to a truce. ""The conversation resulted in an agreement on ceasefire regime in the Donbas (eastern Ukraine region),"" said the statement from the presidential press office. ""The parties reached mutual understanding on the steps that will facilitate the establishment of peace."" Earlier, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN there was ""no confirmation of a ceasefire because Putin cannot agree (to) a ceasefire because he is not party to the conflict. ""What was agreed were steps that would lead to a ceasefire. The important thing is to bring an end to the bloodshed and to stop the firing. Everyone is trying to de-escalate the conflict."" Peskov also said the longer term issue of constitutional reform in Ukraine was not discussed. However, the spokesman told Russian state news agency Itar-Tass that Putin's view on possible ways out of the crisis ""largely coincides"" with that of Poroshenko. Putin's roadmap . Russia's President presented his roadmap for a ceasefire to journalists Wednesday, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Setting out his seven-point plan, Putin said both parties in the conflict must negotiate immediately and stop ""any offensive military operations by the army, armed forces and self-defense groups of the southeast of Ukraine towards Donetsk and Luhansk."" Russia routinely refers to the rebels as self-defense forces. Putin called for Ukrainian troops to pull back to a distance that would mean they can't fire shells on communities. He also urged an end to the use of military aircraft against civilians and an exchange of all hostages. The Russian President said the sides should ""provide full and objective international control over the conditions for the ceasefire and monitoring of the situation."" Humanitarian corridors also should be opened to permit delivery of aid to communities in Donetsk and Luhansk, he added, and workers should get access so they can rebuild cities' infrastructure. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk dismissed Putin's roadmap as looking like a ""rescue plan"" for the rebels, and said Russia could not be trusted to stick to any agreement. ""This plan is yet another attempt to trick the international community on the eve of NATO summit and avoid the EU decision of the next level of sanctions against Russia,"" he said, according to the Cabinet's press office. ""Putin's real plan is to destroy Ukraine and renew the USSR."" Obama flies to Europe with a warning for Putin . Rebels question ceasefire . A rebel spokesman in eastern Ukraine expressed doubt a ceasefire could hold and demanded federal troops withdraw from the region, according to RIA Novosti. An aide to another rebel leader, the DPR's First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Purgin, told the news agency that Poroshenko's ceasefire move was unilateral and was ""impractical"" while there were still Ukrainian forces in the disputed region. ""This is some sort of a game by Kiev. This was completely unexpected. This decision was made without us,"" Purgin's aide quoted him as saying, according to the news agency. Putin has consistently argued that Russia has no say over ending the conflict because it is not involved in it on the ground. U.S. and NATO officials say that in recent days Russia has sent its own troops and heavy weaponry into Ukraine, as well as training and arming the rebels. Obama vows support . Obama, giving a speech in Tallinn, Estonia, ahead of a NATO summit this week, said a vision of a Europe dedicated to peace and freedom is ""threatened by Russia's aggression against Ukraine."" It challenges the most basic principles of the international system: that no border can be redrawn at the barrel of a gun, Obama said. He vowed NATO will always come to the defense of its member states, including the Baltic nations. ""We will defend our NATO allies, and that means every ally,"" he said, including Estonia. Ukraine is not part of NATO, but the alliance has said it will support Kiev in the face of what it says is Russian aggression. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel defended the U.S. response to the Ukraine conflict and dismissed any criticism that the diplomatic efforts have failed to de-escalate the tension. Hagel blamed Putin for fueling the Ukraine crisis. The Russian President ""continues to take very dangerous escalatory actions,"" Hagel told CNN. The continued escalation by Putin would bring further consequences, but Hagel added that ""we're not going to get into a military engagement, a war, over this with Russia."" On the battlefield . Traces of warfare remained starkly evident in eastern Ukraine near the town of Illovaisk. One road was a graveyard for burned-out military vehicles stretching for 1.5 miles: tanks, trucks, armored personnel vehicles. There was even a surface-to-surface missile laying on the side of the road. Shallow graves were dug a distance from the roadway, and an odor of decomposition permeated the air. CNN's Diana Magnay found a Russian military food box labeled ""Army of Russia,"" an apparent indication that Russia has some involvement in the conflict, though Moscow vehemently denies it. Apparel belonging to the Ukrainian National Guard was also found among battlefield debris, but it was unclear Wednesday what happened in the recent fire fight between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. Military exercises . Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council announced Wednesday that Ukraine would host multinational exercises later this month with the United States, NATO and other nations. It said 200 American soldiers are expected to take part in the exercise, alongside about 1,000 servicemen from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Britain, Canada, Georgia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Romania and Spain. Earlier, speaking alongside the Estonian President, Obama announced that additional U.S. personnel and aircraft are being rotated through the Baltics as part of NATO operations. Obama's trip to Estonia, before he heads to the NATO summit in Wales, is meant to reassure nervous Eastern Europe that Putin's support for separatists in Ukraine doesn't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere. The United States and European Union have agreed that additional economic sanctions are needed to curb Russia's actions in Ukraine. ""The sanctions that we've applied so far have had a real effect on Russia, and I think it's important for us to continue to impose costs on Russia, so long as it is violating basic principles of international law,"" said Obama. European nations will consider proposals for ""significant further steps"" against Russia on Wednesday afternoon, an EU statement said. The proposed sanctions regard ""access to capital markets, defense, dual use goods, and sensitive technologies,"" the statement added.","Putin may face consequences but U.S. won't go to ""war"" with Russia, Hagel says .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Violence flared overnight in Bangkok amid anti-government demonstrations intended to drive Thailand's Prime Minister out of office. Tens of thousands of protesters have disrupted traffic at major intersections and marched on government offices in Thailand's large and hectic capital city this week. The protests, dubbed ""Bangkok shutdown,"" had begun Monday without serious incident. But on Tuesday night, two people were shot and wounded, an explosive device was thrown at an opposition leader's house, buses were set alight and police officers were attacked, according to authorities. The protesters say they want Thailand's political system overhauled instead of new elections scheduled for next month. They're demanding that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government be replaced with an unelected ""people's council."" Their numbers dropped from a peak of as many as 170,000 on Monday evening to about 60,000 on Tuesday evening, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, Thailand's security chief. He said roughly 10,000 demonstrators had stayed out on the streets overnight as others returned to their homes in the Bangkok area. Protest leaders disagree with the government's estimates of their numbers. They say they had more than one million people on the streets on Tuesday night. Intersections occupied . Since Monday, groups of demonstrators have occupied seven main intersections in Bangkok and marched on several government buildings, including the labor, commerce and foreign ministries. The protests have caused some disruption in central Bangkok, but large areas of the sprawling capital city so far remain unaffected. Authorities have deployed about 20,000 security personnel to keep watch throughout the city. The rallies are orchestrated by the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) protest group, led by Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the opposition Democrat Party. The government has offered talks with protesters and other concerned parties to discuss a way out of the impasse and the possibility of postponing the election. But Suthep's group has rejected the offer. Unrest overnight . With Thailand still scarred by deadly civil unrest in 2010, police and demonstrators have both pledged not to resort to violence. But amid the tense atmosphere in parts of Bangkok, pockets of unrest sparked on Tuesday night. An explosive device was thrown at the house of opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, Paradon said. Abhisit, the leader of the Democrat Party, was not in the house at the time and nobody was wounded by the blast, Paradon said. The case is under investigation and it is not certain at this point whether the attack was politically motivated, he said. Abhisit, a former prime minister, has denied being a member of the PDRC but has appeared on stage and among the crowds at some of their demonstrations. At Pathumwan, one of the major occupied intersections, two protesters were shot and wounded by unidentified attackers, Paradon said. One of the protesters suffered serious, but not life-threatening, injuries, he said. The other had minor injuries. In the Lumpini Park area, protesters' guards attacked four police officers who were gathering intelligence, police said. One of the officers remains in the hospital after the assault. At Nang Lerk intersection, where scores of people have been protesting for months, two buses were set on fire, Paradon said. Dispute over elections . Rights groups, the United Nations and the United States have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations. Since demonstrations against Yingluck's government began in November, eight people have died and 470 have been wounded, authorities said. In a bid to cool tensions, Yingluck dissolved the nation's parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political reforms. The national Election Commission has urged the government to postpone elections amid the continuing unrest. Yingluck offered to meet with protest leaders and election commission officials Wednesday to discuss whether to delay the vote, her office said. But Akanat Prompan, a PDRC spokesman, said Yingluck's offer of talks wasn't an answer to the problems. The protesters want to see changes to Thailand's political system enacted before elections take place, he said, and the demonstrations will continue until they achieve that goal. Travel warnings . Dozens of countries have issued travel advisories amid fears the tensions could erupt into violence. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has urged U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings in the city and to ensure they have a stock of cash and essential items in case the situation deteriorates. ""While protests have been generally peaceful over the last two months, some have resulted in injury and death,"" its online warning said. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational, and can escalate into violence without warning."" The protest group has said that it will allow ambulances to pass along the roads it blocks, and that it will not block access to airports and public transportation. The U.S. government supports ""a democratic process to resolve the ongoing political tensions in Thailand,"" Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said Monday. ""We also continue to urge all sides to refrain from violence, exercise restraint and respect the rule of law,"" she said at a regular news briefing. ""And we do, I would note, applaud the restraint shown thus far by government authorities in this regard."" Ambitious goal . Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok. Thaksin's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast Thailand. His supporters, known as ""red shirts,"" support the holding of elections on February 2. Kocha Olarn and Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: Authorities report several violent incidents overnight, including shootings .

"Cairo (CNN) -- An angry crowd lingering near the Israeli embassy in Cairo after an attack on the building a day earlier turned on journalists reporting the incident Saturday, accusing at least one of being an Israeli spy. As a CNN crew filmed the embassy from across the street, another crew from American public television -- led by Egyptian television producer Dina Amer -- approached the building. The crew's Russian cameraman was preparing to film the embassy when a woman in the crowd began hurling insults at the TV team, Amer said. ""There was this older lady who decided to follow me and rally people against me,"" Amer recalled. ""She said 'you're a spy working with the Americans.' Then they swarmed me and I was a target."" A growing crowd surrounded Amer and her colleagues, as they tried to leave the scene. Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, a producer working for CNN, rushed to help escort Amer through the angry crowd. But suddenly the two reporters were pinned against the railing of an overpass by young men who were accusing Amer of being an Israeli spy. Yelling ""I'm Egyptian,"" Fahmy managed to pull Amer another 10 meters down the road, until the pressure from the mob overwhelmed the pair. Amer screamed as she and Fahmy were knocked to the ground and the crowd started to trample them. Other CNN journalists tried to reach in to help, but were pushed back by a wall of angry men. Fahmy lay on top of Amer, shielding her with his body. ""I was thinking, how powerless I was because there was no police to save us,"" Fahmy said. ""I was worried that they were going to rape her."" At that moment, a student bystander named Mohammed el Banna called out to the journalists and pointed out a nearby car. Somehow, Fahmy managed to carry Amer to the open door of the public television crew's car, where two of her female colleagues were waiting just a few feet away. The mob pounded on the windows and tried to reach into the vehicle as the panicked reporters fumbled and struggled to get behind the steering wheel. When Margaret Warner, a correspondent with the PBS program ""Newshour"" managed to get the vehicle moving away from the crowd, men threw stones at the departing vehicle. Amer had few words to describe the terrifying ordeal. ""They were animals,"" she said. Other Egyptian journalists told CNN they were also attacked Saturday while trying to report near the Israeli embassy. Ahmed Aleiba, a correspondent with Egyptian state television, said he was pursued by civilians and soldiers. ""I had to run because obviously they were targeting journalists,"" Aleiba said in a phone call with CNN. ""They attacked two other TV crews."" ""I was in the car getting ready to film. A soldier knocked on the window with his stick and said 'if you don't leave by midnight your car will be destroyed,"""" said Farah Saafan, a video journalist with the English-language newspaper Daily News Egypt. Journalists have been targeted before in Cairo. On February 2, dozens of journalists of different nationalities were beaten and pursued around the city while trying to report on pro-Mubarak demonstrations. The day descended into one of brutal street violence, as pro-regime supporters backed by men on horses and camels attacked opposition demonstrators on what became known as the ""Battle of the Camel."" And CBS News correspondent Lara Logan suffered a brutal sexual assault in Tahrir Square while covering the celebrations that followed former President Hosni Mubarak's resignation on February 11. On Saturday, as some journalists ran for their lives from the Israeli Embassy, the interim government was holding crisis talks with Egypt's ruling military council and top intelligence chief. The emergency session concluded with a pledge to honor Egypt's international treaties and defend foreign embassies. The government also announced plans to re-activate the country's 30-year-old emergency law. Application of the law had lapsed since the overthrow of Mubarak, according to a senior official in the National Security Directorate, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. One of the five measures announced after Saturday's crisis talks calls on authorities to make ""media and political powers accountable for inciting security lapses."" ""It's obvious that there is some sort of plan leading to military rule in this country,"" warned Egyptian state TV's Aleiba. ""The next step will be martial law.""","One Egyptian journalist is accused of being an Israeli spy .
