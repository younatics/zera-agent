"Some people here just wanted the drama to end. Others say it can never end, not as long as a white cop can shoot an unarmed black teenager to death without consequences. On the street in front of Ferguson's police station on Monday night, the tension crackled as hundreds of people awaited a grand jury's decision and chanted demands for an indictment. They were denied. No indictment, the grand jury said. Officer Darren Wilson will not be charged in the August 9 killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. ""They don't care about black people,"" said Danielle Hines, in the throng outside the police station. ""They treat us like criminals. This is what it feels like to be black in America."" Get the latest updates . The crowd surged toward metal gates in front of the station. Some people were crying; many were angry. They threw their hands up and screamed. A chant arose, "" F*ck the police!"" They were met by a phalanx of cops in full riot gear. ""No justice, no peace!"" It soon turned ugly. Protesters turned their rage on police vehicles and boarded-up storefronts. The air was heavy with noxious gas. Police denied it was tear gas, but CNN reporters insisted they had been tear-gassed. Brown's shooting death ignited two weeks of violent protests last summer in Ferguson and rekindled the national debate on race and the criminal justice system. Supporters of Brown's family backed witness accounts that Wilson fired while Brown had his hands up in surrender. Wilson's supporters say that Brown was the aggressor and the officer fired in self-defense after the teen tried to take his gun. What's next for Officer Darren Wilson? 'I'm scared. This is so sad' The emotional response to the grand jury decision spoke to issues far larger than Ferguson -- to America's deep racial divisions. Deidre Johnson, who is raising four boys, had tears in her eyes as she learned the grand jury's decision. ""I just know they can't walk on our streets,"" she said. ""I'm scared. This is so sad."" Another mother echoed her feelings. ""I hate this for our youth,"" said Shellie Robinson, who has a 19-year-old son. ""We've been fighting for 100 days. This breaks my heart."" The head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which for decades has fought racial injustice in the Deep South, said Ferguson underscores a flawed and biased justice system. What's next for Brown family? ""The events in Ferguson have made vivid just how wide the gulf is between the police and those who are policed in so many communities in our country,"" said Richard Cohen. ""It's a gulf that's been formed by the history of discrimination in our country, a gulf that has been deepened by the systemic biases in our current criminal justice system. It's a gulf that breeds suspicion and mistrust, a gulf that undermines the very legitimacy of our system of justice."" President Barack Obama, speaking after the announcement, said: ""We need to recognize that the situation in Ferguson speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation."" At Morehouse College in Atlanta, about 200 students chanted: ""Ferguson's hell is America's hell."" They chanted the names of other black men and women killed by police and quoted civil rights hero the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. His daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, had hoped people would rise above anger and make history. ""Decades from now, what do we want historians to write about this moment?"" she asked. She urged protesters to speak up, but refrain from violence. ""Historians, 40 years from now, can reflect that we decided to live in such a way that humanity could continue,"" she said. ""Nonviolence 365 (days a year) is the choice that we must make. The alternative may well be a civilization plunged into the abyss of annihilation."" Protests spread far beyond Ferguson . 'This is our moment, St. Louis' Another religious leader, St. Louis Archbishop Robert Carlson, echoed calls for a restrained reaction. ""This is our moment, St. Louis,"" he said several hours before the grand jury's findings were announced. ""Whatever the grand jury decides, we can be an example for the rest of the world. Everyone is watching what we will do next, and violence is not the answer."" Tory Wilson, co-founder of the ""Hands Up United"" organization, urged calm and restraint -- by the police. ""I'm urging calm for the police officers to not pepper spray me, tear gas me, mace me and shoot rubber bullets,"" he said. ""People need to urge the police to be calm. Stop hurting kids, stop traumatizing our communities."" Many questioned why, given the volatile emotions on the streets, prosecutors waited until long after darkness fell to announce the decision. Tension had been building in Ferguson for days. A crowd gathered outside police headquarters Monday evening, chanting, ""Indict that cop!"" and ""Tell me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like!"" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . Ray Lewis stood out among the demonstrators. He was white, and he wore a police uniform. He carried a sign that said, ""Police: try love."" A retired police captain from Philadelphia, Lewis came to support the protesters and draw attention to what he considers excessive use of force by police across the country. ""I wanted to bring a white police captain's face to show people in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, that too often blacks are shown as rioting and as criminals. And that is just not true,"" he said. ""Think twice about judging these people."" He insisted he wasn't anti-cop. ""I am anti-corrupt cop,"" he said. He was surrounded by people chanting, ""Mike Brown! Mike Brown!"" He said there's a lot of truth to what's being said about white cops not hesitating to pull the trigger on young black men. Police should recruit officers more sensitive to racial issues, Lewis said. Otherwise, police can be perceived as an occupying force. ""There's a thousand Fergusons all over America.""

"(CNN) -- Maybe if you're a New Yorker, you grow accustomed to the sight. Maybe if you live in the city, it becomes just another part of the Manhattan landscape. But if you're from somewhere else, visiting, and you're not expecting to encounter it. . . . Well, you sense that you've been in front of this building before, even though you never have. You feel it before you fully see it. So it was, early on a recent afternoon, that I was walking east on 72nd Street, approaching Central Park West. I glanced to my left. To say the building is spooky is perhaps too easy. Yet everything about it -- the high gables, the balustrades, the gas lanterns burning even in the daytime, the black iron gates leading into the open interior courtyard -- seems purposely designed to give off an aura of portent. Possibly that impression is merely retrospective -- most likely, when the massive residential building was constructed well over a century ago, the desire was simply to erect a place of urban elegance. And perhaps to the people who live there now, it looks only like home. When the 1968 movie ""Rosemary's Baby"" was filmed, and the exterior of this building -- the Dakota -- was chosen as the site of the eerie tale, the die may have been cast. For anyone who ever saw the movie, the temperature drops a few degrees as soon as those walls come into sight. Yet it is what happened here 29 years ago this week that draws curious visitors still. I heard a voice behind me. ""Is this where. . .?"" A young woman was asking her friend the question. ""Yes,"" the friend said, not needing to hear the rest. Mark David Chapman shot John Lennon to death next to those courtyard gates on the night of December 8, 1980, as Lennon was returning to his home inside the Dakota. Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had spent the evening at a recording studio known as the Record Plant, working on a song called ""Walking on Thin Ice."" As they neared the entrance to the Dakota just before 11 p.m., Chapman, who that same afternoon, at the same entrance, had asked for and received an autograph from Lennon, waited with a gun. Lennon never had a chance. He would be pronounced dead at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. His public life had been somewhat quieter since the breakup of the Beatles; although many of his admirers around the globe were aware that he had become a resident of New York, relatively few knew exactly where in the city he lived. On the night of the murder, though, as the news of his death quickly spread, so, too, did photographs and live television images of the Dakota. The building on that night became synonymous with heartache, with senseless loss, with joy extinguished.. And here -- as in the waning days of 2009 you find yourself standing on this block without having planned it, as you look at the building you have never before seen with your own eyes -- is what strikes you: . To anyone in this city, in this country, in this world, who is younger than 32 or 33 years old, the memory of Lennon is of a man who has always been dead. The murder was past tense by the time people who are now that age first became aware of his name. The Dakota, in its own way, may be, to them, like Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., or the triple underpass in Dallas. A place where something terrible happened, yes, but something terrible that happened in history, not in the recollected narrative of their daily lives. I crossed the street called Central Park West and stepped onto the pathway to the park itself. A little girl, around five years old, was coming out of the park with her parents. They obviously had been talking about Lennon, for she said to them: . ""Is that where he's buried?"" As if approaching Grant's Tomb. Her father said to her: . ""No, he was killed there. I don't know where he is buried."" And they crossed the street, toward the Dakota. The array of John Lennon merchandise for sale by vendors at the entrance to the park -- photos, drawings, postcards -- is understandable from a purely commercial point of view, but is jarring nonetheless near the shadow of the building where he died. It may not be intended as a sign of disrespect, and maybe the sight of this, too, is something to which people who live in New York have long ago become accustomed. Just inside the entrance to the park is the famous Strawberry Fields, named in his memory. The main gathering point is the mosaic with, at its center, the single word: ""Imagine."" One sign near the mosaic announced that the playing of musical instruments is not permitted, but on this day a man sat on a bench facing the mosaic and strummed a wooden acoustic guitar. As he played the song ""In My Life,"" he sang, with a wavery voice, the words: . ""There are places I remember. . . ."" Fans remember Lennon . On Tuesday, as the anniversary of the murder arrives, perhaps the mood will be solemn in Strawberry Fields. But on this day, at least on this hour of this day, it was intermittently lighthearted. People sprawled on their backs on top of the mosaic, grinning and spreading their arms and legs in ""Hard Day's Night"" or ""Help!"" quasi-Beatles poses. Friends with cameras knelt near them, trying to angle the lens upward at a severe enough degree to include the looming vision of the Dakota in the shot. There was a little informal line as people waited their own turn to pose on the ""Imagine"" mosaic. The man with the guitar sang: . ""But of all these friends and lovers. . . ."" Another snap of another camera. "". . .there is no one, compares with you. . . ."" Twenty-nine Decembers ago, a man on 72nd Street wanted only one thing: . To get home for the night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Greene: The events of 29 years ago still draw visitors to the Dakota .

"For more than 30 years, ""Reading Rainbow"" has taught children in America to love books. By Wednesday, that love had come back in the form of $6.4 million in donations. The funds raised in a Kickstarter campaign to expand the digital presence of what started as an educational public television show burst the seams, broke the dam and went through the roof. Actor LeVar Burton had hoped to raise just $1 million in five weeks' time to create a Web version of Reading Rainbow's popular tablet app, then give access to it for free to underprivileged classrooms. It took 11 hours to meet that goal, when he launched the campaign on May 28. And the donations kept gushing in. ""It was humbling, stunning and a good story,"" Burton has said. When the fundraiser closed out Wednesday, more than 105,000 people had given $5.4 million, and whopping generosity by another celebrity added a chunk to that pile. Last week, comedian and ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane pledged to match donations in the last five days of the campaign up to $1 million. Donors made sure he ponied up the whole sum. Born on TV . ""Reading Rainbow"" made its debut in 1983 on public television with a simple idea: Use the medium to keep kids reading during summer by urging them to ""take a look"" in a book. The popular public television show ended its run in 2009, but Burton, the host, stuck with child literacy and the ideas behind the beloved show. Viewers moved to digital media. The Rainbow joined them, and the app was born. Burton has said the new tools funded by the campaign will allow more children and educators to use ""Reading Rainbow"" materials. The Web version will be accessible through a paid subscription, but Burton aims to provide it for free to disadvantaged classrooms and hopes the Web-based version will meet the needs of teachers and homeschoolers. It will include lesson plans and tools to track students' reading progress. What makes a good story hasn't changed much since ""Reading Rainbow's"" debut, Burton has said. Technology has. So, Burton also plans to use part of the donations to spread digital offerings to mobile phones and video game consoles. Inspired by 'Roots' Burton said he realized the power of TV as a medium for educating and informing viewers when he played Kunta Kinte on the ""Roots"" miniseries, based on Alex Haley's novel about slavery. The story captured the nation as millions tuned in to watch the miniseries that during the late 1970s gave dignity to the experience of African-Americans. Decades later, after reading a book on an iPad for the first time, he saw the potential to create an interactive reading experience. Burton acquired the rights to the ""Reading Rainbow"" brand and created his company, RRKidz. He envisioned an app that could interact with the audience in ways the show never could. He launched it in 2012, and in its first 18 months, users read 10 million books, making it the No. 1 free educational app in the iTunes store for two years. ""I wanted to put in the hands of kids a library of books and videos, like the TV show did, all in the service of inspiring a love of literature and exploring the world -- connecting the real world to the literature that kids are reading,"" said Burton, who received the Impact Award for his efforts to instill ""a lifelong love of reading in children"" during Children's Book Week. Burton has said that he would like underserved children to have access to more diverse books. He believes that they should be able to see themselves in characters that appear in literature they read. Dire need . Reading Rainbow expands into a growing literary desert among youths in the United States. In the last 30 years, children and adolescents say they have spent markedly less of their recreational time with books, according to research by advocacy group Common Sense Media. On his TV show, Burton became a trusted friend to children, parents and educators, recommending a variety of books and taking viewers on book-related field trips. He invited kids to recommend books in a segment, using the famous line, ""but you don't have to take my word for it."" It was his cue to children to pick up a book themselves. Burton hopes more of them who should read more often will be able to soon.","More than 105,000 people donated over $5.4 million .

"(CNN) -- I was stunned. We were deep into the fall semester at the University of North Carolina journalism school, where I taught feature writing. I was showing the students an example of a travel article, one I had written for The New York Times about Plymouth, Massachusetts. I read a few paragraphs from the opening scene, with U.S. 44 winding through cranberry bogs, a billboard coming into view with images of Gov. William Bradford and Elder Brewster, the greeting in boldface letters: Welcome to Plymouth -- America's Hometown, and a black Pilgrim hat that conjured up memories of all those Thanksgiving pageants in grade school when Priscilla said: ""Speak for yourself, John."" A student in the second row said, ""Who's John? And ... this Priscilla?"" A student in front of her said, ""I've never heard of these people."" That's when a young woman in the front row said, ""Yeah, I kept wondering, who are these dudes?"" I felt sheer incredulity now. ""Capt. Myles Standish?!"" The no was in the silence. A silence that morphed into sympathy. They hadn't meant to make me feel so bad. A student at the other end of the second row squinted in deep thought, admitting that Myles Standish sort of rang a bell. ""Wasn't he the captain of the ship?"" I didn't know you could get through grade school without those Thanksgiving pageants and the Priscilla-John Alden-Myles Standish triangle immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Nor did I think you could get through the American history courses that follow or become a student at one of the top public universities in the land without encountering those names. Or Gov. William Bradford. Or Elder Brewster. Publishers of textbooks have pretty much dropped the Pilgrims. Maybe they are sensitive to separation of church and state, or don't want to jeopardize their sales to schools and school boards. It's true, too, that lots of more recent history has had to be added to textbooks, for World War II and the Cold War, not to mention Vietnam, the space race, the civil rights movement and the too many assassinations and assassination attempts. That leaves little or no room for the Pilgrims and what they did. But I say no more. Opinion: Some uncomfortable truths about Thanksgiving . No more forgetting, casting Priscilla and John Alden, Capt. Myles Standish, Bradford and Elder Brewster aside -- left in the ditch of history. Let's hear it for the Pilgrims! I say this not for personal reasons -- I am a member of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants -- but because their story is an important part of this country's history. When they boarded the Mayflower in Plymouth, England, in 1620, it was not because they didn't have anything better to do. They did not sail across the Atlantic, still a great unknown, simply to see what was on the other side. They came aboard the ship -- a very small ship for such a big ocean, all the more evident if you have stepped aboard the replica Mayflower II -- and sailed west because they had a deep and abiding desire to worship their God as they saw fit. There were 102 of them. The Pilgrims did not occupy passenger cabins, however small those cabins might have been back then. They were considered the cargo for the voyage, and so crossed in the cargo space, the deck -- a dark deck -- below the crew's quarters. Halfway across, the ship was damaged by a bad storm. In another storm, John Howland was swept off the deck of the ship into the ocean; he managed to grab a rope and was pulled back on deck. Oceanus Hopkins was born at sea. Peregrine White was born after they reached Cape Cod. The Mayflower dropped anchor in Provincetown Harbor on November 22, 1620. (Some historians give the date as November 11.) Later that day 41 men gathered in a cabin to draw up the rules of governance for their colony -- a document that has come to be known as the Mayflower Compact. Those 41 men then affixed their signatures to one of the great liberty documents of history. It would become the keystone for the U.S. Constitution. It took almost a month for the search party to find a suitable place for their settlement, but they finally found it: an abandoned Wampanoag village with a plentiful water supply, good harbor, cleared fields and a hill on which to build a fort for protection. The Mayflower pulled up anchor in Provincetown Harbor and dropped anchor in Plymouth Harbor December 21. The dead of winter. No Holiday Inn. Just cold, bleak shoreline, with only the trees and hills to offer shelter. The first passengers went ashore December 21 -- whether on Plymouth Rock is subject to debate. Richard Pickering, deputy executive director of Plimoth Plantation, points out that, as the naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison has noted, men in boats tend to avoid big rocks. Whatever the truth of the landing, the captain of the Mayflower did not simply put the Pilgrims ashore and return to England. Capt. Christopher Jones -- not Standish -- kept the ship in the harbor so the men could go ashore each day to build homes -- simple, one-room cottages the size of suburban garden sheds today -- then return to the safety of the ship. For future safety, a large gun was mounted on a platform atop the hill that overlooked the harbor. But the enemy that first winter was the ""general sickness,"" the near plague of colds, coughs and fevers. ""Because only five to seven men were well enough to tend the sick and bury the dead,"" Pickering said, ""a common burial was used."" In mid-March 1621, as the sickness was abating, Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag tribe, appeared and befriended them. Squanto, who had been captured by English sailors and lived briefly in London, showed them how to plant corn. Come spring, when Jones prepared to set sail for the return voyage -- a voyage delayed by the loss of members of his crew to the ""general sickness"" that had claimed so many of his passengers -- he invited any of the Pilgrims who wished to do so, to return. Half of them had died. Yet not one single one went. ""By the standards of that day or by the amphibious doctrine of any day,"" historian Morison wrote, ""the leaders of Plymouth Colony took incommensurate risks, yet they came through marvelously well. They attributed that success to Almighty God .... But the Lord helps those who help themselves, and these people were valiant in the face of danger, resourceful in difficulties, and possessed of an innate common sense, not only in dealing with the fools and rascals among themselves but with the enemy on our coasts, the American Indian."" The following autumn, to give thanks for the bounty of their crops and well-being, the Pilgrims -- 16 men, four women, 23 children and nine hired seamen or servants -- held a harvest festival. The record shows that the bounty included wild fowl, codfish, bass and ""a great store of wild turkeys."" Massasoit, the chief, arrived with 90 of his men to be ""entertained and feasted"" in a three-day celebration of the harvest. ""During the course of the event,"" Pickering said, ""they went out and killed five deer, which they presented ceremonially to the men they perceived as the important men in the colony -- an honorific gift."" Our Thanksgiving has its roots in that gathering, though -- the wish to give thanks and the gathering to eat. As does Thanksgiving dinner. Cranberries, a native berry the Indians introduced them to, apparently got their name from the Pilgrims. The stem so resembled a crane they called them ""crane-berries,"" shortened over the years to cranberries. And pumpkins were such a staple the Pilgrims had a verse: . We have pumpkins at morning, and pumpkins at noon . If it were not for pumpkins, we should soon be undone. Thanksgiving by the numbers . So, welcome your family -- or make the trip ""to grandmother's house"" -- enjoy the Thanksgiving football games, carve the turkey, add the dollop of cranberry sauce, save room for the pumpkin pie ... and remember the Pilgrims. As I hope the students in my class do too, now, with their families and possibly their children.","Val Lauder: Many people don't know roots of Thanksgiving, story of Pilgrims in 1620 .

"The machete blades turned red with heat in the fire that the rubber workers built on a Liberia plantation, Thomas Unnasch remembers from a visit in the 1980s. This was how the men tried to quell the intense itchiness that comes with river blindness, a rare tropical disease. ""You can imagine how bad the itching must be, that running a red-hot machete up and down your back would be a relief, but it was,"" said Unnasch, whose laboratory works on diagnostic tests for the disease. About 18 million people have river blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, but more than 99% of cases of this disease are found in Africa. It goes by the technical name ""onchocerciasis,"" and it spreads through small black flies that breed in fast-flowing, highly oxygenated waters. When an infected fly bites a person, it drops worm larvae in the skin, which can then grow and reproduce in the body. Unlike malaria, river blindness is not fatal, but it causes a ""miserable life,"" said Moses Katabarwa, senior epidemiologist for the Atlanta-based Carter Center's River Blindness Program, which has been leading an effort to eliminate the disease in the Americas and several African countries. Some strains cause blindness, while others come with more severe skin disease. With time, generally all strains of the disease can lead to rough ""lizard"" skin, depigmented ""leopard skin"" and hanging groins. Another big problem among patients is itching, which happens when the worms die inside a person. In southwest Uganda, the locals call the disease ""Obukamba,"" referring to the symptoms of distorted skin appearance and itchiness, Katabarwa said. In western Uganda, he said, ""the fly is called 'Embwa fly' or dog fly, for it bites like a dog!"" There is no vaccine for river blindness, but there is a drug, called ivermectin that paralyzes and kills the offspring of adult worms, according to the Mayo Clinic. It may also slow the reproduction of adult female worms, so there are fewer of them in the skin, blood and eyes. The pharmaceutical company Merck has been donating the treatment, under the brand name Mectizan, since 1985. Elimination efforts . Great strides have been made against this disease. In the Americas, it was eliminated in Colombia in 2007 and in Ecuador in 2009. The biggest area of concern is Africa. In 1995 the African Programme for Ocnhocerciasis Control was founded by a group of nongovernmental organizations, governments, and United Nations agencies, with the World Health Organization overseeing it. The APOC partnership, which includes the Carter Center, has given out 500 million ivermectin treatments between 1995 and 2010, according to a new study in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Rare tropical disease close to eradication . The organizations and governments involved in APOC have collectively avoided 8.2 million years of life that would have been lost to unhealthiness as a result of this disease from 1995 to 2010, the study said. The study projected that APOC's impact will be even greater from 2011 to 2015, avoiding 9.2 million years of life that would have otherwise been lived in agony from this disease. In Uganda, Katabarwa's home country, the country's goal is to eliminate the disease by 2020. The Ministry of Health and the Carter Center, partners of APOC, are working toward making that happen. Instead of the standard ivermectin treatment of once a year, Katabarwa and colleagues have been working on distribution every six months. More frequent treatments eliminate more baby worms and reduce the reproductive capacity of the adult female worms inside patients' bodies, Katabarwa said. Where possible, they are also treating fast-flowing waters with a biodegradable insecticide called Abate to wipe out the larvae of the infectious black fly population. And they are training local populations to give out the medicine and keep track of who has been treated. 'You never sleep' It can't be overstated that the worms itch, a lot. Sometimes, said Unnasch, people infected with the worms are driven to suicide. Katabarwa also has stories of people inflicting harm upon themselves because of the itchiness. There are cases where people boil water to pour on themselves, he said. ""You scratch yourself until you damage your skin,"" Katabarwa explains. This leads to other health problems: The scratch marks bleed, making you more prone to bacterial infections. Children with the worms can't concentrate because they are scratching themselves all day and night. ""You never sleep,"" Katabarwa said. ""Some people use a clay pot and break it to scratch themselves because the nails are not enough."" Relief from itchiness comes with the ivermectin -- even for someone who has lived with the disease for more than 50 years, he said. By taking the drug frequently, the skin can partly heal. Unfortunately, for patients who lose all sight, blindness is irreversible because the optic nerve is damaged. Skin that has hardened, sometimes to the point where needles can't penetrate it, will not reverse itself, either. The side effects from the medicine can also be nasty: Ivermectin may cause fever, itching, skin rash, joint or muscle pain, rapid heartbeat, and painful, tender glands. Less common side effects include headache and swelling of a person's hands, feet, legs, face or arms. A person can also suffer a serious allergic reaction from it, so health workers bring antihistamines. ""If your immune system is very efficient, it will try to attack the dead worms"" that the medicine kills, Katabarwa explained. ""The itchiness that will be triggered is incredible. It happens within 10 minutes."" But most of the reaction subsides after two days. During that time, other biting insects such as mosquitoes, lice and bedbugs also die if they attempt to bite the treated patient. Guinea worm a greater challenge than smallpox . Because of the observed benefits of treating river blindness, infected people agree to take the medication despite the side effects,  Katabarwa said. ""When people see you with that skin, they don't want to be near you,"" Katabarwa said. How disease creates outcasts . One patient who made a big impression on Katabarwa was Semanza from the Rukungiri district of Uganda. In 1992, Semanza's skin looked like it was covered in dried mud, and flies swarmed around him. No one from his village wanted to be near him and he lived in a hut behind his family's home, separated from everyone else. ""He was really forgotten,"" Katabarwa said. Semanza's skin was so thick, because of river blindness, that it could break a needle. Katabarwa told the local health workers to give Semanza a dose of ivermectin every three months, which is more often than the standard distribution. Years later, when Katabarwa visited again, a man approached him and hugged him, smiling. ""Who are you?"" Katabarwa asked. It was Semanza. Two years later, they reunited again, and Semanza revealed that he had married and wanted many children. Katabarwa also remembers educating a particular community in northwest Uganda in 1993, which had all the right conditions for black flies that transmit river blindness to breed. A group of women in the community told Katabarwa that because of river blindness, people from surrounding areas did not want to marry anyone from their village. As a result, marriages had to happen within the community, including among relatives. Incest was strictly forbidden in their culture, but because of river blindness, it happened quietly, Katabarwa said. When Katabarwa returned five years later, the skin of infected individuals had greatly improved, and marriages with outsiders were happening again. ""These are stories of sadness, but after a few years there is hope,"" Katabarwa said. Empowering populations . Katabarwa has taken the approach of making use of Ugandan villages' kinship structures to assist with health care. People in villages often live on the land that belonged to their families several generations back, and do not move away in adulthood. This means that cousins live near each other, too, and will help with care for family members who are absent when health workers visit. It is easier and more efficient to distribute medications when tapping into these large family structures, Katabarwa said. Through this approach, many more women have joined the effort to distribute the medicines because they are comfortable working among their family members. Toward elimination . Elimination in 2020 is the goal for Uganda, but river blindness is harder to control in some parts of the country because of environmental and political factors, Unnasch said. There are places where insecticide resistance is a problem with a particular species of black fly that also moves around a lot, he said, especially on the border with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Doing any kind of river blindness control in Democratic Republic of the Congo is problematic because of safety issues, he said. A lack of government structure also makes it hard for health workers to coordinate efforts. But the flies don't respect the border between DRC and Uganda, and people belonging to the same tribe in both countries migrate across, too. ""If you're controlling it on the Ugandan side, and doing nothing on the DRC side,"" Unnasch said, ""you're never going to really eliminate it until you deal with these cross-border issues, and get an effective program going."" Unnasch commended the work that the Carter Center has been doing. He and Katabarwa travel together to Uganda every year. They are both part of an expert committee on river blindness through the country's Ministry of Health. ""When summertime rolls around, and the rains start to come and the flies go out, that's when we need to be there,"" Unnasch said.","Carter Center in Atlanta leading an effort to eliminate river blindness in several countries .

"Thieves have stolen eight shoes belonging to Holocaust victims from a museum in Poland, the latest in a series of thefts targeting memorials to those killed in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. The shoes were stolen from a permanent exhibition at the Majdanek State Museum in Lublin, spokeswoman Agnieszka Kowalczyk-Nowak told CNN on Wednesday. The museum displays 280,000 shoes belonging to Holocaust victims in a former barracks building on the grounds of the former concentration camp. The theft was uncovered when a security guard noticed Thursday that one of the cabinets used to display the shoes had been broken into, Kowalczyk-Nowak said. This triggered a count that revealed that eight shoes had been stolen. Holocaust artifacts bear witness . The theft was reported to police, and a criminal investigation is ongoing, she said. It comes less than a month after an iron gate with the notorious Nazi slogan ""Arbeit Macht Frei,"" which translates to ""work sets you free,"" was stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum condemned that theft, saying: ""While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust."" The famous ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" sign at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland also was stolen in 2009. It was discovered shortly afterward cut into three pieces. The concentration camp in Lublin, popularly known as Majdanek, housed Jews from Poland and across occupied Europe, as well as Soviet prisoners of war and political prisoners from Poland. According to the museum website, of an estimated 150,000 inmates who entered Majdanek, 80,000 people, including 60,000 Jews, were killed. ""In order to remove the traces of the crimes, the corpses of those who died and the murdered were burnt on pyres or in the crematorium,"" it states. eBay removes purported Holocaust memorabilia from site, apologizes .","Eight shoes belonging to Holocaust victims are taken from a museum in Lublin .

"(CNN) -- Yes, this really happened! A bunch of passengers left their seats to give their frozen plane a push at a snowbound airport in Siberia. That was the situation at Igarka Airport earlier this week where temperatures of minus 50 Celsius left a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft stranded on the runway. Passengers rallied to the rescue when oil in the plane's landing gear iced up, according to UTair, the airline whose livery the plane carries. According to the Komsomolskaya Pravda website, there were cries of ""Let's go!"" as two rows of passengers, dressed in heavy coats and thick gloves, each took a wing and apparently began shoving the aircraft into position. ""We all want to get home,"" one of the burly volunteers was quoted as saying. Video and images circulated on social media show the passengers succeeding in their mission, despite biting winds and freezing temperatures. Komsomolskaya Pravda said Russian officials were investigating whether any aviation safety regulations had been breached by the unorthodox take off. UTair said the aircraft was operated by a subsidiary, Katekavia, and that the parking maneuvers of aircraft and departure conditions were the responsibility of airport ground services. ""The problems at departure were caused by weather conditions, in particular, extremely low air temperature which is typical for this part of Krasnoyarsk region and sometimes gets as low as minus 50 Celsius,"" an UTair spokesperson told CNN. ""While the aircraft was parked at Igarka airport, its landing gear froze on to the aerodrome surface. In order to quickly resolve this issue the passengers assisted the tow truck to move the aircraft."" The plane and passengers were reportedly able to take off and landed safely several hours later in Krasnoyarsk, to the south of Igarka. Thankfully there was no need for further pushing as the temperature at their destination was a balmy minus 11 Celsius.","Temperatures of minus 50 Celsius cause aircraft's landing gear to freeze .

"Four members of a polio vaccination team were killed by militants Wednesday in western Pakistan's Balochistan province, police said. Attackers on two motorcycles opened fire at the team in the eastern part of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province. Two polio workers were killed during the attack, and two others who were injured died later at a hospital, said Imran Qureshi, a senior police officer. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The province's chief minister, Malik Baloch, vowed to protect polio vaccination teams and bring the attackers to justice. ""We will not bow down before terrorists,"" Baloch said. Militants have targeted anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan since U.S. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

"The Duchess of Cambridge's announcement today puts an end to months of pregnancy speculation. Number Two is on the way and with him or her comes a huge boost for the Royal Family. The level of excitement won't quite be the same as it was for Prince George -- but we can still expect great interest across the world and massive baby fever early next year. But why does the ""spare heir"" matter? One child is never enough for a monarch. Throughout history, the only way to secure a throne has been with a phalanx of children -- nine for Victoria, thirteen for George III. Aristocratic wives were once told they needed to provide an ""heir and a spare"" at least -- and the same has always been true for the royals. Once, this was because high mortality rates meant that the more children the better -- for the first born son didn't always come to be King. Henry VIII was the second son, who became heir and ascended at 17 after the untimely death of his brother, Arthur. George V was also the second son -- and also became heir after his elder brother died young from influenza. Both men married the women who'd been betrothed to their brothers -- Henry made Catherine of Aragon his queen and George wed Mary of Teck. The current Queen's father, George VI, was the second son of George V, and was never meant to be king. But when his elder brother, Edward VIII, gave up the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallace Simpson, the heir became the king -- much to his own surprise. Now we don't expect the second child will come to rule, but he or she still has a vital role in carrying out royal duties and obligations. The Royal Family - or ""Firm,"" as the current royals like to call it -- needs plenty of employees for the huge number of royal visits and receptions. What is different in 2014 is that the heir and the spare heir can be female. After the law changed last year to allow women the same rights of accession to the throne as men, females are no longer pushed to the back of the line. If the Duchess of Cambridge's baby is a girl, she will be the next in line to the throne after her brother -- even if more sons follow. This baby will be a huge boost to the Royal Family - and ""Brand Windsor"" across the world. But what will his or her life be like? The role of the second-in-line is not easy. For Princess Margaret being younger sister of the heir was no picnic -- she had all of the downsides of being royal, such as lack of privacy and restrictions on freedom, without the great compensation of becoming Queen. Unable to find a role for herself or marry the man she loved, the Princess sank into depression and ill health. Prince Harry, too, has been clear on how hard it is to find an occupation -- he was eager to fight on the frontline in Afghanistan but was accidentally exposed by Australian media and had to return. It's also been hard for him to find a woman who will take on the royal role. ""Royals are only private in the womb,"" said the governess of Elizabeth II. We are fascinated by royal children -- most of all by the second or the ""spare heir."" What will be even more difficult for this second child is that he or she will grow up in a world of camera phones and social media, where private photos are gold dust and royals are the biggest celebrity big game of all. The life of the second child can be exciting and dynamic -- but most of all it is one of extreme fame -- and a lot of responsibility.","The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting her second child, Buckingham Palace announced .

"In a case that Pope Francis says he's taken an interest in after speaking to one of the alleged victims, a Spanish judge on Wednesday filed preliminary charges of sexual abuse against three Catholic priests and a religious teacher. Investigating magistrate Antonio Moreno, in the southern city of Granada, ordered the suspected ringleader, a priest, to post a $12,500 bond in order to leave jail, according to a court statement and spokeswoman. The suspect posted the bond, and Moreno released the others from custody without bond, the statement said. The four must report regularly to authorities and can't have any contact or communication with two alleged male victims, the court statement said. The judge's decision came two days after the four were arrested, and just a day after Pope Francis told reporters that he called an alleged victim in August and urged him to come forward to authorities in Spain. ""The truth is the truth, and we must not hide it,"" Pope Francis said aboard the papal plane, CNN Vatican contributor John Allen reported in a story for the Boston Globe. The Pope confirmed that he received a letter from a young man describing his plight. ""I received it and I read it,"" Pope Francis said of the letter. ""I called the person and said, 'Tomorrow go to your bishop.' I wrote to the bishop so he could start his work, do the investigation and go ahead,"" the Pope said, Allen reported for the Globe. Spanish media have credited the young man's letter to the Vatican -- alleging the abuse when he was a teenaged altar boy -- and then the surprise phone call from the Pope as big steps toward preventing the events from remaining a dark secret. Attorney Javier Muriel, representing all four defendants, told CNN that they deny the charges, while acknowledging they know the man who brought the complaint. The court investigation is under seal, and since it began, a second man has come forward to allege similar abuses. The Andalusia regional government's education department in Granada is moving to terminate the contract for the high school religion teacher who's facing the preliminary charges. He's been teaching for seven years, up until Friday, but authorities do not want him back in the classroom, a department spokeswoman told CNN. On Sunday, the Archbishop of Granada and other clerics took the unusual step of prostrating themselves in the cathedral during Mass, ""asking forgiveness for the sins of Church, for all of the scandals that have, or might have, occurred among us,"" the Granada Archdiocese website reported. The archbishop usually does that once a year, on Good Friday, but he lay on the floor of the cathedral Sunday because of the seriousness of the allegations, a Granada Archdiocese spokeswoman said. The archbishop earlier had removed an unspecified number of priests from their duties pending an investigation, she said. The arrests of three priests in a single day over sexual abuse allegations is the biggest case of its kind in Spain, said a spokesman in Madrid for the Spanish church leadership, known as the Episcopal Conference. Since 1997, 10 priests have been convicted of sexual abuse, in individual cases, most recently in 2010, the spokesman said. The Pope has called for ""zero tolerance"" of sexual abuse by clerics and has said Catholic bishops ""will be held accountable"" for failing to protect children from such abuse.","Judge files preliminary charges of sexual abuse against three priests, one religious teacher .

During Tuesday night's finale, the ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" star was crowned the king of the dance floor as he and his pro partner, Witney Carson, were awarded the mirrorball trophy. The actor -- and now dancer -- was so thrilled, he was moved to tears. ""I cannot believe this,"" Riberio told co-host Tom Bergeron. ""I've wanted it forever. ... I don't even know what to say.

Yet he almost didn't get the opportunity to see it all the way through. The star injured himself during the course of the season to the point that he wasn't sure whether he'd be able to continue. But by the start of the two-part finale on Monday, Ribeiro rallied and turned in a tap dance solo that left viewers speechless. Despite his injuries, Ribeiro performed impeccably during Monday's episode and had the lead score going into Tuesday's finale. Fellow competitors Janel Parrish and Sadie Robertson were right at his heels, with ""Pretty Little Liars"" actress Parrish going into Tuesday's finale with a score of 77 and ""Duck Dynasty"" star Robertson in second place with a score of 78.

"(CNN) -- The nation's colleges have a serious rape problem. Five percent of college women experience rape or attempted rape every year on campus. Most universities are doing little to nothing about this. From 1998 to 2000, I was an assistant dean of students at the University of Virginia. Of the six universities where I have worked, the University of Virginia stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators. This issue, which affects so many students, is finally coming into light, led by the excellent reporting of Sabrina Rudin Erdely in Rolling Stone, detailing an alleged, horrific gang rape in a Virginia fraternity. Only now is the university really doing anything about it, some two years later. Its most recent action is to suspend all fraternities through Jan. 9, some 45 days or so. To an outsider this might seem like an admirable first step. In reality, it is a farce. Suspending fraternities' functions at this point essentially means that they are not able to have official parties during the week between Thanksgiving and final exams. One week. Fraternities are self-supporting houses off campus anyway, so who is to say they won't just have a social gathering in their houses and not call it a party? The trouble runs deeper, though. Recent interviews with university administrators show that they are highly reluctant to expel a student who commits rape (watch this eye-opening video). When I worked there, I was once asked to meet with a student who had been found responsible for sexual assault. He was instructed to read a book about sexual assault and then discuss it with me. That hardly seems like an adequate punishment. I also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found ""not responsible."" In most cases I was aware of, male students were not found responsible. Occasionally suspensions would occur; those were, of course, temporary. During my tenure there, rape survivors would commonly tell me that they had wanted to file charges against their attacker but were told by administrators that their cases were more fit for mediation. It is unconscionable to mediate a felony. And in fact, the Office of Civil Rights for the U.S. Department of Education ordered universities in 2011 to stop mediating rape cases. But the Office of Civil Rights doesn't seem to have deterred Virginia much. In a morally abhorrent move -- one I hope will be found illegal by the civil rights office during its investigation of the university's handling of sexual assaults -- Virginia actually offered complainants a process for an ""informal resolution"" that sounds just like a mediation process. It also theoretically allows the school to avoid publicly acknowledging a rape happened and ignores the threat to the safety of the community. Men who are responsible for rape need expulsion, not just a chance to give an insincere apology to avoid serious consequences. Let's remember that while recent news makes the University of Virginia seems more egregious than most institutions, a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the One in Four chapter and women in the One Less organization. They are pushing hard to make a difference They are working hard to educate their fellow students about the reality of rape and how to prevent it, and we all need to support them. We also need to remember that ultimately, we don't do a lot of good focusing on just one university. It is time to use research-based programs like The Men's Program, The Women's Program, Green Dot, MVP and Bringing in the Bystander to eradicate this problem. Furthermore, we need universities to have adjudication processes that are accessible to and trusted by students. Let's all work together to create a culture that reliably prevents rape and punishes rapists.","John Foubert: There's a rape problem on college campuses. Most universities do little about it .

"(CNN) -- Moldova's president Wednesday accused Romania of involvement in a huge anti-communist protest, much of it coordinated on Facebook and Twitter, which saw government buildings ransacked and police arrest scores of demonstrators. Protests over Moldova's election have gathered pace, fueled by Facebook and Twitter. Vladimir Voronin described riots in the Moldovan capital Chisinau against his ruling Communist party's victory in Sunday elections as ""very serious"" and pledged to take action in response. ""Romania is involved in everything that has happened,"" he said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency. ""Patience also has its limits."" An estimated 10,000 mainly students gathered Tuesday to protest what they say was a rigged election. Many in the crowd were summoned using social networking tools, particularly Twitter. IReport: Send your photos and emails. Protesters threw bricks at riot police who responded with batons and water cannon. Outnumbered, police retreated, leaving rioters to enter the parliament building and presidential offices where they smashed windows and started fires.  See images of the chaos » . Demonstrators claim Voronin's ruling Communist Party manipulated Sunday's election results to make it appear that it had won 50 percent of the vote, a majority that would allow the party to and amend the Constitution to allow Voronin to rule for a third term. Although election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found the voting largely free, many in the former Soviet state disagreed. ""There were too many frauds,"" said Alina Radu, director of the weekly newspaper Ziarul de Garda. Her newspaper's Web site asked readers Wednesday morning to send in instances of voter abuse. ""In just half an hour, we had tens and hundreds of cases,"" Radu said. Voronin said he was expelling the Romanian ambassador to Moldova and imposing visa restrictions on Romanians in response to the violence, RIA-Novosti said. The agency reported that Romania has denied involvement and was threatening retaliatory measures. Analysts saw Tuesday's demonstrations as a student-led action that ""caught the opposition political leaders by surprise."" ""Because I think that after talking to the Western observers, they didn't expect they would get any support for protests,"" said Tammy Lynch, senior fellow at Boston University's Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy. ""It seemed to be undirected,"" Lynch said. ""A lot of students felt angry they were being ignored and took out their anger on buildings."" Moldova's ties with Romania have become increasingly strained under Voronin, who has steered his country diplomatically closer to Russia since taking power in 2005. The president has repeatedly accused Romania of wanting to absorb his country. -- CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report .","Up to 10,000 gathered Tuesday in Moldova's capital Chisinau .

"Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN)This state launched the Clinton brand two decades ago and handed Hillary Clinton one of the biggest victories of her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama. But as she considers another bid for the White House in 2016, Arkansas isn't so friendly. In the final weeks of the 2014 election, top Democrats in Arkansas told Hillary Clinton and her associates that she wasn't welcome to stump for the party's candidates in the state, according to a knowledgeable source. While there were some in Arkansas who wanted her to come, the ""stay away"" contingent won the argument and Hillary Clinton was left to raise money for Sen. Mark Pryor from New York. Bill Clinton made up for the absence, making 13 stops in the state during campaign season imploring voters to not make the election a repudiation of President Barack Obama. Still, Democrats across Arkansas lost big. The governor's mansion flipped red, along with Pryor's Senate seat. The state's four-member House delegation is solidly Republican. The rout was part of a broader repudiation of Democrats across the South this election cycle. But the results in Arkansas were particularly tough for the Clintons and raise questions about whether the state most associated with the couple is no longer welcome territory ahead of Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 race. ""The coattails were short,"" outgoing Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN. ""It is a fact."" Bill Clinton handily won Arkansas during both of his presidential elections. But the politics of the South changed during his time in office as many states were increasingly dominated by Republicans. Arkansas was a genuine battleground state during the 2000 election, when Al Gore and George W. Bush both campaigned here and spent money on television ads. Seeking to distance himself from Bill Clinton after his impeachment, Gore didn't campaign with the former President and lost Arkansas to Bush by 5 points. By 2008, Arkansas was seen as so unfriendly to Democrats that Obama wrote the state off -- even as he won other southern states like North Carolina and Virginia that Republicans carried for decades. Before the 2014 election, Hillary Clinton's supporters -- many at the grassroots level in Arkansas -- would quietly talk about the former first lady's chances of competing and winning Arkansas in 2016. They touted her standing with white women and working class voters. But after Election Day, those optimistic Democrats are harder to find. ""Limited,"" said Vincent Insalaco, the chair of the Arkansas Democratic Party, when asked about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the state. ""It is limited here in Arkansas."" ""I think she could run a strong race here, but I think the electorate has changed,"" said Clarke Tucker, a newly elected Democratic state representative. ""The state has changed."" Hillary Clinton moved to Arkansas in 1974, joining her soon-to-be husband, Bill, who was already a rising political star in the state. The couple would go on to dominate the state's politics for the better part of two decades and left a long list of confidants -- known as FOBs or Friends of Bill -- in key Democratic positions across the state. But times have changed. Republican power bases in northwest Arkansas have grown, religious conservatives are a powerful voting bloc and the state's Latino population has yet to become a force at the ballot box. ""Arkansas is a real demographic nightmare for Democrats,"" said Andrew Dowdle, the vice chair of political science at the University of Arkansas. ""It is a complete reversal of fortunes."" All of this complicates the idea that Hillary Clinton could win Arkansas in 2016. During the 2008 primary, Hillary Clinton dominated Obama, winning 70% of the state, her largest victory during that year's primary fight. That was the only time she has been on the ballot in the state, however, and was a contest with just Democratic voters. The 2014 exit polls in Arkansas weren't positive for Hillary Clinton, either. Thirty-nine percent of voters said she would make a good president, according to the exit polls. Fifty-six percent said she would not. Those same exit polls found that former GOP Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also considering a 2016 run, is seen as a better presidential option in the state than Hillary Clinton. Fifty percent of voters in Arkansas said he would be a good president, compared to 46% who said he wouldn't. With the former first lady eyeing another run at the presidency in 2016, Democrats and Arkansas experts said that while she would easily win the Democratic primary, she would struggle mightily to overcome what has become a changed state. Democrats in Arkansas blame Obama -- not the Clintons -- for their losses. One reason Beebe, the outgoing governor, sees things getting better for Democrats in 2016 and beyond is because ""Obama will be gone."" ""I think it is all Obama,"" Beebe said. ""I don't think there is any question that most folks feel like it was a repudiation of the president and the president's policies. But I think it is cyclical and the reason I say that is if you look at the history."" ""Democrats are looking at what can she do different from Barack Obama,"" said Dowdle. ""If you are a Democratic party activist, you would end up hoping she would win white women. ... That idea that a woman candidate could end up running and making the gap grow is not going to happen.""

"(CNN) -- A year after leaving Syria, and I had almost forgotten how it feels to be under pressure and terrified all the time. How so easily you can become one of the nameless victims, considered lucky if you were even counted among the dead. But a year after fleeing from the civil war, I have come back -- to a place dominated by fear and chaos, one governed by the force of arms and of bombs. Why did I choose to come back to all this? The main reason is professional -- I am now working for Save the Children. But there is another reason -- a desire to see the country I left 12 months ago, and to see the situation and devastation through my own eyes, not through the filter of the media. Like most of my Syrian colleagues, I wasn't an aid worker before the conflict. This is a new field of work for many of us, but in it I feel that I have a responsibility to those Syrians who are trapped inside this never-ending conflict. Each time I interview a child or a mother, I have a responsibility to share their story and ensure the world does not forget them. Before I came back, I thought that perhaps people wouldn't want to speak to me -- that they would be scared to share their experiences. But actually, everyone was just relieved that there were people outside Syria who still cared. On my first day I was on the border, and stretched out before me I could see camps filled with tents and thousands of displaced people. I cannot imagine how these families are coping in these conditions, families like mine who are now collecting water in a jerry can and relying on food rations. And then I started to notice other things, smaller details that show how much life in Syria has changed. For example, I noticed that many of the cars were driving around without license plates. Why? Well I guess they don't need to -- who will fine drivers for their defiance? Anyway, now even the smallest problems are solved by weapons, and people feel they need bigger weapons and stronger connections to stay alive. Another change -- all of the men I saw had long beards. I was surprised to see even local people had them. I asked the people I am traveling with if this was common in this area before the war, and they tell me that it was not. That this is ""conflict fashion."" Fashion? Since when was conflict ever associated with fashion? I have seen destroyed buildings and war zones on TV and in the news, but returning here was the first time I had seen such destruction in real life. At first you can't believe your eyes, and you have to remind yourself that you are not watching an apocalyptic movie, but real life. It eventually dawns on you that this is not a film set, that there is life and there are families living in the remnants of these half-destroyed buildings. I wonder how these people do it. How do people who grew up like me adapt to a situation where virtually everything has been taken away? The answer is that when there is nowhere left to run, you simply have no choice but to find a way to survive. There are airstrikes so people create their own local warning siren. There is no electricity, so people make candles and rig up their own power systems using batteries. But I am shaken out of my thoughts by the shouts of a friend who is asking everyone to turn off the lights. It's evening, and the locals have heard that there may be an attack on the village we are in. We all move quickly to turn everything off and sit to listen to the reports on the radio. There is mention of a village just a couple of miles from us. My friend tells me this village might be attacked and we should stay on the floor. Then I hear the name of the village we are in. Then silence again. I look at the faces of my friends; pale, ironically smiling, feigned bravado. None of us say a word, and I swear I can hear our hearts beating. We all know tonight it could be us that are the next nameless victims. I spend most of the night in a state of paralyzed fear, until finally, at some point, we all fall asleep. The next day people wake as if nothing had happened. That is what life in Syria is like now -- you lived, you are lucky. Now you just have to get on with your day and hope that you will be so fortunate again.","Naeem: After leaving Syria, I forgot how it was to be constantly terrified .

"(CNN) -- Comprised of four main islands, and over 6,000 smaller ones, Japan stretches for around 1,500 miles from sub-tropical Okinawa in the south to the frozen climes of Hokkaido in the north. The bulk of the country's 127 million inhabitants live in urban areas, mostly on Honshu island, the country's largest. The capital since 1868, modern Tokyo is a sprawling mega city and home to over 36 million people. From the 12th century until the mid 19th century, Japan was a feudal society dominated by military leaders known as shoguns. A long period of self-imposed international isolation ended when the Emperor Meiji took direct control of the country in 1867 and began a period of modernization. Western trade began to influence the development of the country. The period also saw the beginning of Japan's pursuit of an overseas empire, the legacy of which still affects relations with its neighbors to this day. Japan is a constitutional monarchy, headed by 80-year-old Emperor Akihito. Although the emperor's powers are politically limited, he is regarded as the highest authority of the country's dominant Shinto religion. Reconstruction and recession . After the Second World War Japan witnessed spectacular economic growth, transforming a country physically and psychologically scarred by military defeat and the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima into a world leader in electronics and manufacturing, especially in the automotive industry. However, those post-war decades of high growth came to a juddering halt in in 1990, when real estate and stock market prices plummeted; the 1990s are now commonly known as the ""lost decade"". Japan has more government debt than any other developed nation -- nearly 230% of its GDP according to the CIA World Fact Book -- and has struggled to sustain steady economic growth. It has slipped into recession four times since 2008, the latest being the third quarter of 2014. That grim economic news led the country's current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to call a snap parliamentary election for December 14. Despite the country's financial challenges, compounded by an ageing population, Japan has some of the world's most valuable companies and remains a source of global innovation and cultural trends. It is the world's third largest economy in terms of GDP. Present day Japan blends modernity and tradition, with society and work environments structured around well-defined hierarchies. According to recent OECD figures, Japan has some of the most highly educated women in the world, yet ranks among the bottom of developed countries when it comes to employing women with college degrees; only 69% are in the workforce. While diverse in its climatic regions, much of Japan is mountainous and remains one of the world's most seismically active areas of the world. Earthquakes and regional relationships . On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the eastern coast of the Tohoku region unleashed a devastating tsunami. Over 15,000 people died and thousands more were displaced. The tsunami hit the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant causing extensive damage and a radiation leak, and leaving surrounding areas uninhabitable. The material damage from the earthquake and tsunami is estimated at around $300 billion. On the international stage, Japan exerts considerable soft power as a major aid donor and source of capital. Its projection of power militarily is limited by its post-war pacifist constitution. However pressure has been building from hawkish elements in the country to allow the Japanese Self Defence Forces to take a more assertive role. This summer Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet approved a white paper on defence policy that allows the military to act in support of its allies. The background to this recent revision of military policy has been an increase in regional tensions. While North Korea's missile program remains an ongoing security concern, conflicting territorial claims by Japan and China in the East China Sea over a group of islands known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China have inflamed nationalist rhetoric on both sides and strained relations between the countries. Other tensions with China and South Korea persist over the use of so-called ""comfort women"" by the Japanese military before and during the Second World War. While an official government apology was issued in 1993, known as the Kono statement, it remains a sensitive international issue and source of contention within Japan. Some conservative elements in Japan suggest there remains insufficient evidence to prove that the military directly recruited women as sex slaves. In September, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye has stated that no formal summit meeting with Abe can happen until ""sincere efforts to heal the wounds of the past"" are made.

"(CNN) -- From New York to Los Angeles and dozens of cities in between, protesters flooded the streets to denounce a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. A day after the country learned that Wilson wouldn't face criminal charges for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, at least 130 protests sprouted up across the U.S. Some demonstrations blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, the Tuesday night protests were largely peaceful. Atlanta . The Public Enemy anthem pumping from mounted speakers at a protest in downtown Atlanta captured the mood of the crowd Tuesday night. ""Fight the power,"" Chuck D and Flavor Flav shouted over the speaker. ""Fight the powers that be. ..."" About 300 people tried to follow the duo's advice. As helicopters circled above, black college students, white urban hipsters in skinny jeans, middle-aged socialists and black militants in berets gathered for a raucous rally to vent their anger. ""They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace,"" the demonstrators chanted at they amassed in front of the Underground Atlanta shopping district. Protesters also gathered outside CNN Center. Some held signs that read ""Enough"" and ""We are all one bullet away from being a hashtag."" One demonstrator wore a T-shirt that read, ""Racism isn't over but I'm over racism."" ""It's a travesty; it's just not right,"" ShaCzar Brown said, holding up a sign that said, ""Stop killer cops."" Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also saw emotional reaction Monday night when about 200 students gathered at Morehouse College to hear the grand jury's decision. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd when it came. Read what Darren Wilson told the grand jury . Some of the students at the historically black men's school looked at one another in disbelief, others started to tear up and a few stared ahead as their jaws dropped. Police sirens wailed in the distance as the students chanted: ""Ferguson's hell is America's hell."" Protests have been organized in more than 30 states, the District of Columbia and at least three other countries, according to information compiled by CNN and a site set up to help organize protest efforts. Oakland, California . Perhaps the greatest concentration of turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store. Some also set several bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access, footage from CNN affiliate KPIX showed. Some people were seen adding more items to the fires. New York . A massive protest wound its way from Union Square to FDR Drive and to the United Nations, Times Square and Harlem. ""Now it's not clear where we're going,"" said CNN's Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight. One demonstrator said he didn't even know about the protest until he saw it pass by his workplace on Times Square. He decided to join in. ""I just want to help bring about change. ... Sometimes I am profiled based on my race,"" said the protester, who is black. ""I think this is progress. ... Now we're going to make sure things are going to change."" 'A thousand Fergusons across America' As they marched, some protesters chanted, ""Mike Brown! Mike Brown!"" Police, who were nearby in large numbers, stayed back and let the marchers go. Protesters also briefly blocked one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel on Tuesday evening, but then headed off to the city's West Side. Los Angeles . A stretch of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles was shut down in both directions after protesters took roadblocks from the streets, along with debris, and placed them on the freeway, police said. And demonstrators gathered outside the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, Officer Sara Faden said. She said the protesters demonstrated peacefully. An LAPD spokesman said officers are allowing people to vent. ""We have detained people. We don't have any property damage to speak of,"" Officer Jack Richter said. ""We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights."" Boston . Mayor Marty Walsh estimated about 1,000 protesters took to the streets Tuesday night. The gathering was largely peaceful. ""It's a beautiful thing to see,"" demonstrator Daniel Jose Older said. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . Denver . Several hundred people took to the streets of Denver on Tuesday night, police said. Officers tried to prevent demonstrators from marching onto Interstate 25. Most protesters dispersed peacefully, but a ""small group"" refused and grabbed officers. Officers used pepper spray, and three people were arrested, police said. Dallas . About five protesters were arrested after marching on Interstate 35, CNN affiliate WFAA said. About 200 demonstrators gathered at Dallas police headquarters before marching onto the interstate, the affiliate said. Washington . In Washington, protesters lay down on a sidewalk outside police headquarters as if dead, according to a tweet by Nikki Burdine of CNN affiliate WUSA. Some had handwritten notes on their chests: ""Black lives matter."" Minneapolis . A woman in a group blocking an intersection was run over by a car in Minneapolis. The Star Tribune newspaper reported that the driver of the car honked at protesters before knocking a few people onto the hood of the vehicle and apparently running over the woman's legs. She was hospitalized with ""very minor injuries."" Chicago . About 200 members of the Black Youth Project staged a sit-in outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office Tuesday afternoon. They planned to be there for 28 hours. The time period symbolizes the average time that passes in America before another young black man is shot by a police officer, security guard or ""self-appointed vigilante,"" project member Charlene Carruthers told the Chicago Tribune. ""I think what happened yesterday is a great injustice to everyone that's been fighting for equality in this country,"" one Chicago protester told WGN on Tuesday. ""And I think that just because a bad decision was made doesn't mean people who believe in equality are going to fall silent.""

"Nearly half a million Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov during the first week of open enrollment for 2015, a sign the federal health care site has improved since its rocky rollout last year. The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that more than a million Americans submitted applications for coverage in the first week of open enrollment for 2015. From Nov. 15-21, 462,000 Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov, with a little under half, or about 220,000, of those being new purchasers. Those figures only include numbers from the 37 states that offer coverage through the federal site, rather than state-based exchanges . That's a marked improvement from the 2014 open enrollment period, when 27,000 people signed up for coverage on HealthCare.gov during the entire first month. ""We had a solid start, but we have a lot of work to do every day between now and February 15,"" HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. ""People are ready to get covered, and visitors to HealthCare.gov are seeing more competition, affordable options and an improved consumer experience."" HHS said that about 3.7 million Americans used HealthCare.gov during the first week, and nearly 1.6 million used the ""window-shopping"" tool to browse coverage options over the week. The administration has previously predicted that between 9 and 9.9 million to enroll in health coverage under Obamacare by the time the 2015 open enrollment period ends, at the end of February. Despite the improved enrollment figures and functionality of the site, HHS is not out of the woods with its implementation of the law. News last week that initial enrollment figures were inflated by hundreds of thousands of dental plans brought new scrutiny to the law, prompting Burwell to apologize and pledge that ""this kind of mistake"" wouldn't happen again. No mention of the inflated numbers was made in Wednesday's announcement of the latest enrollment numbers, but HHS is planning to put out weekly enrollment numbers and a more detailed outline of the enrollment figures every month, a move that might help quiet critics.","Nearly half a million Americans chose plans on HealthCare.gov in the first week of 2015 open enrollment .

"A California state legislator is proposing to ban the captivity of killer whales for entertainment at SeaWorld in the wake of CNN's controversial documentary ""Blackfish."" ""It is time that we embrace that the long-accepted practice of keeping orcas captive for human amusement must end,"" state Assemblyman Richard Bloom, a Democrat from Santa Monica, said at a press conference Friday at the city's oceanfront pier. Bloom was joined by ""Blackfish"" director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, two former SeaWorld orca trainers and an animal welfare activist. ""This is about greed and this is about corporate exploitation, both of the whales and the trainers, but most importantly the whales,"" said John Hargrove, a former SeaWorld orca trainer who resigned in August 2012. A Bloom statement described the proposal as ""landmark legislation calling for comprehensive improvement to orca protection laws in California."" Currently, there are no laws prohibiting the captive display of orcas, but there are federal laws governing the care, capture and research use of the killer whales, Bloom said. The documentary, produced by Magnolia Pictures and acquired by CNN Films, recounts the 2010 death of longtime SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a killer whale named Tilikum, a 12,000-pound bull, in Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld also offers orca shows at a third site, in San Antonio, Texas, but the California legislation would apply only to SeaWorld's San Diego facility. The film challenges the concept of keeping killer whales for entertainment and implies Tilikum had been driven to madness by captivity. Since then, a fiery controversy has erupted. SeaWorld strongly disputes the allegations that ""Blackfish"" makes and called the film grossly one-sided and the product of animal activists. On Friday, SeaWorld spokeswoman Becca Bides criticized the bill. ""The premise behind this proposed legislation is severely flawed on multiple levels, and its validity is highly questionable under the United States and California Constitutions,"" Bides said in a statement. ""We trust that our leaders who are responsible for voting on this proposal will recognize the clear bias of those behind the bill."" Bides added the participants joining Bloom were well-known ""extreme animal rights activists, many of whom regularly campaign against SeaWorld and other accredited marine mammal parks and institutions."" ""Included in the group are some of the same activists that partnered with PETA in bringing the meritless claim that animals in human care should be considered slaves under the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution -- a clear publicity stunt. This legislation appears to reflect the same sort of out-of-the-mainstream thinking,"" Bides said in a statement. ""We engage in business practices that are responsible, sustainable and reflective of the balanced values all Americans share."" The proposed law would end performance-based entertainment for all killer whales in California, captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic material, and the import and export of orcas within the state. Also, the proposal would retire all captive killer whales to sea pens if available and would allow retired orcas to be on display, but not perform. The bill would limit the amount of human interaction for trainer safety, according to Bloom's fact sheet. ""Like the elephant -- the largest land mammal in captivity -- we have realized that orcas are more complex than most other marine mammals and require more space, have a more complex social structure and most importantly need their family network (pod) for a happy and healthy life,"" said a fact sheet by  Bloom. Currently, California has 10 captive killer whales, and seven of them were captive-born, according to Bloom. In the past 50 years, California has lost 14 orcas, 12 of which were caught in the wild, Bloom said. ""After the tragic death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, the public has begun to question the moral justification of keeping orcas in captivity for our general entertainment,"" Bloom's fact sheet said. ""As a state we should lead the way in ending captivity for entertainment purposes and should be ensuring our current captive population general welfare needs are taken care of, and that we end any future captivity whether it be by capture or captive breeding programs here in California."" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said the proposed legislation ""has the potential to end the deep injustice of exhibitions of captive marine life,"" said spokesman David W. Perle. ""PETA and kind people around the world have called on SeaWorld to retire these deprived orcas to a seaside sanctuary, but the park continues to defend its overt cruelty,"" Perle said in a statement. One animal trainer, Grey Stafford of Arizona's Wildlife World Zoo & Aquarium, criticized the proposed law, which he said ""collapses under its own weight of inconsistencies, particularly with respect to animal welfare and future breeding."" ""We still have a lot to learn about the killer whales,"" said Stafford, who used to train orcas. The killer whale shows ensure the animal and its ocean habitat remain in the public consciousness. ""I am more concerned about the welfare of all species,"" Stafford said. ""Out of sight means out of mind.""","""The premise behind this proposed legislation is severely flawed,"" SeaWorld says .

"(CNET) -- Just because the Internet has broken down geographic barriers, don't assume that Google doesn't care about geography. With Google's new Latitude software, cell phone users can share their locations with others. The company plans to launch software called Latitude on Wednesday that lets mobile phone users share their location with close contacts. Google hopes it will help people find each other while out and about and to keep track of loved ones. ""What Google Latitude does is allow you to share that location with friends and family members, and likewise be able to see friends and family members' locations,"" said Steve Lee, product manager for Google Latitude. For example, a girlfriend could use it to see if her boyfriend has arrived at a restaurant and, if not, how far away he is. To protect privacy, Google specifically requires people to sign up for the service. People can share their precise location, the city they're in, or nothing at all. ""What we found in testing is that the most common scenario is a symmetrical arrangement, where both people are sharing with each other,"" Lee said. The software spotlights Google's fixation with mapping and location technology. Location is an important part of navigating the real world, and Google clearly sees its geographic services as a way to establish a more personal connection with customers who today use Google chiefly for the virtual realm of the Internet. And of course money is involved, too: Google hopes its mapping technology will lead to location-based advertising revenue. Google's power is firmly lodged in search and search advertising, but the company is trying to expand to broader online services, too. That includes online documents and various aspects of social networking, which are much more personal services and ones that put Google into more direct competition with rivals such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo. Like using Google profiles to contact information with select contacts, using Google Latitude tells Google who's who in your social graph. How it works . Latitude is part of Google Maps for Mobile, the company's mapping software for mobile phones, but also can be used through a gadget loaded onto its iGoogle customized home page. It'll work in 27 countries at launch, Google said. Initially, it will work on most color-screen BlackBerry phones, most phones with Windows Mobile 5.0 or later, and most Symbian-based devices such as Nokia smartphones. An update to the Google Android operating system now being distributed to the T-Mobile G1 phone also enables it, and iPhone and iPod Touch users will get the option ""very soon,"" Lee said. Latitude uses Google's technology to judge a user's location not just by GPS satellite, but also by proximity to mobile phone towers and wireless networks. That's a much more automated approach than the manual ""check-in"" process used by Dodgeball, a service that Google decided in January to shut down. Other competitors exist, though. BrightKite and Loopt offer mechanisms for people to find each other by mobile phone, for example. Then there's MobiFriends, Tripit, and Dopplr. And Google's clearest competitor, Yahoo, offers some competition with Fire Eagle. That service doesn't provide location information, but it does provide a mechanism to centralize people's geographic privacy choices, in effect taking care of some of the social graph management when it comes to location information. To use the service, you need a Google account to record who has permission to see your location. For choosing who gets to see your location, you can use contacts stored with Gmail or Picasa, Google said. The white lie . With the service, you can hide from specific people or disappear altogether. And you can manually set a specific location if, for example, your phone can't show it with sufficient precision or if you wish to tell someone a white lie about whether you really aren't going to go to the candy store. Google envisions two broad classes of people with whom you might want to share location information. First is a small, close-knit circle of friends and family with whom you're willing to share your exact spot. Second is a larger group with whom you're happy to share city-level detail, convenient for finding out when somebody's in town but not much more. When somebody is close, the software lets you contact the person various ways--by calling or sending an e-mail or text message, for example. It also lets you hide from that specific person. Privacy is of course a significant concern when it comes to sharing this sort of information. If you want to use Latitude, you must specifically enable the service. Meeting your pals at a bar is an obvious example of the software's possibilities, but there are softer cases I see as useful, too. Lee pointed to a case where a friend's girlfriend, though far away in Seattle, will ""virtually place herself next to him."" That sounds a little sappy for my tastes, but I can still relate. My wife is on the other side of the country right now, and it would be heart-warming to see just where. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Google Latitude . There are a lot of occasions where technology is better for maintaining relationships than it is for establishing them, and this looks like one to me. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- When Christine Mbabazi started designing clothes in her bedroom in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, she had big ambitions. Now the owner of her own store -- Christine Creative Collections -- she has even bigger plans: turning her fashion boutique into a household name. ""The brand is promoting African fabric and African designs, with my creativity, and developing it to the rest of the world,"" says the young entrepreneur. Launched last March, Mbabazi's startup produces and sells a wide variety of eye-catching fashion items, including bags, shoes and clothes. Mbabazi says Rwanda is at the very heart of her brand, so every creation in her store is handmade with locally-sourced materials. ""I love the African fabric,"" she says. ""[Growing up] I liked looking unique, [so] I used to cut my clothes in different ways -- I used to change them, I used to sew with my hands. It all inspired me to come up with what I have today."" Mbabazi, who is also a radio presenter, makes use of social media to reach new customers, but says she has found it difficult to convince people that traditional fabrics are acceptable in formal settings. ""My friends saw me and saw I was very unique in parties, weddings, even at work -- that's how the word spread out. It's still a big challenge convincing people you can go to work when you have a African fabric suit but we are still fighting those small challenges."" Her next step is to take the brand, which she calls CCC for short, out of Rwanda. ""I want to be exporting things made in Rwanda,"" she says, ""so that when you are in Europe and you see something, you're like this is from CCC.""

"In its effort to curb game addiction among adolescents, South Korea pulled the plug this weekend on young gamers after midnight by blocking access to game websites, putting a hotly debated law into practice. The new system called the ""shutdown law,"" also referred to as the ""Cinderella law,"" blocks those under the age of 16 from accessing gaming websites after midnight and has fueled heated anger among younger gamers and avid game fans. The new rule does not affect mobile games or certain games used on social networking websites. As South Korea, which has one of the richest online gaming cultures in the world, tries to battle gaming addiction that has led to serious consequences, it struggles to find effective means to selectively help those in need. Roughly 8% of the population between the ages of 9 to 39 suffers from Internet addiction, according to a study conducted in 2010 by the National Information Society Agency (NIA), which runs a national Internet addiction counseling center. The addiction rate for those between 9 and 12 was highest at 14%, according to the NIA. The government is heavily involved in treating people for gaming addiction by holding workshops on prevention education at schools and offering counseling for students with an addiction. However, internet users have flooded the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which initiated the policy, website with postings calling the new measure ""a waste of money,"" ""idiotic"" and ""useless,"" and questioning whether it will prevent young gamers from playing into late hours. ""Do you really think that teenagers are going to give up on gaming and study?"" one posting from the website read. ""Have you even thought about what the result of this going to be before deciding to crackdown on it?"" Some called on the government to shut down the ministry, while others said parents should have the autonomy to decide how long their children can play games. South Korea's advanced gaming culture revolves around high-speed Internet cafes where gamers can sit around the clock playing games, glitzy tournaments hosted by big brand companies and professional gamers that have celebrity status with huge fan bases. Game companies have been actively preparing for the shutdown, easing in the new regulation days before the official mandatory start date. Critics point out that many teenagers hold gaming accounts created with their parent's personal information, easily providing them with an alternative log-in option. The controversial shutdown system already faces a petition in the constitutional courts. ""You can say someone is an alcoholic if they drink more than three bottles (of liquor) a day, but you can't call them alcoholic because they drink after midnight. It's the same with gaming,"" Lee Byung-chan, the lawyer who filed the petition on behalf of parents and a young gamer said. The argument is that the measure violates the right to happiness and discriminates gaming against other leisure activities such as watching movies or television. ""From the parents' point of view, it violates their right to educate their children,"" Lee added. It is for the parents to decide what time they want to allow their children to play games or not, not for the government to exclude them from that process, the argument goes.","The ""Cinderella law"" blocks under-16 gamers from accessing sites after midnight .
A 2010 survey found nearly 14% of 9-to-12-year-olds in South Korea are Internet addicts .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Cathy and Jerome Jenkins have been running businesses in the St. Louis area for more than two decades. They tried selling neckties, then found success marketing a fabric chemical. But it's the restaurant in downtown Ferguson, Cathy's Kitchen, that is their love. Monday night brought heartbreak. For so many reasons. As a black family, the Jenkinses understood the rage that seethed and then exploded on the streets of Ferguson after a grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, in the death of black teenager Michael Brown. Protesters spilled onto South Florissant Road and met a line of riot police just outside Cathy's Kitchen. Things got ugly after police warned the crowds to get off the streets and then fired tear gas. Many businesses were vandalized and looted. Some were razed by fire. ""I understand there is not a proper regard for African-American life in this country,"" said Cathy Jenkins, shivering in the cold by the shattered window in her restaurant Tuesday. If Wilson had been indicted, she is sure life would have moved on without blemish. Instead, she and her husband found themselves not being able to open for business. She knew from a text she received that her eatery had been vandalized during the protests. But neither she nor her husband knew how they would find their beloved business. It was, after all, right next door to the Ferguson Police Department. Follow the latest news on CNN.com's Live Blog . Cathy's Kitchen was a labor of love, inspired by a family vacation several years ago. Jerome Jenkins was a huge fan of National Lampoon's ""Vacation,"" the movie series starring Chevy Chase. So he copied the Griswolds, put his wife and three kids in an RV and drove from state to state. There's a map in the restaurant of all the places they visited. Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Memphis. In each place, Cathy Jenkins picked up local flavors and spices. The menu at Cathy's Kitchen reflects some of the dishes she savored on that vacation. The diner-style eatery has checkerboard floors and red walls. The two wall-mounted televisions are always set to The Cooking Channel and the Food Network. And the sound of soul is always playing on the stereo. Aretha, Stevie, Otis and Marvin. Customers sing along. That is, when they're not busy eating. There's Memphis-style gumbo, New Orleans Po' Boys and Chicago hot dogs. Cathy Jenkins likes to write the special of the day with chalk on the black-board table tops. Pulled pork or turkey with gravy. Drinks are $2.49. Free refills. No wonder the place is packed at lunchtime. On Monday, the Jenkinses closed early, around 3 p.m., when they saw protesters gathering across the street. They put up a sign on their front door: ""Closed Until Further Notice!"" The following morning, Cathy's Kitchen sat dark and silent. And broken. 'Black lives matter' The Jenkinses knew their restaurant was not so badly damaged. They'd seen video of protesters locking arms in front of the place to protect it from vandals. ""I wish I knew who they were,"" said Jerome Jenkins, ""because I really would like to thank them."" The Jenkinses planned to wake up early, rustle up relatives and be there by 8 to begin cleaning up. But by the time they arrived, people were already picking up the shards of glass from the window that was shattered. They weren't members of the National Guard. Or any federal disaster agency. They were her customers, loyal to her on a day of tragedy. ""I am overwhelmed,"" she said. But this was the Ferguson she knew. A Ferguson that was about diversity and community. She said she had to believe the grand jury made the right decision. But she and her husband were both deeply disappointed that some protesters turned violent and that authorities failed to protect their city. ""I thought when trouble erupted, the National Guard would be here. Then not to see a single military truck. ... That's troubling."" Jerome Jenkins said authorities had four months to ""get this right."" He didn't understand why the decision was announced at night, why the police didn't react right away and why the military was not sent in after a state of emergency had been declared many days before. Opinion: America, we have a problem . ""I hate what I have seen on West Florissant,"" he said, referring to the main thoroughfare that intersects with the road where Brown was shot dead. It was the scene of nearly two weeks of protests, some violent, in the wake of the killing. After word spread that Wilson would not be indicted, protesters clashed with riot police in Ferguson. Many businesses had their doors and windows smashed in. Some were looted and set ablaze. Obama: 'No sympathy' for violence in Ferguson . ""Nobody was there to protect them,"" Jerome Jenkins said. ""To the African-American community, that is the greatest form of racism. You don't protect and serve. You allow 20 to 30 criminals to come into our community and burn it down."" He said the images of Ferguson mistakenly portray a community not interested in bettering itself, when instead rogue elements are responsible for the violence. ""A criminal is a criminal,"" he said. ""Poverty brings crime, and you will see that where you go in the world."" Jenkins said he is not a man who would normally put his face in front of a television camera. ""But it's worth telling the world, 'Listen, it wasn't us as residents who dropped the ball.' "" After the cleanup Tuesday, the Jenkinses hope to leave for Indiana, where they both grew up, to enjoy Thanksgiving with family and friends. And to heal. They don't know what will happen in the next few nights, whether there will be more trouble. They hope to hang the ""open"" sign on the door again very soon. Perhaps even as early as Monday.

"(CNN)Here's one thing some will not be so thankful for: a messy mix of snow, rain and sleet for Turkey Day. A storm will dump rain and snow across the East Coast early Wednesday, causing delays of up to six hours on the busiest travel period of the year. About 30 million people from the mountains of North Carolina to Maine could be affected. ""The storm will have a major impact nationwide to air travel, as the ripple effect from delays and cancellations in the Northeast hubs impacts the rest of the country,"" CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""Expect very long delays, in some cases averaging three to six hours for major airports in D.C., Philadelphia, New York and Boston, which will be impacted by a combination of heavy rain, snow and wind,"" Hennen said. ""Most delays and cancellations will occur from late morning through Wednesday evening."" The silver lining for Thursday morning fliers? ""By Thanksgiving, the storm will be exiting, and conditions should return to normal,"" he said. Use CNN's winter weather tracker . Rain and snow will begin to hit the Washington, New York and Boston metro areas Wednesday morning. Travelers can expect some significant snow accumulations. Though Washington should see a mix of rain and snow, areas far west of the city will get heavy snowfall. Philadelphia will get about an inch of combined rain and snow. Three or 4 inches of snow are possible in New York City, with heavier accumulation in northern New Jersey and in the Hudson Valley. Boston can expect rain and snow in the morning, changing to all snow in the late afternoon and evening. The city is forecast to get 4 to 5 inches of snow, with 10 to 15 inches in central Massachusetts. Mike Todd, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Safety, said power outages are a major concern. ""This is New England, this is just another winter storm here, and the complication is just that it's the holiday weekend,"" he said. ""We caution individuals to drive carefully and slowly. Consider staying put if you're concerned. Safety first, as always."" Pennsylvania said it'll have state police and the National Guard in the state emergency operations center. State officials urged residents to avoid the roads if they can. ""The bottom line is the less cars the better, the less traffic the better,"" said Cory Angell of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. ""If you don't have to go, you don't need to go. You don't want to be stuck in a queue for hours and then run out of gas and what not. It's important people realize there are hazards involved with travel, and more often than not they don't."" 10 ways to survive holiday travel . So far, airlines have canceled at least 164 flights for Wednesday, and that number is expected to increase, according to FlightAware.com. Fliers should check airline websites to see about rebooking flights. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and other carriers are waiving rebooking charges for holiday travelers in the Northeast. ""Customers ticketed on American Airlines, American Eagle or US Airways or US Airways Express flights on November 26 to, from, or through (18 affected airports) may change flights without penalty, have the ticket-reissue charge waived for one ticket change, and begin travel as early as November 25 or as late as November 27 under American's current travel waiver,"" according to an airline release. The Northeast isn't the only region where bad weather is predicted. Light snow is forecast until Thursday in Minneapolis, Chicago and other parts of the Upper Midwest. The Northwest is expecting rain, with snow in the mountains. Denver is expecting wind gusts of up to 30 mph on Tuesday and 15 mph on Wednesday. AAA is expecting 46 million Americans to travel 50 miles or more from home during the Thanksgiving weekend, and 90% of them are traveling by car. That would be the most travelers since 2007. Drivers should check weather forecasts before setting out on the road, and travelers should also check tire pressure, car batteries and windshield wipers. On the bright side, people traveling by car will probably pay less for gas than in recent years, AAA says. The current average price of gasoline in the United States is $2.85 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the average price at  the same time last year.","Airlines waive rebooking charges for travelers .

"(CNN) -- How would you design a movie poster for a Hollywood blockbuster you'd never seen, filled with characters you knew nothing about and actors you'd never heard of? Would Jean-Claude Van Damme look like a surgical glove stuffed full of walnuts? Would Cujo the killer dog look like a guilty spaniel that'd devoured the cake at a child's birthday party? Would James Bond have the stunned expression of a man who had just received a large electricity bill? If your only brief was to pack a crowd into a mobile African cinema hall, you might also want to add some incidental aliens shooting laser beams from their eyes. In Ghana -- where the Golden Age of movie posters during the 1980s and 1990s produced these lurid, vibrant and outlandish originals -- the movie poster may be a dying art form but it has since become big business. Western collectors now pay thousands for prime examples of the genre and the artists who once churned out the posters to fill Ghana's dilapidated cinema clubs are finding a new lease of life reproducing them for art aficionados. Jeaurs Oka Afutu, 39, began painting the posters when he was 14 years old but now works from his home in Accra, Ghana, to produce them for art dealers, selling them for between $75 and $100 apiece. Currently putting the finishing touches on a canvas cut from a flour sack, he's producing a distinctively Ghanaian take on the biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."" ""Action and war works a lot ... and women too: both actually,"" Afutu told CNN, showing that Hollywood's time-honored recipe of sex and violence is an international language. ""It all depends on what the audience prefers."" Read more: Keeping Africa's star of democracy shining . When he produced these originals for Ghana's cinema clubs --- often no more than rows of seats in the open air around a gas-powered generator and a TV set with a VCR --- his job was to draw crowds. To do this, he applied his imagination to the canvas, producing scenes that didn't exist in the original film; placing dripping knives in the hands of zombie assassins or guns at the ready for various heroes who had no weapons in the actual film. These surreal variations spiced up a whole generation of schlock-horror films that came out of Hong Kong, Hollywood, Bollywood, and its Nigerian equivalent Nollywood. As one critic remarked, the posters are often far better than the films. African art dealer Ernie Wolfe, who first noticed the movie posters in 1990 while researching Ghana's phenomenon of fantasy coffins, said that despite the untutored style of the posters, the artists knew exactly what effect they wanted to create. ""They are definitely very, very good artists and they paint exactly what they want,"" said Wolfe who has written two books on the genre ""Extreme Canvas"" and ""Extreme Canvas 2."" ""Having looked at hundreds of them, you become aware of their individual hand, their idiosyncrasies and their brush strokes. ""The ones that interest me the most are the ones before the tradition died in about 2000."" Read more: Bamboo bikes turn around fortunes . Ghana's economic development -- combined with affordable technology that has brought home entertainment within the reach of many Ghanaians -- put paid to the movie poster cottage industry. While they're still being made by some of the artists that produced them two decades ago, Wolfe explained, they're now made as commodities for the art market. ""The best of the Golden Age movie posters -- from the '80s to the late '90s -- are the ones where they just completely went out into the land where there are no rules,"" he said. ""It gave them an incredible freedom to be expressive. ""They made images that they knew would bring people in and no one was looking over their shoulder to tell them they couldn't do anything."" The only restriction, he said, was the size of the canvases which fell strictly into two versions: one side of a 50kg flour bag or two sides stitched together. ""Apart from that, there were no limits."" He said the works also fall into the realm of art artifact where the evidence of their original purpose is also part of the narrative. ""The work patterns of their use; having been nailed up by their corners and splattered by mud from passing buses also tell a rich story about how they were utilized,"" Wolfe said. With rare vintage works fetching as much as $15,000 and Golden Age posters routinely going for between $1,500 and $3,000, a market in fakes has emerged. Wolfe, however, remains sanguine. ""It's possible to say they're fakes but it's also possible to say they're a homage,"" he said. While the commoditized versions are still artworks in their own right, Wolfe said they occupy a different zone to the stark immediacy of the originals. ""There's a big difference between those works that were produced for them, Ghanaians, and the ones that are produced for us (collectors).""

"(CNN) -- Qatari driver Nasser Al-Attiyah described winning his first Dakar Rally title as ""the biggest moment in my career"" following Saturday's final stage of the testing endurance race. Carlos Sainz won the 13th leg into Buenos Aires from Cordoba to extend his career record of stage wins to 24, but the defending car champion finished third overall behind South African Giniel De Villiers as their Volkswagen team filled the podium. The 40-year-old Al-Attiyah was delighted following his second-place finish last year, and a disqualification in 2009. ""It means a lot to win a Dakar, for me, for my people, for my country and for my team,"" he told the race's official website after finishing second in the final stage to head off De Villiers by almost 50 minutes. ""It is a great victory. It's hard to explain everything that goes through your head. But it is a very nice feeling. We demonstrated that we have the strongest team in the world. It is the third time the team has won a Dakar. The ultimate endurance race? ""It is also the biggest moment in my career. I think that now people will finally know where Qatar is located."" Al-Attiyah also competed for his country at last year's Asian Games in China in shooting, and reached the final of the skeet event. Sainz's challenge effectively ended with a broken suspension on Thursday, but he finished strongly with wins in the final two stages for seven victories in the 2011 edition, which started and ended in Argentina after heading into Chile through the Andes mountains and Atacama desert. ""No, I am not disappointed. This is how the race goes. After two tough weeks, there is nothing left to say. I gave it my very best shot,"" said the 48-year-old Spaniard, a two-time world rally champion. His compatriot Marc Coma clinched a third motorbike crown as he came home fifth, a place behind his main rival and defending champion Cyril Depres of France to guarantee a 15-minute winning margin. ""We all know that a Dakar is a difficult race, but this year it was particularly difficult,"" Coma said. ""This victory is the reward of all the hard work, the reward of many years and a lot of tensions over the last few days. It is the bonus you get for steering right and for so many sacrifices over the years."" Russia's Vladimir Chagin won a record seventh truck title ahead of Kamaz teammates Firdaus Kabirov, Eduard Nikolaev and Ilgizar Mardeev. Argentina's Alejandro Patronelli similarly had a big lead going into the final leg, and clinched his first title in the quad bike category as he emulated the 2010 feat of his younger brother Marcos. Alejandro, second last year, broke his hand with before the 15-day race reached halfway, while Marcos was ruled out after breaking his leg in training in December. ""Here I am, champion with one-and-a-half hands! What a reward. I had not won anything since 2000 and I am now Dakar's number one! I just cannot believe it,"" Alejandro said.","Volkswagen teammates fill podium as Dakar Rally finishes in Argentina .

"(CNN) -- A lawsuit has been filed claiming that the iconic Led Zeppelin song ""Stairway to Heaven"" was far from original. The suit, filed on May 31 in the United States District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania, was brought by the estate of the late musician Randy California against the surviving members of Led Zeppelin and their record label. The copyright infringement case alleges that the Zeppelin song was taken from the single ""Taurus"" by the 1960s band Spirit, for whom California served as lead guitarist. ""Late in 1968, a then new band named Led Zeppelin began touring in the United States, opening for Spirit,"" the suit states. ""It was during this time that Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin's guitarist, grew familiar with 'Taurus' and the rest of Spirit's catalog. Page stated in interviews that he found Spirit to be 'very good' and that the band's performances struck him 'on an emotional level.' "" One of the causes of action for the suit is listed as ""Falsification of Rock N' Roll History"" and the typeface in the section headings of the filing resembles that used for Led Zeppelin album covers. According to claims in the suit, ""Parts of 'Stairway to Heaven,' instantly recognizable to the music fans across the world, sound almost identical to significant portions of 'Taurus.' "" The estate is seeking court ordered damages and writing credit for California, born Randy Craig Wolfe. Part of the defense includes a printed interview conducted with California prior to his death from drowning in 1997. In the 1997 interview with Listener Magazine, the guitarist claims that some of the music from ""Stairway to Heaven"" was taken from his group's song. ""Well, if you listen to the two songs, you can make your own judgment,"" the lawsuit quotes the interview as saying. ""It's an exact ... I'd say it was a rip-off. And the guys made millions of bucks on it and never said, 'Thank you,' never said, 'Can we pay you some money for it?' It's kind of a sore point with me."" In a May interview with France's Liberation newspaper, Page said of the claims ""That's ridiculous. I have no further comment on the subject."" The attorney representing California's trust, Francis Malofiy, told CNN before the suit was filed that Zeppelin's guitarist Page ""looked to Randy California and Spirit as someone who inspired him."" The attorney also explained why it took so many years for a suit to be filed. ""Justice is available to those who can afford it,"" Malofiy said, ""It's very very hard for a musician who's struggling just to keep a roof over his head ... to actually go about and fight some of the biggest giants in the music and entertainment industry.""

"(CNN) -- A little over two days. That's how long the grand jury deliberated before deciding not to bring an indictment against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury had heard more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses before reaching its decision, which he said was supported by physical evidence. Sadly, the grand jury's failure to return an indictment of Wilson was not surprising. But don't blame the grand jury; blame McCulloch. He oversaw the proceedings and bears responsibility for their outcome. McCulloch compromised the Ferguson grand jury proceedings from the start. He resisted calls to recuse himself, saying, ""I have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community."" However, the community would have been better served if he had stepped aside. Are protests taking place near you? McCulloch's father was a police officer killed in a shootout with an African-American suspect. His brother, uncle and cousin served with the St. Louis Police Department, and his mother worked there for 20 years as a clerk. Newsweek noted McCulloch's ""long history of siding with the police."" For the sake of impartiality, McCulloch should have let a special prosecutor take over the case. The grand jury only needed to find ""probable cause"" to charge Wilson. That's one of the lowest legal standards in our justice system, below ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" (required for a criminal conviction) and ""preponderance of the evidence"" (the standard in a civil trial). The fact that McCulloch did not get an indictment for a killing that shocked the nation raises questions about whether he really wanted an indictment. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,"" McCulloch said in August. Yet in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor typically shows the minimal amount of evidence necessary to establish that a trial is merited. By dumping so much evidence on the grand jury, McCulloch may have overwhelmed them and led them to the wrong conclusion. In the process, he's opened himself to charges that he was acting to protect Wilson. Opinion: Why I feel torn about the Ferguson verdict . Consider McCulloch's time frame for the grand jury, which The New York Times described as ""prolonged and exhaustive."" Grand juries routinely return criminal indictments in a matter of days. But the Ferguson proceedings dragged on for months, putting a burden on the jurors to recall everything and then decide wisely. Another red flag was that this lengthy process was riddled with leaks, all of which supported Wilson's account of the events. Worse, McCulloch declined to recommend charges to the grand jury. Prosecutors normally walk a jury through the charges they are seeking, breaking them down and explaining why they are deserved. McCulloch instead left the Ferguson grand jury to sort through terms such as ""voluntary manslaughter"" and ""involuntary manslaughter in the second degree"" on their own -- making it more likely that they would not seek an indictment. In fact, McCulloch could have brought charges directly against Wilson, circumventing the grand jury. He chose not to do so, which is a troubling indicator of his interest in aggressively prosecuting this case. Opinion: Ferguson shows failure at every level . Sure, there are conflicting accounts of what transpired between Wilson and Michael Brown. Was Wilson in fear for his life, as he told investigators, when he and Brown struggled for his gun? Did Brown have his hands up when he was fatally shot? We will never know, because there will be no trial. That's a tragedy for the Brown family and an affront to the fundamental American value that we all are equal under the law. The grand jury's decision has implications far beyond Ferguson. Gallup polling has found that African-Americans have less confidence in the criminal justice system than white Americans, while a W.W. Kellogg Foundation report found that 68% of Latinos report being worried about police brutality. Wilson walking free will likely reinforce the views among communities of color that our justice system is unfair. And when significant segments of our population lose faith in our justice system, our democracy is weakened. The Ferguson decision reflects poorly on prosecutor McCulloch. His flawed grand jury proceedings ensured that justice was not served for Michael Brown.","Raul Reyes: Grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson; prosecutor key in this .

"A daring raid by U.S. and Yemeni forces into an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen freed eight hostages, but not before kidnappers stole away with some Westerners, including an American. The raid took place Monday, according to an American official and information posted on a Yemini website associated with the country's Defense Ministry. The mission was planned after al Qaeda militants were seen transferring hostages ""chained and covered with blankets"" into pickups that were driven to a cave about 68 miles (109 kilometers) from Hajir al-Saiyer, according to the website. The intelligence included that there were foreigners among the hostages, so ""a plan was established in order to raid the cave,"" according to the Yemeni government account of the operation. The details were attributed to a Yemeni special forces member who was on the raid. The troops, equipped with advanced weapons, including night vision equipment, launched the mission about 4 miles from the cave, according to the Yemeni government. The kidnappers were found about 100 yards from the cave, and ""clashes erupted"" soon, according to the account provided by the special forces member. All seven kidnappers were killed. The special forces troops found eight hostages chained up. They told the rescue team that two days earlier, kidnappers had moved five others, including an American, a Briton, a South African and a Yemeni. The fifth was believed to be a Turkish citizen. While the Yemeni version does not mention U.S. involvement, an American official confirmed to CNN that U.S. Special Forces were part of the raid team. CNN learned of the American involvement this week but, at the request of the government, did not report the information as there was a search for the American hostage.","Militants were seen moving hostages ""chained and covered with blankets"" into pickups .

"In the busy streets, shoppers and workers rush by the homeless little boy with a flute -- some dropping change, but most ignoring him. Sitting on the sidewalk in Istanbul, Turkey, his head is barely above knee height of the adults around him. But he plays on -- for hours, knowing that each coin or note can help his family survive another day. The flute is a cheap one, but it is key to their struggle. The money he makes -- usually about $10 a day -- will help feed his mom and four siblings. The family escaped the horrors of war in Aleppo, Syria, and he says they now live in a park. He does not say which park or if they have a tent for shelter at night. According to U.N figures, there are about 1 million registered refugees in Turkey, but the country says the total is closer to 1.6 million. Research from the Migration Policy Centre adds that in the last couple of months, there has been another spike as Syrians flee the rise of ISIS. The boy says he has been in Turkey for about a year. He plays falteringly and his young face looks innocent, but he knows the cruelty of war. He says his dad died in Aleppo, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting in Syria and is a rebel stronghold that President Bashar al-Assad's army has attacked. The boy, who says he is 6, complains that his head hurts and talks of the guns back in Aleppo. As he plays on, he is relying on the kindness of strangers and watching for police patrols, as begging on the streets is illegal. When police do see him -- this time as he walks back to his makeshift home -- an officer confiscates his flute. But he cannot be kept down. A new flute is $5 -- half is daily profit -- but if he is to play on, if he is to help feed his family, if they are to have some hope, it's a small expense. And tomorrow, he will play again.","A refugee boy uses a flute to help keep his family fed .

"(CNN)November is the month we celebrate Thanksgiving in the United States. In Finland, there is a different type of celebration. It turns out that all tax returns of every Finn are made public this month, which leads to a ""media frenzy of gossip, boasting and finger-pointing about who has paid their fair share in income tax,"" according to an article on Foreignpolicy.com. Good times for all, it would seem, in the small Nordic country widely praised for its generous social welfare policies. Well, not quite for all. Take banker Bjorn Wahlross, one of the richest Finns. He moved to Sweden of all places earlier this year to avoid the high tax rates in his homeland. And high they are. The average income tax rate in Finland fell from 37.5% in the 1990s to around 30% in the 2000s, and is now rising, set to hit 31.1% next year. In the United States in contrast, the average tax rate in 2010 was 11.81%, according to a study published by the non-partisan Tax Foundation. Another study shows that in 2014, 95% of Americans paid an effective income tax rate under 10%; the top 1% of income earners reached an average of 24.6%, still significantly below the average tax rate for all taxpaying Finns. So what would happen if Americans had a ""Tax Day"" like Finland, and tax returns of every citizen were all released in one fell swoop to unleash a media frenzy? It is hard to predict counter-factual history, of course, beyond stating the obvious -- it ain't going to happen, ever. Even the most zealous foes of privacy when it comes to terrorists and other outcasts seem firmly committed to privacy of tax returns.  Don't tread on me -- and don't look at my 1040 -- seem equally sacred principles in the United States. But putting reality aside for a moment, what is my best guess as to what would happen if America went the Finnish way? Nothing. Nothing has been happening a lot lately.  According to the online Wiktionary, the saying that ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"" is a proverb ""making the observation that turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo."" We certainly have seen a lot of turbulent changes.  Consider the situation in 2008: the United States was facing a Great Recession, a worldwide credit crisis exacerbated by sketchy lending policies, not to mention two major wars (Iraq and Afghanistan), each part of a broader war against terrorism, sovereign debt crises around the globe (Iceland, Greece, more) and mounting fiscal deficits at home. The turbulence led to the election of Barack Obama, our first African-American president, a Democrat, and something of a liberal to boot.  So what happened to tax policy, which might be thought to play a starring role as both cause and effect of the drama? Well, pretty much, nothing. It was not until the early hours of 2013 that we saw any changes to the income tax at all, and these were mainly to add a few percentage points to the rate bracket in which a handful of the highest earners found themselves -- those couples earning more than $450,000 a year. Earlier this year, the French economist Thomas Piketty saw his monumental work ""Capital in the 21st Century"" translated into English and promptly rocket up all kinds of bestseller lists. Piketty's volume tells the tale of how the United States, in particular, is approaching the highest levels of wealth and income inequality in recorded history.  And what has been the policy response to Piketty's prognosis? Well, again, nothing, unless you consider a return to a Republican Senate, and a fully divided government, something.  (In fact, that is the ideal structure in which nothing gets done, hence it makes stock markets happy.) Then there is the fact that when we do disclose tax returns in the United States, nothing much happens. Presidential candidates tend to do this. When they do not, or just release summaries, nothing much happens. From the disclosures, we learn that Hubert Humphry was not very wealthy, but Mitt Romney is, and life pretty much goes on -- with some wailing and gnashing of teeth among tax cognoscenti over such odd tidbits as the fact that Romney was able to amass more than $100 million in a Roth IRA. The tax policy impact? Well, nothing. There was also the much ballyhooed self-disclosure of Warren Buffet's 2010 tax returns, leading to a proposal for a ""Buffet Rule,"" a flat 30% effective tax rate on millionaires -- still lower than the average Finnish tax rate.  What happened there?  Well, nothing, again. So, how about it?  Could we force all tax returns in the United States to be made public so that we could have a ""media frenzy of gossip, boasting and finger-pointing"" too?  Well, no and no.  No, it ain't going to happen and no, it would not lead to that result.  Not here, not now. No doubt, tax compliance might improve, by means of shame if nothing else, and perhaps some entrepreneurs would even find a way to make some money by ""whistleblowing"" on tax crimes and misdemeanors they unearthed from the massive data dump. Yet being America, publicly disclosed tax returns would more likely lead to an assault from financial advisors offering their services to help the rich lower their taxes. Just think -- who would not want a $100 million Roth IRA?  Taxes could thus even go down, as the tax-avoidance-industry found new targets, with fees to these helpful souls going up. The facts of life in 21st century America are different than those in Finland, a nation with a population about the size of Wisconsin. We have gotten pretty much inured to indifference about levels of wealth and income inequality unimaginable to people from other times and places. The details simply bore us. Our media frenzies and gossip are about other pressing matters.  In fact, I have to run; I have to find out just what's going on with Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth, and I have yet to see the latest Kim Kardashian photos. Happy Thanksgiving to all.","In November, all tax returns of every citizen are made public in Finland on ""Tax Day""

"(CNN)Javier Hirschfeld has a thing for eyes. He is gripped by unflinching stares, by looks that belie dignity and poise. ""Even in street landscapes, I like pictures where the building is looking back at you,"" admits the Spanish photographer. It was this fascination that inspired him to photograph the women of Goree Island, off the coast of Senegal. ""The powerful eyes of those girls; they are very dark and very deep. That's what attracted me to them,"" he recalls. The women and the landscape reminded him of a powerful portraitist who defined much of his childhood: Spanish painter Julio Romero de Torres. ""La Chiquita Piconera is (de Torres') most famous painting, and one of the most famous paintings in the Spanish tradition,"" he says. ""In the history of art, when women are portrayed, most of the time they're being looked at. I like portraits of women that look back at you, and the woman in La Chiquita Piconera is looking back with a lot of dignity and a lot of strength."" Another defining feature of de Torre's paintings, says Hirschfeld, is the melancholy housed in their expressions. He found a similar sentiment in the Goree's architecture. ""You can see that same melancholy in the crumbling buildings on the island,"" he says. The 'universal portrait' Though the influence is Spanish, the props, the fabrics, the models and the setting are all local to Senegal. Rather than recreate the Andalusian fashions donned by the women in de Torres' portraits, Hirschfeld picked fabrics from the Senegalese markets, and had dresses made by tailors on the island. ""In Senegal, they have an amazing tradition of tailors, and they work really fast. In one day, they can create these beautiful dresses, which you can see in the pictures,"" he says. Hirschfeld's subjects also hold objects that reflect their culture. In de Torres' painting, ""The Fortune-telling,"" for instance, one woman uses playing cards to give a psychic reading to her friend. In Hirschfeld's version, his models use cowrie shells, a traditional Senegalese fortune-telling tool. ""I wanted to show that some emotions are universal, and create a more universal portrait, but I also wanted to create a more Senegalese scene,"" he says.","Photographer Javier Hirschfeld recreates portraits by modern Spanish painter Julio Romero de Torres using Senegalese locals .

"Al Qaeda-linked rebels in northern Mali destroyed historic and religious landmarks in Timbuktu on Thursday, claiming the relics are idolatrous, residents told CNN. Three four-wheel-drive trucks carrying at least 30 armed fighters arrived Thursday morning at three mausolea -- all U.N. World Heritage sites -- in the southern Timbuktu neighborhood of Kabara, two residents told CNN by phone. ""They started destroying the first mausoleum's wooden door with their axes,"" said Ibrahim Ag Mohamed, a guide. ""Then they went inside and burned the cloth covering the grave before destroying the building with picks and axes."" Opinion: Attack on Timbuktu tomb is an attack on our humanity . The mausolea, one of which held the remains of a religious leader and the founder of the neighborhood, were destroyed within an hour, Ag Mohamed said. ""The local Islamists were reinforced by between 30-40 men carrying Kalashnikovs and axes,"" said Sankoum Sissoko, another resident. ""They started destroying the mausolea and didn't finish until they had turned the tomb into rubble,"" he said. Area residents, too afraid to try to stop the destruction, simply watched, he said. ""After the attack, the Islamists told the people that worshiping saints is not right, according to their form of Islam, and the destruction was necessary,"" he continued. Thursday's attack was at least the fourth this year on Timbukto's historic tombs, said Osmane Halle, the former mayor of Timbuktu. Read more: Militant Islamist groups destroy shrines in Mali . International outrage has been growing over the destruction of the West African nation's shrines. The United States and a number of other nations have condemned previous attacks on Mali's historic tombs. Chaos has rocked the country since March, when a military ruler overthrew the democratically elected president, shaking what had been one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but uncertainty looms. Ethnic Tuareg rebels and other Islamist militants have taken advantage of the uncertainty to seize control of the northern portion of the country, including Timbuktu. Read more: Mali hunger crisis deepens . Ansar Dine, an al Qaeda-linked group claiming control of the city, is blamed for the attacks on historical landmarks. The picturesque city, considered an important destination for Islamic scholars, features a number of ancient and prominent burial sites. Islamist militants regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their religion. They have targeted Sufi shrines, which they say they are sacrilegious. Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat by Islamic hardliners, who frown upon it. The Sufis, who took Islam to much of sub-Saharan Africa, dance, pray and preach using drama and humor. Read more: Fear grows as Mali extremists compile list of unmarried mothers . ""If the Islamists continue in this way, there will be nothing left of Timbuktu's sacred heritage that made it famous all over the world,"" Halle said. ""I ask the international community to help Mali find a solution to the country's problem, no matter if it's a military intervention or negotiations, this has to end."" Last week, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that gave regional leaders until November 19 to provide plans for an international military intervention that would oust rebels from northern Mali. The resolution, which passed by a unanimous vote, calls for retaking the region from al-Qaeda-linked rebels. In a similar attack in 2001, the Taliban destroyed ancient Buddhist relics in Afghanistan.

"(CNN)The first Muslim lawmaker to serve on the House Intelligence Committee said Friday that the violence perpetrated by Islamic radicals in the name of their religion ""certainly doesn't represent the [Muslim] religion"" and encouraged those of all faiths to come together to stop it. ""It's not any different than those who claim to be Christians or Jews or Hindus and commit atrocious acts,"" Democratic Rep. Andre Carson said on CNN's New Day of the attacks. ""I think it's clear that we will never win the war on national terrorism, or even global terrorism for that matter, without getting help from Muslims, getting help from Sikhs, getting help from non-theists — those who are committed to keeping our country safer and making the world a better place to live,"" he added. Carson's religion has become a flashpoint for criticism from conservatives following his appointment to the House Intelligence Committee this week. Conservative publications have raised questions about his ties to Islamist groups that have been investigated for allegedly supporting terrorism, and his comments during a 2012 speech that U.S. public schools should look to Islamic schools as a model. But a top Democrat came to his defense this week, with New York Rep. Joseph Crowley, vice-chairman of the Democratic caucus, saying the comments ""offended"" him in a letter to members. ""These comments deeply offend me, as I'm sure they offend all of you, which is why I hope all of us will take every opportunity to renounce these kinds of comments and discourage this kind of harmful talk,"" he wrote. On Friday, Carson thanked Crowley for his support and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her ""boldness"" in appointing him to the Intelligence Committee, and said that ""for the most part, folks have been very excited about this opportunity on both sides of the aisle."" He also weighed in on the elevated terror threat in France and the 10,000 troops the French government deployed across the country this week as a precautionary measure, following a week of violent attacks from individuals who've claimed ties to ISIS and other terrorist groups. Carson said he believes there is ""more to unearth and discover"" about the threat facing France, and was supportive of the troop deployment, which he said was ""a start"" — but cautioned against the government overstepping its bounds. ""I know they certainly don't want to become a totalitarian state, but in protecting the rights of citizens there's a delicate balance between keeping people safe and surveilling the citizens to the point where we are targeting people specifically — not because of race, not because of religion, but making sure we are targeting the right people and eliminating the threat to make people safer,"" he said. He would not endorse a further commitment of troops from the U.S. to fight the growing threat posed by ISIS in the Middle East, saying ""we don't want to have what we had in Iraq,"" but said while the administration has done a ""fantastic job"" addressing the threat, ""there's more to be done."" ""We cannot win this war unless we get help from our friends in the Arab League and the international community. It's very clear,"" he said.","Rep. Andre Carson said violence from Islamic radicals ""doesn't represent"" the Muslim religion .

"The family trip to San Diego that we've been discussing, in part to visit SeaWorld with the kids, might be off -- indefinitely. I relayed that news to my husband (he wasn't pleased) after watching the stirring documentary ""Blackfish,"" which will be showcased on CNN at 9 p.m. ET Thursday. The film tells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a 12,000-pound orca. You might be surprised to find out that the director of ""Blackfish,"" Gabriela Cowperthwaite, once would routinely take her kids to shows at SeaWorld in San Diego. That was the case until that day nearly four years ago when the whale Brancheau trained and performed with in Orlando pulled her underwater. The death led Cowperthwaite to make a documentary, raising questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity over the past 39 years. The film includes interviews with a number of former SeaWorld trainers, including one who said he would never take his child to SeaWorld. ""I am not at all interested in having my daughter who is 3-and-a-half grow up thinking that it's normalized to have these intelligent, highly evolved animals in concrete pools,"" said John Jett, a former SeaWorld trainer, who said he grew increasingly concerned about the stressful conditions the animals were living under at SeaWorld. ""I don't want her to think that's how we treat the kin that we find ourselves around on this planet. I think it's atrocious."" In conversations with parents across the country, most of whom had not seen the film and many of whom contribute to the parenting and lifestyle site Babble.com, I found strong differences of opinion about keeping animals in captivity and about taking kids to SeaWorld as well as to zoos, circuses and aquariums. Parents weigh benefits and costs of captivity . Janis Brett Elspas of Los Angeles, who describes herself as a lifelong animal lover, took her four kids, 16-year-old triplets and a 17-year-old, to SeaWorld every chance she could from the time they were very little. ""Since I love nature, I really wanted them to be exposed to that early,"" the host of the blog Mommy Blog Expert and social media strategist said in an interview. At a time when some species of whale are on the endangered list, Elspas believes places such as SeaWorld provide crucial education to children about whales. ""We need to educate children about why these whales are so important, why they're so beautiful, what their unique characteristics are, because these kids are also going to be the world's future marine biologists,"" she said. Joanna Mazewski, a mom of two who grew up in Orlando, Florida, wholeheartedly agrees. ""If we don't give our children the opportunity to go visit them, how else would they learn about these animals?"" said Mazewski, who is a Babble.com contributor. ""It's a hands-on experience and a hands-on opportunity, too."" On the other side are moms such as Pilar Clark, who believes parents should not take their kids to SeaWorld, circuses or other places where ""animals are made to perform for the enjoyment of humans."" At a very young age, Clark was deeply affected by animals in captivity, begging her parents to take her home early after trips to the circus and SeaWorld. ""I still have a photo of myself posing awkwardly in front of a lion standing on top of an elephant, and that bothered me so much,"" the mom of two, social media strategist and contributor to Babble.com said. ""I didn't really want to see the wild animals being made to do what people wanted them to do."" Explaining SeaWorld position to kids, other parents . Clark's kids, 4 and 7, have no issue with the family position of ""No SeaWorld, circuses and aquariums,"" but other parents are a different story. An awkward conversation usually ensues when other families invite Clark and her kids along to an animal park or circus. ""People are taken aback when you say, 'You know what, I don't really agree with circuses or believe in them, so we'll pass,' "" Clark said. ""That always seems to shock people a little bit, at least I've found."" Sheri Silver and her family have made a 180-degree shift in terms of their feelings about places such as SeaWorld. Silver's daughter, now 22, was obsessed with sharks and marine life in general beginning at 3 and dreamed of swimming with dolphins. So, at 10, her parents took her to SeaWorld to swim with the dolphins, and then at 16, she swam with them again in the Bahamas. But during her college years, she saw the documentary film ""The Cove,"" which explores the killing of dolphins and porpoises in Japan. Everything changed. ""She was devastated by what she learned,"" said Silver, a mom of three, blogger and food writer for Babble.com. ""She made every member of our family watch it ... and those issues became very much on our radar to the point where we stopped going to aquariums."" Once ""Blackfish"" came out, they immediately went to see it and were deeply moved. ""There's not only no kind way, no humane way to keep (whales) in captivity. It is traumatizing to them,"" Silver said. ""Once you know it, you can't ... unknow it and go with any kind of open mind or heart."" SeaWorld's conservation efforts . Elspas, the Los Angeles mom of four, says she feels bad when whales are captured or born into captivity, but she says they are not safe in nature, either, citing how some countries still permit their slaughter. Places such as SeaWorld, she says, are one of the few ways to preserve and protect each species of whale from extinction ultimately. ""I think a lot of the anti-whale-in-captivity people are thinking that people are using them for entertainment value and for their own selfish purposes, but I think it's really important from the educational aspect."" Also missing from the discussion, said Orlando-native Mazewski, are the conservation efforts by SeaWorld, which include taking in injured birds and animals and having staffers travel to beaches to recover stranded animals. ""There is a controversy,"" said Mazewski. ""At the same time, they are doing a lot of good to save a lot of animals that would be in danger or ... wouldn't survive in their natural habitats."" On the fence . Somewhere in the middle are parents such as Alice Gomstyn, who participated in coverage of the SeaWorld 2010 death during her time as a Web producer for ABC News. Gomstyn says she has to balance her concerns about animals in captivity with how certain places help endangered species continue to survive. She's waiting until her two children, 11 months and 3 years old, get a bit older to decide whether animal parks are a potential family destination. ""It's easy to say, 'Well, I'm not going to visit any of these places' "" she said. ""But when you have a child and you see his face light up at the sight of a four-legged furry thing, it's hard to deny him that joy."" Gomstyn, who is now a Babble.com contributor, also wonders what the alternatives would be if there were no SeaWorlds, zoos and aquariums, since most families can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on an African safari or on a whale-watching expedition. ""I think (kids') universes of animals, or at least live animals, would be limited to the squirrels, cats and dogs in the neighborhood, which I think would be too bad for them because kids these days in general have a lot less exposure to wild animals than they did years ago,"" Gomstyn said. ""And I think they are missing out because of that.""

"Workers employed by Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health to bury Ebola victims took drastic action this week in a dispute over pay, abandoning the bodies of 15 people in the street. Some were paraded at the entrance to a hospital Monday to stop people from entering. Another body was placed outside the entrance to a hospital administrative building. The workers have gone on strike because they say they are owed seven weeks of their ""hazard"" pay of $100 a week. Burying Ebola victims is a dangerous task, since the deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids.

"The families of two men who were fatally shot are suing the New England Patriots and its owners to prevent the football team from paying former player Aaron Hernandez, who has been charged in their slayings. The NFL team and its owner's company, Kraft Enterprises, have been named as co-defendants in a $6 million civil wrongful death lawsuit along with Hernandez. The attorney for the families is asking the court to prohibit the Patriots and its owners from paying Hernandez $3.25 million and other funds that may become due to Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges. The National Football League Players Association has filed a grievance on behalf of the former tight end after the team failed to pay him the multimillion-dollar sum, which was due in March, the lawsuit says. The wrongful death lawsuit was originally filed in February on behalf of the families of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, according to court papers. The lawsuit alleges that the victims' families have sustained both fiscal and emotional damages. Prosecutors say that in July 2012, Hernandez fatally shot de Abreu and Furtado in their car after de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez and spilled his drink at a nightclub earlier in the evening. ""We are seeking to have the families who have been victimized by these deaths have some assets set aside that they may be somehow compensated,"" according to a written statement from William Kennedy, the families' attorney.  ""The two young men in our case both supported their mothers with their modest earnings.  That support and emotional attachment has been lost forever. ""Our information is that Hernandez has received over $11M in compensation in the 3 years as a Patriot,"" Kennedy added. ""Part of his funds and assets should be set aside for the victims of his crime.  The victims should be compensated."" CNN has reached out to the Patriots and Kraft Enterprises but has not yet received a response. Hernandez was charged with murder in the deaths of de Abreu and Furtado in May. He was dropped by the New England Patriots in June 2013 after being charged with first-degree murder in the death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd.

"As far as bodies of water go, lakes are easily the most overlooked. Even hot tubs get more press. Maybe it's the large shadows cast by the mountain peaks that often surround them, or that needy ocean always crashing about and waving for attention, but lakes don't get the rave reviews they deserve. Lakes, of course, are cool with not being the center of attention. They're content to sit placidly, waiting to welcome the kinds of guests that truly appreciate the quiet lure of their wild surroundings and the luxury lodges often found upon their shores. The lodges below do a particularly good job of showing why lakes deserve to be in the discussion of great vacation retreats. Casa Palopo (Lake Atitlan, Guatemala) Unsung, unspoiled and with room for only a handful of guests, Casa Palopo overlooks Guatemala's volcano-embellished Lake Atitlan.

Mirror Lake Inn (Lake Placid, New York) You can tell a lot about a property by the way it greets its guests. At the 125-year-old Mirror Lake Inn -- which housed Olympic athletes who came to the Adirondack area for the Winter Games in both 1932 and 1980 -- house-made chocolate chip cookies come with your room key. Guests enjoy lake views through floor-to-ceiling windows from private balconies, where the scent of fresh wood smoke hangs in the air. Dining is as first-rate as the views.

"At least 13 inmates at a Venezuela prison, all of whom were on hunger strike, have died, according to the Ministry for Public Power of Penitentiary Services. Authorities said inmates at the prison became violent and started breaking down the walls and doors of the prison areas, with some breaking into the pharmacy. They proceeded to ingest multiple drugs, including antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, anti-diabetic agents, anti-epileptic drugs, and alcohol; intoxicating a group of about 145 prisoners who were treated by medical staff at the facility. The 13 deaths were as a result of ingesting drugs, the ministry statement said. The inmates, all housed at the David Viloria penitentiary center in Lara State, had started their hunger strike on Monday morning to demand the dismissal of an officer of the ministry, who they believed had been appointed director of the center. According to broadcaster Globovision, relatives of prisoners have camped out since Tuesday outside the detention center waiting for the Minister of Penitentiary Services Iris Varela to speak to them. The National Guard has been stationed outside the prison preventing access of media and family. Globovision also states that a total of 720 prisoners have been transferred to other prisons. However, families are still waiting for Varela to provide details of the transfer. According to the ministry, the David Viloria center is one of more than 70 new prison centers in the country. They were intended to phase out the old centers, which were plagued by deplorable conditions, lack of control, anarchy and violation of human rights.","At least 13 inmates die after trouble breaks out at a prison in Venezuela's Lara State .

"Baltimore (CNN) -- At just 7 years old, Kyron Chase is facing the unimaginable: His father was murdered. ""Telling my son his father had been killed was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do,"" said Kimberly Vinson, Kyron's mother. ""Their bond, it was just a bond that a lot of kids don't have with their father."" Kyron has struggled to cope after his father's death in December. And Vinson, left to raise two small children on her own, has struggled to fill the void for her son. ""My concern is how he will make it through this,"" she said. Last year, Baltimore's homicide rate hit a four-year high. Yet families such as Vinson's have few resources to help them heal from the trauma of a relative's sudden death. That's where Annette March-Grier steps in. Her nonprofit in Baltimore helps children and their families cope with grief. ""A child's grief over the loss of a loved one is often complicated by the loss of security and identity,"" said March-Grier, a bereavement counselor and registered nurse. ""This shift can be very dangerous if there's no support system there."" ""Our program provides that safe place for a child to recover."" Since 2008, her organization, Roberta's House, has provided free grief support programs to more than 2,100 people -- nearly half of them children. When death strikes a childhood . March-Grier's vision for Roberta's House stemmed from her childhood. She grew up in her family's funeral home. ""As a little girl, I would sit at the top of the stairs and peer down between the banister rails, watching as families gathered around their deceased loved ones,"" said March-Grier, 53. ""Death was all around me."" Through the years, she met thousands of grieving families -- especially children -- struggling to cope with their loss. ""I love my city. ... But people here are having crisis after crisis,"" she said. ""The violence in this city and grief are directly connected."" Today, Roberta's House -- named for March-Grier's late mother -- offers peer support groups, counseling and specialized workshops to anyone in the community. The Family Program is tailored to children 5 to 17. Volunteers help them explore their feelings and learn healthy ways of coping through journaling, games and arts and crafts. The group also offers a three-day summer camp. ""We teach our children it's OK to cry, (that) crying is really an indication of love, not an expression of weakness,"" March-Grier said. Kyron and his mom have been attending sessions at Roberta's House for a month. Vinson says her son is opening up more about his feelings and his dad. ""I (wanted) to let him know that there are other (children) that are going through the same thing he's going through,"" she said. Changing the game . Since 2011, March-Grier says she has also been helping juvenile offenders cope with different types of loss, such as the incarceration of a parent or sexual abuse. The teenagers go through a six-month program aimed to help them get on the right track. To that end, March-Grier uses a ""scared straight"" tactic: She stages a funeral for the teens and tells them to imagine it's theirs. ""We take them to the funeral home and help them see that if you're going to play the game, you have to realize there is an end to this game,"" she said. ""This is our way of trying to reach them before it's too late."" March-Grier believes grief is a public health problem. She often takes her message out into the community, providing free workshops to children and adults at local schools, churches, hospices and community centers. ""Unresolved grief can cause people to go through life severely wounded,"" she said. ""Our goal is to help people understand that grief does not have to destroy them."" With plans to expand her services and move to a larger location, March-Grier wants to continue her parent's legacy in Baltimore. ""We're giving families in this city a sense of hope,"" she said. ""We're helping to heal wounds and bring families back together again."" Want to get involved?

"Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is heading to North Carolina next week to campaign with Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis, CNN has learned. This comes as GOP officials believe Tillis, the North Carolina House Speaker, has closed the gap in his race against endangered incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan. Romney, who won North Carolina in the 2012 general election, is scheduled to attend a rally with Tillis in Raleigh next Wednesday, which ""will be a big shot of momentum"" for the campaign in the closing days, campaign manager Jordan Shaw told CNN. Tillis allies believe they have gained some support following the controversy surrounding Hagan admitting she missed a classified briefing on ISIS and other security threats to attend a fundraiser. That revelation, prompted by questioning from CNN producer Ted Barrett, prompted Hagan then to attack her opponent on missing legislative work in favor of fundraising. The race for the North Carolina seat is expected to be the most expensive Senate contest this election year and is key for the Democrats if they hope to hold onto control of the Senate. Romney is one of the Republicans' most sought after surrogates as he crisscrosses the country campaigning with Senate and gubernatorial candidates and repeatedly having to answer whether or not he would be interested in a third run for president. He has said repeatedly this month ""I'm not running.""  He appeared with Idaho Gov. Butch Otter on Wednesday and is planning on campaigning with Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, who is locked in a tough re-election race, next week. Two sources inside Mitt Romney's inner circle told CNN last month while he isn't planning a presidential bid, he's listening to a lot of people who want him to get in the race, although he remains skeptical himself. While these sources said that, as of today, it's not likely Romney would run, it can't be ruled out entirely -- and if the early seeding were to produce a weak field, Romney might be in a positioin to be a late entrant. ""A lot of people in Romneyland are rooting for him to get in,"" said one source. ""He's not one of them.""

"A rare video showing a walking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was paralyzed from the waist down by polio in 1921, has been donated to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The video, only the second such clip in existence, shows the President, his legs supported by braces, moving gingerly while holding on to an aide's arm and grasping a handrail, making his way up a ramp. He was at Washington, D.C.'s, Griffith Stadium at the 1937 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, according to a museum statement. ""The fact that he is on an incline and that it is very windy makes his walking even more arduous,"" filmmaker Ken Burns, who is using the footage in a documentary that will air this fall, said in a statement. ""The wind even presses his pants against his withered legs and you can clearly see the braces underneath."" Burns said footage of Roosevelt struggling to move is rare because the Secret Service either prohibited or confiscated cameras at the time to minimize the public's knowledge of the devastating effects that polio had had on him. The media complied with the request. ""This remarkable eight seconds provided to us by the Pennsylvania State Archives is one of the very best pieces of film that so clearly shows what a brave struggle it was for FDR to move,"" Burns said. ""This ... helps deepen the American public's understanding of the strength and fortitude this badly disabled man brought to the task of seeing our country through two of the worst crises in our history -- the Depression and World War II."" Major League Baseball pitcher James ""Jimmie"" DeShong of the Washington Senators shot the film on his 8 mm home movie camera. DeShong's daughter, Judith Savastio, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, donated the film to the Pennsylvania State Archives to ""conserve, preserve, interpret and make it accessible to the public,"" the statement said. Bob Clark, deputy director of the FDR Presidential Library in Hyde Park, New York, called the film significant because it offers a rare glimpse into how the President managed his disability. ""What you see with this film is, even going to a baseball game was difficult for him,"" he said. ""The people at the stadium saw a man with paralyzed legs, getting out of his car, locking his braces so his knees were rigid, and doing a difficult walking maneuver to get to his seat. ... What the film shows is that FDR was not hiding his disability."" Robin Glass, director of Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, where the President retired, added: ""To me it shows the public the strength and determination of FDR to live a normal lifestyle and not be limited by a crippling disease. It speaks volumes about such a determined man."" FDR was stricken with polio at 39.

"Authorities have arrested three women who have been secretly recruiting members for the female wing of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Nigeria's Defense Ministry said Friday. ""The arrested trio suspects were luring ladies, especially widows and young girls, by enticing them with male suitors who are mainly members of their terror group, for marriage,"" said Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, director of defense information. ""Before their arrest, they were on a mission to take additional briefing from the leadership of the terror group,"" said Nwachukwu. The suspects, identified as Hafsat Usman Bako, Zainab Idris and Aisha Abubakar, were arrested while traveling to the town of Madagali. Officials say one of the women, Hafsat Bako, was married to a member of the terrorist group who was killed by the military. ""Hafsat continued with the terror group, specializing in surreptitious recruitment of members into their fold,"" said the ministry. The arrests were made after a recent suicide bombing attempt on a military facility in the state of Gombe, carried out by a female suspect who blew herself up.

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israel's new hard-line foreign minister immediately distanced himself Wednesday from the 2007 relaunch of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians adopted by his predecessor, Tzipi Livni. Avigdor Lieberman's remarks come amid concerns about the new Israeli government's view of the peace process. Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the far-right Yisrael Beytenu movement, said the Annapolis agreement was never adopted by Israel's government and is not binding. He said Israel is bound to follow the ""road map"" process, started earlier this decade. The road map, put together by the Mideast Quartet -- composed of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States -- calls on Israel to stop settlement building and Palestinians to stop terrorism. The Annapolis Peace Conference, held in November 2007 in Annapolis, Maryland, brought together Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to discuss a joint statement signed by the two Mideast leaders and U.S. President George W. Bush calling for a two-state solution. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said Wednesday that the United States stands by what was achieved at the Annapolis talks and supports ""the two-state solution, and we will continue to work for that."" Of the differences between U.S. policy and statements by the new Israel government, Duguid said, ""We haven't heard their proposals yet. We haven't sat down with them."" But Israelis generally have become frustrated with the peace processes and have moved to the right in recent years, because of the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities that sparked the country's Gaza offensive. Yisrael Beytenu, which had a successful showing in recent elections and has become a major power in Israeli party politics, is a beneficiary of that right-wing trend. Lieberman made the remarks in front of Livni during the handover ceremony at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem. He took office after the formation of a new government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Palestinian officials have been critical of Lieberman's positions on Israeli-Palestinian matters and are pessimistic about the new government's will in forging the necessary compromises to reach a peace. Netanyahu ""does not believe in peace,"" Abbas said Wednesday, according to a report from WAFA, the Palestinian Authority's news agency. He urged the world to put pressure on the new Israeli prime minister to make peace. Lieberman's remarks underscore concerns about the Israeli government's way forward regarding peace talks. They come a day after Netanyahu made conciliatory comments about relations with the Palestinians but stopped short of endorsing a two-state solution, the end result foreseen in both the road map and the Annapolis processes. Abbas was also quoted as saying, ""Netanyahu never believed in a two-state solution or accepted signed agreements and does not want to stop settlement activity. This is obvious."" Israeli President Shimon Peres, presiding over the prime minister's changeover ceremony, made reference to the importance of the two-state vision. ""In parallel with the strengthening of Israel's security, the government under your leadership must invest great effort in advancing the peace process on every front,"" Peres told Lieberman. ""The outgoing government espoused the vision of two states, for two peoples, which was initiated by the American government and accepted by the majority of countries in the world. It is up to your government to decide the shape of the reality to come."" Lieberman called Egypt a key player in the region and said it has a major role in quelling the instability there. He criticized Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year because the Egyptian leader has never visited Israel. At that time, Lieberman said, ""if he wants to talk to us, he should come here. If he doesn't want to come here, he can go to hell."" His remarks drew widespread criticism in Egypt and the Arab world. Lieberman said Wednesday that he expected to be invited to visit Egypt and expected that country's representatives to visit the Jewish state. Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab League countries to have full diplomatic relations with Israel. The prime minister's office said Wednesday that U.S. President Obama and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin phoned Netanyahu to congratulate him. Both leaders agreed to meet soon with the new Israeli prime minister. The office said Obama repeated America's unqualified commitment to Israel's security, and it characterized the half-an-hour conversation between Obama and Netanyahu as ""friendly and constructive."" Duguid said, ""Israel is a close friend and ally, and we remain unalterably committed to Israel's security."" ""We will work closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu's government to advance the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East and move the parties in the direction of a two-state solution. We have full confidence in and will continue to support the government of Israel and we will work together for durable and lasting peace in the region.""

"Back in 1998, just as Harry, Bella and Katniss were on the verge of owning the front shelves of bookstores everywhere, the Young Adult Library Services Association launched Teen Read Week in an effort to mold adolescent bookworms. Monday marked the start of 2013's Teen Read Week, but with young adult literature regularly burning up the bestseller lists, it's clear many young adults don't need an excuse to seek out the written word: Sixteen- to 29-year-olds are the largest group checking out books from their local libraries, according to a Pew survey. Wizards, vampires and dystopian future worlds didn't always dominate the genre, which hit its last peak of popularity in the 1970s with the success of controversial novels by the likes of Judy Blume. In the years between, young adult has managed to capture the singular passions of the teen audience over a spectrum of subgenres. Now, as the book industry enjoys a second ""golden age of young adult fiction,"" according to expert Michael Cart, it bears asking why young adult fiction has become so successful. The proof just may be in the timeline. Young adult books that changed our lives . The very beginning . The roots of young adult go back to when ""teenagers"" were given their own distinction as a social demographic: World War II. ""Seventeenth Summer,"" released by Maureen Daly in 1942, is considered to be the first book written and published explicitly for teenagers, according to Cart, an author and the former president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. It was a novel largely for girls about first love. In its footsteps followed other romances, ands sport novels for boys. The term ""young adult"" was coined by the Young Adult Library Services Association during the 1960s to represent the 12-18 age range. Novels of the time, like S. E. Hinton's ""The Outsiders,"" offered a mature contemporary realism directed at adolescents. The focus on culture and serious themes in young adult paved the way for authors to write with more candor about teen issues in the 1970s, Cart said. The first golden age is associated with the authors who the parents of today's teens recognize: Judy Blume, Lois Duncan and Robert Cormier. The young adult books of the 1970s remain true time capsules of the high school experience and the drama of being misunderstood.  Books like Cormier's ""The Chocolate War"" brought a literary sense to books targeted at teens. But once these books devolved into ""single-problem novels"" -- divorce, drug abuse -- teens grew tired of the formulaic stories. The 1980s welcomed in more genre fiction, like horror from Christopher Pike and the beginning of R.L. Stine's ""Fear Street"" series, and adolescent high drama a la ""Sweet Valley High,"" while the '90s were an eclipse for young adult. With fewer teenagers around to soak up young adult lit due to low birth rates in the mid-1970s, books for tweens and middle-schoolers bloomed. But a baby boom in 1992 resulted in a renaissance among teen readers and the second golden age beginning in 2000, Cart said. R.L. Stine aims to give adults 'Goosebumps' ""When I was a teen in the '90s, there were probably three shelves of teen books I wanted to read,"" said Shannon Peterson, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. ""Now, I feel like it's evolved from three shelves to whole hallways of books."" The book world began marketing directly to teens for the first time at the turn of the millennium. Expansive young adult sections appeared in bookstores, targeting and welcoming teens to discover their very own genre. J.K. Rowling's well-timed ""Harry Potter"" series exploded the category and inspired a whole generation of fantasy series novelists, Cart said. The shift led to success for Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" vampire saga and Suzanne Collins' futuristic ""The Hunger Games."" But why did paranormal and dystopian tales connect so well with teens? ""Just like adolescence is between childhood and adulthood, paranormal, or other, is between human and supernatural,"" said Jennifer Lynn Barnes, a young adult author, Ph.D. and cognitive science scholar. ""Teens are caught between two worlds, childhood and adulthood, and in YA, they can navigate those two worlds and sometimes dualities of other worlds."" Now, reveling in the continued success of fantasy subgenres and series, young adult fiction is enjoying a sustained boom rather than an afterglow. Banned Books Week: Favorite novels challenged . Nostalgic hallmarks . ""It's not surprising that YA is always dealing with transformation, whether it be realistic or supernatural,"" author and publisher Lizzie Skurnick said. ""It's the only genre that can always be both. It shows teen life in full chaos. And that means constant change."" Skurnick is also devoted to reissuing classic young adult novels, from the 1930s to the 1980s. While young adult spans and mashes up multiple genres, it connects readers to transformation stories best through emotion. When David Levithan was helping develop Scholastic's teen imprint, PUSH, in the late '90s, he and his team spoke directly with teens over the course of four years to discover what they wanted in their literature. PUSH launched a line of novels by debut authors with authentic voices in 2001. ""Teens wanted things that were real, that they connected with,"" Levithan said. ""It doesn't have to reflect reality directly. They love 'The Hunger Games' not because it's real in that it happens, but the emotions there are real, and it's very relatable."" Young adult novelists don't shy away from tackling the deepest and darkest issues that teens face, from identity struggles and sexual abuse to drug/alcohol use and suicide. Authors like John Green write about the best and worst of adolescence fearlessly and honestly, building a trust within readers, Peterson said. Author Meg Cabot tried to find books she could relate to as a teen, but the ""single-problem"" novels that resulted in girls dying for their choices frustrated her. She wanted to read the ""science fiction novels about girls spying on other planets."" Now Cabot has written more than 45 young adult books. ""The whole reason you're reading is because you want some hope that you're going to get through whatever you're going through. I know how hard it was as a teenager, and I understood how it felt to be an outsider. I want to be able to offer people hope."" Meg Cabot's teen escapism and empowered heriones . Turning the page . Because young adult fiction is always changing, anything goes, said Elissa Petruzzi, Web and young adult section editor for Book Club Magazine. From sci-fi/fantasy, paranormal and dystopian to classic romance, mystery and contemporary favorites, writers can explore any subject, and readers are eager for new worlds. Contemporary standalones, or non-serial books, have returned to the forefront as a lighter response to dark paranormal and dystopian series, Barnes said. A real opportunity for growth lies in diversity, Peterson said, although young adult already surpasses children's fiction in that aspect. Cart is pleased to see more gay, lesbian and transgender characters in young adult books but admits that there is a multicultural hole, especially for Hispanic teens. Young author faces great expectations in 'The Bone Season' Cabot strives to amp up the empowerment angle for girls. As a teen, she always looked for role model heroines, so all of her female characters ""kick ass."" The genre is also just as open to male readers as it is to females, said Erin Setelius, a writer for the YA Book Addicts blog. ""Boys and girls can fall in love with the same books."" Because filling gaps is an area where young adult succeeds, the ""new adult"" genre has emerged over the past few years (beginning with St. Martin's Press coining the phrase in 2009), featuring characters in their late teens and early 20s going through the college experience and a second adolescence.  Only time will tell whether it's a trend or a budding genre, Petruzzi said. Young adult lit has become popular with readers of all ages and has even allowed parents to see what their teens care about through what they're reading, Skurnick said. After all, 55% of young adult books purchased in 2012 were bought by adults between 18 and 44 years old, according to Bowker Market Research. ""I don't think people are reading it just to relive their teen moments,"" Peterson said. ""It's so interesting to see what happens when there is all of that living, emotion and the heaviness of all that emotion, without the experience. It's such a terrible and beautiful thing to witness."" Follow Ashley Strickland on Twitter: @CNNAshley .","The first ""golden age"" of young adult fiction in the '70s featured drama and realism .

Now, 39 years later, the legend has been recognized as having also set a still-standing record at the Preakness Stakes. The Maryland Racing Commission unanimously agreed Tuesday that evidence shows Secretariat's Preakness time was faster than originally recorded, said the commission's executive director, Mike Hopkins. Penny Chenery, who owned Secretariat, and Thomas Chuckas, the president of the Maryland Jockey Club, made the request for the commission to review the evidence. The hearing lasted three hours and involved watching digital tapes and video overlays as well as listening to expert testimonies, Hopkins said. The controversy over Secretariat's time goes back to the 1973 race day. Secretariat's 1973 Preakness time reviewed . The electronic timer at the Preakness recorded a winning time of 1:55 (one minute, 55 seconds). However, two independent clockers from the Daily Racing Form individually timed the race at 1:53 2/5. Officials at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, where the race is held, admitted that there were ""extenuating circumstances"" with the electronic timer's recording and changed Secretariat's official time to 1:54 2/5. If Secretariat had indeed run the 1 3/16-mile (9.5-furlong) race in 1:53 2/5, as the Daily Racing Form timed it, it would have meant a record at the time, and one that has been matched but not beaten since. But the commission changed the official time to 1:53 flat, meaning the then-3-year-old set an unmatched best in the race, the second leg of the Triple Crown. ""For me, revisiting this dispute on a new day is matter of resolution -- for historians, for sportswriters and for racing fans,"" Chenery said. ""Their voices are supported by sound evidence, and they deserve to be heard."" Modern video technology can be used to settle the controversy, Chuckas said. ""During the last 40 years, video technology has been accepted in other professional sports as a supportive mechanism for officials to ensure fairness and accuracy in their decisions,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- President Obama's remarks Thursday on the death of Michael Brown were an echo of his powerful 2013 speech on Trayvon Martin's shooting. Notably absent was any mention of race. A year ago, the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's shooter sparked protests across the United States. Martin was 17 and armed with nothing more than a bag of Skittles candy. Protestors believed that Florida's self-defense law helped enable civilian George Zimmerman to racially profile Martin and justify shooting him in self-defense. Studies had found that whites who kill blacks are more likely to be found justified in ""stand your ground"" states like Florida. Now, a police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an African-American, in Ferguson, Missouri has reignited the discussion about racial injustice in America. Brown was 18 and planned to start college this week. Witnesses said he was shot multiple times when he refused to comply with an officer's order to ""get the f--- onto the sidewalk"" or ""get the f--- out of the street."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Although the identity of the officer has not been released, a witness who was walking with Brown at the time told CNN that the officer is white. In a primarily black city, only three of Ferguson's police officers are African-American. Facebook and Twitter are abuzz with #iftheygunnedmedown, where young men and women pair a rebellious image of themselves next to a telegenic, shirt-and-tie one to highlight societal stereotypes of minorities. Officer in Ferguson shooting had no prior disciplinary record . In response to what has become another debate of national -- and racial -- proportion, President Obama advised on Tuesday: ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds."" He alluded to the protests and looting in St. Louis. The looting was opportunistic, people taking advantage of a tragedy as a cover for criminal activity. And some of the unrest was a cry for help, desperate acts to get attention from a criminal justice system that has not adequately addressed problems of racial injustice in America. Complete coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests . But there is a major difference between the way the President addressed race in his Trayvon Martin speech and his Michael Brown remarks Thursday. It is representative of the growing disconnect between an administration that has promised to alleviate racial injustice, and a community in which there is a strong sense of disappointment. After President Obama's lyrical speech on race during his 2008 presidential campaign, minorities and civil rights groups expected the election of a black president to be more than just symbolic. This hope was solidified in the president's selection of the first black U.S. attorney general in 2009. While his first term reflected a lull in civil rights legislation, President Obama's 2013 speech on Trayvon Martin promised more. He emphasized the importance of racial profiling legislation, even though Zimmerman was a civilian and such legislation affects law enforcement. He indicated a new focus on such laws and described the one he had successfully passed as a state senator in Illinois. The President also suggested he would work on improving conditions for young black men to succeed and called for the examination of state and local laws like the Florida ""stand your ground"" laws. However since then, not much has happened. The special nature of state police powers has made federal action difficult. About two dozen states have passed self-defense laws similar to the Florida one that may have helped lead the jury to exonerate Zimmerman, but not one state has repealed them. Even on a federal level, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a Senate Judiciary hearing and Justice Department investigations have produced no solutions on such laws and the racial profiling that is inherent in their enforcement. The Justice Department considered filing a civil rights lawsuit against George Zimmerman, but did not. In addition, the administration has not made a strong effort to rally Congress around racial profiling legislation. In the meantime, allegations of racially biased actions by police have flitted across headlines, such as the New York Police Department's ""stop and frisk"" policy and chokehold incidents that disproportionately affect blacks. Social media and activism has brought underreported stories and photos to the forefront: for example, the case of Darren Rainey, a mentally ill Florida prisoner whose skin separated from his body when guards locked him into a 180-degree shower, originally garnered only local media attention. Now the petition to the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate his death has over 160,000 signatures across the nation. President Obama was right in encouraging talking and reflection, in criticizing Ferguson police for harassing peaceful protestors and journalists, and in involving the Missouri governor in crisis resolution. But he is speaking to an audience that wants more. The president should take proactive measures to address the Michael Brown case in particular, and racial injustice in general. Unlike the Justice Department's previous investigation, news of which came and went with the news of the Trayvon Martin protests, the FBI and Justice Department's investigation into Brown's death needs to be thorough, transparent and broadcast to the public. Most importantly, the administration should make racial profiling legislation a top priority. Eliminating racial injustice in the criminal justice system is an almost Sisyphean task because of the many levels -- surveillance, arrest, conviction, sentencing and imprisonment. The roots of injustice are deep and tangled. The factors that lead to tragedies such as the death of Michael Brown are entwined with the human psyche, implicit bias and socioeconomic factors that are beyond the government's control. Racial profiling legislation in particular is valued because it attacks the issue at its origin. By preventing law enforcement from disproportionately targeting ethnic minorities for investigation, interrogation and arrest, we affect the later stages of the justice system. Through training and monitoring, we change the culture of our police and court systems. In 2003, as a state senator in Illinois, Obama did pass such a bill with unanimous support. The state legislation called for the collection of data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped -- a measure that can be extended more broadly for a national bill. His bill also trained police departments on professionalization and avoiding racial biases. The U.S. Congress has been less receptive to such measures. Despite the many cries for change, the efforts of Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. John Conyers to pass the End Racial Profiling Act in Congress have been unsuccessful. But with the same fierce diplomacy that passed healthcare reform through a recalcitrant Congress, President Obama can rally Congress to honor Michael Brown, a promising teenage boy whose tragic death could have been prevented by racial profiling legislation.

"The military operation against ISIS now does have a name but the Pentagon is not expected to reveal it until later this week, a U.S. official confirms to CNN. The name will not be made public until a formal 'execution order' covering the entire mission against ISIS is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff perhaps as soon as Wednesday, . Naming the operation is a fairly bureaucratic matter, but it is typically done in large scale or significant military operations as a means of providing a mechanism for everything from budgeting of funds to awarding of medals. The execution order will spell out these details, as well as potential command arrangements, and a formal military definition of the mission. The order is not expected to be made public until after a Tuesday meeting of about 20 international chiefs of defense staff from members of the coalition meet in Washington behind closed doors to discuss the way ahead in the coalition, the official said. On the issue of the name, the official said the military has made sure the name is acceptable in languages other than English so it does not cause offense when translated. Much has already been made of the name of the enemy. President Obama and the U.S. Government call the group ISIL -- Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.

"The Burmese migrants accused of the murder of two British tourists on the Thai resort island of Koh Tao have retracted their confessions, according to Burmese media. Following a visit from a consular lawyer, the two men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, say that they made their statements admitting to killing David Miller and raping and murdering Hannah Witheridge, under duress. The two men have been in police custody since October 1 and confessed shortly after that. The murder of the British tourists occurred on September 15. The bodies were found partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads. A hoe with blood on it was found close by, police said. Aung Myo Thant, a lawyer attached to the Myanmar embassy, visited the accused and later reported that one of the Burmese migrants had only admitted the crime after being beaten by the police and threatened with electrocution. Myanmar, a former colony which gained independence from Britain in 1962, is also known by its colonial name, Burma. Calls to the Thai police force, and the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, by CNN went unanswered Thursday. Torture denied . The revelation comes a day after the national police chief held a press conference denying that the police had extracted the confessions through use of torture, the Bangkok Post reported. The Thai newspaper quoted Aung as saying, """"They told me that they were on the beach that night drinking and singing songs. ""They said they didn't do it, that the Thai police [along with their Myanmar-Thai translator] beat them until they confessed to something they didn't do. They're pleading with the Myanmar government to look into the case and find out the truth. They were a really pitiful sight. Their bodies had all sorts of bruises. I have already reported all that I have seen today to my government."" Amnesty International called upon Thai police to launch a full, independent investigation into reports that the police have been using force to extract information from migrant workers from the neighboring country in connection with the investigation. Allegations of torture should be investigated independently, and not by the Thai police, Richard Bennett, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Program director, told CNN. He also said there were questions of due process that had arisen, specifically the absence of legal counsel prior to the confession, and difficulties with interpretation. ""There is a fairly long-standing record of ill-treatment,"" in Thailand, he said. ""Impunity is also a problem. If the investigation shows ill-treatment, those responsible should pay."" The fact that the suspects are migrant workers, many of whom work in Thailand illegally, makes them more vulnerable, Bennett added. Calls to the Thai police force, and the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, by CNN went unanswered Thursday. Police Commissioner Gen. Somyot Poompanmuang had previously told CNN that DNA in semen taken from Witheridge matched samples taken from the two men. ""The DNA matching result is out already and they matched with DNA found on the female victim,"" he said. But Bennett said that regardless of the outcome, and despite the high profile nature of the case, proper procedure should be followed to allow justice to be properly served. ""We don't take a position on their guilt,"" he said. ""It is a horrendous crime, and involved British young people so there is tremendous pressure to get a conviction but this shouldn't be a reason to cut corners.""","Burmese migrants who had previously confessed to double murder retract confessions .

"(CNN) -- Former New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden was driving under the influence of drugs with a child in the car when he was arrested Tuesday after a car crash, police said Wednesday. Gooden was arrested after the two-vehicle crash about 8:50 a.m. ET Tuesday, police in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, said in a statement. Gooden, 45, lives in Franklin Lakes, authorities said. Detective Lt. John Bakelaar told CNN that the child in the car was Gooden's 5-year-old son. Gooden faces charges including endangering the welfare of a child, driving under the influence of drugs, DWI with a child passenger, leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident and reckless driving, the statement said. He was released on his own recognizance. Gooden pitched for the Mets from 1984 to 1994, winning the 1985 Cy Young Award after a 24-4 record that year. He also pitched for the New York Yankees, the Cleveland Indians, the Houston Astros and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before retiring from baseball after the 2000 season. In a November article in the New York Daily News, Gooden discussed his long struggle with drug abuse, which included prison time in 2006.

"In fresh evidence the threat of violence in Mali -- and, specifically, attacks directed at international forces -- hasn't gone away, two U.N. peacekeepers died and nine others were hurt in a suicide attack Saturday, the U.N. mission there said. The U.N. mission in the West African nation is there to guard against militant Islamists, which have been in the country for years and recently threatened to move on the capital, Bamako. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, the recent spate of attacks suggests such a threat is still very real -- especially when one considers that Saturday's attack is the third against U.N. personnel in the past week. A motorist Saturday targeted a U.N. patrol base in Ber, a village in northern Mali not far from Timbuktu. Two U.N. peacekeepers were seriously wounded when their vehicle struck a mine on Thursday, and another peacekeeper was hurt in a separate mine incident, MINUSMA said. ""Such violence is senseless, the MINUSMA pays too much of a toll in Mali,"" David Gressly, deputy special representative of the secretary-general, said in a statement. ""These attacks reinforce our determination to continue our mission alongside the Malian people.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Much of the world got to know her as Col. Wilma Deering on the ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" television series. Though she later played Kate on ""Silver Spoons,"" there was something about that Spandex that was hard to forget. But today, actress Erin Gray has found a way to combine her celebrity with the very real business of fan-based conventions. At events like Dragon*Con in Atlanta, the woman known for playing strong female characters now uses her brains to wrangle issues for her celebrity clients as they prepare for close encounters with fans. Gray runs a company called Heroes for Hire, which represents about 35 celebrity clients at conventions around the world. CNN caught up with her at Dragon*Con in Atlanta (unofficially referred to as ""PartyCon""). Dragon*Con is known for being the most ""fan-friendly"" convention, which, in itself, can pose both unique opportunities and unique challenges. Heading into the weekend, there were 35,000 people expected to attend, primarily to see some of the 400 celebrity guests who sign autographs and mingle with the crowds. Gray knew this meant that there were a lot of things to plan for. ""We create 30-page spreadsheets so that we can keep track of where we are in the process,"" Gray said. ""Are the contracts signed? Have the photos and bios been sent? Are the travel details done?"" Today, the former space colonel walks a fine line between getting her clients closer to their fans at conventions and keeping them away. ""We've had death threats before,"" she said. ""I've had my own personal stalker. I would get nude drawings of my body with a knife and a message saying 'I'm watching you' and 'I'm going to get you.' When you have a baby, you just feel so vulnerable. We couldn't figure it out because it was happening at the studio,"" Gray said. Incidentally, it turned out to be a security guard. ""The other one, I would get these 10-page tiny handwritten letters front and back and perfect penmanship, and he would say things like 'don't tell your husband about our relationship.' And you know how I found out who it was? He said, 'when you waved at me.' I waved to my postman. This is before we had stalking laws. And when something like that happens, you think, 'is being an actress worth it?' "" Luckily, Gray doesn't have those terrifying experiences anymore, but now she has clients who do. ""I have a couple of clients who give me the names of their stalkers, and I have to let the promoter know who they are and to keep an eye out for them. I have one who is obsessed with a female celebrity, and this guy e-mails me, texts me, and he'll come to a show and stand about 20 feet away and stare at her. We'll hire security, and they will be with security all day long,"" Gray said. ""Every actor has their stalker."" But the reality is that conventions like Dragon*Con can help make or break an actor's career. We are no longer living in the age of Hollywood executives determining who the stars will be, Gray said. We are living in an age of social media, where the fans have a louder voice than ever before. For example, Gray has one client whom Hollywood paid no attention to. So she went out on her own and started a webcast, and today has more than 1.7 million followers on Twitter. Ouch! That's gotta hurt all of those people who told Felicia Day, ""don't call us; we'll call you."" ""I think there's been a major shift in grass roots media because of the internet and because the geeks and nerds rule the world. They are in control in so many ways. The comic is today's Western, so many movies, and I think that if actors want to optimize their longevity, it's important for them to meet the fans because those fans are so loyal and will show up at any movie or tune in to any television show they're on,"" Gray said. The shift in Gray's own career from onscreen heartthrob to celebrity manager was completely unscripted. ""As an actress reaching her mid- to late 40s and the number of roles not being there and still having kids in private schools, there came a point when I hit bottom, and I was desperate to get a job and understand that being a model and actress my entire life since the age of 15, I didn't have the qualifications to get a normal job, nor did I want to. I couldn't see myself in a corporate environment under the thumb of some boss,"" she said. So she started talking to other female actresses in her position, and before long, they were telling her how she could make money at conventions like these. ""I went online and started booking myself, and one day Gil Gerard called me up and said, 'what are you doing?' and I told him I was going to a show in Ohio, and he said, ""Oh, I want to go, book me, and I'll pay you 10 percent."" Then Gil went and played golf with Marc Singer, and there you have it, a business was born."" Incidentally, both Gerard and Singer made appearances at Dragon*Con this year, along with a host of Gray's other clients. ""Dragon*Con is the number one, in my opinion, fan-based show in the world. The entire focus is on the fans for the fans to have a good time, to satisfy their desires and needs and so on."" Thus the art of managing a celebrity. Gray says she goes to about one con a month, sometimes more. Get the spreadsheets ready.","Erin Gray turned heads as Col. Wilma Deering on ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century""

"Serena Williams bemoaned the amount of unforced errors she made after suffering a quarterfinal defeat to fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki at the Miami Masters. The 13-time grand slam winner smashed 34 winners during her clash with the fourth-seeded Dane, but made as many errors in Tuesday's 6-4 6-4 defeat. The American has won the U.S. hard-court event five times, a feat matched only by Steffi Graf. She is on the comeback trail after a 2011 season which was blighted by injury and illness, including life-threatening blood clots on both lungs. ""I think I just struggled a bit with a lot of errors more than anything,"" the 30-year-old told the WTA Tour website. ""She did well, she moved well, and I just made too many errors. Sometimes you're not playing well. But you have to be able to play better. ""The good thing, though, is I could have played a lot better. I probably played about 20%. It would really suck if I couldn't do any better. I'm just looking forward to the next tournament and I'll try not to dwell on this too much."" Wozniacki, who lost her place at the top of the world rankings to Victoria Azarenka following the Belorussian's triumph at the Australian Open, was pleased to advance after a late rally from Williams. ""There are some players you play who, when you lead 5-1 in the second set, you know that you have pretty much won the match,"" the 21-year-old said. ""But against someone like Serena, you know you need to fight until the last point. I knew she was going to step up. I could tell she was really motivated that last game."" Wozniacki's reward is a clash with second seed Maria Sharapova, who crushed French Open champion Li Na in straight sets. The Russian, who has never won the Miami title despite reaching three previous finals, won eight games in a row on her way to a 6-3 6-0 success in just 68 minutes. The win also ended eighth seed Na's recent superiority over Sharapova, with the Chinese player having won their last four previous meetings in straight sets -- including in the semifinals at Roland Garros last year. In the men's section, 2010 champion Andy Roddick failed to capitalize on his shock win over 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer as he stumbled to a 7-5 6-0 defeat to Argentine 22nd seed Juan Monaco. The 27-year-old Monaco will face U.S. opposition again in the quarterfinals, after eighth Mardy Fish beat Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 6-3. Defending champion and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic beat 17th-ranked Frenchman Richard Gasquet 7-5 6-3 to set up a last-eight clash with Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer, who won 6-3 6-3 against 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. Ferrer's second-seeded compatriot Rafael Nadal proved too good for Japanese rising star Kei Nishikori, winning 6-4 6-4. The 10-time grand slam winner -- a three-time runner-up in Key Biscayne -- will play sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for a spot in the last four. The Frenchman beat German world No.19 Florian Mayer. Serbia's ninth-ranked Janko Tipsarevic ended the run of unseeded Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, winning 7-6 6-2. He will next play world No. 4 Andy Murray, the 2009 Miami champion, who beat French No. 13 Gilles Simon 6-3 6-4.","Serena Williams loses 6-4 6-4 to former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki .

"This is a story affecting millions of Pakistanis — and it does not involve suicide bombings, honor killings, extremism or President Zardari's mustache. ""What would you like to be when you grow up?"" I asked Sakafat, a boisterous 12-year-old girl, while visiting a remote Pakistani village in the Sindh province. ""A scientist!"" she immediately replied. ""Why can't we be scientists? Why not us?"" The confident Sakafat lives in Abdul Qadir Lashari village, which is home to 500 people in Mirpur Sakro. It is in one of the most impoverished regions of Pakistan. There was a characteristic resilience and optimism in this particular village. This should come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about Pakistan's often dysfunctional, surreal yet endearing daily existence. The 500 villagers live in 48 small huts, except for the one ""wealthy"" family who recently built a home made of concrete. The village chief, Abdul Qadir Lashari, proudly showed off his village's brand-new community toilets, paved roads, and water pump that brings fresh water to the village. These simple, critical amenities, taken for granted by most of us in the West, resulted from the direct assistance of the Rural Support Programmes Network, Pakistan's largest nongovernmental organization. RSPN has worked with thousands of similar Pakistani villages to help them achieve economic self-sufficiency. I visited the Sindh village with RSPN to witness the results of using community organizing to alleviate poverty. The staff told me its goal was to teach villagers to ""fish for themselves."" Every household in the Abdul Qadir Lashari village was able to reach a profit by the end of 2011 as a result of professional skills training, financial management, community leadership workshops and microloans. Specifically, a middle-aged, illiterate woman proudly told me how she learned sewing and financial management and was thus able to increase her household revenue, manage her bills, and use a small profit to purchase an extra cow for the family. She was excited to introduce me to her cow, but sadly due to lack of time I was unable to make the bovine acquaintance. Women play a prominent role in this village's process toward empowerment and self-sustenance. Here, in one of the most traditional and rural regions of Pakistan, almost all of the presentations were led by women. All of their daughters from the ages of 6 to 12 are now 100% literate. In comparison, only 31% of the entire village and 12% of females 15 and older can read. All this is particularly pertinent to Pakistan's wider sociopolitical context. In a country where change is so often top-down and directed by national elites mostly interested in maintaining the status quo for sake of sustaining their vice-like grip on power and wealth, grassroots empowerment can potentially change deeply ingrained feudal and tribal traditions. This power — to progressively change societal patterns and norms from the bottom up — is a rarity in Pakistan and a crucial counterweight to more extreme narratives currently sweeping the nation. The village's local community manager — a woman — reflected some of this positive sentiment when she passed on a hopeful message to America: ""We take pride in our traditional work and livelihood, and we hope you too can enjoy them. We hope to trade with you in the future and to have better relations. And we hope and believe we can be a developed nation like you."" Asked what single thing she felt was most important most for her village, she replied education. Upon asking another elderly lady what she wishes for Pakistan, she repeated one word three times: ""sukoon,"" which means peace. When it was time to depart, the people of the village presented me with a beautiful handmade Sindhi shawl, an example of the craftwork the villagers are now able to sell for profit. As I left the village with the dark red, traditional Sindhi shawl adorned around my neck, my thoughts returned to the 12-year-old girl, Sakafat, who passionately asked why she couldn't become a scientist. I looked in her eyes and could only respond with the following: ""You're right. You can be anything you want to be. And I have every confidence you will, inshallah (""God willing""), reach your manzil (""desired destination""). By focusing on education and local empowerment to lift the next generation out of poverty, Sakafat's dream could indeed one day become a reality for all of Pakistan.","Journalist Wajahat Ali recently visited a Pakistani village that is pulling itself out of poverty .

"Washington (CNN)Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, glowingly praised Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday, and urged Democratic politicians to pick sides on labor in his closing remarks at a labor summit on raising wages. Warren, who also spoke at the summit, is seen by many liberals as the best spokeswoman for their causes. Although the Massachusetts senator has said she is not running for president in 2016, Warren has been followed by presidential speculation for months as liberal groups have started movements to urge Warren to run in 2016. Trumka started his remarks by calling Warren an ""inspiration"" who embodies labor's ""highest ideals."" ""Her vision of a Raising Wages America embodies our highest ideals,"" Trumka said. ""Senator Warren is that rare political leader: she shares out values, she really connects with us, she is a genius when it comes to policy, and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics."" He continued: ""Senator Warren, thank you. You have always been and will always be a remarkable, remarkable champion of working people."" Despite labor's power within the Democratic Party, Trumka has shied away from weighing in on 2016 politics. His remarks about Warren, however, are glowing, especially compared to what the labor leader said about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former secretary of state, in August 2014. ""I think that Hillary did an excellent job as secretary of state. I think she is very, very qualified to be president,"" Trumka said at a breakfast with reporters in Washington. ""Would I say she is the favorite now? Yes. But I think anytime anybody believes there is going to be a coronation, that is dangerous for the candidate."" Last year, the AFL-CIO came to an agreement with all its members that, according to Trumka, ""no one will endorse [in 2016] until we say all of us are going to endorse."" And before doing that, the labor group plans to question all presidential candidates. But on Wednesday, Trumka urged Democrats to take sides on labor ahead of the 2016 presidential election and said that if the party wants labor there on Election Day, they need to get behind the group's priorities. ""We know that no matter what happens in the 2014 mid-term elections, 2015 would be a pivotal year,"" the labor leader said. ""It would be the year that politicians decided to stand up strong, or to retreat, afraid of responsibility. To be very, very clear about what we need, or to be murky, saying a little of this, a little of that, and a lot of 'maybe, kind of, sort of.' To build our nation's future, or to protect their own backside with caution and corporate cash."" The AFL-CIO will also step up their 2016 activity this year by taking their Raising Wages summit message to the first four presidential primary states - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Though Trumka did not mention Clinton by name, liberal activists could see 2016 implication in the labor leader's remarks. ""Trumka's comments appear to reflect the yearning of so many Americans, who long not just for more leaders like Elizabeth Warren specifically but in general, leaders who stand up for working people and not just for powerful monied interests,"" said Sally Kohn, a liberal activist and CNN contributor. ""Is Trumka implicitly endorsing Warren? I don't know, but what I think he is explicitly endorsing is more principled, populist leaders like her — including in the 2016 presidential race."" Wednesday's meeting is the first AFL-CIO summit on raising wages in the United States. Labor organizations and Democratic politicians used much of 2014 to push raising the minimum wage to $10.10. Republicans thwarted the law in Congress, but voters in reliably red Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota gave labor leaders hope when they voted to approve ballot measures to increase their minimum wages. Trumka pressed those priorities on Wednesday, urging the labor leaders assembled to use their ""collective voice"" to ""protect workers' full rights to engage in collective bargaining and hold employers accountable for violations for these rights.""","Richard Trumka heralds Sen.

"Officials in Lauderdale County, Mississippi, have operated ""a school-to-prison pipeline"" that violates the constitutional rights of juveniles by incarcerating them for alleged school disciplinary infractions, some as minor as defiance, the U.S. Department of Justice said Friday. ""Students most affected by this system are African-American children and children with disabilities,"" the Justice Department said. The federal agency's civil rights division seeks ""meaningful negotiations"" in 60 days to end the constitutional violations or else a federal lawsuit would be filed against state, county and local officials in Meridian, according to a Justice Department letter dated Friday to those officials. The letter also names two Lauderdale County Youth Court judges, Frank Coleman and Veldore Young. State and local officials couldn't be reached immediately for comment Friday. ""The systematic disregard for children's basic constitutional rights by agencies with a duty to protect and serve these children betrays the public trust,"" Thomas E. Perez, assistant U.S. attorney general, said in a statement. ""We hope to resolve the concerns outlined in our findings in a collaborative fashion, but we will not hesitate to take appropriate legal action if necessary."" In 2009, the Lauderdale County Juvenile Detention Facility in Meridian was the target of a federal class-action lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center that alleged children and teens were subjected to ""shockingly inhumane"" treatment, the center said. The alleged mistreatment included youngsters being ""crammed into small, filthy cells and tormented with the arbitrary use of Mace as a punishment for even the most minor infractions -- such as 'talking too much' or failing to sit in the 'back of their cells,'"" the center said in a statement. In 2010, Lauderdale County officials and the center reached an agreement to reform the jail system and consider alternatives to sending youths to the detention center, said the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights group. ""I think this is evidence of a broken system where the most vulnerable population of kids are not receiving their constitutionally guaranteed rights,"" Jody Owens II,  managing attorney for the center's Mississippi office, told CNN. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department accused Meridian police of automatically arresting all students referred by the city's public schools and then sending them to the county juvenile justice system, ""where existing due process protections are illusory and inadequate,"" the federal letter says. The police department command staff and officers characterized their agency as a ""taxi service"" for the schools and juvenile detention facility, without assessing the circumstances of the alleged charges against students, the Justice Department said. ""The Youth Court places children on probation, and the terms of the probation set by the Youth Court and DYS require children on probation to serve any suspensions from school incarcerated in the juvenile detention center,"" the Justice Department letter said.","U.S. Justice Department accuses Lauderdale County of violating rights of pupils .

"(CNN) -- The fugitive pilot accused of faking his own death had enough provisions to stay on the run for awhile, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say. Authorities found financial manager Marcus Schrenker, who they say  parachuted out of a plane while over Alabama, with deep cuts on his wrist at a campsite near Quincy, Florida Tuesday. But the biggest clues helping authorities piece together his complex plan were what they didn't find at the site of the crashed plane. Authorities believe Schrenker guided himself from his jump-off point to the campsite armed with pages from a 50-state road book. Authorities found the road book, with the Florida and Alabama pages missing, near the downed plane, according to a court affidavit. The financial manager may have mapped out opportunities to hide at campsites. Authorities also found a book of campsites -- also with the Alabama and Florida pages ripped out -- near the plane, according to the affidavit. When authorities found Schrenker Tuesday, he had deep cuts on his wrists. He was incoherent and bleeding so profusely he probably would not have survived another hour, a federal agent said Wednesday. Schrenker was ""verbally resistant"" to authorities' offer of medical help and was muttering a phrase with the word ""die,"" said Frank Chiumento, assistant chief of the U.S. Marshals Service office in Florida, who participated in the raid. But Schrenker also had tools to survive. He had plenty of food, water and clothes, authorities said. Federal charges were filed against Schrenker on Wednesday in the incident, with prosecutors alleging he intentionally communicated a false distress message and caused the Coast Guard ""to attempt to save lives and property when no help was needed."" Schrenker is also charged with willfully damaging, destroying or wrecking an aircraft. Schrenker was charged Tuesday in Indiana with one felony count each of an unlawful act by a compensated adviser and unlawful transaction by an investment adviser. He was taken to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare and remained there Wednesday, officials said. Indiana officials have agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to have him extradited to Indiana, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Florida. A federal arrest warrant was issued, and Schrenker will appear before a magistrate judge in Pensacola, Florida, after he is released and arrested, the statement said. Chiumento said marshals are waiting for Schrenker to be healthy enough to be released from the hospital before charging him as a fugitive from justice. Authorities say Schrenker took off alone Sunday night from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA-46 en route to Destin, Florida. Over Alabama, he contacted air-traffic controllers, saying the windshield had imploded and that he was bleeding profusely. Court documents indicate Schrenker had planned to say exactly that. On the back of a book found near the crash, there was a list of what appeared to be summary points, ""which included 'cracked windshield, window imploded, bleeding profusely' or words to that effect,"" according to the affidavit. Police suspect he then put the aircraft on autopilot and parachuted to the ground. The plane later crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, missing a group of homes by 50 to 75 yards, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County, Florida, sheriff's department. Quincy is about 215 miles southeast of Childersburg, Alabama, where Schrenker was first spotted after authorities believe he bailed out of the aircraft.  Watch what authorities believe happened » . Marshals say Schrenker showed up at 2:30 a.m. Monday at a home in Childersburg, about 35 miles south of Birmingham, telling a resident he had been in a canoeing accident. After getting a ride into town, he was taken by police, who were unaware of the crash, to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said. Officials believe he fled Harpersville on a 2008 red Yamaha street bike he had stashed at a storage unit earlier, also using an assumed name. Investigators found the storage unit empty, with some wet clothes left behind. Officials found the motorcycle at the campground Tuesday night. Chiumento declined to reveal how authorities tracked down Schrenker other than to say the lead came from the Birmingham marshal's office. Authorities think Schrenker defrauded investors through three companies he owns before attempting his vanishing act.  Watch what a friend and an attorney say about Schrenker » . A lawyer for Schrenker's wife attempted to distance his family from the incident, saying she and the couple's three young children ""are victims of this man's deceitfulness."" ""She is not guilty of anything other than trusting her husband of 13 years,"" said attorney Mary Schmid, who is representing Michelle Schrenker in divorce proceedings. Michelle Schrenker contacted her last summer to discuss a divorce because he was having an affair, Schmid said in a statement. ""At the time, she wanted to work on reconciling with her husband,"" Schmid said. But the affair continued, and Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce December 30, the attorney said. The divorce filing was based on Marcus Schrenker's infidelity and not the accusations of investment fraud, the statement said. ""In fact, Michelle first learned of the allegations against him when, on December 31, 2008, the police and investigators came to her door to search her home. To Michelle's dismay, at the time her home was being searched, Marcus was in Florida with his girlfriend."" ""Everyone should remember that Michelle and her children are suffering through a terrible time right now,"" the statement said. ""Through no fault of their own, they are having to deal with the repercussions of this man's behavior and will be doing so for a long time to come.""

"(CNN)There used to be an ad campaign for American Express featuring the line, ""Do you know me?"" Larry Wilmore could probably be its poster boy. The writer and comedian, whose new ""The Nightly Show"" debuts on Comedy Central on Monday after Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show,"" has generally stayed behind the scenes. Sure, he's popped up occasionally on ""The Daily Show"" as ""Senior Black Correspondent,"" but he's devoted much of his career to writing and producing. It didn't start out that way. In the 1980s, he dropped out of college to become an actor and stand-up comedian. (You may remember him as a police officer on ""The Facts of Life."") It was a few years later when he decided to become a TV writer. As Wilmore tells it, he was just being practical. ""I knew Hollywood wasn't going to find me,"" he told New York magazine of his acting years, when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to Eddie Murphy's fast-talking types. ""I needed to be able to control my own destiny. Being an actor was too flighty."" After success as a writer for ""In Living Color,"" ""Sister, Sister"" and ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"" he turned producer with ""The PJs,"" the animated Eddie Murphy show, and the offbeat ""Bernie Mac Show."" He had returned to standup and done some hosting with a touring show called ""Larry Wilmore's Race, Religion and Sex,"" but was ready to go back to producing as the show runner for ""Black-ish."" Instead, he decided to stay in front of the camera to host ""The Nightly Show,"" which is taking over the ""Colbert Report"" time slot. He doesn't seem intimidated. Not only is he going to be in Colbert's old offices and using his old studio, ""I'm also moving into Stephen's house and driving his old car,"" he told The New York Times. Wilmore grew up in the Los Angeles area, where comedy was a regular part of his growing up. It's still a family affair: His brother Marc is a writer for ""The Simpsons."" Hard work is also in his makeup. His father was a probation officer who decided to become a doctor -- in his 40s. ""He started taking premed courses, and he just did it. He was a really solid student because he had perspective,"" Wilmore told The New York Times. ""He wasn't out playing beer pong every night. It was such a lesson to me."" Wilmore has distinguished himself on ""The Daily Show,"" where his Senior Black Correspondent has chimed in on such subjects as Black History Month, Barack Obama's presidency and the Ferguson violence. He's already had to adjust to changes at ""The Nightly Show,"" which was originally announced as ""The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore."" Unfortunately for Comedy Central, Fox decided to develop a project based on the 2002 Tom Cruise movie, so Comedy Central opted for ""The Nightly Show."" But the easygoing Wilmore is OK with that. Besides, the show wasn't just going to be about people of color, he told The New York Times. ""It was never intended to be a show only about minorities,"" he said. ""It's a show about underdogs, and that happens in a lot of different forms, whether it's race, gender or whatever."" According to New York magazine, the new show will have some regular cast members, a few panelists and Wilmore, anchoring it all with monologues and his distinct take on the news. Rory Albanese, the ""Nightly Show's"" executive producer, told The Wall Street Journal that Wilmore's training behind the scenes will serve him well. ""Larry's like a Jedi"" of TV and comedy, he said. Wilmore himself is taking a casual attitude to the inevitable attention. You didn't know him before? You may soon see him everywhere, but he'll be the same Larry Wilmore regardless. ""It's too late for success to do anything to me. I'm too old. Success had its chance,"" he told The New York Times. ""It's too late for you, success. You had your shot. You're not going to change me at this point.""","Larry Wilmore's ""Nightly Show"" taking over Colbert's old time slot .

"(CNN) -- More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded during Israel's three-week offensive in Gaza, the Web site of the Palestinian Authority's Central Bureau of Statistics said Monday. A Palestinian man Monday prays in the rubble of his home,  destroyed during Israel's offensive in Gaza. Louay Shabana, head of the agency, said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Shabana put the economic destruction at more than $1.9 billion. The fighting largely stopped Sunday with a cease-fire. Israel has said 13 of its citizens -- including 10 soldiers -- were killed during the offensive, which started December 27. Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. Gaza is in need of humanitarian, economic, sanitary and social help as a result of the Israeli attacks, Shabana said. The attacks destroyed public sector and private buildings in Gaza, affecting even the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's facilities and halting economic and social services, the statistics agency said.  Watch Palestinians recover bodies from rubble » . Gaza's gross domestic product was slashed by 85 percent during the 22 days of war, and it could take a year for the economy to recover, the agency said in a preliminary report. About 80 percent of crops in Gaza were destroyed, according to the agency. ""The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief, so many families have been destroyed in so many ways,"" said John Ging, the top United Nations official in Gaza. Ging, UNRWA's Gaza director of operations, said the bill could reach ""billions of dollars."" Among the dead were 159 children, two of whom died in an UNRWA school that was shelled Saturday, Ging said. Gaza's main border crossings, which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, were open Monday. Infrastructure repairs were being made, but 400,000 people still had no water, according to Ging. Streets in some northern Gaza towns were flooded with sewage, and about 50 U.N. facilities were damaged, he said. More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday, less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005, said John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site. ""This was not a war against the Palestinians,"" he said. ""It was an operation of self-defense against Hamas and related terror organizations. Unfortunately, this task was made extremely difficult by Hamas, as they made the choice to use civilians as human shields."" Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said. The operation's goal, he said, ""was to improve the security situation in southern Israel, and to facilitate peaceful living for the Israeli civilians living there."" ""We asked ourselves how to accomplish this, and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels, the terrorists themselves, and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population,"" the officer said. He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday's cease-fire declaration. ""We want to give this cease-fire a chance, but if Hamas chooses not to, we will utilize all of our means,"" he said.","Israeli offensive caused $1.9 billion in economic destruction in Gaza, official says .

"(CNN) -- Indiana financial manager and pilot Marcus Schrenker is a smooth talker who promised investors steady returns on their money, said two former commercial pilots named in an Indiana Department of Insurance complaint. Marcus Schrenker's companies were under investigation by the Indiana Securities Division. Police believe Schrenker attempted to fake his death by bailing out of his plane over Alabama. He was found late Tuesday in Quincy, Florida, with marks on his body consistent with a suicide attempt, said Lt. Jim Porter, a spokesman for the Gadsden County sheriff's office said. Those who knew Schrenker shared stories of a charming man with lofty promises. Joe Mazzone and Charles Kinney said they trusted Schrenker because he came highly recommended by other pilots. ""It was all word of mouth, and when you're a pilot, you trust. That's what you do and what you're used to doing,"" said Mazzone, 57, of Auburn, Alabama. ""His modus operandi is, he flies into your city dressed up in a thousand-dollar suit and sits down with you, buys you lunch, and the next thing you know, he has you on his side, and you move your money to his Heritage Wealth Management."" A judge in Indiana froze Schrenker's assets at the request of investigators looking into his business dealings. The order also applies to Schrenker's wife, who was seeking a divorce, and his three companies: Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth management. Those companies are ""the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division,"" said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana secretary of state. ""You'd think nothing would surprise you any more,"" Jim Atterholt of the Indiana Department of Insurance said Tuesday. ""We'd be less than honest if we didn't tell you this was a shock and anybody who's going to jump out of an airplane to avoid one of our hearings next week ... it's certainly unusual to hear.""

Authorities say they later found that he had stashed a motorcycle in a storage facility in Harpersville, again using a fake name and saying he would retrieve it Monday. Police think he used it to leave town. ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars are at stake -- in upwards of a million dollars, potentially more,"" Atterholt said. ""We've had folks calling since they've seen the media coverage of this story, we've had new folks calling, and we don't know the scope of the damage that he has done or alleged to have done."" Schrenker was licensed, he said, and allegedly was defrauding investors through annuities. ""When you have an annuity and you sell it, there are a lot of penalties that the insured incurs, and the first time you buy an annuity, the agent makes a very nice commission,"" Atterholt said. ""And so every time he sells a new annuity, he gets a nice commission. So it's a double hit for the consumer and a nice bump for the agent."" Kinney, 49, of Norcross, Georgia, said he befriended Schrenker in 1996. ""This guy was the most charming guy you'll ever meet,"" said Kinney, who allowed Schrenker to manage his money starting about 2003. Kinney then encouraged his parents to invest about $2 million with Schrenker. ""This guy was family to me,"" Kinney said. ""He's a fantastic nice guy. He's well-spoken. His customer service was impeccable. You call the guy on the phone, you would get him. ""He told my parents that they were investing in various insurance products, but they didn't really know what that meant. I didn't really know, either. We trusted him,"" Kinney continued. ""He said this is a safe place to put money, to avoid all the world's dangers like terrorism and impending doom and gloom associated with it. ""In that climate, back then, you bought it. You believed him that he would protect your money."" Both pilots say Schrenker gave them vague explanations about where their money was invested. Kinney and Mazzone said Schrenker assured them that he was not making commissions on their investments and that the pilots and their families would receive only one statement each year showing returns. But Schrenker's business dealings, and the upcoming hearings with state officials, seemed to be getting to him, according to friend and neighbor Tom Britt. ""He always seemed a little stressed,"" said Britt, who said he has known Schrenker for four or five years. Schrenker's wife, Michelle, filed for divorce in Hamilton County Superior Court on December 30, according to the Herald Bulletin in Anderson, Indiana. A hearing was set for February 5. Britt told CNN affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis, Indiana, that the couple has two young sons and a daughter and that Schrenker was involved in school activities. Once insurance companies found out about Schrenker's activities, Atterholt said, they have been attempting to help the consumers. ""They were not working with him, but they were trying to fix the problem after it occurred,"" he said. The department is seeking fines against Schrenker and the revocation of his license, Atterholt said. ""This gentleman, if these allegations are true, he's clearly a crudball,"" he said. ""Anyone who would do this to their friends and neighbors and be so brash about it deserves the full penalty that's coming to them."" Attorney Lisa Harpeneau said she took the call from Kinney in August 2007, and he told her ""we had a rogue agent in the state of Indiana."" However, Schrenker is also accused of defrauding people outside of the financial arena. A suit filed in January 2008 in Houston County, Alabama, accuses him of misrepresenting the condition of an aircraft he sold to a local man. Schrenker told Barnett Hudson that the 1996 Extra Flugzeugbau Ea 300L aircraft was ""squawk free,"" had ""exceptional maintenance"" and had ""never been damaged,"" according to the suit. But Hudson says he later learned that the plane had made a ""hard landing"" and that a wing had been overstressed, and that Schrenker had made a $104,000 claim with his insurance company for damage to the plane but made only cosmetic repairs. The suit claims that the defendants, including Schrenker, ""breached their express warranty by selling an aircraft that was not squawk-free ... had been damaged and was not fit to even be flown, given the internal damage to the wing.""

"Nurse Kaci Hickox has cut a deal with authorities that permits her to travel, more or less freely, while monitoring her health. But Hickox, who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, says she won't go into town where she lives or public places, even though she's allowed. ""The truth is I completely understand that this town has been through a lot and there's still a lot of fears and misinformation out there. I think we need to start addressing those issues,"" she told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday night. ""It's also true that I only moved here to Fort Kent, Maine, in August. So, you know, there are a lot of people who don't know me. I'm still an outsider, and I just sort of want to respect their wishes,"" she said. On Friday, a judge in Maine ruled in favor of Hickox, who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities. District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere said local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine, and ordered Hickox to submit to ""direct active monitoring,"" coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear. Weighing returning Ebola workers' liberty, public safety . Maine authorities had wanted Hickox to stay home for the remainder of a 21-day period -- the incubation time for the deadly virus -- following her return to the United States, although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms. ""There is no science behind it with this disease,"" she told CNN about quarantine. ""We know that Ebola is not transmitted as easily as many other diseases and that self-monitoring and even an enhanced version, which is what most states in the U.S. are going to now ... This will work,"" Hickox said. She first made news when she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders. Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent. She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola, including an elevated temperature, to be isolated. ""The biggest reason that I fought is because I, you know, felt so much fear and confusion, and I imagined what my fellow aid workers were going to feel if they came back to this same situation -- and the more I thought about the fact that these policies are being made by politicians, really not the experts in the field -- the more I felt like I had no choice but to fight back,"" Hickox said. The ruling in Maine just applies in her case. It has no bearing for anyone else possibly returning from working with Ebola patients in West Africa, which is why Hickox believes more work must be done. ""I'd like to see more leadership at the national level as well. We really need evidence-based policies and these knee-jerk reactions, you know, they're just not being well thought out,"" she said.

"Joint Base Lewis-Mcchord, Washington (CNN) -- A military judge sentenced a soldier accused of being part of a rogue Army ""kill squad"" that murdered civilians in Afghanistan to three years in military prison and to receive a bad-conduct discharge Friday. At the opening of his court martial for allegedly killing civilians in Afghanistan, Army Specialist Adam Winfield pleaded guilty to manslaughter and use of an illegal controlled substance. Winfield is one of six soldiers from the 5th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division who, while on assignment in Afghanistan, are accused of participating in illegal killings of civilians and covering up the alleged crimes by making it appear as if they were insurgents. An additional six soldiers are accused with lesser crimes in the case, including helping to cover up the killings. Winfield originally faced five charges including murdering three Afghan civilians, but Friday accepted a plea agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to lesser charges and agree to testify against other soldiers in the case. He faced a maximum of 17 years behind bars. With time already served, Winfield will serve about two more years and will be demoted to the rank of private. He will also receive a bad-conduct discharge, rather than the more severe dishonorable discharge. During his testimony Friday, Winfield told the military court that he was afraid of his Staff Sergeant. He said Sgt. Calvin Gibbs concocted ""scenarios"" where the men would select Afghan civilians to murder and then place weapons on them so they would appear to be insurgents who had attacked U.S. forces first. During a May 2010 mission to a village called Qualaday, Winfield testified that Sgt. Gibbs pointed to an unarmed Afghan man. ""Is this the guy?"" Winfield testified Gibbs asked him and Pvt. Jeremy Morlock. ""I had an idea that Sgt. Gibbs was looking for a kill,"" Winfield testified. The soldiers separated the man from his wife and young children, Winfield said. Then, he said, they killed the man by throwing a grenade at his feet and shooting him. They later claimed the Afghan man had thrown the grenade at them. Winfield said Friday he fired his automatic weapon away from the man as to pretend to have taken part in the alleged murder. But he admitted he did nothing to keep his fellow soldiers from carrying out the alleged execution of an unarmed civilian. ""I didn't say no, I didn't object to it,"" Winfield told the court. Winfield said the group's alleged ringleader, Sgt. Gibbs, was concerned he would talk about the alleged murders. Gibbs, Winfield said, threatened that he could kill him and make it look like an accident had taken place while Winfield was repairing a vehicle or working out in the gym. When Winfield went to speak with an Army Chaplain about depression he was suffering from, he said Gibbs intercepted him. ""Sgt. Gibbs reminded me I shouldn't be talking about things I shouldn't be talking about,"" Winfield testified. Although Winfield said he was pressured to keep quiet, he testified no one forced him to take place in the alleged killings. ""If I had done my duty, he would still be alive,"" Winfield said, referring to the Afghan man he said his fellow soldiers murdered. In March, another soldier, Pvt. Morlock, pleaded guilty to killing that man and two other Afghan civilians for thrills and covering up the murders. Morlock's chilling testimony painted a picture of soldiers gone rogue -- abusing drugs, executing Afghan civilians they referred to as ""savages"" and posing in photographs over the dead men. Morlock is serving a 24-year sentence in prison. Sgt. Gibbs, who also faces court martial in the case, has said the killings were justified under Army rules of engagement. Gibbs is also accused of taking body parts from the dead men to keep as grisly souvenirs. Winfield's father, Christopher Winfield, previously told reporters that his son had told him about the alleged killings and that he was afraid that his fellow soldiers might target him for speaking out. Christopher Winfield said he tried to report the group's alleged actions to the Army but was ignored. The Army has said it is investigating the claims made by Winfield's father that he tried to alert officials about the alleged murders. During testimony Friday, both of Winfield's parents lashed out at the Army for what they called a failure to act on the information they had provided. But Emma Winfield said her son takes responsibility for his part in the alleged murders. ""Adam definitely understands the error that he made,"" she said. ""He is filled with remorse."" In halting testimony before he was sentenced, Winfield told the court: ""I was sorry for what happened here, I wish it didn't go the way that it did,"" he said. ""I wish I had been braver.""","NEW: Winfield will receive a bad-conduct discharge .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A federal lawsuit was filed Tuesday against Atlanta police over a September raid at a gay club, on behalf of 19 patrons who say they were forcibly searched and detained. The suit, filed by the gay-rights group Lambda Legal, names Atlanta Police Chief Richard Pennington and 48 officers who were at the Atlanta Eagle bar the night of September 10. ""The Atlanta Police Department dispatched about 20 to 30 officers to the Atlanta Eagle, including its 'Red Dog' unit dressed in SWAT team gear,"" according to a statement from Lambda Legal. ""But inside the bar, the APD found no public sex, no drugs or illegal weapons."" No patrons were charged with any crime, the organization said. During the raid, patrons were made to lie face down on the floor while background checks were run on everyone, the statement said. ""Eagle bar patrons heard anti-gay slurs; were forced to lay in spilled beer and broken glass; and one was forced to lie on the floor even though he had injured his back in the Iraq War."" Some of the patrons were restrained with handcuffs, and officers used excessive force, including shoving some people to the floor and kicking others on the floor, the lawsuit says. Authorities searched everyone on the property, seizing their driver's licenses or other identification, the suit says. ""These actions were taken without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that any individual patron, let alone every person at the establishment, was involved in criminal activity whatsoever,"" said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Atlanta City Attorney Roger Bhandari said in a statement Monday that the city had not been served with the suit or had an opportunity to review it, so he would not comment. Bhandari's office told CNN on Tuesday that its response was the same, as it had not seen the suit. The only charges filed were against Eagle employees, for allegedly violating the city's law about unlicensed adult entertainment ""because four dancers were observed, in the words of the arresting officers, allegedly 'wearing underwear' and 'dancing,' "" the lawsuit said. ""Imagine if the police walked into a Wal-Mart and see someone shoplifting, and because they see what they think is a crime taking place in Wal-Mart, they take everyone at Wal-Mart, throw them on the floor, spread their legs, put their hands in their pockets, take their IDs, put their name in the computer, simply because they're out of place or someone else may or may not be doing something wrong,"" co-counsel Daniel Grossman said at a news conference Tuesday. The suit seeks damages and alleges that police violated the patrons' constitutional rights and that the individual officers committed false imprisonment, assault, battery and trespassing. It also requests a jury trial. ""The illegal activity going on in the Atlanta Eagle that night was committed by the APD,"" Greg Nevins, supervising senior staff attorney in Lambda Legal's southern regional office, based in Atlanta, said in the statement. ""If it is APD procedure for elderly men and wounded veterans to be thrown to the floor and harassed simply for being in a bar having a drink after work, then APD should change its procedures."" ""People have asked me why I'm doing this,"" plaintiff Geoffrey Calhoun told reporters. ""I'm not doing it because I have a vendetta against the police. I work for a police department. I'm an emergency communications officer. I do my part to make sure these officers go home. I don't work for the city of Atlanta. ""I was in the bar drinking beer, playing a video game, and I was dehumanized and humiliated and laid on the floor for no reason,"" he said. ""That's why I'm doing it."" The suit alleges undercover officers entered the bar before 11 p.m. and had a drink, then later ""began screaming at patrons and employees to 'hit the floor' and get down on the ground."" ""Several plaintiffs were in terror and feared for their lives, believing that the Eagle was being robbed or invaded by criminals or gay-bashers who might kill or injure them,"" the suit continues. Other officers came in, including the ""Red Dog Unit,"" a special force that provides ""aggressive police presence"" in areas with high drug use, the suit said, citing the Atlanta Police Web site. Many of the officers in that unit were wearing black, paramilitary-style clothing not immediately recognizable as police uniforms, the suit says. While lying on the floor, some people asked permission to move away from the broken glass and were told to ""stay down and shut the [expletive] up,"" the suit alleges. In all, they lay on the floor for 30 minutes to more than two hours, as they were released one by one or in small groups, the suit says. Those who asked questions were also told to shut up, threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct or ""threatened with violence and physical harm,"" the suit says. ""Some were retaliated against by being forced to remain at the Eagle long after they had been searched. ""All persons at the Eagle complied fully, promptly and peacefully with all demands made by the officers, no person at the Eagle offered any physical resistance to the officers whatsoever, and none was charged with obstructing the officers in any way,"" the suit says. Police have said that if they go into a bar, it is procedure to have patrons lie on the floor and be searched, and everyone's identification is taken and checked, Nevins told reporters. ""They didn't say this the night of the Eagle raid ... this happened like a month later,"" he said of the police comments. ""They had plenty of time to figure out all the facts, and they knew they were going to be meeting with the media, and it was ultimately recorded, and they specifically went on record and said, 'This is what we always do, this is standard operating procedure,' and that's what makes this case so outlandish.""

"Every explosion in Gaza seems personal to Said Durrah. The Washington-area resident has so many relatives in Gaza that he can't count them all: uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, and so on, in Zaytoon, Rimal and other Gaza communities. His mother is one of nine children, many of whom still live in the Palestinian territory. ""Every missile hits close to home, pardon the pun,"" he said. ""It's the worst reality television you'd ever want to watch."" For example, when the past week's violence between Israel and Hamas' military wing in Gaza killed a family of 10 in Gaza, Durrah learned that he was distantly related to them. The family was an in-law of a cousin, he said. Will cease-fire last? ""Gaza is very much the type of place where everybody is connected,"" said Durrah, 30. Wednesday's cease-fire between Israel and Hamas has provided some comfort, until the smoke clears and the wreckage can be assessed in Gaza, Durrah said. ""A cease-fire may bring a little bit of relief, but when the cease-fire is done, they return to the status quo -- minus their homes,"" Durrah said. ""They have to rebuild them without any means to do so, so it's going to be tough."" How U.S. Jews view the conflict . Arab-Americans, Muslims and the Palestinian diaspora are focusing renewed energy and concern on Gaza, a sliver of land along the Mediterranean coast that is about twice the size of Washington and is populated by 1.6 million people, including 1.1 Palestinian refugees. ""Palestine is a central issue for most Arab-Americans,"" said Laila Mokhiber, spokeswoman for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. ""Overall, Arab-Americans want to see an end to the siege on Gaza. Until that happens and until the Palestinians are able to exercise their basic human rights, we can't expect to see a lasting cease-fire or peace,"" Mokhiber said. Analysis: Conflict shifts balance of power . Many Arab-Americans say Gaza is under Israeli occupation. Durrah likened Gaza to ""a cage,"" walled-in and cut off to the outside world by Israel. Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza shortly after Hamas was elected to run the Gaza government in 2006. That blockade -- as well as Israel's military might, backed by the United States -- has created humanitarian concerns in Gaza, according to the Arab-American group. The West Bank is also part of the historical conflict between Israel and Palestinians. ""The occupation of both the West Bank and Gaza and the blockade against Gaza -- as long as that is a reality, you're going to see tensions between Palestinians and Israel,"" Mokhiber said. ""You have civilians against the fourth strongest military in the world. They're killing kids. They're killing civilians. It's not military against military."" Durrah owns an event management business that operates fund-raisers for Palestine. He's also a comedian who does stand-up in Las Vegas and Manhattan. But the carnage between Hamas in Gaza and Israel is no laughing matter, and he doesn't engage in the endless arguments so common in the Mideast about who started what in a centuries-long history, he said. Timeline of the conflict . ""What do you say about a place that has been occupied for more than 50 years,"" Durrah said. ""This is a situation where people were born in occupation and lived their entire lives in occupation and died in occupation. It's crazy to me. ""If you cage an animal long enough, eventually when you get close to that cage, they're going to hiss at you and they may even scratch,"" Durrah said. Durrah's family received a phone call Tuesday from relatives in Rimal, Gaza. ""They were literally telling my mother how glass shakes. They were just afraid. They don't know what tomorrow brings or what the next hour brings,"" Durrah said. Those perils are difficult for Durrah to imagine. It's hard on him, too. ""It's fear of going to sleep and getting a phone call or, worse, not getting any phone call and wondering -- having the feeling of whether no news is good news or not,"" Durrah said. ""Our issues are so small in comparison to what they're going to go through. We may not be able to sleep because of a cricket in the room, but they are trying to sleep through the soundtrack of blasts and missiles."" This month's exchange of Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes has prompted pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel rallies throughout the United States. On Wednesday evening, the Congress of Arab American Organizations in Michigan, home to a large Arab diaspora, held a vigil in front of the Dearborn City Hall in support of the Palestinians, and more than 500 Palestinian-Americans, other Arab-Americans, Muslims and others attended the event, said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, a weekly bilingual newspaper in Dearborn, Michigan, who also organized the event. Gaza has ""been under Israeli siege for many years which makes it a large virtual prison,"" the group said in a statement. ""Just 43 kilometers (about 27 miles) long and 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) wide, most of its residents are Palestinian refugees who have lived in camps since 1948."" The violence has prompted an outpouring of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, said Saleem Zaru, a Palestinian-American who is executive director of United Palestinian Appeal in Washington. In the past five days, the nongovernmental organization received between $40,000 and $50,000 in donations, which will help 550 families in Gaza who need food and shelter because of  the conflict, Zaru said. Donors include Jewish-Americans and people in Asia, he said. ""Some of their houses have been bombed and it's going to be a while before they can get back to them,"" Zaru said of the Gaza families. ""We're dealing with this on a day-by-day basis.""","More than 500 people attend vigil Wednesday evening in Dearborn, Michigan, for Palestinians .

"It's a tiny country of 5½ million people, but suddenly Denmark feels like the most happening place on the planet. First, a Copenhagen restaurant few people had heard of was voted best in the world -- and held on to the title for three years in a row. Then Danish TV dramas ""The Killing"" and ""Borgen"" captured the imagination of a worldwide audience. And now designers Malene Birger, Ivan Grundahl and a new generation coming up behind them are taking the international fashion scene by storm. ""Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen,"" trilled Danny Kaye in his movie portrayal of Denmark's famous fairytale author, Hans Christian Andersen. And it is wonderful -- though there's a lot more to the Danish capital than the beautiful little harbor surrounded by quaint townhouses that drew Andersen to the city nearly 200 years ago. Great experiences awaiting the curious traveler in Copenhagen include: . Nicely tickled taste buds . Noma, thrice voted world's best restaurant, may be solidly booked for months, but there are other places to sample the New Nordic cuisine this rustic eatery has inspired. The main principle is super-fresh Scandinavian produce, inventively prepared. Check out Relae, opened by an ex-Noma chef, as well as Radio, Aamann's, Geranium and Nimb Louise. At the other end of the spectrum is traditional fare such as smorrebrod (delicious open sandwiches) and crisp, buttery Danish pastries that put mass-produced imitations to shame. Lagkagehuset is the pace for great Danish, as popular to start the day in Copenhagen as a post-partying hot dog is to end the night. Locals swear by John's Hot Dog Deli on bustling Axeltorv Square, and get their dog slathered with remoulade sauce, raw and fried onions as well as ketchup. CNN's travel Photo of the Day . A walk on the wild side . Many tourists don't get far beyond picturesque Nyhavn, where in summer you can barely move along the cobbled harbor lined with colorful old houses and restaurants. But thanks to ""The Killing,"" bolder travelers are taking walking tours of the show's Vesterbro locations and exploring other edgy neighborhoods. Once a red-light district, Vesterbro has gentrified and is now the hippest residential area in town as well as a center of lively nightlife. Head for the old meat-packing plant, now an art venue, and keep going till you hit the White Town -- the meat-packing district and now home to popular late-night hangouts such as Karriere and the Fiskebar. Edgier yet is Christiania, taken over by hippies 40 years ago and an official ""free town"" in the heart of the city. Residents decorate their public buildings with amazing graffiti and have built spectacular family homes around a lake. Despite the alternative activities taking place, tourists will come to no harm -- so long as they respect the strict no photography policy. The Nemoland outdoor bar puts on free weekend concerts May through August. Awe-inspiring American castles . Shopping till you drop . Stroget, Europe's longest pedestrian street, is lined with great boutiques -- check out Ivan Grundahl, whose clothes look more Japanese than Danish, and the two big department stores, Illum and Magasin du Nord. For more eclectic finds, stroll down Store Strandstraede, just off the main tourist center of Nyhavn, for antiques and unique housewares as well as fashion, and also check out Kronprinsensgade and Elmegade. FN92 on Larsbjoernstraede is considered one of the city's finest vintage fashion emporia, while Georg Jensen is Copenhagen's world-famous silversmith. A treat for your inner child . Given the affection for Andersen's fairy tales, it's no surprise Copenhagen's most-visited attraction is the tiny statue of the Little Mermaid on the waterfront. And another is the nearly 170-year-old Tivoli Gardens, a lovely amusement park that offers beautiful gardens, a pantomime theater and top restaurants as well as truly fearsome-looking fright rides. Copenhagen also has a state-of-the-art zoo and clean outdoor swimming pools in the harbor with lifeguards and special sections for children. Five places to find mermaids . A feast for the eyes . Danish design is world-famous -- think Arne Jacobsen, Bodum and Bang & Olufsen -- and Copenhagen has some spectacular buildings, too. The Old Stock Exchange is a striking 17th-century blend of red brick and curlicued green gables, while the Royal Hotel, designed for SAS airline by Jacobsen in the late 1950s, has a lobby full of his iconic midcentury modern Swan and Egg chairs. The Hotel Astoria, next to the ugly Central Station, made headlines when it opened in 1935 boasting Copenhagen's first revolving doors. Despite a faded exterior, it's had updates to become a modern budget hotel. In a more traditional vein, the Admiral Hotel is a superb conversion of an 18th-century warehouse, with half its rooms overlooking the harbor. Striking ultra-modern buildings include Copenhagen's Black Diamond conference center on the waterfront. A road trip to the former Denmark across the bridge . The southern tip of Sweden used to be Danish, and still looks it, so no wonder Copenhagen locals scoot across the bridge connecting the two countries on weekends to eat in the province of Skane, known for its organic farms, pottery and fine restaurants as well as its wild beauty. The lively town of Malmo, Sweden, can be reached by train in half an hour, but it's worth renting a car to explore both the area on the Danish side north of Copenhagen, where the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art is a main attraction, and the lovely coastal countryside of southern Sweden. Skane will be familiar to fans of the Kurt Wallander books and TV series, which are set there. One of Skane's newest attractions is the charming little rustic restaurant of Daniel Berlin, tipped to succeed Noma as the next king of Nordic cuisine. Three top tips . • Get an overview from a canal boat; tours leave every hour from Nyhavn and provide an excellent opportunity to see Copenhagen from the water. • Pay extreme care when getting out of a taxi; Copenhagen roads have two curbs, and only one of them is designed for pedestrians. The curb where taxis pull up separates vehicles from a busy cycle path -- not from the sidewalk. • Join Copenhagen's hordes of cyclists by getting on a free city bike. You'll require a 20 Danish kroner coin -- around $3 -- as refundable deposit, and must remember not to cycle after dark or in the city's parks.

"Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej is recovering from surgery to remove his gallbladder, the palace said Monday. The palace had earlier revealed that the 86-year-old king had been hospitalized at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital with a high fever and irregular blood pressure Friday evening. The palace statement said the operation went well, and the king was in a satisfactory condition post-surgery. ""This morning his general health conditions have improved. His heart rate has lowered, his blood pressure is normal and his body temperature has lowered,"" said the statement. The world's longest-reigning monarch, Bhumibol is a deeply revered figure in Thailand, where his portrait hangs in government offices and many homes. His appeal stretches across the spectrum of Thai society, unifying urban elites and rural farmers. Political crisis . His declining health in recent years has come as his country has been wracked by a drawn-out political crisis. Last month, Bhumibol was discharged after being hospitalized for more than a month for treatment of a stomach complaint.

"A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month. The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9. The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon. ""A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,"" the company said. The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000. Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed. The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual. The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said. In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four. The significance of the pause . Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death, and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports. Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car. Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. Read the police reports . Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said. Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car. Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting. But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds. Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots. ""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina. But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer. ""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' "" Complete coverage .","A man recorded sounds of gunfire during a video chat with a friend, company says .

"A controversial advertisement that critics say is hateful toward Muslims will appear in New York City subway stations starting next week, despite the city's attempts to halt the campaign. New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority initially rejected the ad, which reads: ""In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad."" The authority's decision was overturned last month when a federal judge ruled that the ad is protected speech under the First Amendment. Jihad -- Arabic for ""struggle"" -- is considered a religious duty for Muslims, although there are peaceful and violent interpretations of what it means. The American Freedom Defense Initiative, which produced the ad, has been fighting to place the message in New York's subway system since last year after the authority refused to display it. ""We don't think it's controversial,"" said Pamela Geller, the executive director of the American Freedom Defense Initiative. ""It's truth. The MTA has run anti-Israel ads before and no one had an issue about it.  'Any war on innocent civilians is savagery': What's controversial here?"" Starting next week, the ads will be displayed in 10 of the city's more than 400 subway stations.  The exact locations have not been selected by the transportation authority. Geller said she had no qualms about releasing the message amid ongoing protests against an American-made anti-Islam film clip that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya last week. ""If it's not a film, it's a cartoon, it's always some event,"" Geller said. ""I will not sacrifice my freedom."" She noted that other places such as San Francisco have had these ads appear on buses with disclaimers next to them. It's the latest controversy fueling the debate over free speech versus hate speech.  In addition to protests over the film clip, a French satirical magazine published cartoons on Wednesday featuring a figure resembling Islam's Prophet Mohammed, triggering security concerns. ""These hate ads are part of a larger problem,"" said Muneer Awad, executive director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. ""We're trying to make sure MTA has policies to discourage hate speech."" Awad wants to ensure that anyone seeing the ads next week are aware that the message is not sanctioned by the city of New York. ""It is a hate group paying for these advertisements; an avenue to promote hate speech,"" said Awad. ""Millions of people will see this, we want to make sure they realize that it is not (promoted by) the city of New York."" While his council cannot stop the ads, Awad hopes transit officials will put a disclaimer on the advertisements and redirect any funding of the ad to the Human Rights Commission. The MTA is considering amending its advertising policies as soon as next week to prohibit all noncommercial advertisements, spokesman Aaron Donovan said. It is unclear what effect that might have on the American Freedom Defense Initiative's advertisement.","Controversial ""Defeat Jihad"" ad to appear in several New York subway stations next week .

"The state's chief witness in the Trayvon Martin murder case lied under oath, prosecutors say. The young woman who says she was on the phone with Martin when he encountered George Zimmerman lied about her whereabouts at another time, the prosecution told a judge Tuesday. The woman, whose name has not been released, had told prosecutors that she was in the hospital on the day of Martin's funeral.  The defense then sought her medical records. Letters to Zimmerman show split opinions on Trayvon Martin shooting . In court on Tuesday, the state said the woman, known as Civilian Witness 8, was not in the hospital, so there are no such records to be turned over. Prosecutors did not immediately respond to a question Wednesday from CNN about the witness's credibility and how this may affect the case. Questions have long surrounded the woman.

"As a multi award-winning chef, bestselling author, TV channel proprietor and hugely successful syndicated show host, Sanjeev Kapoor is arguably the world's most revered exponent of Indian cuisine. For the past 18 years he has concocted a handful of new recipes every week as the host of ""Khana Khazana,"" said to be India's most watched, and Asia's longest-running, cookery program. As if that weren't impressive enough, Kapoor has penned 36 cookbooks, while his website consistently attracts a hungry audience of 25 million users a month. Suffice to say, the man has a distinguished rep in the venerable tradition of Indian cuisine. But the myriad blend of spices and stimulation of the senses that characterize his country's culinary heritage couldn't be more at odds with the restrained subtlety that dominates contemporary cooking in northern Europe. So it is perhaps testament to Kapoor's desire for a challenge that he chose Copenhagen, Denmark, as the location for his ""Fusion Journey."" See more Fusion Journeys . Here he would meet with, and learn from, Rene Redzepi, head chef and proprietor of Noma, the two Michelin-star restaurant ranked best in the world by Restaurant magazine, where fresh ingredients and simplicity reign supreme. His mission was to synthesize the two divergent culinary traditions, and ultimately combine them into a completely original dish of his own. In his own words, Kapoor looks back over his Fusion Journey. Sanjeev Kapoor: When you've been in the profession for as long as I have, it's imperative to keep making new discoveries, to go beyond your particular area of expertise. And the best way to do that is to travel. So I couldn't resist the chance to fly to Copenhagen. With its Scandinavian climate and classic European architecture, it's a world away from Mumbai -- and the style of our cuisines are just as contrasting. The challenge is that from an Indian perspective taste is paramount. Our savory dishes are more salty, our hot dishes are more hot, our sweet dishes are more sweet, our sour things are more sour. This is all because the use and blend of spices is very bold -- the objective is to embellish and we often have 15 to 20 contrasting herbs and spices in a single dish. But Rene and his Nordic cuisine is all about simplicity. It's all about passion and appreciation for the ingredients themselves. This philosophy was immediately apparent as soon as we journeyed out to the farms around Copenhagen, where Rene buys most of his food directly. This emphasis on sourcing fresh ingredients, having a relationship with the producers, knowing the history of the food, is something I admire and relate to -- but not something that I'm able to practice very often in my country. It's an irony that the act of going to back to nature, as it were, is something that is so easy to do in India, and yet we have been going in the opposite direction. Unlike a lot of the industrialized West, we're generally much closer to our environment, but we don't focus on it. Instead, it is all becoming very commercial in nature. The food deliveries arrive at your kitchen and you won't know where it's come from, how far its traveled, who the supplier is, what relationship they have with the grower and so on. This is a shame because you can't then guarantee the quality of the product and, on top of that, you lose the emotional connection to the food ... it becomes more like a commodity. See also: Ballet star takes inspiration from Chinese dance . Watching Rene work at Noma was a fascinating experience. He has so much reverence for the food and tries to keep the natural essence of his ingredients intact. So for instance, a simple carrot might be slow-roasted for hours, allowing it to soak in its own juices -- really bringing out its essential flavor. In India, we're quick and explosive in the kitchen -- we'd rarely cook a vegetable for longer than 15 minutes -- and the culture is about pleasing every taste sense on just one spoon, adding layers of flavor so that they all blend together. But then, of course, the individual ingredients are somewhat hidden. So, how to bring these two very different styles together in one dish? I took the best of both. While Rene and I had been foraging, I'd come across some wonderfully fresh and fragrant mustard leaves. It's not too sharp yet it's pungent and very mustardy ... something that I have grown up with as it's very popular in traditional North Indian cooking. I decided to blend this beautiful Norwegian salmon -- coating it with the mustard leaves and some lime, a little seasoning and let it cook gently. The result was a dish that had a distinctive Indian aroma, but with more of a Nordic approach to the style and philosophy of preparation. The respect for the ingredient -- focusing on Mother Nature, one leaf to the next -- has enabled me to return home with a new appreciation for what Indian cuisine still has to offer.","Celebrity Indian chef Sanjeev Kapoor travels to Copenhagen to create fusion of culinary styles .

"(CNN)At his first fundraiser for his new leadership political action committee, Jeb Bush told donors and former George W. Bush administration officials that he's seriously considering a run for president but has yet to make a final decision. According to two sources who attended the private event in Greenwich, Connecticut, Bush emphasized that he's aiming to spread his message to nontraditional GOP voters and ticked through his positions on immigration, education and foreign policy. Both sources asked not to be named to speak more freely about the event. Noting he had recently stepped down from his board memberships, Bush humorously said he was ""unemployed"" for the first time in his adult life, drawing laughs from the audience. The attendees, both Bush supporters, described the former governor as relaxed, comfortable and personable. Iowa chairman sets Valentine's date for Jeb Bush . He didn't mention Hillary Clinton by name, but Bush alluded to the former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential frontrunner while offering criticism of the Obama administration's foreign policy. Hearst Connecticut Media Group first reported the criticism about Clinton, as well as other details from the fundraiser. ""He made reference to the fact that one of the candidates who looks like they're going to run has a four-year track record of being part of that failed foreign policy,"" one source told CNN. Jeb Bush launches leadership PAC . More broadly, Bush said that President Barack Obama has weakened the United States on the international stage due to inconsistent policies and a lack of willingness to back up promises with action, the attendees said. ""He was very critical of the point of view that disengagement could make America safer,"" one source said, adding that Bush spoke of ""the importance of American leadership."" He argued that the threat of terrorism is not just a concern at home but abroad, citing Wednesday's shootings in Paris as an example. Jeb Bush calls for 'respect' in gay marriage debate . During a question-and-answer session, Bush was asked about concerns that he'd be compared to his father and brother. Both sources confirmed Bush said he should be judged based on his own record as governor and that he's his own person. The website for his leadership PAC, Right to Rise, says that Bush won't ""cede an inch of territory"" on any demographic group or voters, suggesting that he's seeking to bring his message to a diverse set of people. Both sources said that at the fundraiser Bush focused on how he's not only multilingual but also multi-cultural. He mentioned his wife, Columba, who's from Mexico, and how one of his daughters-in-law is of Iraqi descent, referring to Sandra Algudady, a native Canadian of Iraqi descent who married his son, Jeb Bush, Jr. Jeb Bush's long campaign begins? On immigration, Bush argued that diversity is a strength and that immigrants have had a vital role in building the country through businesses and hard work. ""He said their overall enthusiasm is great and we need to work on celebrating people who come to America rather than having it be a discussion focused around negative elements,"" a source said. ""He talked about it quite a bit, not at all reluctantly."" He touted his record as governor -- especially on jobs and education -- and his business experience, saying he's someone who's not only cashed paychecks, but issued paychecks. Both commented on the ""excited"" and ""warm"" reception that Bush received at the crowded event.

"(CNN)It was one of a thousand little conversations that fill each day in a third-grade classroom. As teacher Kimmie Fink read a book featuring a Japanese character, a student brought her fingers to her eyes and tugged on the edges, stretching them into narrow slits. Fink stopped. ""I'm Asian,"" she told the child, ""and when you do that, it hurts my feelings."" The student snapped to attention. ""Oh! I'm sorry!"" she told her teacher, and they went back to their book. It was a quick back-and-forth with a big lesson, but it came from a trained teacher who had rehearsed what to say. Just as Fink learned to teach math and reading, she has practiced how to squelch unwitting bias and stereotyping before it has a chance to grow into bullying or racism. Little insults and acts of disrespect once shrugged off or ignored -- just kids being kids -- are now treated in some schools as important chances to learn. Lessons have long been built around Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Holocaust remembrance week, Women's History Month and countless others holidays and awareness weeks. But at schools around the country, learning about bias related to race, gender and sexuality is part of everyday teaching. Fink, who teaches at Pope Elementary in Puyallup, Washington, began anti-bias training with the Human Rights Campaign's Welcoming Schools program two years ago and immediately began to share those lessons with her colleagues. The program is active in 25 states and offers training and lesson plans around family diversity, gender stereotyping and ending bullying. Fink didn't need help spotting right and wrong around racial diversity and gender bias, but training helped her find the words and tone to explain it to young children, especially when it came to matters of sexuality. Young students sometimes don't realize what they're saying or how painful a comment on the playground can be. ""She had no idea that kind of thing was hurtful -- they don't want to hurt anyone's feelings,"" Fink said of the third-grader who tugged at her eyes. ""A lot (of teachers) are scared to say anything because they're scared they're going to say the wrong thing."" It's not easy for parents, either. So how can adults manage conversations about complicated issues with the youngest of kids? Here's some guidance from educators doing it ever day: . Holidays, awareness weeks and celebratory months are a great way to start a conversation with young people. Last week, the media literacy program Hatch released a video of an 11-year-old analyzing King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech. In powerful, unscripted responses, they explained how words spoken decades ago affected them and identified work that still needs to be done. But educators caution that cultural days or awareness weeks might touch only on clothing, holidays or food -- and serve up only information that suggests how people are different. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, schools might examine only Jim Crow history but ignore modern civil rights issues or King's messages about poverty and peace, said Johanna Eager, the director of Welcoming Schools. ""It can be approached in ways that students don't feel that it's relevant. It's something their parents took care of,"" Eager said. ""It's really important to extend Dr. King's message ... taking an intersectional approach, talking about gender stereotypes, class disparities."" Some of the most powerful learning comes from answering kids' questions about what's going on in the world or what they see in the hallways of their school. And sometimes, the best way to explain an issue to kids is to find a story that's designed for them, educators said. When her students are facing a conflict, Fink, the Washington teacher, is likely to call upon a long list of children's books to help them work through it. Just as students remember a one-on-one conversation with teachers, they see themselves in stories and characters and look to the lessons in books to model their own responses. ""If I'm having trouble with name-calling in my classroom, I'm going to pull a read-aloud,"" Fink said. ""It just works."" It's tempting to believe young children are innocent and unaware of the world around them, but they are listening and repeating what they hear on TV or from older kids and adults around them. Fink has caught even young children saying something is ""so gay."" Sometimes they don't know what it means, but they've heard it used elsewhere. Often, Fink said, they understand that ""gay"" means something like ""a man and a man love each other."" They even know they're using the word ""gay"" to say something is bad. They just don't make the connection that their comment is disrespectful to people who are gay, Fink said. ""'We don't use somebody's identity as an insult,'"" she tells students. Eager said they heard a lot of questions from educators after the shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and during protests that followed. Teachers knew their students were talking about it, but few knew how to explain it to young people. ""Students are having these conversations without us, and we know it's really important for adults to be part of the conversation and model effective, respectful ways to have them,"" Eager said. Welcoming Schools and other anti-bullying programs are ultimately meant to teach children and improve school climates, but the training demands adults examine their own biases and how they talk to children at school and home. It can be uncomfortable for adults to consider and challenge their own beliefs. ""It's a predictable part of this process [that] there's some resistance,"" Eager said. ""There's going to be someone who is not happy."" The Welcoming Schools curriculum is transparent, she said -- it includes family nights and offers guidance to administrators and teachers on how to deal with those who might disagree with how they handle lessons about sexuality, gender and other topics. But even among educators committed to creating a healthy school climate, it can be tough. Fink recalls exercises such as asking teachers to write which identities apply to them -- race, ethnicity, gender, for example -- then asking them to examine which ones opened doors for them and which ones made life harder. Conversations can be intense and revealing. There are reminders, too, that adults can learn from children, too. After all, young students don't like to hurt each other's feelings, Fink said. ""We need to take advantage of that default to compassion,"" she said, ""and harness it.""","Teachers and parents don't always know how to talk to young children about bias and bullying .
Educators say it can't just be a conversation around Martin Luther King Jr. Day or other awareness holidays ."
"Lebanese singer and actress Sabah, one of the Arab world's most prolific entertainers with a career spanning more than six decades, died Wednesday in Beirut, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. She was 87. Born Jeanette Feghali in Lebanon in 1927, Sabah recorded some 3,000 songs and acted in more than 80 Arab films, according to Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper.

"Doctors are looking for more information about a ""polio-like syndrome"" that has caused paralysis in a few children in California. Neurologists have identified five patients who developed paralysis in one or more of their limbs between August 2012 and July 2013. All five children had been vaccinated against the poliovirus. Treatment did not seem to help the children regain their motor function. Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare virus that has been linked to severe respiratory illness in the past. Samples from the other three children were not collected or tested soon enough to yield conclusive results, said Dr. Emmanuelle Waubant, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Waubant and her colleagues will present a case report about these patients' illnesses at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in late April. They are asking health care providers to be on the lookout for similar cases and send in samples from any patient exhibiting these symptoms. Dr. Carol Glaser, chief of the Encephalitis and Special Investigation Section at the California Department of Public Health, said the state is aware of the paralysis cases but believes the risk to families is very low. ""We are evaluating cases as they are reported to us,"" Glaser said in an e-mail to CNN. ""We have not found anything at this point that raises any public health concerns."" The poliovirus has been eradicated in the United States for more than 30 years. Only three countries in the world are not yet free of the disease: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . Poliovirus is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (better known as the common cold). There are more than 100 types of enterovirus that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the United States each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms, said Dr. Steven Oberste, chief of the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch at the CDC. Common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, skin rash and body aches. Enterovirus is often the cause of ""summer colds,"" whose cases spike in July, August and September. Children and teens are more likely to fall ill because they have not yet built up immunity to these common viruses. However, some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients. Enterovirus 68 was first identified in a California lab in 1962, after four children came down with a severe respiratory illness. Between 1970 and 2005, only 26 cases of enterovirus 68 in the United States were reported to the CDC. Since 2000, the government agency has kept a closer watch and has seen 47 cases, Oberste said. Outbreaks have occurred over the years in Asia and Europe, but it's still one of the rarest types of enterovirus. More common -- and more concerning to health officials -- is enterovirus 71, which was discovered by the same California lab in 1969, Oberste said. Enterovirus 71 is usually associated with severe neurological issues, including aseptic meningitis, polio-like paralysis and encephalitis. Waubant is not sure if the samples from this latest group of patients were tested for enterovirus 71. According to a CDC report, several outbreaks of paralysis caused by enterovirus 71 were seen in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, fatal encephalitis was a big problem in Malaysia and Taiwan. ""Ever since then, the virus has circulated in high levels in Southeast Asia,"" Oberste said. In recent years, the outbreaks have spread to Australia; a cluster of cases near Sydney drew media attention in 2013. Between 1983 and 2005, 270 cases of enterovirus 71 were reported in the United States. But none has resulted in a larger outbreak, despite the virus's infectious nature. ""That's the really odd thing,"" Oberste said. ""We see cases from time to time in the United States. Occasionally they'll be severe. Basically it's identical to what's circulating in Asia ... but it doesn't cause the same big outbreak in disease. And we really don't know why."" The CDC is aware of the small cluster of cases in California but is not actively involved in an investigation, a spokesman told CNN. Waubant and her colleagues don't want to alarm anyone with their case report presentation; they're simply seeking help in finding the cause of these seemingly connected cases. ""We would like to stress that this syndrome appears to be very, very rare,"" one of Waubant's colleagues, Dr. Keith Van Haren, said in a prepared statement. Parents need to know that vaccination is key to preventing polio from returning to the United States, Glaser said. While there is no vaccine to protect you from a non-polio enterovirus, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others who are sick can help.","Five children in California have a ""polio-like syndrome,"" according to neurologists .
Two of the children tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare type of enterovirus .
Another type, enterovirus 71, is more commonly linked to paralysis .

The new release should further anger Americans who were already deeply dismayed by the disclosure of an October 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion, which found that the NSA had violated the Constitution and federal law with its surveillance program. But we shouldn't just be upset because the court opinion revealed that the NSA has illegally and unconstitutionally collected the emails and other communications of tens of thousands of innocent Americans. We shouldn't just be upset because the NSA couldn't convince a secret court that its surveillance was legal. And we shouldn't just be upset because the opinion showed that the government, in the words of the FISA court, ""frequently and systemically"" disregarded the court's orders. What should infuriate every American — whether you're a Republican or Democrat, rich or poor, or even whether you are for or against the NSA's surveillance program — is the fact that the government hid the FISA court's opinion from the public for years. Hiding a significant opinion of a federal court, regardless of the topic of the opinion, is inimical to our democracy. In the ongoing debate on NSA surveillance, there are two separate, but equally important, questions at stake. The first part of the debate focuses on the legality of the surveillance: is the NSA's surveillance being conducted in accordance with federal laws and the Constitution? The second focuses on the democratic legitimacy of the surveillance: have citizens, through their elected officials and through an informed and fair process, approved the laws the government relies on and the actions of the NSA? Even setting aside one's views on the first question, the story behind the FISA court opinion provides insight on the second question. The answer, quite simply, is ""no."" The government has intentionally kept the public in the dark for years. For the past year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where I work, has been fighting the government in federal court for the public release of the FISA court's opinion. We sued the Department of Justice in August 2012 after the government refused to disclose it. Initially, we sought the opinion to contribute to a full, informed public debate on the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act, the expansive federal law the NSA relies on to conduct its domestic surveillance operations. The law was scheduled to expire at the end of 2012, and, in the summer and fall of 2012, Congress was debating whether the law should be renewed and if reforms should be introduced. But, during that debate, the government repeatedly delayed publicly disclosing anything about the opinion or the government's surveillance. Months went by, the debate on the FISA Amendments Act came and went, and, on December 30, 2012, the law was reauthorized for another four years. On January 4, 2013, four days after the reauthorization was signed into law, the government finally produced records in response to our lawsuit. Here's an example of what they gave us. In short, nothing. Now, eight months later — and only after EFF won the first known motion by a private party in the secret FISA court; only after the most significant leak of surveillance information in American history; and only after a federal court ordered the government to finalize its declassification decisions and release the opinion — the government finally relented. When current and former administration officials like Gen. Michael Hayden take to the airwaves or editorial pages to rebut the ""[b]reathless claims"" about NSA spying with condescending offers to help ""citizens understand a few basics of what exactly is being done,"" know this -- advocates and organizations like the EFF have been fighting for a ""few basics"" about NSA surveillance practices for years. But government officials, like Hayden, have refused at every step in the process to provide those facts.  And, as is now apparent, it's not just the public that was denied information, members of Congress and the judiciary have been misled or kept in the dark about many aspects of the NSA's surveillance as well. Now is the time to change this. The executive branch, intelligence agencies and the NSA in particular have lost the right to stonewall the public about their activities. They have lost the right to treat us condescendingly. And it's far too late in the day to selectively provide a ""few basics"" about the government's surveillance. We need all the facts, and we need them now. In the 1970s, after the Watergate scandal and multiple reports that federal agencies had spied on Americans, Congress created a special investigatory commission, the Church Committee, to investigate. Through public hearings and investigations, the Committee ultimately produced a series of reports providing the most thorough investigation of American intelligence agencies in our nation's history. Many of the Committee's recommendations were adopted and resulted in a host of beneficial reforms to federal law. It's now apparent that we need a second Church Committee to fully and independently investigate the full scope of the NSA's surveillance practices and to recommend meaningful reforms. EFF, along with 100 other organizations and more than 500,000 individuals, have joined together to call on Congress to initiate a full, and public, investigation of the government's intelligence practices. And I hope Hayden will join us, too. His recent op-ed remarked that the debate on NSA surveillance would be enhanced if ""discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing."" I couldn't agree more. We have been lied to, misled and kept in the dark for too long: it's time we the people command the full story on NSA surveillance.","A secret court opinion found that the NSA had violated Americans' rights .
Mark Rumold: It's outrageous that government hid the opinion from the public .

"More Russian aggression in Ukraine. More U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Moscow. What seems like diplomatic tail-chasing so many months into the Ukraine conflict invites questions about how Western powers can defuse the worsening conflict in Eastern Europe. U.S. President Barack Obama and the European Union raised the stakes on Tuesday, announcing long-threatened sanctions that target Russia's state-owned banks, weapons makers and oil companies, along with top cronies of President Vladimir Putin. They want Putin to stop arming pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukraine government and instead support a political process that entrenches President Petro Poroshenko's elected leadership. A deeper concern is that Putin may be planning to grab more territory from the former Soviet satellite following Russia's annexation of Crimea earlier this year. Russia denies such ambitions and criticizes sanctions as unproductive, with the Foreign Ministry saying Wednesday that the new penalties will harm relations with the United States and ""create a poor environment in international affairs where the cooperation between our countries often plays a key role."" Here is a look at the latest sanctions and what might come next. How did we get here? The Ukraine crisis developed from huge protests in Kiev late last year that led to the February ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In the ensuing political chaos, the pro-West Poroshenko got elected while Russia grabbed control of Crimea, an ethnic-Russian territory home to its Black Sea fleet. U.S., EU hit Russia with more sanctions as Ukraine fighting continues . Obama and U.S. allies protested by suspending Putin from the G8 summit and imposing a series of limited sanctions, warning of tougher measures targeting specific economic sectors if Russia's aggression continued. It did, with the separatists armed and trained by Moscow rebelling in eastern Ukraine. In response, Obama announced expanded U.S. sanctions on July 16 that targeted two Russian state-owned banks, two energy companies, eight weapons makers, along with some Putin associates and separatist leaders. Europe's major economic ties with Russia -- about $500 billion in trade and investment per year -- caused the European Union to balk at joining Washington then. The next day, a missile fired from separatist-held territory downed a Malaysia Airlines jet in the conflict  zone, killing all 298 people aboard. Now the separatists are hindering access to the crash site amid fighting in the area, and Russia is sending heavy weaponry to them while deploying troops along the Ukraine border. MH17 crash: Investigators must have full access, Malaysian PM says . What the European Union did . Almost two weeks after Obama initially expanded the U.S. sanctions, European leaders agreed Tuesday to coordinate similar steps. In a major expansion signaling new resolve, they went after eight of Putin's top associates, along with Russia's finance, energy and weapons industries. The new EU sanctions will restrict Russian state-owned banks from accessing European capital markets, and stop or slow the export of oil-related equipment and technology to Russia. They also will stop new contracts for arms imports and exports between the European Union and Russia, and prohibit the export of goods and technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes. ""It is meant as a strong warning: Illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe,"" the EU said in a statement. To punish Russia, Europe must be prepared to suffer . What Obama announced . Two hours later, Obama told reporters that the United States expanded its July 16 sanctions to include three more state-owned banks and another weapons company, while also targeting technology for deep-water, Arctic and shale oil production. While expanding on the earlier moves, the latest sanctions include limits. They don't affect Russia's current oil production, instead targeting the ability to develop new areas, senior administration officials told reporters on a background call. The European sanctions on weapons trade only involves future transactions, allowing France to complete an existing helicopter deal with Moscow. However, Obama cited the joint action as significant, saying that ""because we are closely coordinating our actions with Europe, the sanctions we are announcing today will have an even bigger bite."" ""If Russia continues on its current path, the cost on Russia will continue to grow,"" he added, calling the moves ""a reminder that the United States means what it says, and we will rally the international community in standing up for the rights and freedom of people around the world."" What is the impact? The senior administration officials said the expanded sanctions prevent Russia's state-owned banks, which have all or most of their debt in U.S. dollars, from getting more medium- and long-term financing in America. They noted the sanctions already have contributed to a downturn in the Russian economy, a flight of foreign capital and weakening of the ruble currency. ""Russia is not a very good bet right now for international investors,"" one of the officials said. On Tuesday, shares in British oil giant BP fell by 2.5% after the company warned that it would suffer from the tougher EU sanctions. BP owns a significant stake in Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil company, which no longer can access long-term financing from U.S. sources. Meanwhile, shares in French automotive manufacturer Renault slumped by 4.5% as the company warned about a sharp slowdown in emerging markets, including Russia. Russia is Renault's third largest market, based on sales. Geopolitically, Obama denied that a new Cold War with Russia had started, but the head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia's State Duma -- the lower house of parliament -- disagreed. Aleksey Pushkov tweeted Wednesday that Obama will make history as ""the statesman who started a new Cold War."" To Gideon Rose, the editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, the expanded sanctions mean that ""the temperature in the room has just dropped a few degrees."" ""The fact that the Europeans have now finally recognized what they need to do and that the administration has been able to bring them on board"" was a ""positive development,"" Rose told CNN. Map: Europe's thirst for Russian gas . Will it matter to Putin? To the U.S. officials, the sanctions announced Tuesday are ""the most significant tool we have to shape Russian decision-making."" Analysts questioned whether economic hardship would change Putin's thinking. Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now with the Brookings Institution, told a congressional committee last month that Putin could use sanctions ""as a scapegoat and attempt to put all the blame on the West for Russia's poor economic performance."" To fellow Brookings analysts Clifford Gaddy and Barry Ickes, Russia's economy can absorb the shocks of sanctions without deteriorating to the point of forcing Putin to change his overall goals and policies. ""For that, sanctions would have to reduce Russia to its condition of the 1990s, when it was simply too weak and dependent on the West to oppose the international order created by the West after the Cold War,"" they wrote in an article on the Brookings website. ""It is clear to us that no feasible actions by the West today can recreate the weak and compliant Russia of the 1990s."" One reason: such a move would seriously harm the global economy, too, a step Washington and the European Union won't take, the pair said. Opinion: Putin, just evil enough . Where do things stand? Obama and EU leaders made clear that Putin could avoid the increasing international isolation Russia faces by working with Poroshenko's government in Ukraine, instead of helping the separatists fight against it. The senior administration officials listed four conditions for getting sanctions eased: recognize Poroshenko's government as legitimately elected; stop arming the separatists; stop massing Russian forces at the border; and influence the separatists to enter an inclusive political process in Ukraine. ""It didn't have to come to this. It does not have to be this way,"" Obama said. ""This is a choice that Russia and President Putin in particular has made."" The European statement specifically cited the annexation of Crimea as another grievance, while the U.S. officials did not mention it. However, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned Tuesday against any further expansionist ideas by Putin, such as invading eastern Ukraine. ""That would be taken, needless to say, as not just a violation of all notions of international law, but an exceedingly dangerous action which would wind up with, you know, the most severe possible kinds of isolation and sanctions possible,"" Kerry told reporters. ""And Germany, France, other countries in Europe, would clearly join into that in ways that would have a profound, profound impact on the Russian economy."" Sanctions: Top 10 Russian targets . What if the sanctions don't work? Obama and European leaders have repeatedly said the Ukraine crisis requires a diplomatic solution, which rules out military intervention -- at least for now. Beyond sanctions, another idea floated by some European officials would be to move the 2018 soccer World Cup planned for Russia to somewhere else. Such a move, considered premature at this point by major soccer nations and organizations, would deliver a bitter blow to Putin following Russia's successful hosting of the Sochi Olympics earlier this year.

"Lebanon prides itself on its image as a melting pot on the Mediterranean: an ancient bastion of civilization boasting a diverse tapestry of cultures and creeds. But scratch the surface, and it becomes apparent that not everyone fits into the country's cosmopolitan self-image. Many migrants and mixed-race Lebanese, particularly those of Asian and African origin, say they encounter racism on a regular basis. Nepalese woman Priya Subeydi told CNN she plans to leave the country soon, as she does not want her nine-month-old son growing up feeling like a second-class citizen. ""Every day we face racism,"" she said. ""I just want to let him to grow in my own country."" Subeydi came to Lebanon as one of the more than 200,000 migrant domestic workers in the country, lured from mostly African and Asian countries by the promise of higher wages and steady employment in upper-middle class homes where household chores are viewed as beneath the family. Today, Subeydi works in a migrant center in Beirut, providing assistance and support for domestic workers, some of whom, vulnerable in their new homes, face a grim reality of confinement, abuse, withheld payments and discriminatory treatment. Lebanon's treatment of migrant domestic workers has been thrust into the international spotlight in recent years. In 2009 the country witnessed a spate of suicides among foreign maids, and last year a 33-year-old Ethiopian woman killed herself shortly after being filmed being beaten by a Lebanese man on a Beirut street. The U.N. special rapporteur on slavery urged the Lebanese government to carry out a full investigation into the death. Ethiopia had banned citizens from traveling to Lebanon as domestic workers because of concerns over their lack of legal protection, although the ban was widely circumvented. Read more: Can Iraq's geeks save the country? But it's not only domestic workers who face racist treatment. Renee Abisaad is the daughter of a Lebanese mother and Nigerian father, who moved to the country when she was 11. The engineering student -- a subject of a photo exhibition of mixed-race Lebanese intended to challenge social attitudes about race -- said that dealing with ethnic slurs had become the norm, and she planned to leave the country once she finished her studies. She said she felt she was not accepted and looked down on because of her ethnicity. ""I never felt Lebanese to be honest,"" she told CNN. ""They assume that you are a prostitute, you are a maid, you are someone low class."" The unequal treatment meted out to people of other ethnic backgrounds has prompted a group of activists in Lebanon, in collaboration with migrant community leaders, to form the Anti Racism Movement (ARM), committed to documenting, exposing and challenging racist behaviour and attitudes in the country. In a recent campaign, the group conducted undercover stings at the country's beach resorts, where it found an Ethiopian women was turned away from going swimming and falsely told a ""members only"" policy was in place. Read more: Palestinian women change motor racing up a gear . The club's actions contravened a decree issued by the Ministry of Tourism last summer barring resorts from discriminating on the basis of race, nationality or disability. Lebanon's Minister of Tourism, Fadi Abboud, said the stance on racism made sense for both moral and practical reasons. ""If people think that we are a racial country, I think we can kiss tourism goodbye, so for me this is very serious, and it can only happen once,"" he said. ""We let them know if it happens (another) time, we close them for one week -- if it happens again, we close them for good."" ARM's general coordinator, Farah Salka, said such measures against blatant discrimination were welcome and necessary. But truly tackling racism would require a more profound shift -- for individuals to re-examine and dismiss deeply ingrained personal prejudices. ""It's a problem that is grounded in each in the way that we have been brought up, the way that we are not taught anything about accepting differences,"" she said. ""You can go to school for 15 years, go to college, become a doctor, but you're never ever taught the basics of how to be with other human beings in this country.""","Lebanese activists have started a movement to change racist attitudes in the country .
Migrant workers and Lebanese of different backgrounds are treated poorly, they say .
The group has carried out stings at beach resorts exposing racist attitudes by owners .
They say the deeply entrenched problem can only be overcome by changing individual mindsets ."
"(CNN)  -- FIFA says it won't be punishing the North Korean football federation over allegations that its players and coaches were publicly humiliated following their World Cup exit. In a statement on its official website, the world governing body, described the allegations as ""baseless"" and said it had closed its investigation. Pressure grew on FIFA to act after widespread reports that harm had come to head coach Kim Jong Hun and his squad after they suffered three defeats at the finals in South Africa in June. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced an inquiry on August 11. FIFA sought assurances in a series of questions to the North Korean FA, centering on the reports and also allegations that the election of their president had been influenced by results at the finals. In a letter, the Korean federation claimed that Kim Jong Hun and his team are ""training as usual"" and would be taking part in the 16th Asian Games. It also responded that the election of its president had been held in ""accordance with the statutes of the association"" and came after a good performance against Brazil in their opening match in South Africa. FIFA said it had ""checked all of its sources,"" before calling a halt to the investigation. North Korea's first appearance at the World Cup finals since 1966 began with some promise after they went down to a narrow 2-1 defeat to the Brazilians, who scored a late winner. But they were subsequently thrashed 7-0 by Portugal in their second match and rounded off their campaign with a 3-1 defeat to the Ivory Coast in their final group match.","FIFA to take no action against North Korea over reports it coach and players were harmed .

"There wasn't room for the two of them. In the fall of 2012, with the presidential race in full swing, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, two prominent Republican governors with well-known national ambitions, were engaged in a different kind of campaign. Behind the scenes, both men were aggressively jockeying for a plum political gig: The chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association, a coveted post for any aspiring presidential candidate. The high-profile job would allow one of them to travel the country, gain a foothold in key states, and mingle with some of the GOP's leading financial backers -- all while controlling a nearly $150 million midterm political budget. Previous RGA chairmen have used the post as a national launch pad: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney led the RGA in 2006 before his first presidential campaign, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry steered the committee in 2011 before embarking on his own White House bid. Christie won't commit to serving full term in New Jersey . Ultimately, both Jindal and Christie would each have a shot at running the RGA, Jindal in 2013 and Christie in 2014. Christie, fresh off his re-election in New Jersey, formally took over the reins of the organization on Thursday afternoon at its annual meeting in Arizona. Jindal is transitioning to the role of vice-chairman. But before that line of succession was arranged, the tightly knit universe of GOP governors who comprise the RGA had to wrestle with an uncomfortable dilemma: Jindal and Christie were both gunning for the committee's top job in the same year -- 2014. And with good reason. Next year's midterm elections feature 36 gubernatorial contests, including three potentially competitive races in the early presidential caucus and primary states of Iowa, South Carolina and Florida. The RGA chairman will be a familiar face on television screens across the country and a constant point of contact for major donors. A successful 2014 cycle would be a gleaming resume point heading into the 2016 presidential cycle, which begins in earnest the moment polls close next November. GOP civil war could be brutal in 2014 . The question of who would run the show in 2014, Jindal or Christie, was complicated by the organization's lack of formal succession rules and Perry's unexpected resignation in late 2011 to run for president. When Perry stepped aside, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was suddenly thrust into the RGA's top job. Christie was elected vice-chairman, putting him in line to take over the RGA in 2013. Jindal, a veteran member of the RGA's executive committee, was hoping to follow him in 2014. But that scenario did not sit well with Christie and his team of advisers for one glaring reason: He was up for re-election in 2013, making it next to impossible to run the party committee while also campaigning for his own job in New Jersey. The Garden State's strict laws governing coordination between party committees made the prospect even more forbidding. Where does Christie go next? So with a flurry of phone calls and e-mails to his fellow governors, Christie charged ahead and launched a behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up the planned order of succession and take over the RGA in 2014, multiple Republican sources told CNN. Jindal started whipping up his own votes. Most of the Republicans familiar with their efforts insisted that the brief but intense campaign for the 2014 job, which unfolded in September and October of last year, was collegial and far from rancorous. ""The leadership teams for 2013-2014 were decided last year,"" said Phil Cox, the RGA's executive director. ""Continuity is a hallmark of RGA and Governor Christie -- one of our party's strongest national leaders -- will continue the strong stewardship of Governor Jindal and prior chairmen."" One senior Republican told CNN that the bout of campaigning was nothing more than ""friendly competition"" between the two governors. Said another Republican, with a nod to the ambitions of both men: ""There was a little back and forth. You know the personalities involved."" Will Christie's moment last? One GOP operative familiar with the jockeying, however, said Jindal and his team were ""a little frustrated"" by Christie's attempt to pry away a job that the Louisiana governor thought was rightfully his. ""It just kind of took people by surprise,"" said the operative, who, like most of the people who spoke about the maneuvering, declined to go on the record discussing internal committee business. ""It came out of left field. It's not how the organization was structured, really. The RGA had become a very congenial organization without a lot of internal politics. You don't really shift things that are going well. Bobby had paid his dues. Was it a good move by Christie? Absolutely. It just rubbed some people the wrong way."" The campaigning grew intense enough that McDonnell fired off an a internal note to his fellow governors urging them to keep their eyes on a more pressing challenge -- the presidential election, then little more than a few weeks away. Christie to GOP: 'If being me isn't good enough, then fine, I will go home' It soon became clear, though, that ""Christie had the votes,"" one person familiar with the whip effort told CNN, citing Christie's argument that it would be best for him to run the committee after securing re-election in New Jersey. ""It just made sense,"" one neutral GOP source said. Other Christie backers on the committee pointed to his ever-growing star power, arguing that his media profile and impressive fundraising acumen would be serious boons for the committee in a busy election year. As the dust began to settle in early October, McDonnell managed to broker a deal in which Jindal would run the committee in 2013, with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as his vice-chairman. Christie would take over the following year, with Jindal as vice-chair. ""The process worked itself out in a quick way and collegial way,"" said one Republican with knowledge of the process. ""It was a win-win, though it was probably a little more of a win for Christie."" If there was any tension between Jindal and Christie, it wasn't apparent at a news conference Wednesday in which Jindal patted his successor on the back. ""Next year is a very important year for the RGA,"" Jindal told reporters in Arizona. ""I think Chris is going to a great job. He's going to do a great job raising money for the RGA. I think he is going to a great job campaigning across the country for our incumbents and our challengers as well.""","High-profile job allows Christie to gain foothold in key states, mingle with GOP's big financial backers .

"The University of Massachusetts Amherst and its alumnus Bill Cosby have split ways amid allegations of sexual assault and rape. At least 15 women have spoken out to various media outlets accusing the comedian of sexual misconduct. ""Bill Cosby has agreed to resign as an honorary co-chair of UMass Amherst's capital campaign. He no longer has any affiliation with the campaign nor does he serve in any other capacity for the university,"" said Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the school. Cosby got his master's and doctorate in education from the university in the 1970s. Many of the women accusing Cosby say he drugged them before he raped them. Some of the alleged attacks took place decades ago. The 77-year-old comedian has denied some of the allegations and refused to discuss others. He has never been prosecuted. The accusations have taken their toll on Cosby's reputation as the beloved Dr. Huxtable -- the sweet, sweater-wearing father on the sitcom, ""The Cosby Show."" They've also hit his earnings, as Netflix postponed a stand-up comedy special and NBC also decided against moving forward with a Cosby project. A lawyer for Cosby has called the increasing number of claims of sexual assault against the comedian ""ridiculous"" and said the media should stop airing ""unsubstantiated, fantastical stories."" Martin D. Singer said in a written statement sent to CNN that it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" One of Cosby's accusers, Andrea Constand, did file a civil suit. In January 2004, Constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at Temple University -- Cosby's alma mater -- was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the following year. She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario, Canada, in January 2005. Though Cosby's attorney initially called Constand's claim ""utterly preposterous"" and no charges were filed, Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand that alleged 13 Jane Does had similar stories of sexual abuse. When Cosby attorney John Schmitt sent out a blanket denial of several allegations that have cropped up recently, he later amended his denial to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences ""to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago.""

"Lots of stern-faced Western politicians and so-called experts have been asking: what is Russian President Vladimir Putin's endgame in Ukraine? The presence of Russian troops in Crimea has sent alarm bells ringing in Western capitals, with some people predicting that it is basically a prelude to a full-blown invasion of predominantly Russian speaking eastern parts of the country, with Russian tanks rolling in. Calls were also made for the ""world community,"" whatever that means these days, to punish Russia economically and diplomatically, although no one is talking about any military response. Very hard to see though how Western countries can exert serious economic pressure on Russia, considering the state of their economies and possible huge losses they will incur. Symbolically, yes, they can, say, cancel some business conferences and maybe even refuse to sign a deal or two. But that would be all. We have already found out the British government is not considering any military options or trade sanctions after a cunning cameramen picked up an official carrying a policy document near 10 Downing Street, zooming in on the relevant paragraph. Although, as a former Kremlin adviser, I can tell you that such things don't happen by accident and usually have all to do with sending out a signal to those who are watching carefully. Other countries have also signaled their lack of any desire to resort to sanctions. Opinion: Putin's Ukrainian endgame . U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have been warning Russia about costs and punishments, if it does not withdraw its troops back to the Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol. The White House has been saying that economic sanctions against Russia are in the making and that all military programs between the two countries are on hold. Other suggested punishments being looked at include boycotting the G8 summits in Sochi in June and even banning Russia altogether from this gathering, which, incidentally, has been losing its relevance in the past decade or so. I mean, who is going to treat seriously the supposed group of the biggest industrial nations if it doesn't include China and India but has Canada and Italy in it, no offence to these two great nations. The thing about the crisis in Ukraine is that the West has greatly misjudged the way Russia would respond to the possibility of its neighbor sliding into chaos and anarchy, with the so-called interim unity government in Kiev failing to establish its authority in the east and south of the country. Not to mention that the children of the Orange revolution of 2004, which, by the way, eventually ended in tears for most of them, have swallowed more than they can chew when they toppled President Viktor Yanukovich, and then made a crucial mistake of making all the wrong noises from day one, demonstrating open hostility to Russia and to the ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. And when the dust began to settle in Kiev and news emerged that out of the 98 people who died, at least 16 were police officers, the image of a glorious people's revolution somehow lost its initial appeal. And with the failed attempts by some extremists to spread the influence of the interim government to the east and south, using intimidation and violence, it became clear that a prospect of a civil war looked very real indeed. Opinion: How Putin carries out power grab . So here's the deal then: as Ukraine was slipping into anarchy and chaos, with all sorts of radicals causing mayhem, President Putin's endgame became obvious. He needed to do anything in his power to prevent Ukraine from becoming another Iraq, with a possibility of a civil war breaking out and violence spreading to Russia at some point. We should learn the lessons of Iraq where the delicate balance, which had existed there before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, was undermined and no one now knows how to resolve it. The same outcome happened as a result of the so-called revolution in Kiev that has now opened up old wounds and awoken historical animosities that had been kept in check. So Putin has chosen to use the 25,000 Russian troops based at Sevastopol, reinforcing them with another 16,000 soldiers, to prevent clashes between radicals on all sides erupting and provide stability in Crimea where about 60% of the population are ethnic Russians. Without a shot being fired, so unlike the rest of the country, law and order have been established. All the Ukrainian military installations in Crimes were surrounded by Russian troops with one purpose: to prevent undesirables arming themselves, like it happened in Lviv and some other cities, with disastrous circumstances. Up to now the plan has worked. But any suggestions that the Kremlin is actually ready to start a full-blown invasion of Ukraine are way, way off the mark. This would be very dangerous for Russia itself, considering it close links with Ukraine on all levels. So the hysteria surrounding the Russian involvement in Crimea at the moment is either caused by ignorance or is a result of the deep suspicions that the West still has about Russia, Cold War or no Cold War. A sudden regime change that has happened in Ukraine could never result in a swift and peaceful resolution. We saw that during the Arab Spring and, less recently, in the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. That is why all sides in the Ukrainian crisis need to keep a cool head and refrain from one-sided propaganda and provocative, inflammatory statements. If one thing that we have learned for history it's that it doesn't take a lot for a big war to erupt in Europe, dragging the rest of the world in it.","Presence of Russian troops in Crimea has sent alarm bells ringing in Western capitals .

"(CNN) -- Five-time winners Brazil opened their World Cup campaign with a nervy 2-1 victory over a spirited North Korea in Johannesburg after the Ivory Coast and Portugal had played out a 0-0 draw in Tuesday's other Group G match. In a contest between the tournament's highest and lowest ranked teams, Brazil were unable to break down the Asian side in a goalless first half, but defender Maicon settled their nerves with a ferocious strike from a tight angle. Elano's crisp finish from a defense-splitting Robinho pass gave the South Americans a 2-0 lead but Ji Yun-nam fired past Julio Cesar to give North Korea a deserved consolation goal. Earlier in Port Elizabeth, Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo struck the post with a 30-yard drive in the first-half of a cagey match, before Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba -- playing 11 days after breaking his elbow -- wasted an opportunity to win the game when he dragged his shot wide in stoppage-time. Inside North Korea's World Cup squad . Brazil 2-1 North Korea . Brazil, seeking a record-extending sixth title, were expected to win with ease against a side making their first appearance in the tournament since 1966, but the North Koreans made life difficult for their illustrious opponents. The first half was a story of resolute defending by the Asians in the face of wave after wave of Brazil attacks. Brazil struggled to get behind the Korean defense and most of their shots came from outside the area with both Elano and Robinho wayward with early efforts. On the few occasions that Brazilian players did make it to the byline, their crosses were blocked by committed and skilful pieces of defending. The second period started in similar fashion, with Robinho and Michel Bastos both missing from range before the opening goal finally arrived in the 55th minute. Kaka picked out the overlapping run of Maicon and the right-back slashed a swerving shot inside the goalkeeper's near post. Brazil's second goal owed everything to a perfectly measured pass through the defense by Robinho to his former Manchester City teammate Elano, who produced a crisp side-footed finish into the far corner. Dunga's men were given a late scare when North Korea crafted a fine goal. A long ball was headed into the path of Ji Yun-nam, who raced into the area and lashed a shot past Julio Cesar. ""I believe the first match is always trying, there was a lot of nervousness, and anxiety,"" Brazil coach Dunga told AFP. ""We all want to score and not concede any goals. I am not entirely happy with the result, we weren't passing as quickly as I would have liked. But the spirit of these players is strong and they are willing to learn."" North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun was proud of his players and saw reason for encouragement ahead of their remaining games against Portugal and Ivory Coast. ""We managed to fend them off whether they were attacking down the wings or through the middle,"" he said. ""We didn't win, but we have picked up some confidence and I think we will do well in the next two games."" New Zealand snatch historic first World Cup point . Ivory Coast 0-0 Portugal . One of the most eagerly-anticipated games of the tournament featured little goalmouth action, with the exception of a moment of magic from the world's most expensive player. After 10 minutes, Ronaldo, who has not scored for his country in 16 months, made space for himself with a sharp turn and curled a right-footed shot from 25 yards which had goalkeeper Boubacar Barry well-beaten but cannoned back off the post. It was the only noteworthy moment of an otherwise dull first half, which featured plenty of probing from both sides but very little goalmouth incident. Ronaldo was shown a yellow card after 20 minutes when he failed to win a free-kick and was involved in a spat with Ivory Coast defender Guy Demel, who was also booked. The Africans saw plenty of the ball but did not create their first real opening until a minute after halftime when the lively Gervinho raced down the left and fired a powerful shot, which Eduardo tipped around the post. With the game starting to open up, Ivory Coast winger Salomon Kalou found space in the area but fired his shot straight at Eduardo before Liedson's header from Deco's cross at the other end was easily held by Barry. Drogba entered the fray after 65 minutes but saw little of the ball until the 92nd minute when Abdelkader Keita slid him clear, only for the striker to screw his shot wastefully across the face of goal.","Five-time champions Brazil beat a stubborn North Korea 2-1 at Ellis Park, Johannesburg .

"(CNN)Fine starts to 2015 for world number one Rory McIlroy and his arch-rival Rickie Fowler, a superb 64 from first round leader Martin Kaymer and aces for England's Tom Lewis and Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez. The first day of the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship Thursday was nothing but eventful as a top class field jostled for position at the top of the leader board. Most eyes were on the partnership of McIlroy and his American rival Fowler, teeing off early at  Abu Dhabi GC, and they did not disappoint, both carding five-under rounds of 67. But last year's U.S. Open champion Kaymer, a three-time winner at the venue, later upstaged them with a blistering eight-under 64, which included 10 birdies, a personal best for him, he told the official European Tour website. ""I putted well. I made 10 birdies. I'm not sure if I have ever done it on a golf course, hit 10 birdies. I hit a lot of fairways, my irons were quite sharp and I putted well. It's very difficult to shoot a bad score when you play like this. His late charge denied Belgium's Thomas Pieters (65) the honor of first day leadership, while there was a five-strong group on 66, consisting of Branden Grace, Gregory Bourdy, Tyrell Hatton, Alexander Levy and Mikko Ilonen. McIlroy, looking to add to his two majors of last year in 2015, made a slow start but a rally on his back nine, with five birdies in six holes, left him in a challenging position. There was no doubting the shots of the day, which came from young gun Lewis and the 51-year-old Jimenez, who aced the seventh and 15th holes respectively. Lewis won a luxury car for his effort, while Jiminez was left to celebrate the eighth hole-in-one of his European Tour career. It's very nice when you make a hole in one. I'm happy I finished level par today."" he said later.","Martin Kaymer leads Abu Dhabi Championship after opening round 64 .

"After Marco Rubio won his inaugural Senate race in 2010 in Florida, he became the latest star of the Republican Party. The young, insurgent candidate was so impressive, talk of a presidential future quickly ensued. He entered the Senate with high expectations, having won his race with the support of the new tea party movement while simultaneously appealing to mainstream conservatives. But his journey has not been without roadblocks. Leadership on controversial topics has slowed his rise. Now, Rubio, 43, is working to right his perceived wrongs and shed his stereotypes as takes up the mantle once adorned by doing the work to launch a presidential run. Boosting his presence . The freshman senator is doing all the things necessary to make himself known. He's traveling to early presidential nominating states, heading overseas to beef up his foreign policy credentials, appearing on national TV to boost his name recognition and formulating policy ideas to demonstrate substance. On Wednesday, he delivered a ""major address"" on economic mobility and challenges facing the middle class. Little new came from it. It was a culmination of previously announced ideas and legislation he's already introduced this year and weaved in personal stories of childhood poverty as the son of Cuban immigrants and accounts of people struggling to make it in the middle class. ""Too  many are starting to believe the American Dream is no longer possible for people like them,"" he said. Alex Conant, Rubio's spokesman, said the senator has been developing these ideas ""for months,"" since the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty earlier this year. It's a comprehensive speech but one that could be delivered on the floor of the Senate, a place where any of the 100 members go to offer their policy prescriptions. Instead, Rubio's speech was aimed at garnering as much attention and clout as possible. In an attempt to appeal to the right, he spoke a few blocks from Capitol Hill at conservative Hillsdale College, which stresses the teaching of ""constitutional principles."" A coordinated media campaign that includes post-speech interviews is geared toward bolstering the significance of the speech. An alternative . Rubio's efforts to raise his profile and prove his substance is also an effort at differentiating himself from Democrats. His economic address comes the same week that President Barack Obama's summit on working families and the Clinton Global Initiative conference in Colorado that focused on jobs and the economy. It was attended by former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton on wealth missteps: 'My record speaks for itself' Rubio's address contrasted the ideas they presented and, instead, took up themes Democrats have largely rejected, including a private option for Medicare and gradually raising the retirement age for Social Security. They are popular ideas within the Republican Party that would arguably save federal dollars. On jobs and economic mobility, Rubio detailed his ideas that include tax reform and tax credits for mothers obtaining an education and income-based student loan payments. He also backed a reduction of regulations and taxes and the repeal of Obamacare that he says prohibits employers from hiring, a far different platform from his Democratic counterparts. Kevin Madden, a former adviser to 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said Rubio is trying to fill a void. ""He recognizes the Republican Party is very hungry for leaders who want to serve as a counterpoint to President Obama on the big policy issues,"" he said. To beef up his foreign policy resume, the member of the Foreign Relations Committee has put himself out front on related matters. He appeared on the Sunday talk shows to discuss the U.S. response to the chaos in Iraq where he backed air strikes, a position Obama hasn't pursued. A crowded field . But to get where he'll contrast his ideas against a Democratic presidential candidate, he needs to differentiate himself from his fellow Republicans. Rubio is doing what other potential presidential candidates have done. Sen. Rand Paul has delivered numerous policy speeches throughout the country; Gov. Chris Christie has been active outside New Jersey in his role as head of the Republican Governors Association; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has begun strategically appearing at national conferences. They, and a dozen other potential candidates, have also traveled to early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? There lies the problem: Rubio is just one of many climbers trying to reach the same summit. As many as four governors, three senators, a former senator and two former governors are contemplating a 2016 run. Rubio faces a difficult slog to rise above the noise that the Republican race is already making. In a June CNN poll, Rubio pulled 8% among potential GOP presidential candidates. His support is low, but he fell smack in the middle of the large pack and not much worse than the most popular potential candidate, Paul, who garnered 14%. In a fractured Republican Party that consists of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party activists and pragmatists, Rubio will have to find his niche. Rubio's rising star . After he won his Senate race, Rubio was the face of the tea party. He was considered one of the more conservative to enter the Senate. But as the Republican establishment struggled to embrace the tea party, he became the glue. Party leaders saw potential and a future in Rubio. He's young, He's Hispanic and he's telegenic. ""It's a great day for the conservative cause. New people with new thinking, new ideas -- 21st century solutions,"" Jeb Bush said immediately after his victory. But politics is a volatile profession. Rubio's folly . Rubio's stock within the Republican Party plummeted last year when he held up the mantle for the Republican Party on immigration reform. He was part of a group of eight senators that forged an agreement, leading to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. While he was dubbed ""The Republican Savior"" by Time Magazine for his work on a solution that has been unable to pass Congress for nearly a decade, conservatives called the bill  amnesty for undocumented immigrants and conservative Erick Erickson called Rubio a ""disappointment"" on his blog Red State. ""While some of us will be able to forgive Marco Rubio's rather rapid shift toward the very position he once vocally opposed, others probably will not be so forgiving,"" Erickson wrote. Bob Vander Plaats, CEO of The Family Leader, a social conservative organization in Iowa that has a large amount of political influence in the critical presidential caucus state, said people ""really backed away"" from Rubio after immigration. Rubio, he said, is going to have to explain himself to Iowa Republicans. Iowa voters are ""a very discerning lot,"" Vander Plaats said. ""They're willing to forgive. They're willing to try to understand."" Although his immigration position was likely to appeal to independent voters and even Democrats, the outrage proved the position was unpopular among the base, which he needs in a presidential primary. After the immigration fallout, Rubio felt the heat and backed away from the national spotlight. He laid low and made little noise. Rubio's return . Rubio has mostly avoided the topic of immigration except to pivot away from the bill he helped pass through the Senate by endorsing a fragmented approach in the Republican-led House. He maintained his latest stance again Wednesday when he said a solution for the millions of undocumented immigrants can't happen before the border is secure and a worker verification system is in place. Since 2014 rolled around, Rubio has been carefully crafting his image as a well-rounded, versatile leader in the Republican Party. He has repeatedly appeared on the business channel CNBC to discuss economic policies without mentioning immigration. A smart move, Madden said, because ""it's dangerous when you make your name on one issue."" Madden, who has been watching his campaign, said Rubio is making the right moves, not only in the policy arena but the political one, too. ""He's not making 2014 about Marco Rubio but making it about candidates across the country,"" Madden said. Rubio was the first of the possible presidential candidates to endorse Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst. He traveled to the state to fundraise and campaign for her. His endorsement and her subsequent win helps him build relationships and a national infrastructure in critical states. Media. Check. Policy. Check. Politics. Check. Now Rubio has the long, treacherous trek of finding the voters who support him. ""Slow and steady wins the race,"" Madden said. How many ways can Romney say no to 2016?","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is giving a major economic policy address .
It's part of a larger coordinated strategy to prepare for a presidential run .
One challenge is being noticed among the many other Republicans considering .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Congressman Henry Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, died early Thursday morning. He was 83. Henry Hyde served in the House for more than three decades. Hyde's death was confirmed by a spokesman in the office of House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. Hyde had been ill for some time and had open heart surgery in July. In his final years in office, he was wheelchair bound and frail. Hyde's wife, Judy, was with him last night at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, according to Tom Mooney, his former chief of staff. According to Mooney, Hyde said to his wife he wanted to ""go home,"" to which Judy replied, ""We are going to get you home."" He passed away soon after that. Born in 1924, Hyde served in the House from 1975 to 2006 and retired at end of the last session. Hyde served as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001. Hyde, a Catholic, was a vocal opponent of abortion. In 1976 Hyde attached an amendment to a spending bill that banned federal funding for abortions. The amendment later become known as the ""Hyde Amendment"" and has been at the center of the political fight over abortion since its passage. He chaired the committee during the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. The committee and the full House approved articles of impeachment stemming from the Lewinsky scandal, in which Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Senate later voted against the charges. In a written statement, Boehner called Hyde ""a constitutional scholar, a thoughtful legislator, and a passionate orator."" ""But above all, he will be remembered as a gentleman who stood as a beacon for the bedrock principles of liberty, justice, and, above all, respect for life,"" Boehner said. ""He was a forceful advocate for maintaining the dignity of the House and for recognizing the sacrifices and struggles Members make while in its service,"" Boehner said in the statement. ""Indeed, when Henry spoke in Committee or on the House floor, Members on both sides of aisle listened intently -- and they learned."" On November 5, President Bush awarded Hyde the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the president can bestow on an American citizen. ""He proved that a man can have firm convictions and be a favorite of Democrats and Republicans alike,"" Bush said at the medal ceremony.  E-mail to a friend .

"Hillary Clinton told reporters Sunday that the purpose of her return to Iowa for the first time in over six years was ""to support candidates."" But 2016's presidential politics were everywhere on a sun-soaked field in Indianola, Iowa. Clinton captured the sentiment best herself with a joke from the stage of the 37th and final Harkin Steak Fry: ""Hello Iowa. I'm back!"" Clinton left Iowa in 2008 after finishing a disappointing third place in the Iowa caucus. Six years have changed things, though, and Clinton has been followed by the possibility of running for president since she stepped down as secretary of state in 2013. Polls show her as the prohibitive favorite for the nomination, and her visit to Iowa this weekend has raised the specter even higher that she will likely run for president. From the stage on Sunday, Clinton admitted the 2016 question is on her mind. ""It is true, I am thinking about it,"" Clinton said to a roaring applause. ""But for today, that is not why I am here. I am here first and foremost for Tom [Harkin], for Ruth [his wife] and for the great candidates that you have a chance to elect."" The crowd reacted with unhappy groans, some yelled ""Just do it!"" Organizers and Clinton supporters went to lengths to stress that the former first family was simply coming to Iowa to honor Sen. Tom Harkin -- who is retiring at the end of the year -- and help raise money for Democrats in the state. Signs reading ""Thank You Tom"" encircled the idyllic field where the steak fry was held and candidates running for office spoke before Clinton. Clinton talks up fellow Democrats . Clinton herself was also clear to endorse and talk-up Democrats running in Iowa, including Senate hopeful Bruce Braley. The former first family headlined a fundraiser before the steak fry with the candidates, where they spoke to donors about the importance of electing Democrats. ""I hope this whole event helps Bruce, because he should be the next senator,"" Clinton told reporters at the steak fry. ""He's got the record, he's got the commitment. He's got the right values. He should be the next senator."" But 2016 -- and the possibility of Clinton running -- touched every part of the steak fry. It was a large reason 6,200 people attended and 200 journalists covered the event, according to organizers. It was also the reason a number of former Clinton aides traveled to Iowa, filtering through the crowd, chatting with Iowa activists. Part fundraiser, part pep rally, part barbecue, the event has become a must-stop for Democrats thinking about running for president and is widely seen as the biggest annual event in Iowa politics. Despite the name, steaks are grilled, not fried, and it is customary for headliners to flip steaks for themselves. Clinton stuck with tradition on Sunday, flipping a steak with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who chose to flip veggie burgers. Other than that, much of the event broke with the traditions Clinton has been following since leaving the State Department. 'In just 50 days, Iowans have a choice to make' Hillary Clinton's speech was markedly different than the ones she generally gives on the paid speaking circuit. Gone were many of the stories of her personal history, instead Clinton focused on the differences between Democrats and Republicans and spoke at length about women's rights. ""Now, think about it, in just 50 days, Iowans have a choice to make,"" she said. ""A choice between the guardians of gridlock and the champions of shared opportunity and shared prosperity. A chance to elect leaders who will carry on Tom Harkin's legacy of fighting for hard working families."" In her last year on the paid speaking circuit, Clinton and her aides have kept the media largely at arms length, rarely answering questions from the gaggle of journalists following her. On Sunday, she shirked that tradition. After flipping steaks, she ventured over the a swarm of media cameras and reporters. ""It is fabulous to be back. I love Iowa,"" Hillary Clinton said to questions about 2016. ""I first came to Iowa when I was around, I was either 9 or 10, and we were with my dad and we went to Des Moines and we stayed at a place called the Tall Corn Motel."" Asked about whether she was running in 2016, Clinton said, ""we are just here to support candidates,"" adding later that she hopes to increase turnout with her visit. ""If people turn out, we will actually win these midterm elections,"" Clinton said. ""This is about the people running right now."" Compared with Bill Clinton, however, Hillary Clinton talked with reporters for a short amount of time. The former President entertained questions about midterm races and the future of the Senate before he was pulled away by aides and Secret Service agents. Bill Clinton also addressed his wife's possible presidential bid. Asked whether Clinton was liberal enough to win Iowa, a question raised by the fact that other presidential hopefuls such as Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden are all coming to Iowa with positions left of Hillary Clinton, the former president answered affirmatively. ""I won it twice,"" BIll Clinton said, referring to his results in 1992 and 1996. ""Yea, I think so. I think what people want is somebody who is both a genuine progressive and will bring people together and produce shared prosperity."" Asked whether Hillary Clinton was that person, the normally wordy former president was silent.

"New York (CNN) -- Some people collect stamps or build miniature boats, while others obsess over their tricked-out cars -- but what if your hobby was building a nuclear fusion reactor? For Mark Suppes, it is. By day, Suppes is a freelance web developer at Gucci, but at night he works in a warehouse lab in Brooklyn, New York, experimenting with nuclear fusion. Suppes says he became hooked on fusion after watching a video featuring Robert W. Bussard, an American physicist who worked primarily in nuclear fusion energy research. ""It very quickly struck me as one of the better ideas for new forms of energy,"" Suppes says. Paul Schatzkin, founder of Fusor.net, says people typically think of Hiroshima or the Chernobyl disaster when they hear the word nuclear. ""And when they hear it they should think sun,"" he says, ""because what they are building is a miniature synthetic star. A fusion reaction is a star."" According to Stan Milora, director of the Fusion Energy Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, nuclear fusion occurs when two hydrogen atoms fuse together and create a helium atom. The resulting helium atom has less mass but is heavier than the original hydrogen atoms. This difference in mass, according to Einstein's classic formula, is what gives off energy, Milora says. Schatzkin has been following nuclear fusion since 1973 and his site provides a forum for aspiring fusion researchers. Such forums allow Suppes to exchange ideas and suggestions with hundreds of other fusion researchers. ""I really started from scratch,"" Suppes says of his fusion reactor. ""I was a web developer. I've always been interested in this. It's exciting. I've learned so much and mastered so many skills that I didn't know about before."" Suppes' fusion experiment is on a small scale and gives off energy that is hard to detect, so he uses a bubble detector. The bubble detector is filled with gel and when fusion occurs, a leftover neutron will travel through the gel, creating a bubble. Although cosmic rays can naturally create bubbles as well, Suppes believes he achieved fusion on June 6 when he recorded an emergence of four bubbles in two hours and 40 minutes in a breakthrough he called statistically significant. Suppes has extensively detailed his endeavors on his blog and provides pictures and data to back up his claims. He has been blogging and building the reactor since October 2008 and has spent around $37,000 of his own money on the project. Schatzkin added Suppes to his site's Neutron Club -- a list of 38 worldwide ""amateur fusioneers"" -- on June 8. Milora told CNN he cannot confirm Suppes' claim without more information, but he said it is definitely possible that Suppes succeeded in achieving fusion. ""I would not at all worry about anything being harmful to the public,"" Milora says, adding that the scale of Suppes' experiment is far smaller than those that create health hazards. Suppes goal now is to build ""the world's first superconducting Bussard Reactor. Ultimately break-even fusion,"" Suppes says. Such a project, however, will require investors and large-scale fundraising. Milora says that while Suppes' experiments may be amateur because they are smaller and less complex, they can be more efficient than the massive projects funded by national governments. ""Someone could come up a with a little twist that improves what we do, a little breakthrough,"" Milora says. ""But it still has to obey the law of physics, there is no magic."" According to Milora, the drawback to nuclear fusion now is that reactors capable of creating large enough amounts of energy cost billions of dollars and have yet to require less energy than they produce, or, ""net energy."" If fusion reactors could produce net energy, ""it would have a profound impact, because there are thousands of years of fuel available,"" he says.","Mark Suppes inspired by American physicist to explore nuclear energy .

"Sen. Ted Cruz hasn't decided whether he'll be hitting the presidential campaign trail in 2015, but he's scheduled to hit the Passover speaking circuit next year. Cruz, who has been actively courting major Jewish and pro-Israel donors in recent months, will speak at at least one ritzy Passover getaway this spring in California. Cruz was mistakenly listed as a speaker at four pricey Passover getaways organized by the Prime Hospitality Group, but a rabbi who helped coordinate Cruz's appearance said the Texan senator is only slated to speak at one event. ""Unfortunately it was a mistake on our part,"" Rabbi Seth Grauer said. Grauer added that Cruz may speak at an additional Passover event in California or Colorado, but deferred additional comment to Cruz's office. His office has not responded to CNN's request for comment. Cruz has spoken at length in the past about the need to support Israel and has called a nuclear Iran the top national security threat to the United States. A tea party and evangelical favorite, Cruz is billed as a speaker alongside several leading rabbis and Malcolm Hoenlein, a major player in the pro-Israel lobby and the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. The event where Cruz is slated to speak is set at the five-diamond St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort in California, where stays range from $5,600 to $11,000 per person for the full 10-day stay, according to the Prime Hospitality Group. The organization's website bills Cruz as an ardent supporter of Israel, quoting Mort Klein, the President of the right wing pro-Israel group, the Zionist Organization of America. Cruz's deputy chief of staff Nick Muzin will also speak at the Passover event in California. Cruz reportedly met with top Jewish donors in New York City in November, according to the New York Observer. He also met privately with casino mogul and Jewish Republican donor Sheldon Adelson in November. Cruz left the stage at an event celebrating Middle Eastern Christians in September after he was booed for expressing his support for Israel.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentine lawmakers approved an agreement with Iran that will create a five-member commission to investigate the deadly 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish community center. The measure passed by a 131-113 vote early Thursday after more than 14 hours of debate. The 1994 attack -- the worst in Argentina's history -- killed 85 people and injured about 300. Iran hints at new evidence in 1994 Jewish center bombing . Prosecutors in Argentina allege that Iran was behind the attack, but a criminal investigation has stalled, in part because Iran denies the charges and has not made the accused available to prosecutors. Argentina requested the arrest of several Iranians in 2007 in connection with the bombing, including the current defense minister of Iran, Ahmad Vahidi. Interpol approved so-called Red Notices for these suspects, alerting countries around the world of Buenos Aires' desire to have them arrested. Seeking a way around the impasse, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner drafted an agreement with Iran that would create a ""truth commission"" and allow the judge and prosecutor in the criminal proceedings to interrogate the accused Iranians. The government heralded the agreement as a way to find out what happened in 1994. But the deal had much opposition, including from Jewish groups in Argentina, because the verdict of the commission would be nonbinding. There was also a feeling of mistrust in engaging in a sensitive agreement like this with Iran, a country whose president has denied the Holocaust. ""This is a memorandum that is not clear, that is not complete and that we feel doesn't bring any benefit to the cause,"" Julio Schlosser, president of the Jewish umbrella organization DAIA, said before the vote. The deal does not provide a timetable for the commission to form or to hand down a judgment, or provide specifics about the interrogation of the accused Iranians, he said.

"Caroline Pla just won her fight to get back on the field. Pla has been playing football since kindergarten, and for the past two years, the 11-year-old has been holding her own on the gridiron. Her playing time with the Catholic Youth Organization ended after last season when the Archdiocese of Philadelphia enforced its ""boys only"" policy for football, sidelining the All-Star guard and defensive end. 'More than able to hold her own,' girl gets boot . Members of a panel selected by the archdiocese voted to continue the boys-only policy as written. Despite the panel's recommendation, on Thursday Archbishop Charles Chaput ordered the archdiocese to allow girls to play CYO football, according to a statement. ""The Archdiocese will allow for co-ed participation in CYO football, effective in the 2013 season,"" the statement said, adding that the rule was provisional and will be reviewed in future seasons. ""The Archbishop is grateful for their time and prudent counsel,"" Archdiocese of Philadelphia spokesman Kenneth A. Gavin said in the statement, adding that the recommendation was only one factor in the decision making process. ""All possible factors were considered including the expectations of coaches, parents, and pastors, common current practice, legal circumstances and the CYO policies of dioceses around the country."" Caroline was walking home from school when her mother caught up with her to tell her the news. ""I was screaming, jumping and laughing,"" she said. ""I'm just really excited and surprised. I wasn't expecting this (news)."" Caroline expressed appreciation for all the support she received around the world, without which, she said, ""I don't think the rule would have been changed."" She also thanked Archbishop Chaput, saying that ""it was his decision in the end."" Caroline's mother, Seal Pla, said she was pleased with the decision, which came after her daughter mounted a fight, rallying support from around the nation. After her pleas to the archdiocese were unsuccessful, Caroline decided to call an audible. With the full support of her team, Caroline and her mom started an online petition at change.org to encourage the archdiocese to allow girls to play football that had more than 108,000 signatures as of Thursday afternoon. The publicity surrounding her plight also caught the attention of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres who invited her to appear on the show. ""I'm just so excited. This is a positive step for the Catholic church,"" her mother said, catching her breath. ""Caroline was never going to give up, even if they said no."" ""I wish I had that much determination,"" she said. Inspired by her older brother, George, 14, Caroline started playing Pop Warner flag football at age 5 and was hooked. Once she got too big to play Pop Warner, she signed up to play tackle football with the CYO in fifth grade. Two games into Caroline's second season, head coach Chip Ross received an unexpected call from Jason Budd, deputy secretary for Catholic education for the archdiocese, who oversees the football program. Not wanting to disrupt the season or ostracize Caroline, Ross and her parents kept the news under wraps and pleaded with the archdiocese to let her finish the season. After a week of corresponding with Budd, including sending a letter of support from the family's church pastor, an extension was granted. There are 46 football programs, each with junior varsity and varsity teams, under the Archdiocese of Philadelphia CYO. Of the nearly 2,500 participants, Caroline is the only female player. The coaches waited until the end of the season to tell Caroline and her teammates that she was off the team. Though Caroline says she's never been hurt -- and has laid her share of licks on the boys -- the archdiocese said in a statement that the decision to give Caroline the boot was for her and other girls' safety. According to the archdiocese, budget cuts and personnel changes allowed Caroline to slip through the cracks, and she actually should've been denied the opportunity to play when she initially applied in fifth grade. When she first stepped on the field, the boys on Caroline's first CYO team were uncomfortable lining up against a girl, said her former coach, Jim Reichwein. Those concerns dissipated once Caroline showed she was tough enough to take the rough and tumble of the game. ""We didn't make a big deal about it,"" said Reichwein. ""Anyone who went head-to-head with her ended up on the ground. After a week, (her gender) was laid to rest."" While waiting for Caroline to return from school, Seal Pla said her daughter taught her a powerful lesson. ""Always fight for what you believe in the right way, with respect and persistence,"" she said. Football season is still a while off, but when the time comes, said Caroline, ""I'll be ready.""

"The middle-aged man stands in line, patiently waiting. He's wearing the de facto uniform of the Seoul businessman, a fitted black suit and thin tie. He's driven an hour to be here at the memorial site at Ansan, joining the 100,000 mourners paying their respects before the school portraits of children who will never grow old. ""I'm a father of two kids,"" he weeps, his hand firmly over his chest, as if to press in a breaking heart. ""I just am very sorry because I can do nothing for these families. I just want to come here to say I'm very sorry to these families."" He knew no one aboard the Sewol ferry -- his life in Seoul should be blissfully separate from the unfolding disaster at sea. But he embodies the grief, guilt and anger that leaves virtually no one in South Korea untouched. Nation in yellow . The main road into Jindo is lined with yellow. Every 6 feet, another yellow ribbon waves in the wind of the passing cars. At Danwon High School in Ansan, where the junior class lost three quarters of its students in the ferry disaster, yellow ribbons are tied at the gates. But these ribbons didn't start at the disaster site or the school. In the nation that refers to itself as the most wired in the world, South Korea's ribbons began online, as a simple yellow square with the outline of a bow. University students designed the image and began to spread it on an instant messaging site in South Korea called Kakao Talk on April 19. The meaning began as a hopeful one, ""one small step, big miracle."" As the death toll continues to rise, it's evolved into a national sign of grief. People are tying ribbons to their homes and schools across the country. The ribbons prominently appear on television news programs nearly every half hour, somber music sometimes playing underneath the slow-motion images of the yellow across the country. The prim presenters of South Korea's television programs, whose female anchors tend to favor hot pink and royal blue, are all wearing grey and black suits. One story dominates the news channels -- the Sewol ferry disaster, from the investigation to the national mourning. On Korean language Twitter and Facebook, users share their grief in short messages with a yellow ribbon. Overwhelmingly, the messages tend to focus on a sense of rage and helplessness. ""I am sorry that I couldn't rescue you and help you,"" Twitter user @sbja22 wrote. Children, a nation's treasure . The palpable desire to rescue the victims centers around who the passengers are -- students from Danwon High School. Juniors in South Korea's high schools have traditionally been granted a special outing or field trip before notoriously rigorous college entrance exams. The teenagers who boarded the Sewol ferry were experiencing a national rite of passage that turned to horror. Children in South Korea are considered a family's treasure, the ones who have traditionally been doted on and showered with attention. Obedience in the young is prized. Parental protection is the reward. The Sewol disaster tears through much of the cultural structure expected in modern Korean society of children and elders. The first emergency call from the doomed ferry came from a Danwon student, 17-year-old Choi Duk-ha. ""Save us. We are on a ship, and I think it's sinking,"" he pleaded as he called emergency services. The adults on the ship failed to make the first distress call and would follow three minutes later. Choi Duk-ha would die on the Sewol ferry. The crew, the ones trained to protect the passengers, issued a ship-wide announcement for passengers to remain in their cabins, instead of heading to the deck and the life rafts. The high school students, raised in that culture of obedience, overwhelmingly listened to that announcement. Survivors say the passengers who listened to that order were the ones who never made it off. The crew then abandoned ship, being some of the first rescued by the coast guard. Television news broadcast images fueling national outrage -- the captain jumping into a rescue boat as his young passengers remained trapped, wearing life vests that prevented them from swimming out of flooding rooms. Systemwide failure . The Sewol ferry was first known as the Ferry Naminoue, built in Japan. It operated in Japan from 1994 to 2012. The Chonghaejin Marine Co. purchased the ferry on October 2012 and refurbished it. Chonghaejin added extra passenger cabins on the third, fourth and fifth decks, raising passenger capacity and altering the weight and balance of the vessel. The ferry, renamed the Sewol, went through regulatory and safety checks, conducted by the Korean Register of Shipping. On its website, it lists its mission as ""protecting life and property."" The organization says it has the ability to inspect vessels in 65 nations, from Australia to Spain. The organization is private but works on behalf of the government. In the case of the Sewol, the Korean Register of Shipping conducted safety inspections, investigating its design and technology. The Sewol's modifications passed inspection and began sailing with passengers last year, operating between Incheon and the resort island of Jeju. ""The modification was part of the reason for the (Sewol) accident,"" believes Yutaka Watanabe, a marine science and technology professor at Tokyo University who has studied maritime accidents, including a similar ferry disaster in Japan in 2007. ""They bought a used vessel from Japan and added lots of cabins, and these cabins were built on the top part of the ship. It shifted the center of gravity upward."" In the wake of the Sewol sinking, Mokpo prosecutors have raided the Chonghaejin Marine Co. and the Korean Register of Shipping. Prosecutors tell CNN while they will not have a conclusion on what caused the accident for months, they are focusing on the retrofit of the Sewol and the shifting and overloading of cargo. The prosecutor's office also says the Mokpo Joint Investigation Force found serious safety failures on a sister ship, the Ohamana, also owned by the Chonghaejin Marine Co. Investigators found of the life rafts on board the Ohamana, 40 did not work. The emergency slides also did not work. The Ohamana did not have any equipment to tie down cars being ferried on board. Shipping containers being transported did have equipment to tie them down, but it did not work very well. Korea's Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries says the Ohamana ceased operations after the Sewol accident. The sense of failure to protect the passengers extends to the South Korean Coast Guard and its rescue of the passengers who did make it to the upper decks of the Sewol. Television images showed the coast guard pulling crew members to safety, while the ferry bobbed on its side. As Koreans look inward on this disaster, the sinking of the ferry is being viewed as an outrageous system failure, from the company that sought to increase passenger loads to the very government charged with protecting the passengers. ""It makes us wonder if we have to take charge of our own safety,"" says Cynthia Yoo, assistant professor at Kyung Hee University. ""We can't take it for granted that there are proper government safeguards or proper inspections of safety requirements in place to protect us. I think the Sewol is a classic case of corruption or collusion between government agencies, associations and corporations. And it's something that as a nation we must try to fix."" The funerals are well underway, the school pictures of teenagers and teachers being broadcast on television and the Web part of the nation's mourning process. But there is another call beyond the cries of grief, an inward alarm to repair the flaws and prevent another disaster with such an immense loss.

"When Ashton Kutcher is deciding which technology startups to throw his money at, he sometimes thinks about pilgrims. ""What would happen if a pilgrim would have seen seen a computer in action in Massachusetts back in the day?"" Kutcher said onstage at a technology conference on Tuesday. ""They probably would have killed that person and called them a witch because ultimately they would have seen it as magic."" In an analogy-laden interview at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference here, Kutcher described how he picks from the myriad small companies that appeal to him for cash. The ""Two and a Half Men"" actor has emerged as a prominent investor in Silicon Valley startups, lending his own money as well as money from his investment firm called A-Grade Ventures. He was also a celebrity early adopter of Twitter. ""We're all kind of on a witch hunt, really,"" said Kutcher, appealing to the other venture capitalists in the room. ""I like to learn how magic tricks work."" Kutcher is considered a flashy outsider in many circles here but is quickly finding friends among entrepreneurs trying to catapult off of his celebrity. He bills himself as a seasoned marketer, as a former model who was able to launch an acting career and sell movies to high-profile producers. He has lent financial and promotional support to Airbnb, the room rental listings service; Flipboard, the iPad news aggregator that CNN's Zite competes with; Foursquare, the location check-in application; and others. He said he sometimes hides his affiliation with companies to avoid overshadowing them. ""Disclosing that I'm an investor can sometimes be detrimental to the company,"" Kutcher said. ""I try not to talk about until the company has a public awareness that's large enough and their story has matured enough so it won't be disruptive to the company."" This strategy got him into some trouble recently, when he edited a section of Conde Nast's Details magazine in which he promoted tech companies he was financially involved in without disclosing his relationships. The U.S. Federal Trade Commissions has rules about journalistic disclosure, but it said last month that it does not plan to investigate the matter.","Ashton Kutcher invests in several tech companies .

"Republicans are going all in, hoping that the payout is big. Like control of the Senate, big. Their big bet: Obamacare. The deadline to enroll in the Affordable Care Act for the year has come and gone. The Obama administration is touting the enrollment numbers as a successful first year, but Republicans think voter anger over the law is here to stay. And so, Republicans running for House and Senate continue to make it central to their campaign. In the Arkansas Senate race, Republican challenger Tom Cotton is using Obamacare to fund-raise for his race against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor. The first screen on Cotton's website is a plea for contributions that says, ""Obamacare is so bad that Obama doesn't want it. Tell him neither do I."" Fund-raising schemes and campaign advertisements are central to Republican races in red and swing states around the country. Republican confidence . When Republican David Jolly beat Democrat Alex Sink in Florida's special election for the 13th Congressional District in March, Republicans attributed the win in part to the health care law. ""His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters after the results were tallied. The deep-pocketed group Americans for Prosperity is playing in dozens of races around the country, and its sole weapon is Obamacare. ""We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the number one issue in the country,"" Tim Phillips, president of AFP, said in a recent interview. The organization, backed by the wealthy partisans David and Charles Koch, has already spent more than $30 million this election cycle and plans to spend a great deal more to ensure that Democrats ""have to explain"" their support of the law. Public opinion . Republicans believe they have a winning issue, insisting that Americans are opposed to the law. And most polling is on their side. According to the most recent survey conducted just over a week ago by CBS News, 53% of Americans gave the law a thumbs down, compared to 41% saying they approve of it. That's in line with most polls. But that could be starting to change. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last week found that the gap between approval and disapproval of the law narrowed to 8 points. And a new Washington Post/ABC poll out Monday found that 49% support the law compared to 48% who don't. Public action . While polls are indicative of voter opinion, they don't indicate voter action. What does, however, is enthusiasm, and Republicans have that on their side. In a midterm election, when people are less likely to vote, voter turnout is critical and Obamacare gives Republicans an advantage. ""This data pretty clearly shows that even though attitudes regarding the ACA are 'baked in' with voters (68% feel strongly one way or another about the issue), the intensity is clearly on the negative side, as GOP voters clearly dislike the new law more than Democrats are in love with it,"" said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, a co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies. Voter apathy is a challenge that Democrats must overcome. Republican strategy: Invoke doubt . Republicans are hitting a nerve when it comes to Obamacare. They are appealing to their base's mistrust in the President. Republican Sen. John Barrasso on ""Fox News Sunday"" alleged  the administration is ""cooking the books"" regarding the program's rollout numbers. This includes the latest number that more than 6 million have enrolled. And Republicans constantly raise questions: Who are the people enrolling and did they have health insurance beforehand? Obamacare was pushed by the President and passed by Congress in 2010 with no Republican support as a way to narrow the gap between those with coverage and the tens of millions without it. White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Republicans are grasping at straws as the law takes hold and people begin to see benefits. ""I know it leaves them with the need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to other means of trying to attack a law that is providing opportunity and security to millions of Americans,"" Carney said. Republican risks . Pounding an issue into the ground does bring some risks -- voter annoyance. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 53% of Americans are tired of hearing about the law. Republican pollster Whit Ayers said there's a more powerful factor in voter fatigue: Obama himself. Six years into a President's term, ""people get tired of that person's leadership,"" he said. ""Especially this President's."" Democrats' challenge . The goal is to get Democrats to the polls. Democrats, however, have a more complicated role that consists largely of defense. While they are being attacked on the campaign trail over the law, they have decided to respond in a multipart way by saying that some of the law is great, but some parts need to be fixed. That's exactly what endangered Democrats, including Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Alaska's Mark Begich, did when they and several colleagues penned an op-ed laying out the parts of the law that they said need to be changed. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, an organization that works to elect Democrats to Congress, is fighting back by highlighting the ""cost of repeal."" The organization is telling stories of people who live in districts with contested congressional races who say they could not afford health coverage without the Affordable Care Act. ""Americans do not want to repeal the ACA and go back to the days when insurance companies had free rein over health care; they want it fixed and improved. But this Republican Congress is obsessed with a repeal that will force hardworking families into bankruptcy and let insurance companies deny care and drop coverage,"" Israel said. It's a difficult way to convince people to turn out to vote, even if public opinion drastically changes in favor of the law. In the March Florida special election in a swing district in a swing state, the only test case analysts have to monitor in the current political climate, Sink embraced only parts of the law. She also talked about what needs to be fixed, a strategy that didn't work. But as of now, Democrats don't want to be talking about it. That's why they are focusing on economic issues such as minimum wage and equal pay for women. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is a member of Senate Democratic leadership, said people aren't focused on Obamacare. ""Most Americans want to hear something positive. 'What are you going to do for me?' Republicans are going to give them no answers on that,"" Schumer said. But former President Bill Clinton said Democrats cautioned against running from the law they championed and passed. ""I thought that Democrats had a tendency to shy away from things they had done that were unpopular, (and) talk about positions they had that were popular. And that my own experience had convinced me -- going back to '94 and even more when I was governor -- that that was always a terrible mistake,"" Clinton said this week.

"New York (CNN) -- Suffolk County Police have upped the ante in their search for a killer or killers who apparently dumped their victims along a remote stretch of beach in Long Island, New York. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, according to a police statement Thursday. The $25,000 reward would be the largest offered in Suffolk County history, in an apparent bid to fill out a possible serial killer case that some fear has gone cold. ""We're hoping the increased reward money will encourage somebody to come forward by calling the police in respect to the families and to (the) victims,"" Lt. Robert Donohue said. At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties since December. The woman who originally prompted the searches -- 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert -- remains missing, and police say they have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case. The New Jersey woman was last seen in May 2010 at a private party at a home in the Oak Beach community. ""I am hopeful that the increased reward will provide critical information to help bring those responsible to justice,"" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian family fighting to keep their 13-month-old son on a breathing tube says they have been denied a request to have him transferred to a hospital in Michigan. Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to sign consent when Canadian health officials determined their son Joseph, who suffers from a progressive degenerative neurological disease and was in a persistent vegetative state, should be removed from life support. Joseph is being treated at the London Health Sciences Centre in Ontario. The Maraachlis reached out to the Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit in hopes of having their son transferred there for continued care. Family spokesperson Sam Sansalone said the hospital initially agreed to accept the transfer. He said he has since received an email indicating the request has been denied. Sansalone forwarded an email from the Detroit hospital that he said explains that after a review of Joseph's records by neurological and intensive care physicians, ""we cannot offer Joseph anything that he has not been provided already during his current admission by his current clinical care team ... transfer to our facility will not provide him or the family any benefit."" Vickie Winn, a spokesperson from the Children's Hospital, confirmed Joseph is not a patient at the hospital but could not offer further comment, citing patient privacy laws. Sansalone said the family is pursuing at least three other hospitals in other states. Baby Joseph's decline . Joseph was born on January 22, 2010, and his parents say they noticed something was wrong when he was around 3 months old. ""He couldn't eat by mouth. He wouldn't open his eyes. He didn't cry, and he couldn't breathe well,"" said his father in a phone conversation. The family lives on the Canada-Michigan border, and they took Joseph to a Michigan hospital a few miles from Windsor, Ontario, in June. He was diagnosed with a metabolic brain disease. ""He saw a neurologist who told us our son would be OK, but may be developmentally delayed,"" said Maraachli. ""Never did they say he would die."" After being treated in Michigan, Joseph returned to normal, the family said. After nearly a month of treatment, he started playing with his brother and began eating again. He was fine until October, when he developed a fever. His father noticed rapid breathing. Maraachli says he rushed his son to an emergency room in Canada. Joseph was in respiratory distress. That hospital didn't have a pediatric emergency room, so the infant was moved to London Health Sciences Centre. Disagreement on diagnosis . The family says the hospital has it wrong and that their son is not in a persistent vegetative state. Sansalone said they have noted experiences where the baby has responded to being tickled and has jolted when he felt discomfort with examinations or the feeding tubes. They say these are signs he might still have brain function. However, Canadian health officials disagree. On February 17, they decided Joseph should be removed from life support. The family was given until February 21 to say their goodbyes and sign the consent, but they have yet to do so. The Maraachlis are seeking a second opinion from what they consider to be an objective source that can review the more than 1,000 pages of Joseph's medical records and provide a better assessment of their son's treatment options. If he is beyond hope, they want him to be able to receive a tracheotomy, where he can be transferred home and die in the care of family instead of in a hospital. Experts say even if the family is granted this request, caring for a child in this condition is an arduous task. Dr. David Casarett, director of research and evaluation at the University of Pennsylvania's Wissahickon Hospice, says patients at home with tracheotomies need monitoring to make sure the airway is clear of secretions, the skin is clean and dry and someone can make sure the incision at the tracheotomy site does not get infected. ""A child's care would be much more complex if a home ventilator is required, since the parents would need to manage the ventilator with the help of a nurse and respiratory therapist,"" he said. Parallels with Terri Schiavo . The family plight has caught the attention of Bobby Schindler, the brother of Terri Schiavo. She was the woman whose family fought to have her sustained on a feeding tube for more than a decade and who became the centerpiece of a national right-to-die battle in the United States. ""There are some parallels,"" Schindler said. ""The family's intention is to bring the baby home and show him the love and compassion that only families can really give a child, just like we did with my sister Terry,"" he says. Schindler is joined by a coalition of advocates en route to Canada to help the Maraachlis with their case. Suzanne Vitadamo, spokesperson for the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network and Terri's sister, issued the following statement: . ""It is unacceptable for Canadian Health Allocation Officials and/or the Canadian Government to make decisions for Joseph that will end his life and deny the wishes of his loving parents. ""Every patient, regardless of age, has a right to proper and dignified health care. It is frightening to once again see government usurp the God-given rights of parents to love and care for their child at home, especially when the child is dying.""","Canadian family doesn't want to take 13-month-old son off life support .

"An Israeli soldier was killed Sunday in a shooting along the Israel-Lebanon border, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The soldier was treated at the scene, then evacuated to a hospital. He later died of his wounds. Later, around midnight, as soldiers in the area conducted an investigation, ""suspicious people"" were identified and ""due to a threat, precise shots were fired at the suspects identified as Lebanese soldiers, and one suspect was hit,"" an Israel Defense Forces statement said. Earlier Sunday, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, had said that a ""serious shooting incident"" was taking place along the Israel-Lebanon border. It was not immediately clear who was shooting at whom, Andrea Treneti said then. Commanders from both sides were talking to the head of the UNIFIL mission to establish what happened. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office issued a statement deploring the shooting and calling for restraint on both sides. Israeli and Lebanese forces are cooperating in the investigation, the statement said. The soldier was shot while driving along the border near Rosh Hanikra, according to the IDF. An initial inquiry confirmed the sniper is a member of the Lebanese Armed Forces, it said, adding that further investigation is under way. According to the Lebanese National News Agency, army troops opened fire on Israeli soldiers near the border. UNIFIL has been in southern Lebanon since a 1978 conflict with Israel. After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, the peacekeepers' mandate was expanded to include helping Lebanon keep the country's south ""free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons"" other than government troops. Cross-border fire has been rare since the Israel-Hezbollah war.

"(CNN) -- A missing 17-year-old Ohio girl was found early Wednesday hiding in the attic of an apartment recently leased by her 20-year-old boyfriend, Norwalk police announced. Abbi Obermiller disappeared June 7 after trading text messages with her boyfriend that indicated the two were planning to run away together, police Sgt. Jim Fulton told CNN earlier this week. An anonymous tip alerted investigators early Wednesday to a New London apartment rented by Obermiller's boyfriend, identified by police as Robert ""Bobby"" Young, three weeks ago, according to police. Obermiller was taken to the Norwalk Police Department, where she provided the names of those who assisted her in running away and hiding her, police said. She also met briefly with her parents and grandparents before being transported to the Sandusky County Juvenile Detention Facility, police said. ""From what I'm understanding, they thought they were going to elope,"" Obermiller's father, James Obermiller, told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" on Wednesday night. ""They were going to hide out until she was 18 years old and elope and get married."" James Obermiller said he and his wife received a phone call around 4:30 Wednesday morning with the news that their daughter had been found safe. ""I don't think I've ever got out of bed that fast at 4:30 in the morning in my life,"" he told ""Nancy Grace."" Abbi Obermiller has been charged with obstructing official police business and being an unruly child. ""She's young. She's 17. She can make some mistakes and come back,"" her father told ""Nancy Grace"" of his daughter. Investigators believed Obermiller had left her grandparents' home in the early morning hours of June 7 on her own accord after uncovering a series of text messages between Obermiller and her boyfriend that appeared to coordinate when she would be picked up from the home, Fulton said. According to Fulton, Obermiller repeatedly sent messages to Young asking, ""How much longer?"" At 12:45 a.m. June 7, Young responded and told her to ""leave now,"" Fulton said. The last text message from Obermiller appeared to direct Young to her location, Fulton said. Young had denied knowledge of Obermiller's whereabouts, according to police, saying the messages were a week old and were sent over Memorial Day weekend while the couple coordinated a swimming date. However, other evidence indicated the couple were making plans to run away after Obermiller's parents expressed disapproval of their relationship, Fulton said. Young was charged June 14 with obstruction of justice in the case for his failure to cooperate in the investigation, authorities said.

"Fast cars, fast women and fast on their way to court -- it would seem some footballers are renowned as much for their pace on the pitch as for flouting the rules when it comes to the need to speed.

In April of this year, the Argentine was fined about $1,500 and told to carry out 250 hours of community service after being found guilty of driving while disqualified and without insurance. Tevez's former teammate, Samir Nasri, was also banned from driving for six months and fined $3,180 after being caught on camera exceeding the speed limit three times in 2011. Defender Micah Richards became the third Manchester City defender to be banned when his license was suspended for six months after failing to respond to two speeding notices. And it's not just the Manchester City car pool that has had problems with that thirst for speed. Benzema . In February, Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema car was clocked on a Madrid highway driving at 216 kilometers per hour -- more than double the legal limit. The Frenchman, who was driving an Audi, which is the official car sponsor of Real, was banned for eight months and fined nearly $23,000. It came after a June 2011 incident where Benzema was fined for racing in downtown Ibiza. In April, Swansea City's Kemy Agustien was banned from driving for 12 months after clocking up 39 penalty points -- 27 more than the usual limit of 12 that would get a player banned. Car sponsors are an essential aspect of the football industry but given the place footballers occupy in the hearts and minds -- and more importantly the wallets -- of the sport's paying customers it's unlikely that relationship will be ending anytime soon. ""Football is the sport that cuts through to by far the largest number of people around the world,"" a spokeswoman for Audi, which runs sponsorship deals with Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Manchester United, told CNN. ""Our experience based on our commitments with the top class European clubs tells us that there is major business potential for Audi within this sporting environment, both on a business-to-business footing and with consumers, i.e. the fans. ""Together with the teams we are conducting international activities not only in Europe but also in Asia."" Big business . It is not difficult to understand why Audi has forged such a close relationship with a number of leading teams in Europe. ""The best example of this 'internationalization' is the Audi Cup, which has been a resounding success both in terms of quantity and quality,"" added the Audi spokeswoman. ""The 2011 competition was staged in Munich, and was broadcast in 180 countries, achieving more than one billion exposures during the pre-event and post-event coverage period."" While the commercial gains are obvious, the company was also keen to point out that it would take ""necessary constructive action"" if players were found guilty of breaking motoring rules. ""Audi has sponsorship agreements with various associations and teams,"" added the spokeswoman. ""Many of these agreements also contain clauses concerning the provision of Audi vehicles. ""Of course, we work on the basis that all the drivers of these Audi vehicles will comply with existing traffic regulations. ""If this proves not to be the case, it is the responsibility of the association or team management to take the necessary corrective action."" Aura of invincibility? But it is not always easy to comply with existing traffic regulations when you have an ""aura of untouchability."" ""Players have absorbed this and, as if by osmosis, have begun to believe they are above reproach,"" Ellis Cashmore, professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University in the English Midlands, told CNN. ""Every day, they are surrounded by evidence of their immaculate status, whether in the media, or in restaurants and bars, or even just when they turn up for training where there's usually an assembly of adoring fans and obsequious journalists. ""Footballers are only doing what the likes of you, me and other consumers do all the time -- buy products that confer value on them. ""Fans buy trainers, shirts, or dogs. (yes, dogs are commodities nowadays), other people buy designer clothes, homes in desirable areas and, of course, cars."" When it comes to vehicles, added Cashmore: ""Footballers buy even more expensive cars, which tend to be faster, so tickets for speeding and parking are, in practical terms, irrelevant. ""We are all part of the same process -- buying visible status. The difference is that footballers can afford more and want their status to be not just visible but ostentatiously visible."" It's not just players either -- managers have also been in trouble, with Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson famously being absolved of any wrongdoing in October 1999 after claiming he had severe diarrhoea and needed to reach a toilet after speeding down the highway. Beckham . David Beckham was another to escape after winning an appeal against his eight-month driving ban in December 1999. Beckham claimed he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer when his Ferrari was clocked at 122 km/h in an 80 km/h zone. According to the judge, there were ""special circumstances"" which had caused Beckham to break the speed limit. Both Ferguson and Beckham were represented by attorney Nick Freeman, a man who has been nicknamed ""Mr Loophole"" after successfully getting his clients off the hook. Freeman has represented golfer Colin Montgomerie, singer Van Morrison and countless other celebrities during his time working in the business. But other football stars haven't been so lucky: . The likes of Rio Ferdinand and Jermain Defoe have also felt the force of the authorities, with both men being handed bans from driving. And Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo survived a high-speed crash in January 2011 after smashing his $303,000 Ferrari against a Manchester tunnel when he was playing for United. Balotelli . And then there's that man, Mario ""Why always me?"" Balotelli, who crashed his Bentley last April in a collision with another car. Balotelli, who now plays in Italy with Milan, paid out nearly $15,000 in parking fines and had his white Maserati impounded just the 27 times during his spell at City. And while car sponsors continue to queue up to sign marketing deals with football clubs, others within the motor industry remain concerned about the impact players flouting the law has. ""It doesn't help having someone who can have cars at the higher end of the market who is ignoring the law,"" Damien Smith, editor of Motor Sport Magazine, told CNN. ""I was surprised that Tevez wasn't given a custodial sentence and the judge didn't make an example of him."" Smith adds, however, that it's not a new phenomenon; footballers and cars have had this relationship going back to the 1970s. ""Footballer players are very rich young men who have a penchant for buying nice shiny cars and have a reputation for buying the most expensive. They're high powered and high performance cars and there will be occasions when they go too fast."" Unfortunately, it's unlikely that footballers are about to change their way. According to a survey taken in February 2011 by British insurance firm Elephant, professional football players ""are the drivers most likely to have points on their driving license for committing offenses such as speeding, running red lights and using a phone whilst driving."" After consulting data from more than over three million motorists in the UK, research showed that almost a third of football players have points on their license. Temptation . Elephant.co.uk managing director, Brian Martin, said at the time, ""Powerful cars are closely associated with the footballers' lifestyle so perhaps for some of them the temptation to speed is simply too much."" With wages at the top level still rising and punishments such as that handed out to Tevez unlikely to act as a deterrent, life in the fast lane looks set to continue for a while longer. But perhaps a sobering thought might give some football players a reason to pause and think. Courtney Meppen-Walter had the world at his feet after joining Manchester City. Now, at the age of 18, he is serving a 16-month sentence after being found guilty of causing the deaths of two people in a car crash. He admitted to causing their death by careless driving and was banned from driving for three years. Footballers may have a need for speed -- but the speed of thought might be more useful next time they consider flouting the law.","Manchester City have had three players banned for driving offenses since start of 2013 .

"Pushing her meal cart into the hospital room, a research assistant hands out tall glasses of reddish-pink liquid, along with a gentle warning: ""Remember, you guys have to finish all your Kool-Aid."" One by one, young volunteers chug down their drinks, each carefully calibrated to contain a mix of water, flavoring and a precisely calibrated solution of high fructose corn syrup: 55% fructose, 45% glucose. The participants are part of an ongoing study run by Kimber Stanhope, a nutritional biologist at the University of California, Davis.  Volunteers agree to spend several weeks as lab rats: their food carefully measured, their bodies subjected to a steady dose of scans and blood tests. At first, each volunteer receives meals with no added sugars. But then, the sweetened drinks start showing up. For the final two weeks of the study, volunteers drank three of the sweet concoctions daily -- about 500 calories of added sugar, or 25% of all calories for the adult women in the study. Within just two weeks, their blood chemistry was out of whack. In one striking change, the volunteers had elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease. While force-feeding junk food may sound extreme, this controlled diet is not so far from the real world. A 20-ounce regular soda contains 227 calories, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). That single drink is more than 10% of the total calories an adult woman needs to maintain a healthy weight, according to USDA diet guidelines. Meanwhile, about 1 in 4 Americans gets at least 200 calories a day from sugary drinks. These numbers, along with work like Stanhope's, gives ammunition to doctors and public health officials who say soda should be treated as public health enemy No. 1. ""Soft drinks and sugar-containing beverages are the low hanging fruit in public health today,"" says Dr. David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center, at Children's Hospital in Boston. ""Many children are consuming 300 calories per day or more, just in sugar-containing beverages. Compare the challenge of giving up three glasses of sugary beverages, versus getting them to do two hours of moderate physical activity."" ""If you switch from Coke to water, that's easy,"" says Elizabeth Mayer-Davis, a professor at the University of North Carolina and a recent president of the American Diabetes Association. ""You don't have to make big complicated changes in how you cook, and shop, and all that. And the number of calories you can save, can be substantial."" Related story: Are sugar substitutes worse than the real thing? Some in the soft drink business say their product has been unfairly singled out. ""Consumption of added sugars is going down,"" says Karen Hanretty, Vice-President of Public Affairs for the American Beverage Association. ""Soda consumption has declined, even as obesity has increased. To say that sugar is solely responsible for obesity, doesn't make sense."" Coca-Cola has adapted to meet consumer demand, says Rhona Applebaum, the company's Vice President and Chief Scientific Regulatory Officer. More than ever, she says, those consumers choose low-sugar products. Today, Diet Coke and Coke Zero make up 41% of Coke's North American soda sales, up from 32% a decade ago. ""Our products are part of a balanced, sensible diet, and they can be enjoyed as a valuable part of any meal, including snacks,"" says Applebaum. Buried in the flood of horror stories about America's obesity crisis, are a few hopeful signs. Not only is sugar consumption going down, but obesity rates among girls and women have actually stayed flat since 1999, according to Cynthia Ogden, a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For boys and men, those levels have increased only modestly since around 2006, Ogden says. Coincidentally or not, the leveling off of obesity coincides with a drop in the amount of soda that Americans consume. Consumption of soda -- both regular and diet -- has fallen by 17.3% since 1998, according to Beverage Digest. Eatocracy: How I kicked my Coke habit . Of course soda isn't the only concern. An 8-ounce glass of fruit punch or apple juice has nearly 130 calories. The same glass of chocolate milk has more than 200 -- a solid 20 percent of all recommended daily calories. Overall, added sugars -- which includes both natural sugar, and high fructose corn syrup -- make up about a sixth of all calories taken in, according to USDA figures. Somewhat more than a third of those sugars come from soda and other drinks. That's why most people who take a hard look at American diets say that cutting out sweetened drinks, is the first step for anyone struggling with weight or diabetes. ""If we create the assumption that doing one thing will reduce the epidemic [of obesity], we're making a mistake,"" says Dr. William Dietz, director of the CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. ""But within the dietary side, we have to focus on where the biggest action is."" The action, says Dietz and others, lies with sugar and its close cousin, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Most sweet drinks, including nearly all soda in the United States, use HFCS. Not everyone agrees they're equivalent. While most studies show that table sugar and HFCS play an equal role in weight gain, some research suggests that HFCS -- which usually contains 10% more fructose than sucrose -- is more likely to change the body's metabolism, in ways that can increase risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. But most scientists say the differences are subtle. That includes even Stanhope, whose work has focused on comparing the effects of fructose and other sugars. In terms of advising patients or making public health policy, she says, there isn't much difference. ""I think we really, at this point, need to treat them all alike."" ""Are sweetened drinks the only reason we have epidemics of obesity and diabetes? No, they're not,"" says Mayer-Davis, the past ADA president. ""But sometimes the easy answer, is the answer.""","About 1 in 4 Americans gets at least 200 calories a day from sugary drinks .

"From a famous French actor accused of relieving himself in the gangway of a cabin to a unruly passenger that to be restrained on a flight from Iceland to New York last year, bad behavior on planes comes in a variety of forms. Carriers have said they face daily issues like passengers watching pornography, throwing drinks at cabin crew or being verbally abusive. But captains and crew are often worried they could be sued for assault if they take action in response. That's why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) wants to clarify what measurements are allowed to be taken in situations that aren't a clear safety threat. Airlines have reported over 15,000 incidents to IATA since it started collecting reports of bad passenger behavior in 2007. ""It's something we need to tackle as an industry and across the globe,"" said IATA spokesperson Chris Goater. The association wants to address the issue at a diplomatic conference in Montreal in March, hoping for a global agreement on new guidelines. Golden days of flying a thing of the past . The current legislation is based on the 1963 Tokyo Convention, which governs criminal offenses that pose as serious safety threats, but ""the reality of today's industry is very different to that when the Tokyo Convention was developed,"" states IATA. Psychologist Robert Bor, who has specialized in passenger behavior and fear of flying, agrees that much has changed since the 1960s. ""In those days flying was dreamlike -- people would dress up to go traveling and the airline adverts reflected the actual experience,"" he said. Read this: How to battle the shrinking airline seat . Bor thinks the increase in air rage can be explained by more efficient reporting on one hand, but also by looking at society in general. ""It's evident that people are under a lot of pressure with their time and money,"" he said. He thinks the proposed revision of the Tokyo Convention is a step in the right direction. ""It is very important that we learn more about air range and that there is common policy between different countries about how to address it."" Stealing wine and threatening crew . But what really causes passengers to behave so badly on flights? Bor says there are many different factors coming together. ""If you look at air rage cases it's often a fairly ordinary person, and a trigger can be another person who might put their seat back, added with a bit of alcohol consumption and a fear of flying."" Another factor could be the cabin layout and the environment in the aircraft. ""We know by research that lack of space can cause stress or even anger and people can become territorial,"" said Bor. ""We might think of it as small trivial things, but actually we know that stress is cumulative."" Read this: Airlines take the pain out of boarding planes . What might be defined as rowdy passenger behavior can vary widely, and IATA has no grading system, says Goater. Many cases involve alcohol consumption, like a man reportedly stealing wine from a trolley to lock himself in the toilet to drink it. With a common policy Goater hopes passengers will then have a clear message of the consequences of acting up in the air. ""The small minority that commit unruly behavior and acts will begin to understand the serious consequences of their actions as police authorities and courts will have the necessary legal tools to deal with them in adequate manner,"" he said.","Bad passenger behavior is on the increase, according to airlines .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Marco Rubio, who is considering a presidential run, said Sunday that President Barack Obama has thrown away valuable leverage to bring about political changes in Cuba. He also took another opportunity to attack his potential opponent for the Republican presidential nomination, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who agrees with Obama's decision to switch course on Cuba. The most vocal Republican leading the fight against Obama's rapprochement with Cuba insisted again that Obama's new policy won't bring democracy to the island. ""My opposition to what the President has done is it won't do anything to further that cause (of democratization),"" Rubio said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""There has to be some reciprocal opening on their part toward democracy and there was none in this engagement."" Rubio, who is Cuban-American, also said Cuban democracy activists ""feel betrayed"" by Obama. ""He completely ignored them and threw them to the side in this whole process,"" Rubio said, adding that he would have ""actively and vibrantly engaged"" those activists if he were President. And the slugfest between Rubio and Paul continued Sunday. Just days after Rubio said Paul ""doesn't know what he's talking about,"" the Kentucky senator swung back Friday on Fox News calling Rubio's remarks ""rude and intemperate"" and suggesting Rubio was promoting ""a policy of isolationism"" toward Cuba that hasn't brought about regime change. Rubio didn't bow out on Sunday, once again aiming his arrows at Paul in a preview of what could come in an eventual Republican presidential primary bout. ""Rand Paul, if he wants to align himself and become a supporter of the Obama foreign policy, particularly toward Cuba, that's his right, he has a right to do that,"" Rubio said on Sunday. Rubio also accused Paul of becoming the ""chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy,"" on ABC's ""This Week."" That prompted Paul and his senior adviser, Doug Stafford, to fire back. ""With all due respect, Sen. Marco Rubio was captain of the GOP cheerleading team for Obama's arming of Syrian rebels, bombing Libya resulting in a jihadist wonderland and illegally giving foreign aid to Egypt's military government. The Rubio-Obama foreign policy has made the Middle East and North Africa less safe,"" Stafford said in a statement provided to CNN. Rubio has won the support of most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate, with some joining him in attacking the policy shift and others, like incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, deferring to Rubio's expertise on the subject. Defenders of Obama's decision to ease sanctions on Cuba and normalize diplomatic relations with the island nation, including Paul, have called the embargo and sanctions on Cuba a 50-year policy that has failed to provoke any political change and have pointed to U.S. decision decades ago to engage and trade with China and Vietnam. Rubio on Sunday looked to spin those examples to his advantage, saying the U.S. should ""learn our lessons from those policies,"" calling China's regime more oppressive than when the U.S. normalized relations with China in the '70s. ""Certainly the Chinese economy has grown, but politically they're more repressed than they were twenty or thirty years ago. There's no freedom of religion, no freedom of speech, no free access to the Internet, no elections, no political parties,"" Rubio said. ""So in essence, that is the model the Cubans will try to follow."" And while embracing that analogy, Rubio also dismissed a comparison between Cuba and China when prompted about whether he would end the U.S.'s trade relations with China if he became President, noting that there are ""geopolitical realities"" when it comes to the Asian power. ""My interest here is singular, and that is freedom and democracy for the people of Cuba,"" Rubio said. ""I just don't think that this policy that the President has put in place furthers that goal. In fact, I think it makes it harder to achieve."" But Rubio may not be the only Florida politican with strong views on the issue entering the 2016 GOP fray of presidential hopefuls. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, who announced this week he is ""actively"" exploring a presidential run, also slammed Obama this week for rewarding Cuba's dictators, calling it an ""ill-advised move."" And while Bush has been a mentor to the younger Rubio in many ways, Rubio said a Bush candidacy would not deter him from his own. ""Jeb if he runs will be a very credible and formidable candidate,"" said Rubio, who has not yet made a decision about running. ""When you reach a point where you're thinking about running for President -- as I am -- what you have to make your decision on is not on who else is running, it's on whether you think that's the right place for you to achieve your agenda and serve your country."" CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Sen. Marco Rubio continued to bash President Barack Obama and Sen. Rand Paul for their support of normalizing relations with Cuba .
Rubio says is Paul wants to align himself with Obama's foreign policies, ""he has a right to do that"""
"CeeLo Green, a singer who is a coach on the television singing competition ""The Voice,"" has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of giving the drug Ecstasy to a woman who also accused him of sexually assaulting her last year, according to prosecutors. But the 38-year-old Atlanta singer, who rose to worldwide fame with the hit songs ""Forget You"" and ""Crazy,"" will not face sexual assault charges after prosecutors concluded there wasn't enough evidence to take that accusation to court, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement released Monday. Green, whose real name is Thomas DeCarlo Callaway, appeared in court Monday to be arraigned on the sole charge of furnishing a controlled substance. The charge carries a potential sentence of up to four years in prison. After Green pleaded not guilty, the judge accepted prosecutors' recommendation to set his bond at $30,000 and ordered him to return to court on November 20. ""Are you relieved?"" a reporter asked him before his arraignment. The singer-songwriter nodded yes. ""Are you scared?"" the reporter asked.  ""No,"" Green replied. According to prosecutors, Green slipped the drug to a 33-year-old woman while they were having dinner on July 13 or July 14, 2012. They later went back to her hotel, prosecutors said. The woman accused Green of sexually assaulting her at the Luxe Hotel after their dinner together, CNN affiliate KTLA reported, citing a Los Angeles Police Department statement. The Los Angeles Times reported the woman said she woke up naked in bed with Green in her room. But in their statement Monday, prosecutors said they had declined to file a charge of rape of an intoxicated person, citing insufficient evidence. Green ""will responsibly address"" the drug charge in court and is pleased prosecutors decided not to proceed with the sex assault charge, his attorney, Blair Berk, said in a statement issued Monday. ""Mr. Green encouraged a full and complete investigation of those claims, and he was confident once conducted, he would be cleared of having any wrongful intent and it would be established that any relations were consensual,"" Berk said. ""CeeLo had faith that if the true facts were known, the district attorney would reject those charges."" She said the decision by prosecutors showed that ""the evidence did not support the false and unfounded claims made over a year ago."" NBC declined to comment on Green's future with the show, a singing competition that involves teams of aspiring artists mentored by one of four coaches, one of whom is Green. It is currently airing taped episodes, the latest of which aired Monday night. The show, now in its fifth season, has been among NBC's most popular programs. Aside from football programming, the show was NBC's best-rated show in 2012, according to Nielsen. It ranked No. 6, with more than 14 million viewers for its October 3 episode, the ratings company said. Green began his music career as a member of the Southern hip-hop group Goodie Mob. He later became part of the duo Gnarls Barkley, whose 2006 song ""Crazy"" became a worldwide hit. Four years later, he recorded ""Forget You,"" which achieved similar success. His work has netted him five Grammys and numerous other awards.","CeeLo Green pleads not guilty to drug charge .

"The intercepted al Qaeda communications that sparked the closure of U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa contained specific words that American intelligence interpreted as a coded message for what they believed signaled a potentially imminent attack, CNN has learned. The coded words directly pointed to the likelihood of a significant al Qaeda attack against an overseas U.S. installation, according to a U.S. source familiar with the latest intelligence. However, the words did not give clues as to a specific location or target, which is what led to closing nearly two dozen embassies and other diplomatic facilities deemed to possibly be at risk. The U.S. intelligence community had been monitoring al Qaeda communications regularly, but was especially concerned about three intercepts. The first was from Nasser al-Wuyhashi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, outlining a possible attack. Another was Ayman al-Zawahiri's response to that from his position as leader of the global al Qaeda movement. Two weeks earlier, the United States had also monitored a communication from Zawahiri appointing al-Wuyhashi as his deputy. Bergen: What's behind timing of terror threat . A U.S. official declined to discuss specific code words on the intercepts but told CNN ""there was a sense of imminence, a sense of the overall area at risk and the known actors. There was great concern."" Members of Congress have indicated that National Security Agency surveillance programs played a role in intercepting and monitoring recent al Qaeda communications. The programs were defended by Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday. ""A number of groups in the world have individually targeted not just American interests but free interests in the world,"" Kerry said during press conference in Brasilia, Brazil. ""There have been bombings in many places in the world. Innocent people have lost their lives. And what the United States has been trying to do is prevent these things from happening beforehand by knowing what others might be plotting."" Separately, a Yemeni official told CNN that a recent drone strike did not injure suspected AQAP bombmaker Ibrahim al-Asiri contrary to an earlier Yemeni news agency report that said he might have been hurt. Three suspects on Yemen's list of its 25 most-wanted terrorists have been captured and two others killed recently, according to the official. It is not clear if those outcomes were the result of drone strikes or other operations.","Source: Officials believed intercepts indicated potentially imminent attack .

"Nearly 21 million people watched ""Blackfish"" when it aired on CNN in October. The documentary, produced by Magnolia Pictures and acquired by CNN Films, recounts the 2010 death of veteran SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a killer whale named Tilikum, a 12,000-pound bull. The film challenges the concept of keeping killer whales for entertainment and implies Tilikum had been driven to madness by captivity. In the months since, a firestorm of debate over the controversy erupted. Social media exploded with an outcry to boycott SeaWorld, the world's largest marine park operator. Protesters not only lined the streets outside SeaWorld Orlando in Florida, the company's flagship park, but the streets of New York and Pasadena during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rose Parade. Southwest Airlines, which owns a plane with a killer whale painted on it, also received a taste of the ""Blackfish"" backlash. A handful of protesters presented a petition to an airline spokeswoman asking it to end its business relationship with SeaWorld. Southwest responded in a statement it was not contemplating changes to its multi-year contract with the entertainment company. Perhaps the largest fallout was in the form of a virtual cavalcade of musicians backing out of SeaWorld's ""Bands, Brew & BBQ"" concert series. Willie Nelson, Trace Adkins, Trisha Yearwood and Joan Jett are among those who declined to perform at the theme park over the controversy. SeaWorld has battled back against the claims ""Blackfish"" makes, calling the film grossly one-sided and the product of animal activists. The company has declined CNN's repeated requests for interviews, but has responded to written inquiries. ""Blackfish is billed as a documentary, but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject, the film is inaccurate and misleading and, regrettably, exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for Dawn Brancheau's family, friends and colleagues,"" SeaWorld said in a statement. ""To promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting, the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts about SeaWorld -- among them, that SeaWorld is one of the world's most respected zoological institutions, that SeaWorld rescues, rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year, and that SeaWorld commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research."" In January, Brancheau's family distanced themselves from the documentary. ""Blackfish is not Dawn's story. Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. Dawn followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer. She loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer,"" a statement on a charity website dedicated to the slain trainer said. ""Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for. Trainer safety was important to Dawn, and it remains important to us as well. Our family always supported Dawn and we continue to support Dawn's friends and co-workers who currently care for the animals she so loved."" Former killer whale trainer Mark Simmons appeared in ""Blackfish,"" but after its airings has gone on to become one of the film's most outspoken critics. ""SeaWorld has exemplified the best in care of their animals and personnel for nearly six decades,"" Simmons said. ""The Blackfish crusade against SeaWorld and zoological care in general is engineered by a perfect marriage between sensational animal rights organizations and disgruntled ex-SeaWorld employees."" Meantime, the marine park giant announced record fourth-quarter results and record annual revenue results in January, indicating there appears to be no real impact on its business. But some animal activists say behind the scenes, SeaWorld is worried. The company launched expensive full-page ads in America's top newspapers and local publications where its parks are located. A promoted link at the top of a Google search takes Internet users to a section within SeaWorld's website called, ""The truth about Blackfish."" Others have even suggested recent financial moves hint of trouble. In December, SeaWorld's largest investor, the Blackstone Group, sold its majority ownership the month before SeaWorld's own chairman sold more than a million dollars' worth of his SeaWorld stock. Financial analysts cautioned that both cases may be routine investment transactions and not an indicator of any concerns. Last weekend, SeaWorld kicked off its concert series with Kid Rock and Alan Jackson, and despite the protests outside — inside, the crowd was robust. The next scheduled acts, Gretchen Wilson and Bill Engvall, are also expected to perform before an at-capacity crowd, the company said. The show, much like the debate Blackfish continues to spark, goes on.","""Blackfish"" tells the story of a SeaWorld trainer who died in 2010 .

The former Senate majority leader broke several ribs and bones in his face and was also diagnosed with a concussion, his office said after the accident.

"A scenic fall tour turned into a nightmare ride for passengers in northwest Arkansas on Thursday after a freight train and a passenger train collision left dozens injured. The six crew members and 38 passengers aboard were all injured, according to the Arkansas Missouri Railroad Police. The passenger train is operated by the Arkansas and Missouri Railroad, said Ron Sparks, the railroad's police chief. The train departed from Springdale, Arkansas, and was headed to Van Buren to take passengers on a fall foliage excursion. The trains collided Thursday morning when the passenger train stalled on a small grade, apparently because of excess leaves on the track, according to police. ""We called for another locomotive to come help,"" said Sparks. ""Somehow there was miscommunication on the passenger train's position, and the locomotive rounded the curve and crashed into the passenger train,"" added Sparks. ""It's a pretty rural area, we had to park in woods, and wade through a river to get the passengers, using four-wheelers to pull them out."" One of the train's conductors fractured his ankle and back and was evacuated to the hospital, said Sparks. Local fire and police emergency responders remain on the scene, according to local police. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to the site of the crash Thursday evening to investigate.","A freight train and passenger train collide in northwest Arkansas .

"Washington (CNN)Groups urging Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016 are kicking off their New Hampshire organizing efforts with a rally on Saturday in Manchester. MoveOn.org and Democracy for America, two liberal groups urging the progressive senator to run, are dispatching grassroots organizers to the first-in-the-nation primary state this week with the goal of encouraging local volunteers, politicians and activists to help convince Warren she needs to run for president. ""Our folks on the ground are going to reach out to the really strong activist community that exists in New Hampshire,"" said Neil Sroka, Democracy for America's spokesman. ""We want to show Elizabeth Warren that if she decided to get into the race, there is a strong grassroots army ready to do everything a candidate needs to run a competitive race in the Granite State."" Saturday will make the start of these efforts. Leaders from Democracy for America, MoveOn.org and other progressive come together for their first meeting in New Hampshire, with the goal of charting next steps in convincing Warren to run. Those steps are likely to include opening offices across the state and dispatching more organizers in the coming months. The ""Run Warren Run"" efforts, which launched late last year, have so far picked up over 200,000 supporters across the country. While they aren't alone -- groups like super PAC Ready for Warren have been organizing around a possible Warren run since early last year -- the coalition of MoveOn and DFA has been some of the most organized work around the senator. That said, the efforts have so far not moved the Massachusetts senator to make a run at the presidency and, in some respects, Warren has moved further away from a run. In an interview published by Fortune Magazine on Tuesday, Warren was asked by former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair whether if she will run for president. ""No,"" the Massachusetts senator flatly said. That is new, given the senator has repeatedly knocked down presidential speculation by simply saying, ""I am not running for president."" The denial is in present tense, meaning Warren wasn't running for president at this moment. When some reporters pressed her on this, Warren would just repeat, ""I am not running for president."" If she does decide to run, though, she wouldn't be the first politician to change their mind on a presidential bid. Warren outlined her liberal economic agenda earlier this month in a campaign-style speech that electrified liberal and labor organizers in the audience. ""For more than 30 years, too many politicians in Washington have made deliberate choices that favored those with money and power,"" she told the AFL-CIO audience. ""And the consequence is that instead of an economy that works well for everyone, America now has an economy that works well for about 10 percent of the people."" RELATED: AFL-CIO president trumpets Warren, calls for Dems to pick sides on labor issues in 2015 . Speeches like that, Sroka said, have made the liberal organizers more upbeat about their plans. Their view is that if more people saw Warren speak, they would be convinced to support her. ""We have watched very, very closely,"" the organizer said of Warren's speeches. ""What you saw there was a senator and frankly a potential presidential candidate speaking out for million of Americans who are struggling to get by and laying out a popular progressive economic message for the country."" He concluded, ""That is the kind of speech a presidential candidate might make.""","Pro-Warren liberal groups will start their New Hampshire organizing efforts with a rally on Saturday in Manchester .

"The number of aircraft near misses more than doubled last year, but U.S. aviation officials tied the increase to new systems that report mistakes not caught previously. There were 4,394 cases in which planes came too close to one another in the year ending September 1, 2012 -- up from 1,895 the year before, the Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday. Forty-one events were characterized as ""high-risk events."" None resulted in accidents. The FAA had predicted an increase as it phased in a program to monitor radar and automatically report problems. The agency says it is a victim of its own success. With commercial aircraft accidents  rare -- or non-existent in some recent years -- it is difficult to use accident data to identify trends. So the FAA has placed a greater emphasis on looking at ""precursors"" to accidents, such as ""loss of separation"" events in which aircraft come closer together than intended. ""We are covering electronically and identifying things that we never did before,"" said one FAA official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 4,394 ""losses of separation"" in 2012 occurred during 132 million take-offs and landings. Put another way, that's 3.3 incidents per 100,000 operations, the FAA said. ""If you want a measure of safety, that's the number,"" the official said. FAA has various separation standards, depending on air space and aircraft. At high altitudes, planes should be separated by at least five miles horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically. Nearer to airports, planes can be closer together. The agency said it has worked with its workforce and the controllers' union to change the safety culture of the agency -- emphasizing collection of data over punishment. Under the new non-punitive reporting system, controllers are encouraged to voluntarily report mistakes and problems. It has buttressed that with an automated system that monitors air traffic, reporting problems to headquarters without any influence from the local facility. As a result of five different reporting systems, the number of reports grew 10-fold in 2012. Officials said the new system makes comparisons with previous years misleading. Information collected in 2012 and 2013 will create a new baseline for meaningful comparisons in the future. Of the 4,394 ""loss of separation"" incidents, the FAA said 1,271 involved cases where the planes came 34 percent closer than allowed. Of those, it characterized 1,048 as ""low risk"" events, 182 as ""medium risk,"" and 41 as ""high risk.""","FAA says year-over-year increase due to better reporting .

"Rio will be the first city in South America to host the Olympics in its history -- a shift of axis that makes sense in the new world politics. I hope this change is not only geographical and that we can make a memorable event. In terms of organization, despite potential problems in the structure of airports and public transportation systems, everything should come out satisfactorily. Rio de Janeiro has hosted other major world events, and after hosting the World Cup in 2014 it will be prepared. The question that arises is: How do we want to show Brazil to the world? Internally, this debate promises to be very lively. Brazil measures progress by the growth of GDP -- an index that is questionable to evaluate the progress of a country -- but as this is the current view, I think many here would like to take advantage of the visibility of the Games to show the world how our agriculture has become one of the most productive and advanced in the world, to show our energetic potential or the strength of our internal market that makes us more immune to global economic crisis. Eyes turn to Rio's preparations . There are groups in Brazil that sees the Olympic Games in Rio as an opportunity to do more business. I'm sure there are government sectors who also wish to use the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games to reinforce these points... but our internal achievements do not interest the rest of the world. What sets us apart, and should be the center of attention, not only in the opening ceremony but during all the Olympics, is our natural resources and the importance they have for the world. Forest still covers 68% of Brazil's vast territory. The Amazon represents over half of the world's remaining rainforest. We know that these rainforests play a crucial role for global biodiversity conservation and a valuable freshwater resource, but also provide essential ecological services such as a carbon sink. That is why we call it the lungs of the world and we know how it is increasingly critical to the fragile balance of the planet's climate. Rio mayor: How to build the city of the future . At a time when the world sees the verge of a collapse in it's natural resources, food security and survival of hundreds of millions of people who are threatened by lack of water and oceanic resources depleting, the Rio Games are the perfect platform to expose that we urgently need to change our consumption patterns and our way of life if we want a future for our grandchildren. The true Olympic spirit is to bring together all countries and all people for a common goal. In other Games, host cities have reinforced the importance of peace, of economic development, and praised technology or human values. I think right now what matters most to the entire planet is the question of the survival of our species. Rio de Janeiro with its forests and impressive nature seems to be the ideal stage to do it. It could be the Olympics of the future -- a real planetary event.","Fernando Meirelles says the Rio Games will be an opportunity to show Brazil's energetic potential .

"From samba and carnival to food, music and religion, African culture is everywhere in Brazil. The cultural heritage stems from the estimated four million slaves who were brought to the country over a 300-year period, at least four times as many as to the United States. Brazil was the last country to abolish the slave trade in 1888. More than half of Brazilians now identify themselves as black or of mixed race, according to the latest census. Rio de Janeiro now has the most famous carnival in the world, attracting an estimated 1.1 million visitors to the city this year and with 5.3 million people taking part in street parties, according to the English language newspaper The Rio Times. Carnival, which is celebrated across Brazil, combines samba -- music and dance which grew out of Brazil's black neighborhoods -- and the Catholic tradition of celebrating the run-up to Lent brought by Portuguese colonialists. After the abolition of slavery, the rituals of the Catholic former colonialists and their former slaves merged to form the origins of modern carnival, according to the Rio Times. Mixing sushi and samba - meet the Japanese Brazilians . One explanation for the origins of carnival is that it began in a Catholic church, Our Lady of the Rosary, built by slaves in the 1700s whose masters wanted them to convert to Catholicism. ""The black people that were part of this congregation, most of them came from Congo,"" said Joao Carlos Desales, a tour guide who took CNN around Rio de Janeiro. ""So they were able to organize a celebration where they would choose a man and a woman, and they would be the king and queen of Congo. That celebration turned out to be the beginning of carnival celebrated in Brazil."" Even many of Brazil's Catholic saints are said to have African heritage. St Benedict, whose name is remembered in Our Lady of the Rosary church, was a slave from North Africa, who promised to devote himself to Catholicism if he became a free man, Desales said. Brazil's patron saint, Our Lady of Aparecida, a black clay statue of the Virgin Mary, was -- according to some -- found by runaway slaves on their way to Quilombo, a community of runaway slaves. Quilombo communities continue across Brazil to this day. Luis Sacopa, president of the association of Quilombos, runs a restaurant with his 17 members of his family in a piece of jungle in what is now an expensive suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His grandparents found this piece of land after escaping slavery. The family has fought a legal battle to hold on to its land against the threat of eviction, and now has official protection for their right to remain. ""Thanks to god we have had success and we're still here at the end of our dispute,"" said Sacopa. ""Thanks to god, the family has united, we're fighting and we're winning the fight against the elite in this expensive neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro."" Sacopa said he was able to resist eviction with the help of his Orixas, gods of the Yoruba people of Southwest Nigeria, Benin and Togo. In Brazil, the religion is known as Candomble, and it has a large following in some Afro-Brazilian areas, particularly Salvador in Bahia state. Also on Inside Africa: Why Tanzanians believe in witchcraft . Candomble was prohibited in Brazil up until the 1950s, but influenced much of the country's food and music. In Sacopa's restaurant he serves feijoada, a typical Brazilian dish originally created by slaves from their masters' leftovers. A new Historical Circuit of African Heritage opened in Rio de Janeiro in 2010 to help tourists and descendants of slaves reconnect with the past slavery. The project began after workers installing a new drainage system in the central districts of Saude and Gamboa discovered hundreds of personal objects belonging to African slaves, according to the Rio Times. Archaeologists established that this was the site of the 19th century slave trading complex, the Cais do Valongo, or Valongo Quays. Many of the discoveries are now on display in the Valongo Gardens, the newspaper reported. Another discovery of recent years is the remains of a squalid slave cemetery in the courtyard of a home in central Rio de Janeiro. Renaldo Tavares, an archeologist who has been studying the discovery, said: ""These are human remains mixed in with the garbage from the city. It shows how society in the 19th century treated slaves. ""Bones, pieces of ceramic, bits from construction, tiles, animal remains, bits of food, society threw all sorts of things in here. Slaves were considered garbage by society."" Ana de la Merced Guimaraes, the homeowner who discovered the bones in her courtyard, said: ""When we started a reform in our house, we found all these bones. We thought it was a family grave, but there was so much we thought maybe it had been a serial killer. ""But then we calmed down and talked about it and called a lawyer and the police. And he said don't worry, we aren't going to accuse you, it's probably something very old. ""A neighbor told us, a long time ago, your street was a slave cemetery."" Brazil's third city Salvador, in Bahia state, northeast Brazil, has some of the strongest links to Africa. Salvador was the first colonial capital of Brazil and its central district, Pelourinho, now a UNESCO world heritage site, was the New World's first slave market from 1553, according to UNESCO.","African culture is evident in Brazil's carnival, music, dance food and religion .

"The hi-tech listening post Russia used to spy on the United States from Cuba may once again gather intelligence, according to a Russian newspaper report. The Kommersant business daily on Wednesday said the Lourdes signals intelligence facility, which was mothballed in 2001, would reopen as part of a deal struck by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban President Raul Castro. Putin visited Cuba on Friday to strengthen ties with the island and lauded a recent deal that forgave over $30 billion in Soviet-era debt that Cuba still owed its former communist ally. During the daylong visit to Cuba, Putin and Raul Castro announced agreements on a wide variety of issues, including a pact to safeguard each country's national security. Cuban and Russian officials and a U.S. State Department spokeswoman would not comment on the report of the reopening of the base. If Lourdes reopens, it is not clear how soon the defunct facility will again be operational or how much Russia would pay to be able to monitor U.S. telecommunications from Cuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia paid a reported $200 million each year to maintain Lourdes. When the facility was closed in 2001, it further strained Russian and Cuban relations. Part of the sprawling facility has been turned into a computer science university, but many of the Soviet-era buildings have fallen into disrepair. Trees and bushes have grown around collapsed buildings and goats hunting for food wander around the once top secret and tightly guarded facility. A university official who only gave his name as Benjamin said he doubted Russia could restore Lourdes to its role as a cutting edge listening post just off U.S. shores. ""Look around here,"" he said, gesturing at the mounds of rubble and trash, ""Not even in their dreams.""","Lourdes signals intelligence facility in Cuba to reopen, Russian paper says .

"Republicans who want to taint Hillary Clinton are going to lengths to link the former secretary of state with President Barack Obama and his sagging poll numbers. Throughout the party's infrastructure, Republicans say that linking Clinton with Obama, especially labeling her possible 2016 campaign as ""Obama's Third Term,"" is the most potent attack. America Rising, an anti-Clinton super PAC that has looked to define the former first lady for the better part of a year, will push out a series of talking points giving Clinton the third-term label, and the group plans to fundraise off the push staring Tuesday. ""Hillary Clinton has a Barack Obama problem,"" reads a lengthy research document that will go out to GOP pundits, strategists, conservative organizations and media members Tuesday. ""No matter how many of her advisors whisper to reporters that she's different from Barack Obama, Americans still know who she is: Barack Obama Part Deux."" The document lists ""10 Reasons Why Clinton 2016 = Obama's Third Term,"" including her praise for Obama as she left the State Department in 2013, her role in his first four years of foreign policy and Clinton's support of Obamacare. ""Looking ahead to 2016, it's critical that Obama's 3rd Term is an element of the broader narrative defining Sec. Clinton, especially since she still has a higher approval than he does,"" Tim Miller, the group's director, said in a statement to CNN. Multiple Republican operatives said this strategy -- which is coming from national party groups, outside super PACs and GOP politicians -- is best at engaging the base and raising money. Therefore, it is something they plan to continue in the coming months and possibly years. Democrats, too, are concerned about the attack line. In August, some close to Clinton told CNN that labeling the former secretary of state as the successor to Obama's legacy was a possible problem. ""She was in his government, she was at his side,"" said one source. ""That is, the way to go after her is four more years of the same old thing. The question they should ask her is 'Tell me 10 things that you disagree with him on.' "" Republican lawmakers -- including those who may challenge Clinton in 2016 -- have been quick to use some variation of Obama-Clinton in speeches, statements and interviews. Hillary Clinton's fall to-do list . Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been the most strident in linking Obama and Clinton, a tactic he first used after the former secretary of state headlined a CNN town hall in June. ""The most consistent error of the Clinton/Obama foreign policy is a failure to understand the nature of the people we're dealing with, of our enemies,"" Cruz said in an interview with CNN after the event. According to a senior Cruz aide, the attack engages the senator's base and is something Cruz plans to use again. ""His mindset is it is not just Obama's failed policies, it is all of them,"" the aide said. ""We want to draw attention to the fact that she owns  this foreign policy and she is not speaking. She is supposed to be the leader, especially on foreign policy, and she is saying nothing. She has a voice, she doesn't use it."" Sens. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, too, have been linking the two. In an op-ed earlier this month, Rubio called for voters to reject the ""the veiled isolationism of Obama and Clinton,"" and Paul has looked to link the two on issues including terrorism and Syria. For her part, Clinton has both distanced herself from Obama and drawn closer to him. In her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton distanced herself from Obama on Syria and did so again in a much-talked-about interview with The Atlantic. But the former secretary of state has also heralded Obama, like in Iowa this month when she touted his handling of economic issues as getting the country ""on the road to recovery."" This is a common refrain for Clinton. At the Brookings Institution this month, she touted Obama's ""extraordinary leadership,"" adding ""thanks to the economic policies that were pursued by the President and endorsed by the Congress ... we are in a much stronger economic position than we were."" Whether she will continue this trend of heralding Obama while also distancing herself depends, according to former aides. Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and Al Gore's 2000 campaign manager, said whether or not Clinton needs to break with Obama ""all depends on the political climate and environment in mid-2015 to 2016."" ""In 2000, I had to answer this question,"" she said. ""And the answer is always the same. Each year is different and every candidate must make his or her case to the voter of why they represent someone else.""","Republicans seeking to taint Hillary Clinton want to tie her to Barack Obama .

"It's not easy being a female entrepreneur in a country where women need a male guardian's permission to work, rent property or travel. Yet in Saudi Arabia, a small but determined number of women are overcoming these obstacles to build their own thriving businesses. Social constraints in the conservative Kingdom have not stopped women from amassing substantial individual wealth. An estimated $11.9 billion is held by women primarily in bonds and bank accounts, according to asset managers Al Masah Capital. As it seeks to hedge against its overdependence on oil, there is increasing government recognition that women have a part to play in Saudi's economic development. It has led to a moderate winding back of restrictions on women in the Kingdom smoothing the way for a new generation of young entrepreneurs, like Maria Mahdaly. In 2007, aged 19, she started Rumman (Pomegranate, in English), a media and publishing house in Jeddah, with Enas Hashani and Bayan  Abuzinadah. The company runs two ventures: A monthly city magazine with a circulation of 70,000, called Destination Jeddah, and a social network called Fainak (Where Are You, in English). By 2010, Rumman was ranked as Saudi Arabia's fastest growing start-up, with a growth rate of nearly 600%, by the AllWorld Network, which produces rankings of private growth companies in emerging economies around the world. Meet Fortune 500's female powerbrokers . In the short life of her business, Mahdaly has experienced several legislative changes. Last year, King Abdullah signaled that women will have the right to run and vote in the 2015 local elections, and be appointed to the Shura Council, the most influential political body in the country. He has since allowed women to work in lingerie shops and enter sports stadiums. In May, King Abdullah dismissed his ultraconservative adviser Sheik Abdul-Mohsen al-Obeikan after he publicly criticized reforms aimed at softening restrictions on women. Mahdaly feels that she is benefiting from changing attitudes: ""We get a lot of support from other business, the media and individuals in general,"" she said. ""King Abdullah (has) opened many doors to women and he keeps on doing so against all the cultural pressure he faces."" Mahdaly's staff is 80% female, but she says that even managing older males, she hasn't encountered any difficulties. ""I never felt any resentment or problems with them,"" she said. ""Mind you, I was very tough and strict."" It was not always as easy for previous generations. Recent research on the experiences of women entrepreneurs in the kingdom reveals the novel measures Saudi women have resorted to -- sometimes devious, sometimes desperate -- in order to pursue their goals as independent businesswomen. University of Aberdeen doctoral candidate Sophie Alkhaled, who grew up in Saudi Arabia, conducted in-depth interviews with 13 female Saudi entrepreneurs to explore the strategies they used to work around cultural restrictions on women in the Islamic kingdom. Through interviews with women working in professions like healthcare, fashion and PR over two decades, Alkhaled found that, while Saudi women were increasingly encouraged to enter the world of commerce, entrepreneurial activity was largely confined  to women who were already independently wealthy. Want more female execs? Sort out the household chores . But wealthy women still face many obstacles, says Alkhaled. They must be able to afford childcare and drivers, have access to start-up capital through family connections as well as having the means to buy commercial property, which they are legally forbidden from renting. Women registering a business that serves both sexes must employ a male manager, so many female entrepreneurs would nominate a father or brother even though, in reality, they continued to control the business, she said. This left them open to exploitation, according to Alkhaled. She recounts the story of a healthcare business owner she interviewed who had her permission to travel rescinded by her ""jealous"" husband. Unwilling to divorce for fear of losing her children, the entrepreneur began paying her husband for his permission to travel, said Alkhaled. Other women have been more confrontational in the face of obstacles: One entrepreneur, who had started a business in 1990, lost her temper when confronted with a ""No Women Allowed"" sign in a government department, and ripped the sign off the door. She was helped by a sympathetic manager, but Alkhaled observes, ""Sometimes it's just you and your luck; it's who you meet on the day. That's what the women are facing."" Alkhaled notes that, although many of the entrepreneurs she had interviewed felt ""empowered"" by their business experience, and were motivated by a desire for gradual social change, they expressed respect for their society's traditions. ""They don't want to challenge the religious side of it. They just want their right to live and work in society. They're not looking to fight the conservatives on their views. The women also felt a patriotic pride in Saudi Arabia, despite the obstacles they had encountered. ""All the women said, 'If I had to pick up my business and put it anywhere else in the world tomorrow, I would flatly refuse,'"" Alkhaled said. ""Saudi Arabia is quite a new country and they really want a hand in building it."" Mahdaly says she is also patriotic. But adds, ""one day we would like to expand our operation globally.""","Although they can't yet drive, some Saudi women have started successful enterprises .

"Few would say Cuba is an easy place to do business, but a new law aimed at bringing pep to an anemic economy may lure more foreign investors. Cuban lawmakers Saturday approved an international investment measure. Vice President Marino Murillo Jorge, the economy czar, said that while Cuba would open further to investment, the government would retain a strong hand in dealing with investors. ""The state will always be a participant to avoid the concentration of property,"" Murillo said in televised remarks Saturday. According to state media reports, 576 members of Cuba's National Assembly gathered for a special session to consider the international investment law. Officials said greater international investment was necessary to expand the island's stagnant economy, which grew at 2.7% last year, below official predictions. Cuban officials say the country needs to grow at 7% annually in order to sufficiently expand the economy. Members of the international media were not given access to the session. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba allowed private enterprise and international investment, which had been forbidden shortly after the 1959 revolution that swept Fidel Castro to power. But the return of capitalism to the island has had mixed results, with dozens of international investors arrested in corruption probes and others leaving the island frustrated over the endless red tape and lack of governmental protections for private industry. The new law would lower taxes on international investors and remove some of the entrenched bureaucracy and lack of transparency that is part of doing business with the island's communist-style centralized economy. ""[The investment law] will attract foreign capital with clear rules and respect national sovereignty in a mutually beneficial way,"" said External Trade Minister Ricardo Malmierca, according to the state-run website Cubadebate. Maintaining strong controls . Cuban president Raul Castro was seen in photographs the government released voting in favor of the measure. Full details of the new law will not be published for another 90 days, state media said. The law would permit investment in all area of the Cuban economy except for health care and education, according to state media reports. But all international investment still would need approval from government officials. However, officials promised the approved law would speed up the approval process for new investments. Government-controlled media reported that several forms of investment would be permitted, including enterprises wholly owned by international investors. However, in practice, the Cuban government only permits international investors to hold minority interests in joint ventures with the government. The new law is meant for international investors only and does not apply to Cubans, who the government does not permit to form companies and make large-scale investments on the island. However, during the discussion of the law Saturday, External Trade Minister Malmierca said Cuban exiles might be allowed to invest in the country they had left. ""As long as it involves people who do not have adverse positions to the revolution and are not part of the Miami terrorist mafia,"" he said using a term commonly used by Cuban government officials refer to exiles who are in opposition to the island's single party form of government. The five-decades-old U.S. trade embargo forbids most forms of commerce between American companies and Cuba.","Cuban lawmakers approve foreign investment law .

In a letter to the Obama-appointed U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske on Friday, Sen. Jon Cornyn and Rep. Michael McCaul requested that Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport are added to the list of locations where heightened screening of travelers is conducted. Changes coming to U.S. airports . ""Because those traveling from Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia can transit to the United States from many other countries, we have concerns that the current decision to screen only at five airports may not adequately protect Americans and others traveling to America from the Ebola virus,"" the lawmakers said in their letter, which also points out that a combined 15.6 million international travelers moved through the two Texas airports in 2013. Latest Ebola developments . The letter also raises broader questions about the government's response to preventing the spread of Ebola -- namely, the number of people from Ebola-affected countries entering the U.S. via sea or land, who wouldn't be screened at airport security checkpoints. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? ""What other Ebola-related measures are being taken at other vulnerable port environments, particularly at high traffic land border ports of entry along the Texas-Mexico border?"" the politicians write in their letter. ""If none, why?"" CDC director on Ebola: 'Only thing like this has been AIDS' This isn't the first time lawmakers on Capitol Hill have clamored for more action from the Obama administration on the Ebola crisis.

"(CNN)She isn't forgotten but it's safe to say that Victoria Azarenka hasn't been in tennis' spotlight in the last year. Azarenka only played 15 matches in 2014 after last year's Australian Open thanks to injuries to both feet and a right knee. And unsurprisingly, her ranking has tumbled from No. 2 to outside the top 40. Twice a champion in Melbourne, the 25-year-old entered her first-round encounter against Sloane Stephens unseeded. Stephens has also seen better days, including in 2013 when the pair met not in the first round but in the semifinals at the year's opening major. It was perhaps the most enticing first-round tussle of the tournament but Azarenka ensured the hype bettered the actual match as she eased past the American -- whose tag of next-big-thing in women's tennis isn't yet materializing -- 6-3 6-2 in 75 minutes. Azarenka won't be in the shadows much longer if she can replicate Tuesday's performance. ""From the beginning I started to be pretty focused and just maintained that intensity,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""So that was a good opportunity to just really at the beginning take my chances because she's the kind of player that likes to take her chances. ""There is a lot to build from here."" Indeed Azarenka can take heart from her display but she knows she won't have much time to dwell on it, since her second-round foe is longtime pal and U.S. Open finalist Caroline Wozniacki. The Dane upended another young American, Taylor Townsend, 7-6 (7-2) 6-2. ""Being an unseeded player, it's not a surprise that I have a tough draw or tough opponents in the early round,"" said Azarenka. ""I just need to go through that. I accept the challenges. ""She was showing some great tennis in the end of last year. I know she's very dangerous. We always had some of tough matches. I would like to focus on myself and what I can do to build my game, to prepare as best as I can, and just compete. ""That's my key word for this tournament: Compete."" Besides being former No. 1 players, Azarenka and Wozniacki share another thing in common -- going through high-profile splits last year. Whereas Wozniacki and golfer Rory McIlroy broke up, Azarenka and artist Redfoo went their separate ways. Azarenka trails Wozniacki 4-3 in their head-to-heads, although they've only played one full match since 2010, a victory for the Belorussian in Cincinnati in 2013. ""It's going to be tough,"" Wozniacki said. ""She's won here before. Not the easiest on paper. ""But at the same time I'm just going to focus on myself, my own game. Honestly whether you have to beat her in the second round or fourth round, whatever, doesn't matter if you want to win the tournament."" Women's top-seed Serena Williams began with a 6-0 6-4 win over Belgium's Alison van Uytvanck -- escaping a 0-30 hole on serve at 4-4 in the second set -- and reigning Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova eliminated Dutch qualifier Richel Hogenkamp 6-1 6-4. Kvitova was relieved, since she fell to an outsider in the first round last year. ""I'm glad that I did better than last year,"" Kvitova told reporters. ""Of course, I mean, the nerves were there. ""During all match, I was still feeling the tightness and the legs were suddenly so heavy and I couldn't really move. It was difficult, but I'm glad I did it. That's important."" Wawrinka, Djokovic move on . On paper, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and defending champion Stan Wawrinka are due to meet in the semifinals, and both began with three-set wins. Wawrinka, who stunned Djokovic last year on the way to opening his grand slam account, routed Turkey's Marsel Ilhan 6-1 6-4 6-2 while Djokovic defeated Slovenia's Aljaz Bedene -- a runner-up to Wawrinka in Chennai this month -- 6-3 6-2 6-4 after a slow start. ""I was happy to be back on the court,"" Wawrinka told reporters. ""I can feel that I have a lot of support here, and it's always nice to come back like that and to feel the crowd behind you. ""For sure it's great, but it's still the beginning of the tournament. First round. It's just one match, now I need to be ready for the next one."" U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori, meanwhile, downed 2013 quarterfinalist Nicolas Almagro of Spain 6-4 7-6 (1) 6-2. Almagro, whose ranking has plummeted from the top 15 because of foot and shoulder injuries, hit 50 unforced errors. Home fans had plenty of reason to cheer Monday after the likes of Thanasi Kokkinakis, Nick Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic and Jarmila Gajdosova won, and Tuesday brought more success. Australia's top-ranked player, Samantha Stosur -- who has struggled at the Australian Open -- beat Romania's Monica Niculescu 6-4 6-1, with Lleyton Hewitt getting the better of China's Zhang Ze 6-3 1-6 6-0 6-4. Hewitt, 33, set a tournament record when he stepped on court, making his 19th straight appearance. He continues to play tennis in the aftermath of several serious injuries.","Victoria Azarenka crushes Sloane Stephens in Melbourne .

"The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Floyd Corkins has said he disagreed with the Family Research Council's stance against gay marriage. The shooting took place at the conservative policy group's office in Washington. The research council, a Christian group that focuses on family, anti-abortion and religious liberty issues, views homosexuality as harmful. Before sentencing, Corkins expressed remorse to building manager Leo Johnson, who Corkins shot in the arm. ""I realize resorting to violence to achieve political ends is never OK,"" Corkins said. Johnson, who struggled with Corkins and disarmed him, also spoke before the sentencing. ""I forgive you but I do not forget,"" he said. ""If you believe in God you should pray to him every day because not only did God save my life that day, he saved yours, too."" Johnson said he didn't shoot Corkins after managing to get control of the gun because God spoke to him and told him not to do so. Corkins, 29, pleaded guilty in February to committing an act of terrorism while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition. David Bos, Corkins' federal public defender, said his client was diagnosed with a mental illness six months before the August 2012 shooting and starting taking prescribed medication. Bos said that didn't excuse the shooting but should be taken into account.  The lawyer recommended Corkins receive a sentence of 11 years and three months. Prosecutors argued Corkins should receive 45 years in prison. The government said Corkins did suffer from mental illness but wanted to take medication only so he could think more clearly about his plot. Prosecutors said Corkins was able to carefully plan, rehearse and then conduct his attack. If Johnson had not interceded, they argued, many people at the Family Research Council might have been killed or wounded. ""Earlier this week we were reminded what the consequences can be of one man well-armed,"" said prosecutor Patrick Martin. ""Mr. Corkins was no less determined than the Navy Yard gunman."" When Corkins was arrested investigators found 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack.  He told the FBI he planned to kill as many people as he could at the research council and then smash the sandwiches in their faces. The head of Chick-fil-A had announced opposition to gay marriage. ""Today's 25-year prison sentence demonstrates the steep price to be paid for turning to violence to terrorize your political enemies,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen.","The Family Research Council is a Christian group focusing on many social  issues .

"Adapting a beloved novel for the big screen often guarantees a solid showing at the box office. ""The Hunger Games"" looks to be no exception. Based on Suzanne Collins' young adult novel, the movie is on track to rake in more than $80 million its opening weekend, reports say. But existing story lines, settings and dynamic characters are often accompanied by moviegoers' idealistic expectations, leaving screenwriters to ponder: How do you honor the novel and please readers without compromising the film? Luckily for fans, ""Hunger Games"" screenwriter and director Gary Ross said he found a way. ""I still want to go to that movie the same way everybody else does. I want to see aspects of the novel preserved,"" Ross told CNN. ""I'm a fan first. ... I loved the book so much. I didn't have any desire to rework (it) in any major way."" However, Ross said certain aspects of ""The Hunger Games"" just don't translate cinematically. Those who have read the books, told from 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen's perspective, already know why. ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, in the fictional nation of Panem. Every year, one boy and one girl ""tribute"" are randomly selected from the nation's 12 districts to compete in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death. Wealthy Capitol citizens called Gamemakers manipulate the Hunger Games. Though they only briefly appear in the novel, their presence is felt by Katniss, a District 12 tribute, throughout the Games. ""I can't shoot inside Katniss' head,"" Ross said. ""In the book, she speculates about what the Gamemakers are doing. Well, we created a whole (visual) world that the (Gamemakers) are in."" There may be departures in the adaptation process, Ross added, but in the grand scheme of things, the movie is faithful to the novel. Dayo Okeniyi, who plays Thresh, a tribute from District 11, also stressed the importance of honoring Collins' novel at a recent movie premiere. ""If we deviate much, there are fans out there who will stalk me and kill me,"" Okeniyi joked. ""(The fans) don't ask for much. At the same time they watch everything ... 'Oh, she's supposed to be looking at the right, not the left' -- little details."" While sticking to the novel might keep fans of the book series happy, telling the story scene by scene would yield a long, drawn-out cinematic experience, said Thelma Adams, a contributing editor at Yahoo! Movies. ""You've got to be willing to cut,"" she said. ""Find out which characters are central and which aren't. Which relationships are central and which aren't."" Adams said ""Hunger Games"" screenwriters Ross, Collins and Billy Ray were smart to streamline a few characters, while pushing others into larger roles, such as head Gamemaker Seneca Crane. Casting the right actors is imperative when adapting a novel for the big screen, she said, adding that Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are ""pitch perfect"" for their roles as Katniss, Gale Hawthorne and Peeta Mellark, respectively. ""You can't say that about every (role),"" she said. ""You can't say that 'Twilight's' Peter Facinelli -- he's the only one who could have played (Carlisle Cullen.) He's not."" Let's not forget how angry ""Twilight"" fans were when brunette Nikki Reed was first cast as Rosalie Cullen. It's no secret fans want popular characters to look a certain way, specifically how they envisioned them while they were reading the book. ""Reading is a really intimate, internal experience, where you play your own movie in your head,"" screenwriter Will Fetters said. Fetters, who adapted Nicholas Sparks' ""The Lucky One,"" which hits theaters in April, said, it helps when a book already reads like it was constructed for film. ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those books. Despite the intense, made-for-the-big-screen action sequences in ""Games,"" Ross said there was plenty to be concerned about when adapting it for the screen. ""A lot of the action stuff, you know that's hard work, and you know you're going to get it,"" Ross said. ""But it's really the delicate stuff. ... It's those intangible things you really have to capture: Katniss' character, her relationship with Rue, her relationship with her sister. ... It's that kind of stuff that's very difficult."" Collins, who had a hand in the screenwriting process, took to her Facebook page to share her thoughts on the adaptation of her novel: ""I feel like the book and the film are individual yet complementary pieces that enhance one another."" Which is how it should be, Fetters said. ""When going to an adaptation, you're going understanding that it's not going to be the exact images you saw,"" he added. ""We're all working under constraints to interpret what we saw in our heads and hope that it's the same thing readers saw.""","""The Hunger Games"" is on track to rake in more than $80 million opening weekend, reports say .

"(CNN)Again, so much expectation -- but again, not so much on show to live up to it. Ivory Coast came into their opening game of the Africa Cup of Nations as many people's tip for the title, but began the tournament in a fashion suggesting that expectation was again not sitting easily with them. The contest against Guinea, whose players have spoken of their determination to do well for a country devastated by the Ebola virus, showed the familiar frailties that have hindered an Ivory Coast team boasting star names such as Yaya Toure, Wilfried Bony and Gervinho. A lack of cohesion was apparent in both defense and attack, and a Guinea team that scored six goals in their final two qualifying matches -- played in Morocco because of the crisis -- took advantage in style. Mohamed Yattara thrashed in a stunning volley to open the scoring after 36 minutes of a first half in which the vast bulk of the energetic football came from the underdogs. Just before the hour mark, a bad situation for the Ivorians seemed likely to become worse when Gervinho -- who had shown more purpose than most of his teammates before the break -- was sent off for needlessly lashing out at Naby Keita. Seydou Doumbia came to the rescue when he rounded off a well-worked move to equalize after 72 minutes, steering his shot into the bottom corner after Bony's neat control and layoff. But there were more questions than answers for coach Herve Renard, who took over from Sabri Lamouchi after the team's failure to make it through the group stages of last summer's World Cup in Brazil, after this 1-1 draw. Renard is the latest man to attempt to end Ivory Coast's long wait for another African Cup of Nations success -- the most recent of those came in 1992. He showed that he was unafraid to make bold changes when he brought off Toure with five minutes remaining, with the Manchester City star looking decidedly unimpressed as he made way for Cheick Doukoure. Ivory Coast produced some of their better football when down to 10 men, but again they were less than the sum of their parts. With challenges against Cameroon and Mali waiting in the wings, Renard will be keen to see them harness their full potential sooner rather than later. The Frenchman is by no means the first coach of this squad to be left puzzling over just how to achieve that.","Ivory Coast many people's favorites for trophy .

"(CNN)The Australian Open curse looked like it was going to strike Rafael Nadal again. But this time he managed to get through it. Maria Sharapova survived a scare, too, while Roger Federer might have been stung by a bee on an eventful third day at the year's opening major. Hampered by knee, hamstring and back injuries in past losses in Melbourne, 14-time grand slam winner Nadal felt dizzy and was close to exiting in the second round against American qualifier Tim Smyczek. But Nadal showed his champion's heart to rally past his 112th-ranked foe 6-2 3-6 6-7 (2) 6-3 7-5 in more than four hours. When the night match was over Nadal sunk to the court, reminiscent of a celebration for someone who has just won a grand slam final. In an on-court interview, he said cramps were the source of his troubles. Recent inactivity didn't help, either. Nadal hasn't played much tennis the past six months. ""I felt very tired after the first set,"" Nadal told the crowd. ""I don't know what's going on,"" he added. ""I felt this irritation after the first set. ""I started to have some cramps around the body, different places, so that says I was not in the perfect shape because it's not normal after one hour to start to have these types of things. But it's normal, after a tough period of time without having the chance to be on the tour."" The last time Nadal played under the lights on Rod Laver Arena, it was indeed in a grand slam final. He hurt his back 12 months ago and lost to Stan Wawrinka in four sets. There didn't appear to be anything amiss with Nadal after he won the first set in routine fashion against Smyczek on Wednesday, but things took a turn for the worse for him in the middle of the second. Recovering a break for 1-2 in the third, Nadal called for the doctor and was given medication. Nadal's shots lacking depth from the baseline and with no punch on his serve, Smyczek grew in confidence. Still when Nadal broke and held for 5-3, order seemed to be restored. Smyczek, though, broke back and swept to the tiebreak 7-2 with some flashy tennis. Early in the fourth, a hunched-over Nadal was spent physically but somehow he broke and closed out the set. Holding a 16-5 record in fifth sets, the numbers favored Nadal in the decider. Despite missing three break points earlier in the set, Nadal capitalized in the 11th game and eventually prevailed. But Smyczek walked off court to huge applause. If his winners weren't enough, he allowed Nadal to replay a serve in the last game when a fan shouted out. Nadal took note. ""Not a lot of people would do something like this at 6-5 after four hours, so just congratulate him for that and because he played a great match,"" said Nadal. Sharapova close to exiting . It was the second round of the Australian Open, so Sharapova should have known there would be some drama. A year after the Russian saw off Karin Knapp 10-8 in the third set in sizzling conditions in Melbourne, she was even closer to exiting Wednesday. Sharapova needed to save two match points before finally overcoming compatriot Alexandra Panova 6-1 4-6 7-5 in similarly steamy -- though it wasn't as warm as last year -- daytime conditions. Sharapova struck 43 unforced errors in the final two sets but crucially for the five-time grand slam champion, she produced forehand winners on the match points with Panova serving at 5-4 in the third. That game was a missed opportunity for the 150th-ranked qualifier, and Panova also led by two breaks in the third at 4-1. Sharapova, who is attempting to win a first major in seven years outside Roland Garros, was left both relieved and annoyed. ""I didn't feel that I was positive enough, even though I was making a few more errors than I would have liked,"" she told reporters. ""And I wasn't making enough first serves. ""But I was thinking about it too much instead of just like being in the present, saying, 'Hey, go up to the line, do what you do, do what you've done thousands of times. ""I'm good at that and I'll continue to be good at that. But some days are just a little off. Today was one of them."" Sharapova's performance might not bode well for the rest of the tournament, but at the same time, it might simply be a blip. Last year at the Australian Open, Li Na survived a match point in the third round against Lucie Safarova and then went on to win her second grand slam title. ""You never know how you're going to feel until you go out on the court and compete and play,"" Sharapova said. ""No matter how you prepare, what you did, once you get out there, everything starts from scratch. ""It was a tough day, but I pulled through. I guess at this point that's what matters. ""Certainly gives me a lot of confidence that I didn't play my best tennis and was able to come through."" Federer drops set . Federer lost a set and was visited by the trainer, too, although he wasn't troubled nearly as much as Sharapova and Nadal. He called for the trainer after losing the first set due to an issue with his hand, yet wasn't sure what the problem was. He didn't discount a bee sting. ""I don't know what it was,"" Federer said. ""I still don't know. I just wanted to have a chat with the physio just see what we can do. ""I know there is nothing we could do. I knew we couldn't tape it up because then it would be even bigger and more weird. I just said, 'I hope it doesn't get worse or stay like this.' Actually it went away, but now I feel it again."" The record 17-time grand slam winner recovered and eventually eased past Italian Simone Bolelli 3-6 6-3 6-2 6-2. Federer only faced one break point and hit 15 aces. The Swiss' potential quarterfinal foe is Andy Murray, and the Scot made quick work of Aussie Marinko Matosevic 6-1 6-3 6-2. Viktor Troicki, meanwhile, extended his winning streak to 10 matches by defeating Argentina's Leonardo Mayer 6-4 4-6 6-4 6-0. The Serb's ranking fell outside the top 800 in July following a contentious drug suspension but Troicki now finds himself in the top 60 after winning a title in Sydney last week. The ranking will climb further with his wins in Melbourne. ""I'm enjoying playing tennis and having fun on the court,"" Troicki, a former top-20 player, said. ""I missed it a lot and that gives me a lot of joy on the court and a lot of motivation. ""Trying to use any chance, any match, any tournament. It's going well.""","Rafael Nadal rallies to beat Tim Smyczek at the Australian Open .

"A United Nations General Assembly committee Tuesday voted in favor of a draft resolution referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity as well as ""targeted sanctions"" for rampant human rights abuses. The 111-19 vote, with 55 abstentions, is merely a recommendation. The General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its leader Kim Jong Un to the ICC. The non-binding measure will come up for a vote by the General Assembly in December. The authority to refer a country to the ICC lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security. The five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers. Opponents of the resolution -- including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future. A North Korea representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution ""provoked confrontation"" and ""failed to reflect the reality on the ground."" China is likely to use its veto as its officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC ""won't help improve a country's human rights condition."" North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang. North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens. North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' The country has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the leadership in North Korea. In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Syria. They were the only two of 15 countries to vote against the resolution. The U.S. backs the resolution to sanction and refer North Korea to the ICC. Opinion: Stop romancing North Korea . North Korea last week released the last remaining Americans -- Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- detained in the country, but the gesture has not altered the United State's stance on the country's human rights record. In February, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution. Kim Jong Il's former bodyguard tells of beatings, starvation in prison camp . The almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews. It listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn, corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings. North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, So Se Pyong, said the United States and ""other hostile forces"" had fabricated the report in an attempt to ""defame the dignified image of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and eventually eliminate its social system."" Before Tuesday's vote, an amendment proposed by Cuba to delete the language about an ICC referral was rejected 77-40, with 50 abstentions. Cuban Ambassador Rodolfo Reyes Rodriguez said U.N. resolutions targeting North Korea or any other single country were a ""tool to attack others.""

"Three former journalists at Rupert Murdoch's defunct British tabloid News of the World have pleaded guilty to phone hacking, British media reported Wednesday, citing the prosecution in the case. The three who pleaded guilty are Neville Thurlbeck, James Weatherup and Greg Miskiw. They were among a group of people who went on trial this week in the much-anticipated case. The highest profile defendants are Rebekah Brooks, a protégé of global media baron Murdoch, and Andy Coulson, a former spin doctor for British Prime Minister David Cameron -- both former editors of News of the World. It is not clear how the guilty pleas from the three journalists will affect the cases against their former bosses. The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned  News of the World through its UK subsidiary, News International. Phone hacking scandal: Fast facts . After the scandal, Murdoch stepped down from a string of company directorships and abandoned a multibillion-dollar bid to acquire satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney, as well as victims of crime and the July 7, 2005, London terrorist attacks. Brooks and Coulson were close to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Coulson, who edited the News of the World from 2003 to 2007, went on to become Cameron's director of communications before resigning early in 2011. Brooks was a friend of the prime minister and his wife. Brooks, formerly chief executive of News of the World's parent company, News International, part of Murdoch's News Corp. empire, also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice. But the most explosive charge against her is plotting in 2002 to eavesdrop illegally on the voice mail of missing British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. Public anger after the revelation in 2011 that the missing girl's phone had been hacked forced Murdoch to close News of the World, which Brooks edited at the time of the hacking. She then became editor of The Sun newspaper before taking up the chief executive role. Murdoch's News International announces new name . Brooks, Coulson and fellow former News of the World employees Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup are accused of conspiring between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" Specifically, the charge asserts that they listened to ""voice mail messages of well-known people."" Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire face an additional charge of intercepting Dowler's messages. Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and a former personal assistant also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking. They were charged in May 2012, along with Brooks' former driver, a security guard and members of News International security staff, with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The hacking scandal prompted Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians.

"News International, the UK subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. that publishes newspapers including The Sun and The Times of London, announced a new name Wednesday: News UK. The rebranding  follows a troubled period for News International, hit by a phone hacking scandal. It comes as News Corp. splits into two pieces, with one company encompassing its television and film assets, and the other holding its publishing entities. The separation into two distinct publicly traded companies, 21st Century Fox and the new News Corp., is expected Friday. The new name for News International, News UK, is ""designed to convey a more coherent and logical identity for the new parent company across the globe,"" a company statement said. The rebranding is being mirrored in Australia, where News Limited -- the company from which Murdoch built up his media empire -- will become known as News Corp. Australia. Both companies will become part of the new News Corp,. which will be incorporated on the NASDAQ on Friday, the News UK statement said. ""The change follows the fundamental changes of governance and personnel that have taken place to address the problems of the recent past,"" it said. ""News International apologized to its victims and set up a compensation scheme; closed the News of the World and co-operated with all the relevant authorities. ""New policies and procedures are in place across the company, its main titles are all under new leadership and the executive team has been transformed."" News International was forced to close News of the World, its bestselling Sunday tabloid, in July 2011 amid anger over allegations an investigator working for the paper had in 2002 hacked the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. Since then, a number of former News International staff have been charged with criminal offenses and await trial. They include Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World and Sun editor who served as chief executive of News International from 2009 until 2011, and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who went on to work for Prime Minister David Cameron but subsequently resigned. They deny wrongdoing. Several journalists working for The Sun have also been charged in connection with two police investigations into alleged media abuses. One inquiry is looking into claims of phone hacking, while the other is probing allegations of inappropriate payments to police and public officials. In a sign of an editorial shakeup at the newspaper, Dominic Mohan was replaced as editor of The Sun last week. Mohan, who had been at the paper for 17 years and was its editor since 2009, is moving to a senior role advising the chief executive of the new News Corp. David Dinsmore took over as editor of The Sun on Monday. Mike Darcey, chief executive of News UK, said: ""This is an exciting time and I feel privileged to be leading News UK as it begins a bright new chapter. ""With new people and a new strategy, we will take our place within a new company determined to secure a sustainable future for professional journalism around the globe.""

"British-born Samantha Lewthwaite was once seen as a kind of victim of the July 2005 London terror attacks -- the pregnant wife of one of the suicide bombers who killed 52 people, now left alone to care for her children. She condemned the attacks but then vanished. Now, Kenyan authorities say, she is the infamous ""White Widow,"" alleged to be a supporter and financier of people linked to the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab. Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed Nairobi, Kenya's, upscale Westgate Shopping Mall on Saturday -- an operation for which Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility -- have prompted a slew of media speculation that she might have been involved. But no official confirmation has been given. A senior Kenyan government official said a woman was among the attackers. Yet it is ""impossible,"" based on the government's photo evidence (and before a forensics examination is complete), to determine who that might be. Attackers defeated in mall siege, Kenya's president says . Interpol on Thursday issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for Lewthwaite at Kenya's request. The public's help could be crucial in finding the 29-year-old, believed to be using the alias ""Natalie Webb,"" the international police group said. The notice activates ""a global 'tripwire' for this fugitive,"" Interpol Secretary-General Ronald K. Noble said in a prepared statement. Lewthwaite ""is wanted by Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011,"" Interpol said. A convert to Islam . Lewthwaite, born in Buckinghamshire, England, earned her nickname as the widow of Germaine Lindsay, one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London's transportation system on July 7, 2005. Now age 29, Lewthwaite met Lindsay, a British Muslim, when she was 17, according to the Daily Mail. A convert to Islam, she married him in 2002. After the London attacks, she denied having knowledge of the plans. Later, Kenyan authorities said, she emerged in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and became part of a terror cell linked to Al-Shabaab. In December 2011, Kenyan authorities raided three homes in Mombasa, including one allegedly used by Lewthwaite, and arrested some people on suspicion of planning to destroy a bridge, a ferry and hotels frequented by Western tourists. At Lewthwaite's residence, investigators found the kind of bomb-making materials that were used in the London attacks, Kenyan counterterror police said. But Lewthwaite was not found. A security guard who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity in 2012 said he saw a white woman leave the residence hours before the raid. Authorities have yet to catch up to her. Kenyan authorities also suspect Lewthwaite of hatching a plot to break fellow Briton Jermaine Grant out of jail after he was arrested in connection with the alleged Mombasa plot. 'An innocent young person' But in the English town of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, where Lewthwaite lived with Lindsay for a time, she is remembered by local councilor Raj Khan as a good, helpful woman. ""She was an innocent young person,"" said Khan, who said he knew Lewthwaite as a ""family friend"" before the July 2005 bombings. ""She would do anything to accommodate other people. She was a very good human being. She did everything to help others."" He warned against judging her based on rumors and speculation. ""I'm worried that the picture that has been demonizing her may be premature because it has not been substantiated,"" he said. ""Unless there is hard evidence, we should not just unnecessarily jump to conclusions."" Lewthwaite also reportedly spent time in Banbridge, in Northern Ireland, where her grandmother, Elizabeth Allen, still lives. A family friend, local councilor Joan Baird, said Monday that Allen was elderly and ill, and had been ""in and out of hospital."" This speculation about her granddaughter is upsetting, Baird said. ""This is very distressing for all the family, a decent family. And it got worse with the news (from Kenya). It's also very distressing for the people of Banbridge, on behalf of the family,"" she said. According to the Belfast Telegraph, Lewthwaite's father was a British soldier posted to the area who married a local woman. 'Very unusual' Kenyan officials have given differing accounts of the involvement of a white woman in the Westgate Mall attack. Senior Kenyan intelligence officials told CNN that surveillance video from inside the mall appeared to show such a woman taking part in the attack. Analysts believe she is British, the sources said. Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told ""PBS NewsHour"" on Monday that a British woman was among the attackers. ""She has, I think, done this many times before,"" she said of the woman but did not name the suspect. Kenyan State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu told CNN that ""multiple witnesses"" have said they saw a woman among the attackers. ""We have also been told that if it is the same woman that they say they saw, that she would have been killed very early on in the attack,"" he said. But he cautioned, ""We don't know for sure that we had a woman. And secondly, because of the bodies trapped under the rubble, we don't know if she is who everyone says she might be."" Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku previously told reporters that all the attackers were men. Some of them apparently had dressed as women, he said. But on Wednesday, he revisited the speculation that a woman was involved, saying that authorities were ""hearing possibilities and information,"" including from the public. ""We want to again request you to allow the forensic experts to determine whether that is true,"" he said. Female involvement in such an attack would be ""very unusual,"" said CNN security analyst Peter Bergen. ""Typically these groups are misogynist,"" he said. ""Their view is the woman should be in a home and shrouded in a body veil."" American teens among attackers, Kenya says .","Interpol issues a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for Lewthwaite .

"Aaron Collins was only in his 20s. But something, his family and friends say, made him outline three things he wanted when he died: to repay his parents any debt he may have owed, to give a homeless person some money and to leave ""an awesome tip"" for a waiter or waitress. ""I'm not talking about 25%. I mean $500 for a ... pizza,"" Collins wrote in his will, according to his brother. Collins died on July 7, just three weeks after his 30th birthday, in a Lexington, Kentucky, hospital, leaving behind family and friends who took up his final request -- to leave a big tip. Family and friends fulfilled Aaron's request, tipping one waitress in Lexington the $500, a moment that Aaron's brother, Seth Collins, videotaped and posted online Wednesday to YouTube. It is linked to the family's memorial page, AaronCollins.org. Maybe it was the simple gesture. Maybe it was the generosity. But something caught the imagination of the public, who began watching the video. By Saturday, according to a YouTube count, there were more than 1.3 million views and nearly $30,000 in donations for the family to continue what has become known as ""Aaron's Last Wish,"" Seth Collins told CNN. The nearly 3-minute video chronicles the family carrying out Collins' last wish at Puccini's Smiling Teeth, a pizzeria in Lexington. ""Well, this is where it's happening,"" Seth Collins says, narrating the trip to the pizzeria on Tuesday. ""I'm waiting for the rest of the family to get here and then we'll be going in and having lunch and giving someone a big tip. Hope it means a lot to them."" Restaurant manager Caroline Coleman told CNN the family came in and ordered from waitress Sarah Ward. The video picks up at the end of the meal, with the brother telling the waitress: ""My brother passed away late last week. He asked that we go have pizza, and leave the waiter or waitress a $500 tip."" Tips on tipping from Eatocracy . A visibly stunned Ward said: ""Are you serious? Are you kidding me?"" Seth Collins answered: ""That's what he wanted. Yeah, and if people keep donating, we will keep giving away $500."" Ward then hugged him. ""I'm going to be telling this story the rest of my life,"" she said. A preliminary investigation of Collins' cause of death points to suicide by strangulation, according to the Fayette County coroner, though final autopsy results have yet to be released. Collins' family question the initial findings, saying there was no indication he would take his own life, according to his brother. But family members have no doubt that Collins' last wish is making a big impact. Since the video posted on YouTube, Seth Collins said the family has heard from people in the Netherlands, Brazil, Portugal and even Russia. So many people responded that he is moving the website to a different server to handle the increased traffic. ""People have just been overwhelmingly generous and kind,"" he said. ""If we can keep doing it, I'd like to keep giving these tips, and keep filming them so other people can see the happiness it's bringing to someone."" All the donations are going to the waiters and waitresses, the brother said. ""He left us a will full of his personality,"" Seth Collins wrote on a memorial page. ""Aaron was generous in life, and that's probably why he didn't have the money to do this himself. He just accepted that if someone needed help, he would help them."" And in a way, he is doing just that. Does this inspire you to do something ""awesome"" for a stranger?

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Top U.S. officials in Afghanistan on Sunday condemned the burning of a Quran in the United States that sparked three days of protests in which more than 20 people died. Burning the Muslim holy book ""was hateful, it was intolerant and it was extremely disrespectful and again, we condemn it in the strongest manner possible,"" said Gen. David Petraeus, who heads the U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan. U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry said in a statement that Americans respect the Quran ""and all religious texts and deplore any action that shows disrespect to any religious faith."" ""At the same time, I want to emphasize, as have many Afghan leaders, that to attack and kill innocent people in response to the deplorable act of one individual is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity,"" Eikenbery's statement said. NATO Ambassador Mark Sedwill of Great Britain, meanwhile, called the burning of a Quran by a small Florida church ""an act of disrespect to the Muslim faith and to all peoples of faith. It does not represent the views of the peoples or governments of the alliance."" The comments came as clashes Sunday in Kandahar, Afghanistan, between police and stone-throwing demonstrators killed as many as three people, including two police officers, and injured at least 10. Interior Ministry spokesman Zemaray Bashari said one civilian and two police officers had been killed, and that 10 were injured. The latest clashes occurred during a protest, according to Ahmad Wali Karzai, the provincial council chief who is Afghan President Hamid Karzai's brother, and local elder Haji Abdul Malik. They said one protester died and at least a dozen people were injured. Karzai strongly condemned the Quran burning and asked ""that the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and the U.S. president condemn this action ... in very clear words to the public,"" his office said in a statement. U.S. President Barack Obama also condemned the action on Saturday, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the Senate would ""take a look"" at the issue. Reid stopped short of saying the Senate would vote on a resolution, adding: ""As to whether we need hearings or not, I don't know."" He called the Quran burning by Pastor Terry Jones in Florida ""a publicity stunt"" and said: ""I think people should understand the consequences of what they do under the guise of religion."" However, President Karzai's brother denied that the Kandahar protests were a result of the Quran burning. ""The protests in the last two days in Kandahar have no link to the Quran burning in U.S. at all, but were all organized by some people to loot public and government properties,"" Ahmad Wali Karzai told CNN, adding that he condemned the desecration of Islam's holy book. Also Sunday, demonstrators in the city of Jalalabad, Afghanistan, protested the Quran-burning, blocking a major road that leads to the capital of Kabul, witnesses said. The Jalalabad protesters included university students. The national assembly of clerics on Sunday condemned both the Quran-burning and the killings of civilians and United Nations staff members in the demonstrations. At least nine people were killed and 73 injured in Kandahar on Saturday, and 12 people died Friday -- including seven U.N. employees -- when angry demonstrators stormed a U.N. compound in Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan. Obama extended condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in Mazar-e Sharif, but also decried the burning of the Quran. ""The desecration of any holy text ... is an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry,"" he said Saturday in a statement released by the White House. ""However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity."" Besmellah Afghanmal, a Kandahar provincial council member, said hundreds gathered Saturday in Kandahar to protest the Quran burning. ""Today the enemies of peace in Afghanistan killed and injured our people in Kandahar,"" said a statement from the office of the Kandahar governor. Jones sparked international controversy last year when his Gainesville, Florida, church planned ""International Burn a Quran Day"" on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Jones' church did not host a Quran burning on that day, but the Dove World Outreach Center's website announced an ""International Judge the Koran Day"" set for last month. Another post on the site's blog showed an image of a burning book and read, ""The event is over, the Koran was found guilty and a copy was burned inside the building."" The Mazar-e Sharif killings generated worldwide condemnation, from the U.N. Security Council to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 57-state group that calls itself the ""collective voice of the Muslim world."" In a statement Friday, Jones called the assault on the U.N. compound ""a very tragic and criminal action."" Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the police in Mazar-e Sharif, told reporters that a number of suspects ""who might be the main organizers"" had been arrested. The United Nations said the seven U.N. staffers killed were four Nepalese security guards and three civilians. A U.N. source said the three civilians were from Norway, Sweden and Romania.

"""When the sirens sounded, 15 trained defenders would go to the roof. The anti-aircraft gun mounted there was used once, when the Red River was bombed in May 1972. The planes came over the State Bank, and the shooters on that roof also shot at the plane. I don't know if they found their mark."" Cao Xuan Nha's memories of the Vietnam War were brought vividly to mind with the recent opening of Hotel Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi's old air raid shelter. Lost for decades, then rediscovered and now open to the public, the claustrophobic tunnels are a unique memorial to wartime Vietnam -- one to the bonds formed during a time of fear and destruction, and to the role this iconic hotel has played over the last 111 years. Nha, who was a member of the Commission for External Affairs, Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, says the Metropole was the only hotel in the city to have a shelter. He was responsible for taking care of government guests from 1969 until 1972, all of whom were hosted at the hotel, then known as Thong Nhat (Reunification). ""I was really happy when I found out that they had found the bunker and [general manager] Kai's idea was to bring it back,"" he says. ""It's important for the hotel, important for the city and important for the country."" CNNGo: Shenzhou - 9 spacecraft boosts tourism in China's space city . In the months that followed its rediscovery, the shelter has been cleaned out and made safe for exploration. Wartime relic made amenable . It has a new entrance -- shiny new concrete steps more aligned with the luxurious trappings above than the darkness below -- but otherwise, the shelter is pretty much as it was found. The bare, low-ceilinged rooms are dark, damp and musty. Water drips from air ventilation shafts. Old wiring curls out of rusted circuit breakers. Dandong light bulbs -- Nha remembers them being purchased -- are still screwed into their sockets. And former Australian Second Secretary and Consul Bob Devereaux's graffiti is still discernible on the wall: ""BOB Devereaux, Aug. 17, 1975."" Devereaux doesn't remember tagging the wall, but does recall fishing around the waterlogged shelter, then being used for storage, for documents and the odd elusive bottle of Australian wine during his two-year residency at the hotel. CNNGo: World's 50 best beaches . Devereaux was one of the first to tour the shelter on the Metropole's new Path of History tour, which explains the hotel's history over the last century and more. The shelter was built sometime during the mid-1960s, and although the hotel staff has always known of its existence -- general manager Kai Speth says that at least one guest a week has enquired about it during his four-year tenure at the hotel -- the shelter was unearthed by chance during the renovation of the hotel's Bamboo Bar less than a year ago. Speth says he felt a keen sense of responsibility to reopen the shelter as a tribute to the Metropole's war-era staff. ""Bombs were falling on Hanoi and people were still coming to work -- nobody could guarantee a bomb wouldn't fall on the hotel -- there were no laser-guided missiles then,"" he says. When the decision was made to renovate the Bamboo Bar, Speth decided to do some digging of his own. An adventure . ""Eventually we drilled into the space above the stairs,"" says Speth. ""We created a cavity around 70 centimeters deep and were on our chests, looking around, and we could see there was a structure there. It was like an Indiana Jones adventure."" In August 2011, Speth and his chief engineer finally broke through more than two meters of earth and reinforced concrete and the shelter's 278-millimeter-thick ceiling to emerge into a 40-square-meter space, divided into five interconnecting rooms by heavy metals doors. It took a full week of pumping before the water level was brought down to 20 centimeters, and Speth, wearing boots, shorts and an old T-shirt, could splash down to explore. The shelter provided a unique glimpse into the hotel's incarnation as a government-run wartime guesthouse -- a world away from the opulence of its French colonial heyday. After being constructed by two French investors in 1901, the Metropole had quickly become one of Asia's most celebrated hotels. In 1923, Somerset Maugham checked in with the sole purpose of finishing ""The Gentlemen in the Parlour."" Charlie Chaplin spent his honeymoon in the hotel after marrying Paulette Goddard in Shanghai in 1936. In 1951 Graham Greene stayed for the first time, while writing ""The Quiet American"" and acting as a correspondent for Paris Match. But during the war, well-heeled travelers sipping coffee and fine cognac on the Metropole terrace were replaced by scared Vietnamese ducking into bomb shelters sunk into the pavement as the U.S. Air Force flew overhead. That image made the cover of LIFE on April 7, 1967. Stars check in . Even so, celebrities continued to check in, despite and often because of the war ravaging the country. In June 1972, anti-war activist Jane Fonda arrived at the hotel, and stayed on the second floor for two weeks. She spent many hours in the shelter, and autographed a photo taken there for a member of the staff: ""To Van, with warmest wishes, Hoa Bin (peace), Jane Fonda."" ""I consider Ms. Jane a close friend,"" says Nha. ""She supported our country and I looked after her both times she visited, first alone and the second time with her son Troy and husband Tom."" Although the idea of defending the hotel against enemy aircraft with rifle fire seems laughable, its chefs, receptionists, waiters and cleaners were put through their paces by the army and each carried a weapon to guard the hotel against looters. While guests retreated to the relative safety of the shelter, the staff was in the open, trying to land a lucky shot when incoming enemy aircraft flew low enough. CNNGo: Hello Kitty jets, the cutest airplanes ever . Echoes of the past . The shelter did make an impression on one other guest: American folk singer Joan Baez, who stayed at the Metropole during the Christmas bombings in 1972. Her song, ""Where are you now, my son?"" was inspired by her experience in Hanoi and the quiet and resolute perseverance of the Vietnamese people. The track incorporates live recordings from her hotel stay while bombers raided the city. Now, standing in the same space four decades later, we crowd around Speth's mobile phone in the warm, close space, sweat beading on our foreheads and lips, to listen as Baez' voice interspersed with the unmistakable sound of a wailing Vietnamese woman, machine gun fire and bombs exploding cut eerily through the gloom. It's the first time in 40 years that Nha has been down to the bunker, and he stands proudly, hand on heart, as he surveys the place in which he'd spent many nights hoping for peace. Path of history . Visitors from all over the world can now retrace the steps of former guests and staff. Historian Andreas Augustin, who wrote a book on the history of the Metropole, has helped train six volunteers from Hanoi to lead guests of the hotel on a daily Path of History tour, starting with a stroll between 13 glass displays and culminating with the exploration of the shelter. Among the first to take the inaugural tour on May 21 were Bob Devereaux and Gemma Cruz Araneta, a former Filipino beauty queen and journalist who spent two months in Hanoi in 1968. Araneta had described the shelter in her memoirs as ""a long, narrow, semi-subterranean room of concrete which I thought would have made a groovy discotheque."" Although some had advised Speth, only half-jokingly, that he should turn the shelter into a wine cellar for the hotel, he's glad his determination to preserve the shelter in its wartime state has paid off. He believes that the Metropole bunker will become a destination in its own right, just like the Cu Chi tunnels in south Vietnam.""I want people to feel that space; to transport themselves there in the middle of the conflict,"" he says. ""It's really a place for reflection. If people come out and are a little emotional, that's mission accomplished for me."" To see it for yourself . The shelter will be opened as part of the Path of History guided tour, held daily at 5 p.m. and open to hotel guests only.

"Friday marks the anniversary of the assassination of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. forces. Three years on, the core organization of al Qaeda has been significantly depleted. However, the danger from so-called ""home-grown"" terrorism may yet be on the rise, fuelled by foreign nationals returning from key international theatres of war such as Syria. In the United Kingdom, for instance, Charles Farr, director of the Office for Security and Counter-terrorism, recently asserted that the threat from UK nationals travelling to participate in the Syrian conflict is the ""biggest challenge"" to UK security services since 9/11. The total number of UK nationals who have fought in Syria is estimated at up to 366 by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at Kings College London, with a significant number believed to have been killed there. Moreover, ICSR estimates that as many as 11,000 foreign fighters overall may have fought in Syria, from more than 70 countries, a number which is reported to be a higher concentration than anywhere since Afghanistan in the 1980s. A central concern here is that many of these individuals, which include potentially as many as 2,000 from Western Europe, plus individuals from North America, Australia, South-east Asia, and Africa, will return from Syria to their respective homelands battle hardened with significantly greater terrorist capability and resolve. And given that the relatively large number of these foreign fighters makes them collectively difficult to track with precision, further home-grown attacks appear increasingly likely. While this offers propaganda value for al Qaeda, such individuals often lack thorough indoctrination of the network's core messages, even though some, including last year's London and Boston terrorists, appear to have been partially motivated or inspired by them. This reflects, in part, the continued diminution of al Qaeda's central organization which is unlikely to be able to provide operational support for home-grown terrorists. It also means that these people, while highly dangerous, do not individually represent the same level of threat to international interests as larger cells and terrorist groups, and are thus less likely to be able to perform major, spectacular attacks in the mould of 9/11. Thus, while bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has sought to seize on home-grown Western terrorism, and indeed the chaos in Syria, for propaganda purposes, this cannot disguise the central al Qaeda organization's declining fortunes. Al-Zawahiri lacks bin Laden's personal authority within the terrorist network, and the core has also been weakened by the assassination of numerous other senior terrorist leaders. A fundamental challenge for al-Zawahiri is that while the central al Qaeda leadership appears to remain located largely in Pakistani tribal areas and borderlands, the wider network has becoming increasingly de-centralized and dispersed. The problems this can cause were underlined earlier this month in Syria when a jihadist group called Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) accused al Qaeda of having ""deviated from the correct path,"" and ""divided the mujahedeen in every place."" The origin of the dispute probably lies in an edict from al-Zawahiri to ISIS to confine its activities to Iraq after it was accused of abuses of civilians and rival rebels in Syria. Al-Zawahiri has instead recognized the al-Nusra Front as the official al Qaeda affiliate in Syria and called for jihadist unity behind it. Accompanying this dispersal and de-centralization has been shifting the focus of al Qaeda groups and franchises whose attention is more on ""local"" national or regional issues, rather than the broader international designs of bin Laden. In part, this also reflects the greater difficulty of attacking key international targets many of whose defences have significantly hardened since 9/11. There has also been evolution in the geographical focal points of al Qaeda activity with terrorist nodes of growing importance, for instance, in key African and Middle Eastern countries, such as Yemen, where political upheaval since bin Laden's death has allowed terrorists and other insurgents to secure greater foothold. And reflecting this changed risk pattern, U.S. forces are re-deploying as a result. For instance, the CIA has expanded its staff in Yemen, and also enhanced its air bases in the Gulf from which it can launch drone strikes into the country. Only last week, Washington launched a major drone attack which, according to the Yemeni government, killed at least two dozen militants, including foreign fighters, in an al Qaeda training camp in the remote mountainous area of Abyan. Meanwhile in Africa, U.S. forces have also scaled up facilities in numerous states, including Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic. This is intended to allow for greater aerial surveillance coverage and drone strikes, especially in North Africa, plus sites for military hardware storage. So while the central core of al Qaeda has been diminished since bin Laden's demise, much of the wider terrorist network remains potent, albeit more focused on local grievances than grander international ambitions. However, danger may be growing from home-grown threats fueled by battle-hardened individuals returning from foreign theaters of war, especially Syria, with greater terrorist resolve and capabilities.","Friday marks third anniversary of assassination of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. forces .

"(CNN)Two former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestlers are suing the WWE, alleging their old employer ignored or downplayed signs of brain damage and other injuries while it raked in millions. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Philadelphia by Vito LoGrasso, who is best known for wrestling under the moniker Big Vito, and Evan Singleton, who wrestled under the name Adam Mercer. ""It is not simply that WWE has failed to protect its wrestlers,"" court documents say. ""WWE deliberately creates and heightens the violence of its matches in order to 'heat' up audiences and increase its profits."" WWE is known for over-the-top events, outrageous story lines and matches putting wrestlers against each other and involving high-flying stunts. A lawyer for WWE called the lawsuit without merit, like a ""virtually identical one filed by the same lawyers in Oregon."" ""WWE has never concealed any medical information related to concussions, or otherwise, from our talent,"" said Jerry McDevitt from the K&L Gates law firm. ""We will vigorously contest this lawsuit."" The suit, which is dated January 16, is seeking damages to be determined at trial and medical monitoring. It centers on LoGrasso, who wrestled with the WWE from 1991 to 1998 and from 2005 to 2007, and Singleton, who wrestled from 2012 to 2013. As a result of his wrestling injuries, the suit alleges, LoGrasso suffers from serious neurological damage, which includes severe headaches, memory loss, depression, anxiety and deafness. The court documents say Singleton suffers serious symptoms including tremors, convulsions, migraines, memory loss and impaired ability to reason. The lawsuit has the potential to reach class-action status, the suit says. It estimates that at least 500 wrestlers have worked for the WWE, and it says the operation earns $500 million a year. ""For most of its history, WWE has engaged in a campaign of misinformation and deception to prevent its wrestlers from understanding the true nature and consequences of the injuries they have sustained,"" the lawsuit says.

"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the tweet fittingly declared, ""goes from tabloid boss to tabloid prey."" That's because the head of the powerful News Corp empire has declared his intention to split from his younger wife Wendi Deng . After the news emerged, the news-ravenous Twitterverse, gossip-hungry tabloids and every other blog started soaking up the latest celebrity divorce. Inquiring minds are dying to know why this power pair are getting unhitched. The rumor mill is grinding and the whiff of scandal and the hint of sleaze beckon. People who've got the answers aren't tattling. The New York Daily News said the reasons are ""allegedly shocking."" Its headline shouted -- ""'Jaw-dropping'!"" For now, people are having fun poking fun. One blogger quipped, ""Wendi Deng to divorce Rupert Murdoch after he drops from #98 to #105 on rich list."" Another tweet observed that ""someone's #estateplan will be changing ... "" Murdoch is 82 and Deng is 44, so the May-December age difference is duly noted: ""If Deng starts dating a 60-sumpn billionaire, he'll still be 20 yrs younger than Rupert."" Deng made headlines two years ago for forcefully defending Murdoch from a pie-throwing intruder in Britain's Parliament. That was Wendi Deng Murdoch's ""greatest moment,"" one wit said. She's not just his wife; she's his ""pie-deflecting"" wife. ""If a woman did karate chops for me, @rupertmurdoch, I'd never let her go bro,"" one tweeter said. Another said, ""I bet rupert Murdoch wife wishes now she had let that custard pie smack him in the face."" The Chinese-born, Yale-educated Deng was very accomplished in her own right pre-Murdoch, even though critics jabbed her as a ""gold digger"" through her marriage to the media mogul. Her husband runs one of the most powerful media conglomerates in the world -- one that includes 20th Century Fox, Fox television (including Fox News and FX), Sky news service, HarperCollins publishing and many newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, Britain's Times and several publications in his native Australia. But Deng had stayed largely out of the public eye until July 2011. She was sitting behind Murdoch in Parliament in London, while he testified about his company's involvement in a phone-hacking scandal that rocked Britain. Comedian Jonnie Marbles came at Murdoch with a shaving-foam pie. Deng leaped into action, lunging at Marbles and smashing his hand with her own. ""Mr. Murdoch,"" said parliamentarian Tom Watson, who minutes earlier had been particularly critical of the media titan, ""your wife has a pretty good left hook."" Social media erupted in response to what soon became known as ""the slap heard round the world"" and earned her the sobriquet ""tiger wife."" The reaction was particularly strong on Chinese microblogs, where many hailed Deng's reaction as a moment of pride for Asian women. Murdoch and Deng met at a Hong Kong cocktail party shortly after her graduation from Yale. Deng then went on to work at Star TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television service that's under Murdoch's corporate umbrella. In a 2011 interview with his wife on CCTV, Murdoch recalled her interpreting for him while he toured the Chinese mainland.  A fervent pursuit followed, though Deng didn't necessarily return all his affection. ""I fell in love with her, and I asked her. She said no, and it took a long time to persuade her,"" Murdoch said. Their 1999 wedding occurred shortly after Murdoch filed for divorce from his second wife, Anna Torv Murdoch. (Anna Torv wed Murdoch in 1967, the same year he divorced his first wife and one year before Deng was born, according to multiple reports.) Shortly after the wedding, Murdoch announced his new wife would step down from her executive role at a News Corp. subsidiary in Hong Kong. He described her as ""busy working on decorating the new apartment."" A Wall Street Journal profile, published in 2000, hinted she didn't entirely leave the business world. Deng frequently accompanied her husband and stepson to meetings with high-ranking Chinese officials, where she'd sometimes intervene ""to smooth over potentially awkward situations,"" according to that report. Over the past 12 years, she gave birth to and raised two girls, Grace and Chloe. (Murdoch has four other children from his two previous marriages, some of whom hold prominent posts at News Corp.) Her Yale profile notes she's a co-founder of Big Feet Productions, an independent studio in East London that makes applications and games for Apple operating systems according to its website. And in 2011, she produced, ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"" a film set in 19th century China centered on two girls who circumvent cultural restrictions on females. A divorce would end her union to Rupert Murdoch, and perhaps set up a battle over how much of his fortune -- which Forbes recently estimated at $11.2 billion -- she and her children will receive. This potential showdown comes at a tenuous time for News Corp., which recently approved a plan to split its operations into two publicly traded companies. Murdoch, the existing company's largest shareholder, is set to become chairman of the two new companies. It was not immediately known if Deng and Murdoch signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their wedding, and if so where they filed it. Michael Stutman, president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said he'd expect they did so in New York -- a state with a tendency to enforce terms of such agreements. ""New York will apply those terms so long as they are not grossly unfair or unconscionable,"" Stutman said. ""The same cannot be said about every other country in the world."" One altruist actually tweeted: ""Shouldn't we respect Rupert Murdoch's right to privacy during this difficult time?"" Good luck with that! The ""tabloid boss"" is now ""tabloid prey.""","Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng married in 1999 .

"Since 2009 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated that Plan B and other emergency contraceptives be available without a prescription to women age 17 and up. In reality, a new study suggests, a 17-year-old's access to these drugs can be uncertain. In the study, two female research assistants at Boston University called every commercial pharmacy in five major cities and asked whether emergency contraception was available to them that day. If the answer was yes, they followed up with the question ""If I'm 17, is that okay?"" At that point, 19% of the pharmacy workers told the young women that contraception would not be available to them. When researchers posing as doctors called the same pharmacies on behalf of a (fictional) 17-year-old patient, however, just 3% of pharmacies said the drugs weren't available. Pharmacies, moreover, incorrectly reported the age guidelines for over-the-counter access to 43% of the ""girls"" and 39% of the ""doctors,"" according to the study, which appears in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics. Health.com: 12 types of birth control: what are the options? Misinformation of this sort could lead to unintended pregnancies, the researchers say. ""It's important that adolescents get the correct information the first time,"" says Tracey Wilkinson, M.D., the lead author of the study and a professor of pediatrics at Boston University. ""This highlights some of the barriers that adolescents face when accessing emergency contraception."" Two emergency contraceptives, both of which contain the hormone levonorgestrel, are approved for over-the-counter use and are stocked behind pharmacy counters: Plan B (including the single-pill version known as Plan B One-Step), and a so-called branded generic known as Next Choice. Timely access to these drugs is important, Wilkinson and her colleagues say, since they're most effective in the 24 hours following unprotected sex or a contraception failure. The odds of getting pregnant rise by about 50% every 12 hours after the event, according to the study. Health.com: What to do if the condom breaks . The study included every pharmacy -- nearly 950 in all -- in Austin, Texas; Cleveland; Nashville, Tennessee; Philadelphia; and Portland, Oregon. Researchers contacted each pharmacy twice, once in the role of the teenager and once in the role of the doctor. To better disguise their identity, they spaced the calls at least two weeks apart and used cell phones programmed with each city's area code. In roughly 20% of the phone calls, pharmacy workers reported that emergency contraception was not available for any caller or patient, regardless of age. Some of those pharmacies -- about one-third -- suggested another nearby pharmacy or offered to order the pills, but the average wait time was 45 hours. The faulty information about age recorded in some of the other calls might be due to a combination of ""confusion, misinformation, and maybe personal beliefs,"" Wilkinson says, although she and her colleagues stress that the study is silent on this matter. A pharmacy's location and whether or not it was part of a chain did not appear to play a role. As for the differences in the responses given to doctors versus teenagers, Wilkinson says it could be that physicians are more likely to be transferred to higher-ranking pharmacy employees -- pharmacists rather than pharmacy technicians, say. Similarly, the study notes that teenagers were twice as likely as doctors to be put on hold. Health.com: What your teenager needs to know about sex . Experts not involved in the study say that several factors -- unintentional or otherwise -- could be responsible for the misinformation. ""There were probably some people who had some personal objections about [emergency contraception] and didn't want to deal with it, and some were not educated about the laws and facts,"" says Christopher Estes, M.D., an assistant professor of ob-gyn at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Jean Amoura, M.D., an associate professor of ob-gyn at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha, has studied access to emergency contraception in Nebraska pharmacies and says barriers to access are often logistical. Rural pharmacies, for instance, may not stock the pill simply because too few people ask for it. Amoura has encountered ideological objections as well, however. Although Plan B and Next Choice are believed to work by preventing ovulation, like daily birth control pills, and ""will not interrupt an established pregnancy,"" Amoura says, some people view taking the drugs as tantamount to abortion. The ""misunderstanding among the public, pharmacists, and doctors about this being an abortion pill"" is an ""ongoing dilemma,"" Amoura says. Health.com: Common birth control side effects . The FDA lowered the age threshold for over-the-counter access to emergency contraception from 18 to 17 in 2009, following a federal court order. Girls age 16 and under still require a prescription from a doctor. In 2011, the FDA recommended the removal of all age restrictions on Plan B One-Step, but in a controversial move, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, overruled the agency. Deborah Nucatola, M.D., senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive health services -- including emergency contraception -- at more than 800 health centers around the country, says easing restrictions on emergency contraception may help address the uneven access seen in Wilkinson's study. ""It's unclear if the pharmacy workers who provided incorrect information to the study callers were simply unfamiliar with the law, but one of the unfortunate results of the age restriction is that it requires drugstores to keep emergency contraception behind pharmacy counters,"" Nucatola said in a prepared statement. ""As the research shows, that restriction creates access barriers for women of all ages and these barriers can in turn result in preventable unintended pregnancies.""","The odds of getting pregnant rise by about 50% every 12 hours after unprotected sex .

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, work took place outside of the home during designated hours. Today, that world is a fairy tale. If you checked your work email this Thanksgiving, you're likely aware that at most companies there is an unspoken expectation that employees tend to emails at all hours. It would be easy to blame heartless managers or short-sighted CEOs for the collapsing boundaries between work and life. But the causes of this cultural shift are far more complex. As Americans, we pride ourselves on hard work and self-sacrifice. As human beings, we thrive on feeling needed. Neurologically, certain elements of work can be addictive. Studies have found that satisfying curiosity about a novel event -- say, a new and unread email sitting in your inbox -- releases dopamine in the brain, which conditions us to check again and again. Despite the monumental shift in the accessibility of work, organizations continue to offer employees the same advice they did before the invention of the BlackBerry: Seek work/life balance. The idea holds inherent appeal. Too bad it's a myth. For many of us, compartmentalizing our work and personal life is simply not possible, and not just because of the ubiquity of email. In a growing number of companies, work now involves collaborating with colleagues in different time zones, making the start and end of the workday a moving target. And even within organizations with more traditional hours, let's face it -- standout employees are always working, even when they're not attending conference calls or corresponding over email. They're continuously plotting ahead and thinking up new ideas while showering, driving their kids to gymnastics, or drifting off to sleep. Until we come to terms with the fact that separating work from home is a fantasy, we can't begin to have an intelligent conversation about what it means to create thriving organizations. We can bemoan the blending of our professional and personal lives, or alternatively, we can look for innovative solutions. For the past decade I have been studying the science of human motivation, paying particular attention to how people can work more effectively. Over the course of reviewing thousands of academic articles for my book, I have repeatedly encountered a striking gap between the latest science and the realities of the modern workplace. Take, for example, the degree of control employees at your company possess over when and where they work. We tend to assume that granting workers too much leeway will lead to reduced effort; that employees will take advantage unless they are closely supervised. Yet studies have repeatedly found that the opposite is true. Providing employees with more control over their schedule --to the extent that flexibility is possible -- motivates them to work harder, produce higher-quality work, and develop greater loyalty for their company. Why is this the case? For one thing, placing employees in control of their schedules encourages them to work during hours when they are most effective, instead of requiring them to sit comatose in front of a computer because it's not yet 5 p.m. Most adults function best in the first few hours after waking. Others are sharper in the afternoon. Flexible work schedules allow employees in both camps to leverage their best hours instead of conforming to an artificial eight-hour ""shift"" -- one that was originally designed to maximize the productivity of a factory, not human beings. Studies also show that employees with flexible schedules work more intensely. It's because as humans, we are motivated by a norm of reciprocity. When a manager grants us the freedom of a flexible schedule, we seek to ""repay"" that benefit by investing greater effort. Productivity aside, flexible working offers another crucial benefit -- it allows employees to resolve critical personal matters when needed, so that they can bring sharper focus and clarity to their work. No wonder workplace flexibility has been linked with a host of positive well-being outcomes, including higher job satisfaction, lower stress, and reduced work-family conflict. We live in a world in which it is acceptable for work to interrupt personal time. And yet we're not as comfortable when personal time interrupts work. Why? When organizations provide employees with a clear set of goals and entrust them to manage their time responsibly, making it acceptable for a worker to take an hour during the day to attend a yoga class, visit an elderly parent or welcome his or her child off the afternoon school bus, they generate commitment that ends up saving them money in the long term. Just ask Patagonia, a successful outdoor clothing manufacturer. Employees at the company's California headquarters are empowered to set their own hours, given access to an on-site daycare and invited to take regular breaks during the day for exercise. Company restrooms even include private showers, transforming the prospect of an afternoon jog from an aspiration fantasy into a practical option. The result? Over the past five years, Patagonia's profits have tripled, while employee turnover has dropped to a fraction of the industry average. As for employee satisfaction? In the words of Billy Smith, a 26-year-old Patagonia product tester, ""Landing this job was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like I represent the brand as much as it represents me."" Instead of endorsing the work-life balance myth, organizations are far better off empowering employees to integrate work and life, in ways that position them to succeed at both. Ultimately, it is companies that are quickest to realize that it is in their financial interests to care for the entire employee --not just the sliver of them that sits in the office for 40 hours a week -- that stand to gain the greatest benefits in the form of stronger loyalty, higher engagement, and top performance.","Ron Friedman: Many people like the idea of work-life balance, but it's a myth in America .

"A North Carolina detective justifiably shot a schizophrenic 18-year-old because he believed another officer's life was in danger, a group representing police officers said, offering an account vastly different from that of the late teen's outraged family. The North Carolina Police Benevolent Association laid out its version of what happened in Boiling Spring Lakes in a statement issued Wednesday, three days after Keith Vidal was killed. The most salient part was its defense of a Southport police detective for shooting Vidal after, in its view, determining that the teenager posed a ""deadly threat"" to another officer. The professional organization represents both these officers but not a sheriff's deputy also at the scene. ""(The) detective ... employed authorized law enforcement action to stop the continuing threat of deadly harm to (the officer) and others,"" the Police Benevolent Association concluded. The Southport detective's lawyer, W. James Payne, has told CNN affiliate WWAY that once investigations into the shooting are complete, ""All folks -- everybody -- will conclude that the officers acted appropriately."" Payne elaborated to CNN on Wednesday night, claiming that his client fired after Vidal made multiple attempts to stab the other officer with a screwdriver. The other officer was wearing a bulletproof vest and was not injured. Wednesday's statements are the most detailed public defense yet of the law enforcement officers involved in Sunday's incident. ""We can say, based on our preliminary findings, that we are very confident that the officers did what they should have under state law,"" the law enforcement trade association's director, John Midgette, said Wednesday night. ""It's a very tragic situation, but we do believe the officers."" Vidal's family has offered a starkly disparate view in its pleas this week for justice, as they see it, by holding the Southport detective directly responsible. ""My brother just needed help, and now he is dead,"" stepbrother Mark Ryan Wilsey said in an emotional video posted to CNN iReport. Wilsey was not there when his stepbrother was shot but wanted to speak on behalf of his family, he said Wednesday. ""This officer who shot my son needs to be behind bars,"" said Vidal's mother, Mary Wilsey. ""He needs to die the way my son died."" CNN first learned of the shooting through an iReport sent by a family friend. According to Mark Ryan Wilsey, Vidal had schizophrenia and ""was having an episode"" when his father contacted police to subdue him so he could get help. ""He's not doing very good. You've got to get him someplace,"" a man who identified himself as Vidal's stepfather said on a 911 call, a copy of which was obtained by CNN affiliate WECT. ""He wants to fight his mother. ... She's scared to death of him right now."" The caller said that Vidal ""won't take his medication"" and his family has had ""to put him in before, (and) he's getting real bad again."" Mark Ryan Wilsey said Wednesday that Boiling Spring Lakes police were familiar with  Vidal, having gone to the family's house at least three times before. And the family has no qualms with the first two law enforcement officers who responded -- one from Boiling Spring Lakes police and the other a Brunswick County Sheriff's deputy -- with the stepbrother saying they ""did nothing wrong."" ""All they did was taze my brother and try to get him into handcuffs so he couldn't harm himself,"" said Mark Ryan Wilsey, who wasn't at the scene but relayed his family's account. ""They had the situation under control."" But the family says the situation unnecessarily took a turn for the worse when the Southport detective arrived. Stepfather Mark Wilsey told WECT that Vidal had been tased and was pinned when one of the officers said, ""We don't have time for this"" and fired his gun. Seventy seconds after the third officer arrived, WECT reported, citing police records, police radioed that the teenager had been shot in self-defense. Boiling Spring Lakes police and the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office have both cleared their officers involved in the case after finding, in internal reviews, no evidence they'd violated policy or state law. Southport police put its detective -- the man the benevolent association says shot Vidal -- on paid administrative leave, a step that Midgette said is standard for any officer involved in a fatal shooting. Police Chief Jerry Dove said Wednesday that the detective's record is spotless, adding that his department hasn't had an officer-involved shooting in about 20 years. Asked about his detective's judgment in shooting an 18-year-old who his family said weighed about 100 pounds, Dove said, ""Well, that's what I'm waiting for when I hear all the inquiries that are made."" Specifically, the State Bureau of Investigation and the chief prosecutor for the state's 13th Judicial District are both looking into the matter. The North Carolina Police Benevolent Association said it ""welcomes"" these investigations, but at the same time that it ""assigned local counsel"" to look into the matter. Its director, Midgette, explained this investigation consisted of talking to two officers involved who are members of -- and thus represented by -- his association. The group said that three officers from three agencies responded to Vidal's house ""due to the dangerous nature of the call."" Vidal ""failed to comply with repeated requests to surrender the deadly weapon,"" which the 911 caller said was a screwdriver, the Police Benevolent Association reported. What the officers did next -- such as using a Taser -- were ""authorized and necessary law enforcement procedures ... to promote safety for everyone involved, including Vidal,"" the group added. The detective fired after Vidal ""made physical contact with the (Boiling Spring Lakes officer) using the hand holding the deadly weapon,"" the police association said in its statement. ""The officers present realized the immediate and deadly threat to (the officer's) life,"" said the group. The pain and perhaps anger felt by Vidal's family is understandable. Yet Midgette said that it is important to understand too that the challenges faced by law enforcement, who sometimes have to decide, in a split second, whether they need to act to save their, one of their colleagues or someone else's life. ""Officers struggle every time they are put in a situation like this, because they are human beings, too,"" said the state benevolent association's leader. ""It is always a tragedy, no matter how justified (the use of force) might be.""","Lawyer: Detective fired after Vidal tried to stab another officer multiple times .

"Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst canceled a meeting with the Des Moines Register editorial board Thursday, a move that the newspaper's publisher and president described as ""rare."" Ernst was scheduled to meet with the editorial board Thursday morning and skipped out in a ""last minute"" move Wednesday afternoon, Des Moines Register publisher Rick Green confirmed to CNN. ""I think that Iowa voters were cheated because of the fact that she didn't appear and have more of a chance to articulate details on her strategy, vision and long term priorities,"" Green said. He said that her absence will ""not be the deciding factor"" in which candidate the editorial board chooses to endorse in the race. The Braley campaign pounced on Ernst's cancellation of the Register in a conference call Thursday afternoon, calling her move a ""major change in strategy for the Ernst campaign."" ""I know she made mistakes recently where she accidentally revealed her extreme positions...but those are not good reasons to hide from an open conversation to help voters make decisions,"" said Sarah Benzing, Braley's campaign manager.

""And it's one that many voters across our state seem to disagree with."" Ernst, currently an Iowa state senator, is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley. The pair is locked in a tight race with a Quinnipiac University poll from Thursday morning showing Ernst leading Braley at 48 percent and 46 percent respectively.

"This worn-down, one stoplight town found redemption Friday night in a Baptist church named Victory. Cheers broke out in the pews as two Florida lawmakers abandoned their quest to strip Hampton of its cityhood. The battle for the 89-year-old city's survival began in February with the release of a scathing audit that read like a textbook of municipal malfeasance -- finding 31 violations of local, state and federal codes, along with allegations of nepotism, double-dipping and personal use of city property. Surviving was a sweet win for this city of just 477 residents -- 476 if you don't count the former mayor, who's sitting up the road in jail on a drug charge. Already a notorious speed trap, the place gained even more infamy as a symbol of small-town corruption when the legislators threatened last month to yank its city charter. Late-night comedians mocked Hampton as ""too Florida, even for Florida."" But even as Conan and the rest of world cackled, even as investigators carted boxes of documents out of Hampton City Hall, even as some residents pointed fingers, others rolled up their sleeves and started to turn their city around. In just four short weeks, they came up with a plan that convinced state Rep. Charles Van Zant and Sen. Rob Bradley to spare their city. They won an uphill fight nobody thought they could win. ""Thank you for the work that has been done,"" Bradley told the crowd of 50 gathered Friday at Victory Baptist Church. ""You've got a lot more to do, but boy. ..."" He clearly was impressed, and so was Van Zant, who said, ""You've done yeoman's work. I think you've done well."" The trouble began innocently enough, said John Cooper, Hampton's newly appointed city attorney. A Texaco station out on nearby U.S. 301 asked for police protection after a few bad traffic accidents and a couple of homicides. And so, Hampton agreed to annex a 1,200-foot stretch of highway. Only later did someone come up with the idea that there was plenty of easy money to be made from catching speeders and writing tickets, just like neighboring cities Waldo and Lawtey were doing. The scandal that set tongues wagging . The way the city map was redrawn, it looked like a giant mosquito, with Hampton sucking money directly from the highway. Problem was, the police department constantly overspent its budget, and all that ticket revenue never seemed to benefit anybody outside of City Hall. The police department swelled to 19 officers, including the chief. But Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith said many of the officers weren't trained properly, and the audit found that some of them drove uninsured vehicles. One officer, nicknamed ""Rambo,"" dressed in tactical gear and strapped an assault rifle across his chest -- just to write tickets. 2011 was Hampton's bumper year for tickets -- and it was the year Van Zant was caught by Hampton's radar guns. The lawmaker promptly paid his ticket, but the experience reminded him of the growing stack of citizen complaints. In April 2013, Van Zant asked the state auditor general to look into the city's finances. Mayor Barry Layne Moore was sitting in the Bradford County jail in February when the audit was formally released. He and other city officials suspected it would be bad. But nobody had any idea how bad. Read the audit (PDF) How bad was it? So bad that legislators Bradley and Van Zant immediately called for Hampton's demise. In addition to the code violations, the audit found plenty of other eye-popping irregularities -- a $132,000 credit account at the local BP station, for example, and $27,000 in credit card charges for items that ""served no public purpose."" Van Zant accused Hampton of ""abusing the public,"" while Bradley wondered, ""Why is this even a city?"" When they met with Hampton's citizens last month, the two men were taken aback by the passion of residents' pleas to spare their city. Some said yanking the charter would be like victimizing them twice. The lawmakers listened, and threw down a challenge: If the city didn't clean up its act soon, they vowed to move forward with a bill to dissolve the city's charter -- an extreme measure, for sure. It would be the first time anyone could remember the Florida Legislature taking away a municipality's right to govern itself. The legislators never expected Hampton would meet the challenge. But Hampton surprised them. Four people -- call them The Replacements -- led the city's charge. Myrtice McCullough became the acting mayor after Moore was arrested on a charge of selling a single 30-milligram oxycodone pill to an undercover informant. Moore hadn't been part of the problem; he came into office as a reformer. But he didn't have time to be part of the solution, getting arrested less than two months after taking office. His replacement pleaded with the legislators to give Hampton another chance and last month handed up a petition with 119 signatures. She softened their outrage by asking for their help. The Rev. Dan Williams was appointed to the City Council when Charles Norris Hall resigned in the midst of the scandal. Williams' family has lived in Hampton since the 1920s, and his talents include inspiring oratory and organizing armies of multiskilled volunteers. Amy Davis stepped in as city clerk; she knows Hampton, having worked as the clerk once before. Davis understands how to use accounting software and knows how to apply for grants and follow money trails. Already, she has discovered that Hampton is only $6,425 in the red this year -- a shortfall that can easily be corrected. Cooper took over as the city attorney. Not only does he know municipal law and how to connect the dots, he's working for the city free of charge. The lawmakers were swayed by the progress Hampton has made under the new leadership. In just four weeks, Hampton: . • Accepted the resignation of every elected official who was in office when the scandal broke and called for a special election in September to seat new ones; . • Agreed to get rid of its police force; . • Accounted for the $132,000 spent at the BP station across from City Hall; . • Accounted for the $27,000 credit card balance; . • Started tracking the city's water meters; . • Drafted an ordinance de-annexing the section of U.S. 301 where the speed trap operated; . • And began holding City Council meetings at regular hours and opening them to the public. ""What you've seen here in the past month is the rebirth of your town,"" Van Zant told the residents as Friday's meeting came to a close. ""I want to encourage everybody who has never served on the City Council to run for office. ... We want some new blood. We want to see a new genesis in Hampton. Make this thing work for you."" The lawmakers say they will return to Hampton once more to follow up on the city's progress. The next visit is planned for a Friday night in September, after the new council is elected. This time, there are plans for a good, old-fashioned Southern barbecue.","Florida lawmakers decide to spare city caught in corruption scandal .

The Texas A&M quarterback and 2012 Heisman trophy winner -- better known by his aww-shucks, all-American nickname, Johnny Football -- was not allowed to give any interviews, in accordance with head coach Kevin Sumlin's rules for all freshmen players. Once the regular season ended, and Johnny Football hysteria hit its height, Sumlin lifted the ban. Finally, a chance to get to know more about the superstar quarterback about whom, despite all his nationally televised on-field fireworks, so much was still shrouded in pigskin-scented mystery. ""What will he say?"" ""What's he like?"" Eager fans and sports writers couldn't wait for the public Johnny Football to emerge. And he did --uneventfully -- on November 26, 2012. But now, after another scandal in an offseason that has been too eventful,  Manziel and fans alike may have been better off with the Private Johnny Football. On Sunday it was revealed that Manziel is the subject of an NCAA investigation for possibly being paid to autograph football memorabilia, which would violate the NCAA's rules prohibiting athletes from making money by ""promoting or advertising the commercial sale of a product or service."" And so Johnny Football's roller coaster of unprecedented success and relentless scandal continues. Here's a recap of some of his other highs and lows. February 2, 2011: The highly recruited quarterback officially signs with Texas A&M. Manziel was the nation's 14th-ranked QB prospect and agrees to take a redshirt his freshman season. June 29, 2012: Manziel is arrested in College Station, Texas, after a bar fight. He's charged with fighting, failure to identify and possession of fake IDs. November 11, 2012: Manziel leads Texas A&M to the biggest upset of the college football season, beating Alabama 29-24. Manziel throws for 253 yards and two touchdowns and rushes for another 93 yards. Johnny Football Fever spreads across the country. December 8, 2012: Manziel becomes the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, after a record-breaking season during which he threw for 3,706 yards and ran for 1,410 and 21 touchdowns. Fellow Heisman finalist Manti Te'o said the dual-threat Manziel ""is a human video game."" December 24, 2012: Manziel plays golf with Jonas Brothers Joe and Nick. Whether this is a high or a low depends on your radio presets. January 4: Johnny Football ends his season with a 41-13 pounding of Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl. He's named the game's MVP after throwing and rushing for more than 200 yards each. January 5: Johnny Football begins his offseason by partying at a Houston nightclub ... with his parents reportedly in attendance. Pictures of Manziel end up on TMZ -- including one of him flexing while chomping on a sparkler. He also posts an Instagram photo showing off his legal winnings from an Oklahoma casino. It's relatively harmless stuff, but the ""party boy"" reputation soon leads to concerns and quotes like these... January 16: Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops says of Manziel, ""If they can keep him out of jail or keep him eligible, he's gonna be pretty good."" Stoops then adds of the occasionally oversharing quarterback, ""If they can keep him off Twitter, he might win three or four Heismans."" March 7: Manziel tweets, ""Spring Break! Finally ready for some time with the crew and well needed trip to Cabo!""  Pictures follow -- lots of them. Many people wonder aloud if it's OK that a college student on spring break is having a really good time. May 17: Manziel takes batting practice with the San Diego Padres and hits a home run, of course. June 16: He tweets ""Bulls--- like tonight is a reason why I can't wait to leave college station...whenever it may be."" The apparently anti-A&M post is dissected and criticized by sports analysts around the country. It's later revealed the message was in reference to a parking ticket Manziel received. He later tweets fans should try to ""walk a day in my shoes."" Both tweets have been deleted. July 13: Manziel is a no-show for a Saturday morning appearance at the Manning Passing Academy in Louisiana, where 1,200 campers were expecting him. He later told the staff that he wasn't feeling well and stayed in. The quarterback was then sent home, reportedly by Archie Manning, igniting new questions about his maturity and ability to handle the spotlight. The next week, A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin said, ""I think, off the field, there's no question he's made some mistakes."" July 15: Two days later, Manziel pleads guilty to possessing a fake driver's license and was fined $2,000 in that 2012 bar fight case. August 4: ESPN reports the NCAA is investigating whether Manziel was paid for autographs. The Heisman winner could be suspended if it's determined he did receive money.","Johnny Manziel is under investigation amid allegations of being paid to sign items .

"(CNN)It's all fun and games in the world of comic book movies -- until pro football gets involved. Chris Pratt and Chris Evans -- two of the hottest actors in Hollywood because of their superhero roles in recent Marvel Studios movies -- are waging a friendly feud on Twitter, resulting in an epic bet over the Super Bowl. In one corner, we have ""Captain America's"" Evans, a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the New England Patriots. Evans landed the first blow Monday with a tweet to Pratt that said in part, ""For the next 2 weeks, you are not my friend, you are my enemy."" In the other corner, we have Pratt, the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star, who roots for the Seattle Seahawks. Pratt quickly fired back with a dig at Evans' Marvel character. Then Evans upped the ante. Pratt framed the first half of the bet: If the Patriots lose, Evans must come to Seattle and visit a children's hospital in his superhero duds and waving a Seahawks fan-club flag. And Evans responded in turn, daring Pratt to come to a Boston pediatric cancer center dressed as Star-Lord from ""Guardians."" And so the bet is on. It's always possible that this exchange is a joke or a promotional stunt -- Evans' Captain America co-stars in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" hitting theaters May 1 -- but the Super Bowl just got a little more exciting. Now Marvel just hopes the two will mend fences after the game on February 1.","Marvel stars Chris Evans and Chris Pratt made a Twitter bet over the Super Bowl .

"Jeremy Meeks' steely baby blues and chiseled cheekbones may be attractive. His rap sheet -- not so much. The 30-year-old  stirred a collective swoon nationwide after authorities in Stockton, California, posted his arrest mugshot on social media this week. The picture  turned him into an overnight celebrity and prompted various memes, including photo shop images replacing his plain white T-shirt with spiffy high-end suits. But authorities say he's not such a model citizen. And this is not his first time behind bars. Meeks, a convicted felon who's served years in prison, was arraigned Friday on counts related to firearm possession, gang membership and probation violation. In the latest arrest, Stockton police stopped him and two others Wednesday during a joint law enforcement gang sweep, authorities said. Meeks was driving and one of the passengers, Terry Bailey, 23, was on probation. ""A search of the passenger compartment yielded a 9mm round of ammunition and a small amount of what is believed to be marijuana,"" the San Joaquin County District Attorney said in a statement.  ""A search of the trunk located an unregistered and loaded ....45 caliber semiautomatic handgun along with two extended magazines."" They did not say whom the guns belonged to, but everyone in the car faces felony weapons charges. Drawing fans ... Meeks' prior brushes with the law include resisting arrest and admitted ties to the Crips gang, authorities said. He also spent two years in prison in 2002 for a grand theft conviction, according to the District Attorney's office. ""With his past history, he got out of being incarcerated and put his mind on focus to his family and started doing what he had to do,"" his brother, Bryan Varela, told CNN affiliate KOVR. ""Living the dream that he always wanted."" Despite his ill fame, the fans keep coming. His arrest mugshot is still a talker on social media. On Facebook, someone created a Jeremy Meeks fan page, which had nearly 90,000 Likes and counting early Saturday. ""Criminal or not, if he looks good he just looks good,"" Santana Martin posted under his picture. ""People are not saying he's right for whatever he did. They're just saying he looks good enough to make a mugshot look like a photo shoot."" ... and critics . But others are unswayed by his looks. ""The women who think that this guy is hot are only fueling the fire of criminals and crime, and if they're too ignorant to realize that then they deserve him,"" Clark Foreid posted. His fans may have to wait a little longer before they see him out of the jail setting. During the arraignment, authorities raised his bail to $1 million from $900,000 a day earlier. His next court appearance is Friday. Katherine Angier, who said she's his mother, has launched a fundraiser for his defense at crowdsourcing website GoFundMe. She posted pictures of Meeks with his son and other family members, describing him as a father and a husband who was on his way to work when he was arrested. He has no ties to any gang, she said. ""He has old tattoos ... which causes him to be stereotyped,"" she wrote on the fundraiser page. ""He's my son and he is so sweet. Please help him to get a fair trial or else he'll be railroaded."" By early Saturday, she had raised $2,000. And some commenters on GoFundMe have raised a ruckus, blasting her efforts on her son's behalf.","Meeks, 30, became an Internet sensation after police released his mugshot .

"Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resort will no longer allow visitors with disabilities instant access to rides, starting next month, in an attempt to reduce abuse of the policy. Under the current policy, Disney visitors can get a guest assistance card that grants quicker access to rides, often entering through exit doors to bypass the main lines. There were widespread reports of able-bodied people abusing the policy. Some wealthy park visitors were hiring disabled people to pretend to be family members so they could skip lines, the New York Post reported in May. Social researcher Wednesday Martin learned about the practice while researching a book about New York's Park Avenue elite, the Post reported. ""It really is happening,"" Martin told CNN's ""Starting Point"" in May. Starting October 9, guests with a new disability access card will be issued a ticket with a time to enter an attraction, based on the current wait time, so they don't have to stay in line. Disney fan site Miceage.com broke the news of the policy change last week. Disney World vows action after report of wealthy hiring disabled to skip lines . No proof of disability is required under either the current or new policies.  Asked why Disney couldn't keep the current system and require disabled guests to provide proof of disability, Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said, ""Due to confidentiality laws, we're limited in the information we can ask."" ""We have an unwavering commitment to making our parks accessible to all guests,"" Brown said in a statement. ""Given the increasing volume of requests we receive for special access to our attractions, we are changing our process to create a more consistent experience for all our guests while providing accommodations for guests with disabilities. We engaged disability groups, such as Autism Speaks, to develop this new process, which is in line with the rest of our industry."" Brown stressed that the program is different from the parks' FastPass program, which issues a limited number of FastPasses per hour for certain attractions. A guest using the new disability card would get a return time based on the actual wait time for the ride. Erin Moya, whose 4-year-old son has spina bifida, agreed that there needed to be a change to stop the abuse. But she worried that the new system makes things more complicated for families that really need help. To Disney, or not to Disney? ""For example, my son, similar to many others living with disabilities, has special medical procedures that have to be done at a specific frequency throughout the day,"" Moya, of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, wrote in an e-mail. ""To then have to worry about 'scheduling' rides is just one more complication to add to a visit that is probably already more complex than most people realize."" Disney, which is starting to train its employees on the new policy this week, will release more details of the program closer to the October 9 rollout date, Brown said.  Guests who still have concerns about the policy can talk to guest relations about their assistance needs, she added. Annual passholder Sheryl Gangano of San Jose, California, says the policy change may cause her to drop her annual pass and reduce her seven to 10 annual trips to Disneyland. Gangano, who has complex regional pain syndrome, can walk but experiences ""excruciating pain"" from the lightest of touches or when she stands or sits in one position for too long. ""It makes it a challenge to be able to go and enjoy the park,"" she said. ""I will need to figure out how to structure my visits differently and become more aware of my pain. This is unfortunate, as one of the things Disneyland has given me is that escape."" Ellen Seidman, whose family is heading to Disneyland for the first time in December, is willing to give Disney the benefit of the doubt during the rollout. ""Disney has an admirable history of accommodating guests with special needs,"" she wrote on her ""Love that Max"" blog about kids with special needs. ""There are wheelchairs and Electric Convenience Vehicles available for rent, special dietary offerings at most restaurants, designated relief areas for service animals, plus options for guests with hearing and visual impairment. I can't imagine that Disney would ever leave kids with special needs in the (pixie) dust. ""Parents of kids with special needs sure aren't shy about speaking up when something isn't working. If the realities of the new program prove too hard to handle, the parks will hear about it -- and hopefully make adjustments accordingly."" What do you think of Disney's new program? Please share in the comments section below.","Able-bodied people were reportedly using Disney's disability policy .

"Washington (CNN)South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is toying with the idea of a presidential bid, joked in a private gathering this month that ""white men who are in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency,"" according to an audio recording of his comments provided to CNN. In the meeting, the Republican also cracked wise about Baptists, saying ""they're the ones who drink and don't admit it,"" a variation of a joke he sometimes tells in public. Graham's folksy sense of humor and his shoot-from-the-hip style are part of his political appeal, and well-known to journalists and his colleagues in the Senate. But the behind-closed-doors remarks are a departure from the G-rated jokes he tells in public, and another reminder for politicians in the iPhone era that they are rarely far from a microphone, no matter how private the setting. The audio snippets were provided to CNN on Wednesday by two separate South Carolina Democrats who received the recordings from a person using an anonymous Gmail address. Graham confirmed the recordings in an interview Wednesday with CNN. The person didn't provide details on his background but told the Democrats that Graham was speaking to an ""all-male club"" in Charleston earlier this month, the Democrats said. Both of the Democrats wished to remain anonymous. After CNN contacted his campaign, Graham said in the interview that he made the comments several weeks ago at a  meeting of the Hibernian Society of Charleston, the Irish-Catholic charity organization that sometimes hosts big-name politicians for irreverent and frequently bawdy speeches. Graham said the Hibernian Society encourages speakers ""to be earthy, to make fun of yourself, to make fun of them. Then you say something serious and sit down. And if you talk over 20 minutes, they throw something at you."" In the recordings, Graham, who is favored in his race for re-election next Tuesday against Democrat Brad Hutto, appears to joke about the possible 2016 presidential bid he recently floated in an interview with the Weekly Standard. ""I'm trying to help you with your tax status,"" Graham says in the recording. ""I'm sorry the government's so f---ed up. If I get to be president, white men in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency."" The crowd is then heard laughing. In another clip, Graham asks, ""We got any Presbyterians here? We got any Baptists? They're the ones that drink and don't admit it."" Again, the crowd chuckles. Contacted about the recording, Graham's campaign arranged for the senator to speak about the remarks by phone from South Carolina. The Hibernian Society hosts an annual St. Patrick's Day banquet that, in the past, has been headlined by top political figures like Vice President Joe Biden and former Vice President Dick Cheney. ""I have never been to the Gridiron Dinner, but it's a little like that,"" Graham said. His October visit to the society was a separate event, he said, but the spirit was the same. ""I hope this doesn't reflect poorly on the club,"" he said. ""They are great guys."" Graham said he was making fun of the society's all-male membership, joking that they were the last such organization in existence after Augusta National Golf Club admitted women. As for the Baptist riff, Graham said he regularly teases South Carolina audiences about their various religious denominations, before making a larger point about religious liberty in the United States and warning about the threat of radical Islam overseas.","Lindsey Graham spoke at a private club in October .

"Another proposal for change is surfacing at the NCAA. The body that regulates athletics at the vast majority of U.S. colleges and universities is thinking about redefining academic fraud. There has been some confusion in the last few years about exactly what the NCAA's responsibility is when it came to academic fraud on campus. So the organization's Academic Cabinet ordered a review, deciding that for an academic scandal to lead to violations there needs to be both a nexus to a school's athletics department, and it needs to affect the eligibility of athletes. ""Now that it's clarified, do we like it?"" said Carolyn Callahan, who chairs the 23-member Academic Cabinet. ""How much institutional autonomy do we want? How much oversight do we want?"" Callahan said those questions were brought to the committee long before a firestorm of public pressure on the NCAA to revisit its decision not to sanction the University of North Carolina over its ""paper class"" scandal, saying it involved more  students than just athletes. As CNN first reported, congressional hearings could be the upshot of inaction by the NCAA on the UNC scandal; U.S. Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California, is sending a letter to NCAA President Mark Emmert demanding answers about the NCAA's handling of it. Two years ago, UNC's internal investigation uncovered that several athletes were enrolled in classes where little or no work was required. A grand jury in Orange County, North Carolina, recently indicted a former professor who allegedly accepted money for teaching those ""no-show"" classes. Cardenas, a member of the House oversight committee, told CNN he is prepared to issue subpoenas and call for a hearing if Emmert doesn't provide substantive answers to his letter. Callahan said there have been some passionate discussions among the Academic Cabinet members the last few meetings. The next meeting is in June, and she said there is a possibility that during that meeting they will make recommendations to the NCAA leadership council, which meets again later in the summer. ""Everyone assumes because of the timing this is a UNC issue,"" Callahan said. ""This came up first on our agenda way before the UNC case. Everything the NCAA does takes a long time. The cabinet only meets three times a year for a day and half, and that's not the only thing on the agenda. ""Certainly, all of us are aware of it, but that's not the impetus for the discussion, and it's not the only case we're talking about,"" she said. The NCAA Legislative Council recently said a discussion of academic misconduct will ""occur in the new governance structure"" that would include new members to the board of directors and giving five major Division I conferences more power in making decisions affecting student-athletes. Juggling too much? But Gerald Gurney, a former compliance director who worked in collegiate athletics for 30 years, is skeptical there will be academic fraud changes. ""They are trying to divert attention from what I consider to be a most obvious case of outrageous academic fraud, to needing a redefinition of academic fraud,"" Gurney said. Gurney and another professor, David Ridpath at Ohio University, just started research that will compare what is known about UNC's academic scandal to other institution's academic scandals and how they were handled by the NCAA. Gurney said he suspects this may be the NCAA's way of getting around taking a second look at what happened at UNC. ""From what I see at the moment, I feel strongly it is the worst academic fraud violation in the history of the NCAA,"" Gurney said. ""... They choose to ignore it. They are juggling so many balls right now, with respect to lawsuits, unionization issues, they really can't afford right at this moment to open up a major investigation on North Carolina. It would further jeopardize public confidence in the NCAA's ability to control athletics."" He frames it with ""from what I see at the moment,"" because the full breadth of what happened at UNC is still trickling out, two years after it was first reported by the News & Observer of Raleigh. UNC has long insisted that the paper classes were solely the idea of one man -- now-indicted professor Julius Nyang'oro, who was head of the African-American studies department. The school says it has instituted reforms to ensure such academic problems don't recur. A third look at UNC scandal . This year, shortly after CNN reported the findings of whistleblower Mary Willingham that showed a shocking number of functionally illiterate and ill-prepared student athletes at the prestigious public school, UNC announced it commissioned its third review of the scandal. Whistleblower leaves: 'It's been a hostile work environment' This time, former U.S. Justice Department attorney Ken Wainstein is taking a look. Among his questions: Did members of the athletic department know and talk about the paper classes? Previous reports commissioned by UNC said no. Another question: How long was this happening? There is still no clear answer on that, either. Meanwhile, Willingham says she expects to play a role in the upcoming civil case of former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon vs. the NCAA. O'Bannon is suing to allow student-athletes to be compensated the use of their name and likeness. Several NCAA critics have told CNN they believe the NCAA refuses to look at the fraud at UNC because it might mean conceding their biggest argument against paying players -- that they athletes are paid in the form of an education. ""The umbilical cord between the student and the athlete is being slowly cut and if it's cut I think that has very serious consequences for the NCAA,"" said Tom McMillen, former basketball star-turned-congressman and a member of the University of Maryland's Board of Regents. ""Athletes are not given an education. They step out of the university and they may have a degree, but they don't have an education and that's the sad thing about it."" McMillen has advised those pushing for reform -- most recently those behind the attempt by Northwestern University football players to unionize -- to go after the NCAA over the way they handle academic fraud. He said during a forum at the Aspen Institute that academic fraud is ""the chink in the armor"" of the NCAA. Power conferences may get more autonomy . Whether that pressure is working remains to be seen, but never before have there been so many consecutive pushes for reform. As O'Bannon's case goes to court this summer, the Northwestern union case will be moving through appeal, and an antitrust lawsuit filed by four current athletes to eliminate the compensation cap will be making its way through the first stages of the civil court process. Emmert, the NCAA president, has spent the last few weeks making waves with polarizing media interviews. It all led to an NCAA board of directors meeting on Thursday and a proposal to give more power to five so-called power conferences and their 65 universities. In turn the schools would be able to give more benefits like having the option of increasing stipends for athletes to keep up with the cost of attending college and other small pleasures, like paying for airline flights to championship games for their families. A final vote will be taken in August. The changes are in line with what reformists want. But Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association and the main force behind the Northwestern union attempt, cautions on the NCAA's motives. For 13 years (the NCAA) has fought all of these changes and now that their backs are against the ropes,"" Huma said, referencing the legal actions. ""They had no choice but to gravitate towards the goals that we've set to pursue. It's definitely a step in the right direction, but it's not quite voluntary. It's not that schools and conferences are coming to their senses, it's that players are mobilizing and forcing change.""","NCAA looking at two elements of definition of academic fraud .

"When the global financial crisis struck in 2008, markets across the world reeled, the housing market turned on its side, redundancies were rampant and the investment landscape transformed overnight. As banks turned off the taps on loans, budding entrepreneurs without a track record had to find new ways to raise capital to fund growth. Along came crowdfunding, which allowed the power of people to finance projects. As a return on their investments, these so-called crowdfunders gained an equity stake, and often a sense of pride from having financed something they believe in. Anyone who has an idea for a creative concept can post it on a website and ask backers to fund it, whether it be a new product, gadget or artistic project. Highly-connected, mobile and flexible, the crowdfunding model can react to change faster than traditional companies. CNN recently visited Hamburg-based start-up Protonet, which turned to the crowds for financing its secure personal servers which are produced onsite. ""We said ok, this is what we're going to do. We're going to take our story and our vision of what we believe the future should look like, and tell it to the crowd and see what happens,"" explained Ali Jelveh, founder of Protonet, to CNN's Diana Magnay at the company's office. What happened next?  In less than an hour and a half, Protonet had raised $1 million. ""It's a profit-sharing agreement, so if we get big and have huge success, which we'll hopefully have, you'll be a part of that. Plus, you also get one of our latest products,""said Jelveh. Protonet's crowdfunding accounts for about 65% of its total investment. ""I believe that in the future we will see companies that are 100% crowdfunded,"" added Jelveh. Crowdfunding taps into an online community with the goal of generating small contributions from large numbers of people. The dilemma for the crowdfunding industry ahead is to sort out the level of risk involved, who companies are actually marketing to and who they want to invest in their platforms, said Ben Yearsley, head of investment research for Charles Stanley Direct . ""So the future is interesting. There's a need for funding but you've got this issue of risk and the levels of investment that have to be solved,"" Yearsley told Magnay. It's an industry that is finding its feet, but some believe that the crowdfunding approach will have a place in how businesses are funded in the future. ""If you look at how start-ups were financed before, many of them raised 100,000 Euros through friends and family which is like crowdfunding,"" said Oliver Gajda, chairman of the European Crowdfunding Network. ""So this is bringing this to the digitalized world, the tools that we have into the public, and I think this is what is driving the change,"" said Gajda, who forecasts that many entrepreneurs ahead may first have a round of business angel funding and then move on to crowdfunding to help reap the benefits of marketing while also raising capital. While Protonet celebrates another sale of one of its servers, the small German start-up thinks the crowd could become a powerful force in finance. ""I think it's going to be an earthquake, and I believe it's going to fundamentally change the way things are funded,"" said Jelveh.","Crowdfunding's goal is to generate small contributions from large numbers of people .
New products and gadgets are posted online, seeking backers for funding .
Crowdfunding is similar to a start-up model, with friends and family raising funds ."
"(CNN) -- Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said Tuesday that Federal Emergency Management Agency tried to control the outcome of a scientific study on formaldehyde in trailers used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina. FEMA trailers are shipped to the Gulf Coast by train in March 2006. ""Someone from one of the agencies, the CDC, came to our committee and reported that he had information that indicated that good science wasn't followed when a decision was made to allow people to live in basically travel trailers that were not designed to be lived in,"" said Lampson, chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology. In addition, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee -- Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi -- cited medical experts who said prolonged exposure to high levels of formaldehyde can cause ailments ranging from respiratory irritation to cancer. The committee recently obtained internal CDC e-mail which showed that ""despite the efforts of CDC professionals to bring these health risks to the public's attention, those concerns were thwarted by CDC leadership for roughly eight months,"" Thompson said. FEMA denies that it has suppressed any report, including one about formaldehyde prepared by a branch of the Centers for Disease Control. ""The health and safety of residents has been and continues to be our primary concern,"" FEMA said in a statement issued Monday.  Watch why the trailers are such a big concern » . ""Any and all allegations that FEMA ignored or manipulated formaldehyde-related research are unfounded and false. Such activities are completely contrary to our mission and our commitment to the victims of disaster,"" said Carlos Castillo, FEMA's assistant administrator for disaster assistance during the House Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday afternoon. Almost 150,000 households have lived in FEMA trailers at some point since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005. FEMA says about 40,000 families are still living in the travel trailers. Formaldehyde is a preservative used in construction materials like plywood. The Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as a probable human carcinogen, according to the EPA Web site. The site says the chemical can also be an irritant to the respiratory tract and the eyes. FEMA and the CDC say the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, an arm of the CDC, did an initial assessment for FEMA that wasn't intended to address the long-term effects of extended exposure to formaldehyde. ""ATSDR's original response focused on the acute health effects of formaldehyde exposure -- to meet the urgent needs expressed by FEMA in its original request,"" said a CDC statement. ""The initial consultation with ATSDR was intended to determine effective mitigation measures, and did not discuss long-term health impacts,"" a FEMA statement agreed. ""FEMA wanted to be able to put people into these trailers for long periods of time,"" Lampson said. ""They gave a report that apparently said that it was safe to go in for a couple of weeks and allowed people to go in. Well, it's been way past a couple of weeks and now people have been in them a year or 18 months."" ""One person [from the CDC] who came to us told us they wouldn't write the report,"" he said. ""That person was circumvented and another person at the agency agreed to write a report to say that levels of formaldehyde were safe for a couple of weeks."" FEMA received that initial report in February 2007. ""That study showed that ventilating the units is effective in reducing levels of formaldehyde,"" according to a FEMA fact sheet. FEMA and the CDC said it became apparent that more study was needed, so ATSDR went back to work and issued a new report in October. ""This revised report supports the initial report in that ventilation of travel trailers was effective in lowering formaldehyde levels,"" according to the FEMA statement issued Monday. ""It was revised to include a number of caveats relating to potential health impacts of long term exposure."" FEMA says it has offered everyone living in a travel trailer the option of moving to a hotel until alternative housing can be found. Meanwhile, the CDC has been doing a separate study of formaldehyde in the trailers. The results of that research are expected next month. FEMA pointed to that more comprehensive study in its statement issued Monday about the controversy, and added, ""In addition, FEMA already had begun an aggressive outreach campaign to occupants advising them of potential exposure to formaldehyde and offered those residents an option for immediate relocation to alternative housing,"" the FEMA statement said. Lampson said his subcommittee has requested copies of communications between FEMA and the CDC on the subject. ""Not following good science in advising people to do things as they try to recover from one tragedy is indeed a much greater tragedy this is compounding,"" he said. ""This appears perhaps to be the tip of an iceberg."" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Sean Callebs and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","FEMA denies allegations it suppressed report on trailers used by Katrina victims .

"Northwestern University will ask the National Labor Relations Board to review its decision allowing football players to unionize, arguing that student-athletes are not university employees but ""students, first and foremost."" In a statement Friday, the Illinois university said it will follow labor board procedures but requested a review of the decision, saying it ""overlooked or completely ignored"" critical university testimony and ""applied incorrect legal standards."" On Wednesday, the board ruled that football players at Northwestern University are employees and can unionize. ""Northwestern considers its students who participate in NCAA Division I sports, including those who receive athletic scholarships, to be students, first and foremost,"" Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in the statement. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity."" Cubbage added, ""Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns these students are raising. The life of a student-athlete is extremely demanding, but the academic side and the athletic side are inextricably linked."" Read the board's ruling (PDF) The university will ask for review with the full board to appeal the regional director's decision, Cubbage said. The university's request is due on April 9; the union's brief is due seven days later. If the board grants the review, it will set a briefing schedule for both parties, the statement said. The players' petition was a way to get a seat at the bargaining table in college sports and could change the landscape of the NCAA model. But the board's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships, working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions. The athletes have said they're seeking better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships and the possibility of being paid. But while former Northwestern quarterback CJ Bacher said he agrees with the reform issues set forth by the College Athletes Players Association and other groups, he doesn't think unionizing is the way to achieve those goals. ""While we agree with CAPA's stated objectives, the decision made by the NLRB ... is disconcerting to those of us that care deeply about the future success and stability of Northwestern athletics,"" Bacher said. Richard Epstein, labor law professor at New York University, said the ruling has ""vast implications for the structure of the sport, if upheld."" But he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve. The NCAA promptly said that while it wasn't party to the proceeding, it was ""disappointed"" with the board's ruling and disagreed ""with the notion that student-athletes are employees."" ""We frequently hear from student-athletes, across all sports, that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport, not to be paid,"" said the statement from NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy. ""While improvements need to be made, we do not need to completely throw away a system that has helped literally millions of students over the past decade alone attend college. ""We want student-athletes -- 99 percent of whom will never make it to the professional leagues -- focused on what matters most -- finding success in the classroom, on the field and in life."" Last week, Northwestern University's president emeritus said that if the football players were successful forming a union, he could see the prestigious private institution giving up Division I football. ""If we got into collective-bargaining situations, I would not take for granted that the Northwesterns of the world would continue to play Division I sports,"" Henry Bienen said at the annual conference for the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. He further said that if the players won their fight, private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited Duke and Stanford universities -- could abandon the current mode to preserve academic integrity. He compared it with the pullback of the Ivy League schools decades ago when their conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships, preserving the emphasis on academics for the players. ""In the 1950s, the 'Ivies' had some of the highest-ranked football teams in the country. The Princeton teams were ranked in the top five or 10 at that time. They continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams, but they've given up a certain kind of model of sports,"" he said, adding that ""under certain conditions"" the same could happen at other private elite universities that ""continue to play big-time sports."" Northwestern's appeal could go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court, and it could take years before there is a definitive decision. During his daylong testimony last week, former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter talked about year-round time requirements, at times 50 hours a week devoted to football. Colter said he had to give up his major related to pre-med studies because he couldn't fit the classes into his schedule. Colter's sentiment was echoed by the NCAA in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience. About 15% of men's football, baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes. Twelve percent of Division I football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted. The average time spent on athletics in season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports, according to the survey. That finding flies in the face of the NCAA 20-hour rule, which states that, no matter the sport, coaches can't take up more than 20 hours of their players' time.","Northwestern University to appeal decision allowing football players to unionize .

"Energy drinks can pose a real problem for children, according to a new study from the American Heart Association. Researchers found that 40% of the 5,156 calls to poison centers for ""energy drink exposure"" involved children under age 6.  In most of the cases, the parents didn't know the children had gotten hold of an energy drink.  Many of the calls reported the children were experiencing serious side effects, such as an abnormal heart rhythm, or they were having a seizure. The study is being presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions this week. Study: Caffeine affects teen boys more . Study author Dr. Steven Lipshultz has handled cases involving children who became sick after consuming energy drinks. While studies about the impact of caffeine on children are limited, Lipshultz, a professor and chairman of pediatrics at Wayne State University, said adolescents can experience serious problems after drinking only 100 mg of caffeine. Younger children would feel effects after drinking even less, he said. Some energy drinks contain more than 300 mg of caffeine and it can come in a combination of pharmaceutical-grade caffeine and ""natural"" additives. Earlier studies have shown caffeine combinations may cause more problems for people. Lipshultz said he believes the number of cases associated with energy drinks and children are higher than what's reported in this study.  That's because parents of children who get sick after consuming too much caffeine do not always call the hot line; they may go straight to the emergency room instead.  The study did not look at those numbers. ""The reported data probably represent the tip of the iceberg,"" Lipshultz said. ""This is a very concerning finding,"" said Dr. Laurence Sperling.  Sperling is the medical director of the preventive cardiology clinic at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. ""It further points out that we need to be very responsible about who utilizes energy drinks, because they are potentially harmful to adults, but as this report points out, may be of greater concern to those who are young."" The Food and Drug Administration does not set a standard for what is considered a safe amount of caffeine for children.  The American Academy of Pediatrics prefers children consume no caffeine, although about 73% of children do every day, according to their research.  Children and adolescents are the fastest growing population of caffeine users, studies show. Can you OD on caffeine? For healthy adults, the FDA suggests moderate amounts of caffeine are not harmful.  The agency considers a ""moderate amount"" between 100 to 200 mg (one to two 5-ounce cups of coffee).  Other FDA guidance has cited 400 mg a day, or about four or five cups of coffee, ""as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects."" More than 600 mg a day is considered too much, according to the FDA, although the impact caffeine has on someone varies based on their size, their gender, or how sensitive they are to caffeine. The study's researchers would like the government to improve the labeling of energy drinks.  Energy drink makers are not required to list the amount of caffeine in a drink, because caffeine is not a nutrient, and the laws currently only require nutrients be listed in the dietary information on food or beverages. The American Beverage Association recommends that energy drink makers identify the quantity of caffeine from all sources. The association suggests listing this in a part of the label that is separate from the nutrition information.  The association also suggests including the advisory ""not (intended/recommended) for children, pregnant or nursing women (and/or persons/those) sensitive to caffeine.""  Monster Energy, for instance, added the caffeine content and warning to its labels in 2013.  But because this is not required by law, not all energy drink labels contain such warnings. In 2010 the FDA banned combination alcohol-and-energy drinks and calls to poison control centers for this particular combination fell sharply. Caffeine 101 . ""We should consider appropriate labeling in light of this finding to help protect those who are consciously drinking the energy drinks, but also to protect those who may be drinking them unaware,"" Sperling said.  ""We need to consider these energy drinks and their potential effects on the heart and vasculature and recognize that they are not benign.""","40% of ""energy drink exposure"" calls to poison control centers are for children under 6 .
Study authors believe the number is under-counted .

"(CNN) -- Storm-related power outages hit across the Northeast, leaving some chopping breadcrumbs by flashlight, cooking turkeys on the grill and watching Netflix on phones. Many New Englanders were without power -- but this was nothing new for the region. Tens of thousands spent Thanksgiving just as others did in New England when Turkey Day was first observed in the 17th century: without electricity. In New Hampshire, more than 133,000 customers were still without power early Friday. ""They're saying it will be a multiday event,"" said Fallon Reed, the assistant operations chief for the New Hampshire Division of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. In Maine, there were as many as 110,000 customers without electricity on Thanksgiving morning, but milder Turkey Day temperatures allowed for workers to cut that number down by more than two thirds by night's end. Central Maine Power Co. reported that less than 32,000 customers had no power, while Emera, the state's second-largest utility company, reported that less than 1,000 customers were without electricity after a Wednesday nor'easter dumped more than a foot of snow across a dozen Maine cities, WMTW reported. ""Heavy, wet snow brought down power lines and tree limbs interrupting service to thousands of people throughout Maine,"" Emera posted on its website. ""Crews will remain in the field through the overnight hours and into Friday until all customers are fully restored."" Despite the setback, the heartiest of New Englanders wouldn't let the lack of electricity prevent them from enjoying the heartiest of meals. Lots of Mainers took to Twitter either to poke fun at or moan about the weather. Most showed remarkable resilience and seemed reluctant to let the weather ruin the holiday. ""Power is out at parents house in Maine, so my mom is chopping breadcrumbs with a flashlight,"" Brooklyn copy editor Kelly Gordon tweeted. She later told CNN that the meal turned out perfectly. ""My mom would never let no lights (or) no heat keep her from Thanksgiving prep work,"" she said. CNN's Eliott C.

"One week after Republicans scored massive electoral victories in the House and Senate, the 58 wide-eyed and triumphant House lawmakers-to-be descended upon Washington -- a city many of them campaigned against -- for a crash course on how to be a member of Congress. The dizzying pace of the seven-day congressional freshman orientation has trappings of the first day of college: There's apartment hunting, a picture day, field trips, an ""office fair,"" assemblies, briefings on how to stay out of trouble, an ID card check-in, welcome meetings with leadership and hugs and kisses from loved ones. Some of the members of the new class entered the Capitol for the first time Wednesday night, a structure obscured by rows of grey scaffolding as part of a massive years-long refurbishment project. For the next several days, many will spend time lost in the building's underground labyrinth of poorly-marked hallways. The men and women of the 114th Congress come from diverse backgrounds: There's one car salesman, a dentist, a forester, a 9-1-1 dispatcher, a former CIA officer, two Southern Baptist preachers, an economics professor, an electrician, an arms dealer and, as is tradition, a small army of attorneys. Amid the pageantry and high-minded lectures about the value of ""public service,"" the incoming lawmakers will spend much of their time dealing with the mundane, such as securing access to new government computers and telephones. They'll be tasked with ensuring their new offices have copiers and fax machines. According to a copy of the orientation schedule acquired by CNN, members are encouraged to visit the ""New Member Office Fair"" where they can get help setting up their new website or choose a carpet-and-wall color scheme for their new office digs. In the basement of the Rayburn House Office Building, Capitol Hill techies will be on hand to demonstrate ""the newest computer and telecommunications equipment."" Meanwhile, the House portrait studio will provide official congressional photos—the cost will be billed to their ""Members' Representational Allowance""—and delivered on compact disk. On Wednesday night, the members-elect began a dizzying schedule of briefings, starting with a ""sneak peek into Leadership, Steering and Being a Freshman"" for the Republican group on Wednesday night and a bi-partisan reception. After that, both parties retreated to their proper corners: Democrats joined Nancy Pelosi for a dinner in Statuary Hall while Republicans attended a forum down the hall. On Thursday morning, the newbies departed their security-heavy hotel on a brisk walk to the Capitol for a four-hour briefing on exciting subjects such as how to properly use their office budget to buy pens. The Friday schedule calls for an hour-long bipartisan breakfast panel entitled ""If I Knew Then What I Know Now"" hosted by longstanding members with wisdom to share, followed by tours of the Capitol's hallowed halls. Freshman orientation comes with Saturday school, where the members-elect will get a whirlwind tour of the ""legislative process,"" a subject many seem to struggle to retain. The next week begins with a class photo on the Capitol steps followed by the most important meeting yet: Ethics training. After they're scared straight at the ethics briefing, it will be time for an inspirational field trip—for Republicans only. The new GOP class will hop on a bus to the National Archives with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, for a ""private document viewing"" of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The orientation marathon concludes next Wednesday with a lottery to determine who gets the first crack at office space. A race for the high-rise penthouse this is not: The best real estate on Capitol Hill is actually on the lower floors, which shortens travel between to the House floor for votes. Those unlucky souls assigned to the far corners of Congress' little empire are reminded that yes, It Gets Better. ""John Kennedy was on the fifth floor,"" Michigan Republican Rep. Candice Miller, the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee reminded the freshman on their first day. ""We all start there."" In the meantime, the members-elect will also have a chance to subscribe to their favorite political magazines and newspapers, free of charge. Fun fact: Since 1983, all congressional offices automatically receive free deliveries of pornography, courtesy of a monthly shipment of Larry Flynt's Hustler magazine. Once it's all over, this gang of bewildered and bleary-eyed future lawmakers of America will say goodbye to their new friends and return home for the holidays. They'll be back in January, when the real fun starts.","New lawmakers are on Capitol Hill .

"(CNN) -- Pam Wurst struggled for years to lose weight. One of the triggering points for her to finally shed pounds was when a 5-year-old child patted her stomach and asked: ""When is the baby coming?"" ""I about died,"" she said. ""I wasn't even remotely pregnant, just really overweight."" Wurst, a 39-year old instructional designer, artist and consultant from Marietta, Georgia, lost about 100 pounds, starting from 264 to a low of 155. She lost most of her weight in the first nine months and has kept the majority of the weight off for more than six years. iReporter Seth Leigh of San Tan Valley, Arizona, a computer programmer, has also struggled with his weight. He says he found the motivation to lose at least 110 pounds in nearly seven months so he could return to the Army National Guard in 2010 as an officer. (He has lost 135 pounds to date.) See his full iReport . He was 40 1/2 when he started his weight loss regimen. ""I was facing an age deadline to get back and knew that once I turned 42 years old, it would be forever too late,"" he said. The new year represents a time to create resolutions and for many Americans, weight loss will be high on their lists. And while Wurst and Leigh's weight loss stories are a success, experts say most people will fail at following through on their resolutions. Clinical psychologist Mark Crawford of Roswell, Georgia, says some people sabotage themselves by not being clear on their goals. He offers some tips for getting it right. 1. Be specific about your goal. ""Saying that you want to lose weight is way too general,"" Crawford said. ""You should set specific goals, like you want to lose 5 to 10 pounds."" 2. Set a realistic goal. Make sure you set something achievable and sustainable. 3. Establish a plan to reach your goal. ""Say things like I'm going to exercise four times a week, and I'm going to eat smaller portions,"" said Crawford. 4. Set a time frame to reach your goal. ""Thirty days is a manageable goal to start with, and then go from there,"" he said. Above all, Crawford says stay the course. ""You will make mistakes,"" he said. ""You will have slip-ups, it is part of it.""  But never use it as an excuse to give up. A website supported by the National Institute of Health notes ""the key to successful weight loss is making changes in your eating and physical activity habits that you can keep up for the rest of your life."" And even if you don't need to lose weight, it's a good idea to follow healthy eating and exercise habits to keep you healthy throughout your lifetime. How did Wurst and Leigh shed pounds? When Wurst first started her journey, she set a goal of fitting into a size 14. ""I didn't know how long it would take, but I felt like I could accomplish that in a year and I did,"" she said. She now wears a size 10 or 12, which exceeded her plan. Wurst said when she first started losing weight, she set a goal of exercising six days a week, and three of those days were 22 minutes of cardiovascular moves. After a few months into her Body-for LIFE-program, her job required her to travel a lot and she cut back her workouts to three to four days a week. Wurst changed her eating habits, too, and stopped eating junk food. She tries to set a goal of eating four to six small meals a day to speed up her metabolism. Her meals often include proteins with portions the size of her palm such as fish, chicken, nuts, tofu, mushrooms and eggs. She eats carbohydrates such as multigrain rice or multigrain crackers. Wurst tries her best to avoid processed foods and soda. Leigh had a different plan to shed his pounds. At the height of his exercise program, he spent up to five hours a day working out. His routine included walking, biking, swimming, lifting weights and burning calories on a treadmill or Stairmaster. The iReporter restricted his diet to about 1,500 calories a day. ""I didn't have any time to waste or any days when I could afford not to exercise and eat properly if I wanted to qualify with the right weight for the Guard,"" he said. ""I had a few times during that heavy-duty weight loss period when I would go out and ride 20 miles on my bike at 11 p.m. or midnight, because I hadn't exercised yet that day and I wouldn't let myself go to sleep having missed a day,"" he noted. Both Wurst and Leigh were motivated to reach their goals, but experts differ on their opinions on how much exercise is necessary and what type of foods to eat in order to lose weight. For those of you planning a weight-loss program in 2011, consider guidelines the National Institute of Health offers on its website to help you get started. Losing weight can be a challenge . Wurst said before her big weight loss, she tried a lot of methods to lose pounds, including drugs prescribed by her doctor. ""In 2000, they tested my thyroid and found it to be very slow, and I was prescribed 300 mg of Levoxyl a day and told it would help,"" she said. Six months later, she returned to her doctor in tears and said the drugs weren't helping. ""My doc shrugged it off and said 'fat people are jolly.' "" she said. ""I was heartbroken."" She struggled for a few more years until a friend visiting from Tampa, Florida, in 2004 helped her get started on the diet and exercise regime he used. ""At last, I finally found a program that worked,"" she said. Leigh said he struggled for years as a heavy person and said he weighed more than 300 pounds for about an 11-year stretch. For him, the motivation to achieve a dream is what it took to finally get him back to better health. ""I would imagine myself standing, in a nice new suit, in front of the Officer Selection Board, answering their questions about why I wanted to get back into the Army National Guard,"" he said. ""I must have imagined that interview with the board a hundred times while working out,"" Leigh noted. Both Wurst and Leigh say the best part of their journey is they are now happier people than they were before the weight loss. ""I feel great and love to tell people about my story,"" said Wurst.","Many people will choose weight loss as a New Year's resolution, but many will fail say experts .

"Two Brazilian sailors died and one was injured Saturday after a fire broke out at a naval research station in Antarctica, authorities reported . The fire occurred at the Comandante Ferraz station on King George Island, said Adm. Julio Soares de Moura Neto, commander of the Brazilian navy. The sailors were trying to extinguish a fire that broke out in the engine room of the facility. Brazilian military police are investigating the cause. The station is home to researchers who conduct studies on the effects of climate change in Antarctica and its implications on the planet, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation. Researchers at the base also study marine life and the atmosphere. The Brazilian navy estimated there were 32 civilians and 12 sailors at the station when the fire broke out. Remaining personnel on the base were transferred to Chilean base Eduardo Frei in southern Chile and were expected to return to Brazil some time on Monday, according to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. According to state-run news agency Agencia Brasil, Defense Minister Celso Amorim said that the Antarctica program will continue, despite much of the station being destroyed by fire and with it, many materials and equipment used for  research. He said the nation has a 30-year commitment to the project. ""The entire core base, which is where these facilities are concentrated, was lost,"" said Amorim. ""The program is a source of pride for us, so let us continue.

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill Friday that would have banned crates that severely limit the mobility of pregnant pigs, a move that will win favor with Iowa farmers and spark more speculation about Christie's presidential aspirations but cause outrage among animal rights activists who pushed for the ban. Critics consider the small metal crates a form of animal cruelty -- the pigs aren't able to turn around in the limited space -- but advocates say they prevent sows from accidentally lying down or stepping on piglets. Despite its strong bipartisan support in the state legislature, the Republican governor vetoed a version of the bill in 2013. When a nearly identical version passed again in the Democratic-led legislature, Christie faced mounting pressure this fall from activists and celebrities, including Bill Maher, Danny DeVito, Martha Stewart and Edie Falco. Jon Stewart gave the issue wider attention when he featured it in a segment on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" this month. And Matthew Scully, a former speechwriter and adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote a lengthy essay for National Review Online, spelling out a case for banning the crates. In a statement, Christie said the bill is a ""solution in search of a problem"" and a ""political movement masquerading as substantive policy."" Arguing that it's not a practice in New Jersey, Christie said it should be left to the state's Board of Agriculture, which currently doesn't outlaw the crates. Read the full veto statement (PDF) The move, announced by his office the day after Thanksgiving, places 2016 squarely in the spotlight. With more than 20 million pigs, Iowa is the nation's largest pork producer, and the state's governor, Terry Branstad, told The Associated Press that he urged Christie to veto the bill when a similar version came to the New Jersey governor's desk last year. Branstad also said he and Christie talked about the latest measure during an Iowa event last month. With Iowa holding the nation's first presidential nomination caucuses, Christie's veto will almost surely spark further speculation that he is intent on moving forward with a presidential campaign. According to the Humane Society of the United States, nine other states are moving away from the practice, while companies like McDonald's, Wendy's, Safeway and Burger King are discontinuing the crates from their supply chains. ""This veto shows cynical political calculation from the governor and an obvious capitulation to special interests, rather than leadership or humanity,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society. New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, who authored the legislation, said Christie is ""putting his personal political ambitions ahead of the humane treatment of animals."" ""It has the support of the people of New Jersey as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the Legislature, but the governor chose to follow the dictates of special interests in Iowa,"" he said in a statement.","New Jersey Gov.

"A peace agreement that had halted violence in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan was shattered Wednesday when a rebel commander who had given up his weapons was killed by government forces, neighbors and relatives said. The incident occurred in the southeastern province of Pamir at 4 a.m., when government soldiers entered the house of Imumnazar Imumnazarov and killed him and two other men, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. Imumnazarov's legs had been paralyzed since the civil war, which lasted from 1992 until 1997. Efforts to contact government officials for comment were not successful. Shortly after Wednesday's killings, 3,000 residents of the city of Khorog demonstrated outside a regional government building, demanding that the government and President Emomali Rahmon investigate why the peace agreement had been broken. When protesters threw rocks at the building, soldiers fired on them, wounding several, the sources said. A representative of the Aga Khan Development Network pleaded with the protesters for calm. ""Imumnazarov was loyal to this peace agreement until the end,"" he said. During the protest, more than 40 suspected rebel fighters were taken into custody, the government said in a statement. Last month, the Aga Khan Development Network brokered a peace agreement under which rebels laid down their arms in exchange for a promise from government officials not to attack. The network is a private group that has worked to develop the region over the past two decades. The Aga Khan himself, who wields considerable influence as leader of all Ismailis, adherents of the Islamic branch followed by many Pamiris, played a key role in persuading the rebels to accept the truce. He had urged his spiritual followers to refrain from violence, to work for peace and to uphold the law. The Interior Ministry said July 31 that an offer of amnesty for anyone who disarmed voluntarily had resulted in 200 weapons' being handed over to the authorities. But by Wednesday afternoon, the initial progress toward peace had reversed. Internet, cell phone and land line communications had been cut to the Gorno-Badakhshan region, residents said. Such cutoffs have been routine during periods of unrest. One government explanation appeared comical to some Pamiris. ""The head of the state communications service, Beg Zukhurov, claimed that a stray bullet had severed telephone, mobile, and Internet connections to the region,"" Human Rights Watch said in a posting on its website. The rights group expressed concern over the fate of the detainees. ""Torture remains an enduring problem within Tajikistan's penitentiary system and is used to extract confessions from defendants, who are often denied access to family and legal counsel during initial detention,"" it said. Authorities have not allowed representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners, it added. An open letter to the president from ""youth of Gorno Badakhshan"" bemoaned the deteriorating situation. Since a military operation began in Khorog in the center of Pamir on July 24, ""we have been witness to military actions, civilian deaths, and crying children and mothers,"" it said. ""With every passing day, we are increasingly losing hope that peace and stability will prevail in the country again."" It said that the peace agreement had been adhered to by the former field commanders and that ""the people of Khorog cooperated with the government in every possible way."" That tense peace was first interrupted two weeks ago, when government soldiers manning a checkpoint in the town of Bidurth -- north of Khorog -- shot at a civilian car, killing two occupants and wounding two others, the letter said. ""Despite this, we all hoped for an early resolution to the problems and the removal of the armed structures from the region to avoid further complication of the situation,"" the letter said. But Wednesday's killing of Imumnazarov -- who had called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict -- ""could provoke a further escalation of the situation and result in heavy casualties,"" it said. ""And this, in turn, could become a pretext for the destruction of peace and accord in Tajikistan, as well as in the whole Central Asian region."" The letter asked that Rahmon and other government representatives ""intervene in this complex situation as we believe that a purposeful process of destabilization is taking place in the country by third forces."" It did not elaborate on who those third forces might be. Imumnazarov's killing was preceded in July, before the peace agreement was reached, by the killing of Sabzali Mamadrizoev, a representative of the opposition Islamic Renaissance Party. He had condemned what he said was the government's indiscriminate attack on residents of Khorog after a general was killed there. A YouTube video shows soldiers dragging a man through the city streets and dumping him in a trash heap. Residents identified the man as Mamadrizoev; the government said it wasn't he. The residents have said they want the soldiers involved in the killing to be brought to justice. Islamic Renaissance Party national leader Muhiddin Kabiri said in a statement that even if even if the dead man was not Mamadrizoev, he should have been treated humanely. Tajikistan gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but was troubled by a five-year civil war that ended in 1997 and is still plagued by widespread corruption and poverty. Tensions remain high between the Tajik government in the capital city of Dushanbe and warlords -- so-called Komandos -- of Gorno-Badakshan, who are members of the Pamiri ethnic minority. The region was a stronghold of rebels during the civil war, which claimed thousands of lives. The war divided people along ethnic and regional lines, and the Pamiri largely sided with the opposition. A United Nations-brokered peace plan left Rahmon's secular government in place but gave official jobs to some of his opponents, including the Komandos. Rahmon, who has Moscow's support and faces reelection next year, has sought to consolidate power and stamp out remnants of the former opposition-turned-warlords.","Government soldiers accused of shooting a former rebel commander .

Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius speaks at a news conference in June 2007 in Washington. Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003. She made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business-friendly and increase government efficiency. The Kansas governor has a political pedigree: Her father, John Gilligan, was a Democratic governor of Ohio in the '70s. But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner. Since she moved into the governor's mansion, Newsweek has identified Sebelius as ""one to watch."" Time named her one of four ""rising stars from the heartland,"" and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors. ""Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008,"" Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans. Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole. But entering her sixth year as governor, Sebelius seems to be everyone's favorite pick to join that select group. The down-to-earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge: She loves NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor. (Sometimes, perhaps, a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election-year debate that Missouri roads scared her more than the World Trade Center attacks.) But the big draw for national Democrats is her skill at appealing to moderate GOP voters -- the only way a Democrat can win major office in Kansas. Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. Bush carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no Democratic presidential contender has won there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s. Under Sebelius' leadership, the Kansas economy has rebounded, resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs, according to a Kansas government Web site. Her first term was considered so successful that during her re-election run, a few Republicans tried to use it against her -- predicting she'd probably be tapped for a White House run before she finished a second term. So far, Sebelius has downplayed the scenario. But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest. During her first term, she visited National Guard troops in Iraq. Last year, she took on a high-profile national assignment, serving as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association. If Sen. Hillary Clinton fails to capture the presidential nomination this year, many Democrats say Sebelius will remain high on any vice presidential short list. Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama.

"One of the most anticipated Supreme Court decisions in recent times -- Obamacare -- was not announced Monday. That gave an air of anti-climax to an important decision that was handed down, one with its own political baggage and implications for the election, although not nearly as fraught with peril as the health care law. In any other session, the outcome of Arizona v. United States might have been the headline case of a Supreme Court season. Instead, the Obama administration will have to celebrate an incomplete victory in the next 72 hours before the court delivers its ruling on the fate of Obama's signature legislation. The White House largely won in challenging Arizona's harsh 2010 immigration law, although it might be difficult to sell that point. Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down four provisions of the law, ruling that the federal government pre-empted state regulation on immigration. The Supreme Court mostly agreed. Unfortunately for the administration, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court on the most controversial part of the law, the ""show me your papers"" provision that requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people while enforcing other laws. Arguably, this provision was designed to force the federal government to take action on illegal immigrants by identifying them to the Department of Homeland Security. By upholding this provision, the Supreme Court allowed Gov. Jan Brewer to claim victory for Arizona's immigration enforcement efforts: . ""Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a victory for the rule of law. It is also a victory for the 10th Amendment and all Americans who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens. After more than two years of legal challenges, the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S. Constitution."" But that narrow win is tenuous. The court pointedly did not rule that the provision was constitutional, which means that further court cases may well strike it down at a later date. Arizona can put it into effect, but it probably won't take too much time before a case comes up that will put the provision back under scrutiny. The White House will portray the Supreme Court's ruling on immigration as a principled victory over a state that had infringed on federal prerogatives to manage immigration. It may even get a couple of days' worth of traction on that argument.  That won't last long, though, for two reasons. First, the coming Obamacare ruling will vastly overshadow this nuanced win by Thursday morning. Second, this win serves as a reminder that the Obama administration has done a poor job of enforcing immigration law -- and along with Obama's recent decision to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants -- border states have no reason to expect a second term that will improve on the first.","Ed Morrissey: High court ruling on Arizona immigration law is largely a win for president .

"Washington (CNN)Election Night 2014 was more than a landslide win for congressional Republicans -- it was a historic moment for black Republicans in particular. Come January, newly elected representatives Mia Love of Utah and Will Hurd from Texas along with Sen. Tim Scott -- who won election to the South Carolina Senate seat he had been appointed to -- will make up the largest number of black Republicans serving in a single Congress since Reconstruction. Changing demographics -- a growing Hispanic population in particular -- spell trouble for Republican national candidates and the party is eager to broaden its appeal to minorities to help them win the presidency in 2016 and beyond. The key question is whether these three conservative politicians from red states can help woo more black voters to a party that has struggled to attract them for decades. ""(Republicans) made black voter engagement a top priority by committing time, talent and resources across the country in pivotal states and urban centers. The midterm results are the beginning fruits of that labor,"" said Tara Wall, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, who acknowledged there was still much more work to be done. A racial controversy over a speech a top a House Republican gave to white supremacists while a state politician in 2002, could make that work harder. And it's not clear that simply having a black candidate draws more black voters, said CNN contributor and polling expert Keating Holland, pointing to the two Senate races in South Carolina, where both Lindsey Graham, a white Republican, and Scott were running. Scott brought in 10% of the black vote to Graham's 6%. ""That tells me that having a black Republican on a ballot gets a handful of votes,"" Holland said. ""It may increase the Republican share of black vote by low single digits."" The Republican Party's focus so far has been more on biography than ideology -- finding black candidates who fit the conservative mold but have a compelling story that could appeal to blacks. Mia Love, the Mormon former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, first made a splash on the national stage as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2012. She stressed her background as a child of Haitian immigrants who arrived in America with $10 in their pocket and raised her with an ethos of self-reliance. Arriving on Capitol Hill for new members' orientation shortly after Election Day, Love stressed her desire to represent everyone, regardless of race or gender. ""All the issues that we face in this country, they're not black issues, they're not white issues, they're not gender-specific, they're people issues and I'm doing everything I can to get the decision making closest to people,"" she said as she made her way to the welcome reception. Her campaign to become the first black Republican woman ever elected to Congress focused on conservative principles like local control of education and blasting Obamacare. Scott, who is the first black senator elected in the South since Reconstruction, has focused on issues like tax reform, expanding school choice and reigning in government spending. But he has also addressed the historic nature of his election. ""In South Carolina, in America, it takes a generation to go from having a grandfather who is picking cotton to a grandson in Congress,"" he wrote in a series of tweets. ""We are thankful for those trailblazers who came before us and said the status quo was not enough."" He added: ""We have too many young people being trapped in poverty because other people are defining them with low expectations."" Campaign ads for Hurd, a former CIA officer from San Antonio, emphasized issues like securing the border and his respect for conservative values that he said would help create jobs. He is the first black Republican Texans have ever sent to Congress, but he told CNN, his victory went beyond race. RELATED: GOP agenda for Congress . ""It's exciting,"" Hurd said outside new member check in station at a Capitol Hill hotel. ""When my parents moved to San Antonio in 1970, there were houses they weren't allowed to get because of the color of their skin and now they have a son, you know, who's in Congress, and to me this is a victory for the voters of Texas and the voters of my district that have gotten beyond skin color."" Hurd was elected with the help of white and Hispanic voters, while Love and Scott won with support mostly from white voters. Black turnout for certain Republican candidates this year hit double-digits in Florida (12%), in Arkansas, South Carolina and Wisconsin (10%) and in Ohio, where Republican Gov. John Kasich won 26% of the black vote. It's news Republicans are applauding as a sign the party is making inroads with black voters, whose strong Democratic leanings are well documented. Potential presidential hopeful Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, believes that the GOP could attract blacks in even bigger numbers. ""If Republicans have a clue and do this and go out and ask every African-American for their vote, I think we can transform an election in one cycle and that doesn't mean that we go to a majority of African American votes in one cycle but I think there's fully a third of the African American vote that is open to much of the message, because much of what Democrats have offered hasn't worked,"" Paul told Politico. That's wishful thinking, analysts say. While the election of Love, Hurd and Scott is a good sign for Republicans as they try to broaden their base, it's important not to read too much into their wins, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""Obviously, he's dreaming,"" Sabato said, of Paul's goal of capturing one-third of the black vote. ""I just don't think it's practical to spend a lot of time and money on the African-American vote because it's so heavily Democratic and so intensely Democratic. Look at the intensity of African-American support and it's very high."" In the last two presidential elections, more than 90% of black voters supported the Democrat, Barack Obama, who also happened to be black. But even in 1972, the most recent low-point in terms of black vote share, the white Democrat George McGovern got a whopping 82%. One big problem is the perception that the Republican Party is not as open to minorities. A September analysis by David Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, found that in 1950, 98% of House Democrats and 97% of House Republicans were white men. By this year, 89% of House Republicans were white men. Just 47% of Democrats, by comparison, are white men. ""They won by getting white voters,"" said Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report."" If Republicans don't have policies that attract minority voters, then having candidates who are minority isn't going to be enough."" Paul is one exception on the policy front, a Republican whose focus on criminal justice issues like incarceration rates and other matters, like school choice, appears aimed at drawing black support. While that outreach is significant, it's not clear he is speaking for anyone else in his party, said Ron Brownstein, a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director for the National Journal. So for now, it seems that the biggest impact these black Republicans may be having is on white Republicans. ""Here is what we see happening throughout the country, people are aligning their votes for values and voting for candidates who are not of their own complexion,"" Scott told CNN's Erin Burnett the day after the election. Meanwhile, the Congressional Black Caucus, which is dominated by Democrats, is ready to accept the new class of black Republicans with open arms and say they could help improve bipartisanship. ""I've reached out to congratulate all of the newly elected African-American members of Congress on their win, including Representatives-elect Love and Hurd, and to invite them to join the Congressional Black Caucus,"" said CBC Chair Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. ""Government is most effective when both parties work together for the greater good of the country. I have no doubt that all of the new Members of the CBC will bring their own unique perspective and skills, further solidifying our strength as a caucus."" Love, Hurd and Scott are being sworn in as the Republican Party deals with a controversy over Majority Whip Steve Scalise's 2002 speech to a white nationalist group run by former Ku Klux Klan leader and Neo-Nazi David Duke. The then-state-representative has apologized for speaking to the group and said he did not know about it's racist leanings. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, have thrown their support behind Scalise and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana, an African-American who is also the only Democrat in the Louisiana congressional delegation has also come to his defense. Congresswoman-elect Love released her own statement of support. ""I believe he should remain in leadership. There's one quality that he has that I think is very important in leadership, and that's humility. And he's actually shown that in this case,"" Love said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""He's apologized, and I think that we need to move on and get the work of the American people done."" Still, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Kevin Madden acknowledged the controversy could complicate the party's efforts to expand its appeal to minorities heading into 2016. ""It certainly presents challenges anytime you are a party like ours that has demographic challenges and is trying to overcome those demographic challenges,"" Madden said. ""This will be an element in that conversation. What's important is that we address it head-on, and that we continue to promote an agenda that is going to attract more African-American voters, that's going to attract more Latino voters, that's going to attract more African-American candidates to run within our party.""","The new Congress will feature three black Republicans, a record .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- As soon as Alan Gross got out of Cuban airspace Wednesday morning, he called each of his two daughters to say the two words he had dreamed of saying for years: ""I'm free,"" a spokeswoman for his legal team says. It was the end of five years locked up in wretched conditions, as his lawyers have described his time in a Cuban prison: 23 hours a day confined to a room, with one hour a day outside ""in a small, walled courtyard where you can barely see the sky,"" according to attorney Scott Gilbert. Addressing the world at a news conference after his arrival in Washington, Gross began with another two words: ""Chag Sameach"" -- Hebrew for ""happy holiday."" ""I guess so far it's the best Hanukkah that I'll be celebrating for a long time,"" the 65-year-old said. ""What a blessing it is to be a citizen of this country, and thank you, President Obama, for everything you have done today and leading up to today,"" he said. Saying he was ""very happy"" to see President Barack Obama's announcement of a new era in U.S.-Cuban relations, Gross added, ""This is a game changer, which I fully support."" He thanked his wife, Judy, his family, his ""lawyer and personal Moses Scott Gilbert,"" and Jewish, Christian and Muslim organizations. ""God bless you and thank you. It was critical to my survival knowing that I was not forgotten. Your prayers and your actions have been comforting, reassuring and sustaining."" Gross praised Cubans, saying, ""Cubanos -- or, at least, most of them -- are incredibly kind, generous and talented. It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments' mutually belligerent policies."" Gross asked for ""complete and total privacy."" His family lives in Maryland. Gross: 'I'm incredibly blessed' Smiling often as he spoke for several minutes, even as he mentioned his need for new teeth (they have been breaking, says legal team spokeswoman Jill Zuckman says), Gross seemed to have a new lease on life. ""I'm incredibly blessed finally to have the freedom to resume a positive and constructive life,"" he said, adding, ""It's good to be home."" His family had said he might not live another year in prison. ""Alan is resolved that he will not endure another year imprisoned in Cuba, and I am afraid that we are at the end,"" Judy Gross said this month. Gross, who couldn't visit his own mother before her death this year, had lost hope. His health was in danger; he had lost more than 100 pounds. In July, he said goodbye to his family, and refused to see them again while he was imprisoned. He also refused to meet with U.S. diplomats in Havana, as a protest against the slow progress of efforts to free him. On Tuesday, he learned that he would be freed as part of a landmark deal announced Wednesday between the United States and Cuba. Three lawmakers and his wife flew to Cuba on a U.S. government plane to pick him up. The flight landed at a Cuban military base at 8 a.m. At 8:45 a.m., when the pilot announced they had left Cuban airspace, Gross stood up, took a deep breath and made the phone calls to his grown daughters Shira and Nina, said Zuckman. Shira has battled breast cancer during her father's imprisonment. Gross also spoke with Obama by phone on his flight back to the United States, a senior administration official said. The plane touched down shortly after 11 a.m. ET at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry happened to fly in around the same time, and Kerry gave Gross a big hug, Zuckman said. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, were on the plane, Zuckman said. Van Hollen, who is Gross' congressman, and Flake and Leahy were part of a U.S. congressional delegation that met with Cuban President Raul Castro to discuss Gross' case last year. In the air, Gross ate popcorn, which he had missed. He also ate corned beef on rye and latkes (potato pancakes) with apple sauce and sour cream -- a traditional Hanukkah food. Gross' Cuba mission debated . Gross spent more than 25 years traveling the world, helping people in more than 50 countries and territories, according to a website that has pushed for his release. His work included helping communities in Pakistan, creating jobs in the West Bank and Gaza, and designing agricultural improvement projects in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and the West Bank, the website says. He traveled to Cuba as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. State Department says he was working to bring the Internet to Cuba's small Jewish community despite Cuban government restrictions on Internet access. But Fulton Armstrong, a former senior adviser to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Gross' mission, part of the agency's ""regime-change"" programs, was ""dangerous and counterproductive."" The operation involved the smuggling of parabolic satellite dishes hidden in Styrofoam boogie boards, Armstrong said. Cash was transported to Cuba to finance demonstrations against the Castro regime. ""They were sending this poor guy into one of the most sophisticated counterintelligence operating environments in the world,"" said Armstrong, who spent 25 years as a CIA officer. ""It was not credible his story about the Jews. It didn't make sense."" Sentenced behind closed doors . In March 2011, Gross was tried behind closed doors for two days and convicted of attempting to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents ""to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order."" He was sentenced to 15 years. A 2012 lawsuit filed by Judy Gross accused USAID and Development Alternatives Inc. -- the company that sent him to the island -- of negligence. It said the agencies had a contract ""to establish operations supporting the creation of a USAID Mission"" in Cuba. In 2013, Gross reached a financial settlement with Development Alternatives. Attorney: Gross' treatment 'cruel, inhuman, and degrading' Leading human rights attorney Jared Genser had pushed for Gross' release. In 2012, he wrote the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, saying Gross had been ""denied adequate medical diagnosis and treatment for the last six months, which constitutes cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment under international law."" Gross ""suffers from a number of ailments including degenerative arthritis,"" Genser wrote. His ""repeated requests for an independent medical evaluation have been denied."" A mass developed on Gross' right shoulder, and he was not given adequate medical diagnosis and treatment, the attorney said. En route back home at last, Gross told his legal team what he wanted, in addition to time with family: a glass of good scotch, since he hasn't had a drink in years, and a nice cigar, a habit he's picked up while in prison. CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana, and CNN's Josh Levs reported from Atlanta.","NEW: ""What a blessing it is to be a citizen of this country,"" Alan Gross says .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip women because of the way they dress. ""The ongoing brutality that is stripping our women in public for allegedly dressing in an indecent manner must be brought to an end,"" Eric Mutua, chairman of the Law Society of Kenya, said in a statement. Mutua urged Keriako Tobiko, director of public prosecutions, to take action and for the national police to form a special unit to patrol areas where these crimes are likely to happen. ""These kinds of actions are not only illegal but immoral by all standards and should never be tolerated or condoned in a civilized society,"" Mutua said. In an recent incident, a group of men stripped a woman naked in Nairobi after accusing her of ""indecent"" dressing. The attack was captured on video and prompted outrage on social media under the hashtag #mydressmychoice. In footage posted on YouTube and shown on local television, attackers confronted the woman at a bus stop. The men pushed and shoved her, eventually stripping her naked. In the background, attackers yell ""Toa"" -- Swahili for ""take it off!"" -- as they tug at her clothes. Kenyans took to the streets of Nairobi on November 17 to protest the attacks. Protesters marched through the capital's downtown carrying placards that read ""My dress, my choice,"" while others donned miniskirts, the same attire the unidentified woman wore when she was attacked. Some men wore dresses to show their support. More iReport photos: #MyDressMyChoice . It is not the first time a woman has been undressed for purported indecent dressing in the East African nation, which is a majority Christian.

"Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch spent hours Wednesday downplaying his political influence, even as British Prime Minister David Cameron said politicians in his country had been too close to Murdoch over the years. Murdoch insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had ""never asked a prime minister for anything."" Murdoch was being grilled about his relationship with politicians at an independent British inquiry prompted by illegal eavesdropping by his News of the World newspaper. Murdoch told the Leveson Inquiry he does not believe in journalists using phone hacking or private detectives, calling it ""a lazy way of reporters doing their job."" The media baron, who owns the Sun and the Times in London, as well as controlling the Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Fox News, also denied using the power of his press for personal gain. At the same time, Cameron was saying politicians from across the political spectrum had been too close to the powerful media baron. ""I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch,"" he told the House of Commons as his government was battered over testimony Murdoch's son had given the day before. James Murdoch testified Tuesday that before Cameron became prime minister, he had met the politician over drinks at a pub and told him the company's Sun newspaper would support his Conservative party in the next election. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch was having a bitter falling out with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the elder Murdoch said Wednesday. He told Brown his papers would not support Brown's Labour party in the 2010 election, prompting Brown to respond: ""Your company has... declared war on my government and we have no alternative but to declare war on your company,"" Murdoch quoted Brown as saying. ""And I said, 'I'm sorry about that Gordon, thank you for calling.'  End of subject,"" Rupert Murdoch said. He earlier insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with Tony Blair as Murdoch's papers switched support from the Conservative party to Blair's Labour party in 1997 -- not long before Blair swept into power as prime minister. ""I, in 10 years in his power there, never asked Tony Blair for any favors and never received any,"" Murdoch said, pounding his hand on the table for emphasis. On Tuesday, Leveson Inquiry lawyer Robert Jay pressed James Murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full ownership of satellite broadcaster BSkyB. That bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. Evidence published Tuesday suggests that News Corp. was getting inside information from the office of the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Adam Smith, an aide to Hunt, resigned Wednesday, saying his contacts with Murdoch representatives had gone beyond what the culture secretary had authorized. But Hunt told the House of Commons he would not quit. E-mails released by Leveson Inquiry ""have been alleged to indicate there was a back channel through which News Corp. were able to influence my decisions. This is categorically not the case,"" Hunt said. James Murdoch insisted before the Leveson Inquiry Tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the News of the World, as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family's media empire. The scandal has led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. James and Rupert Murdoch have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. Underlings did not tell James Murdoch how pervasive the practice was when he took over News Corp.'s British newspaper publishing arm, he testified Tuesday. He agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it. ""I think that must be it, that I would say, 'Cut out the cancer,' and there was some desire to not do that,"" he told the Leveson Inquiry. Former Murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem. The younger Murdoch has already been called twice to testify before British lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at British subsidiaries of his father's media empire. He and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans. Dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery, and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people. The suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer, the Crown Prosecution Service said, declining to name them. No charges have been filed, and the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges. In addition to the Leveson Inquiry and London's Metropolitan Police, two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct. News Corp. shut down The News of the World, its British Sunday tabloid, last summer after public outrage at the scale of illegal eavesdropping its journalists did in search of stories.","Gordon Brown ""declared war"" on Murdoch, the media baron testifies .

"(CNN) -- Japanese writer and director Hideo Nakata has been hailed as the modern master of macabre. The master of macabre, Hideo Nakata didn't start out in film aiming to make horror movies. His 1998 film ""Ringu"" -- adapted from a novel by Suzuki Koji, the Japanese Steven King -- redefined the horror genre, propelled Nakata into the international spotlight and soon had Hollywood calling. Born in Okayama, Japan, in 1961, Nakata enrolled at the University of Tokyo to study journalism. On graduating he went on to work in Japan's Nikkatsu Studios, the same place where renowned director Akira Kurosawa started out. He didn't' start out aiming to make horror films, but it was Nikkatsu Studios that Nakata met Hiroshi Takahashi, the screenplay writer for ""Ringu."" An international hit, ""Ringu"" centers on a cursed videotape that kills whoever watches it. It appeared in cinemas at the same time mainstream western horror films were churning out gruesome violence as the means to get audiences hiding behind their popcorn. Nakata's artfully directed and terrifying film was a nether-world away from these schlock horror and slasher flicks, instead utilizing suspense and a pervading sense of dread. Western audiences expecting to watch good-looking teenagers getting chopped up in a blizzard of gore were treated to something much creepier. For Hollywood producers, Nakata has been a gold-mine of remake material. If dread is the word that has become synonymous with Nakata's work, there was a great sense of it among many of Nakata's fans when it was announced that there would be a Hollywood remake of ""Ringu,"" starring Naomi Watts. Despite fans claiming that the terror of the original was lost in translation, Nakata himself was given the opportunity to direct the Hollywood sequel, ""The Ring 2,"" in 2005. The series' success has spawned a third installment, due to be released in 2009 that Nakata will also be directing. Shunning computer generated monsters or gallons of fake-blood and guts, ""Ringu"" and other Nakata films including ""Dark Water,"" which was also remade by Hollywood in 2005, use glimpses of mysterious abstract images -- a reflection in a TV screen, an unsettling, spreading damp patch of water -- to ratchet up the terror. Fans and critics have compared the chilling atmosphere of his films with that of Roman Polanski's work, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Tenant."" Nakata then has been credited with turning on a whole new audience to Asian horror films with an altogether more subtle approach to scaring the wits out of people.

"Attorney General Eric Holder urged other countries to enact new criminal laws to help prevent possible terrorist attacks from returning Syrian fighters. In a speech in Oslo, Norway, on Tuesday, Holder highlighted the threat from domestic extremists such as a lone terrorist who three years ago bombed government buildings in the Norwegian capital and gunned down people at a youth camp, killing 77 people in all. Holder said the United States, along with Norway and other European countries, face similar danger from ""violent extremists fighting today in Syria, Iraq or other locations"" who ""may seek to commit acts of terror tomorrow in our countries as well."" U.S. intelligence estimates that nearly 7,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Syria, including dozens from the United States. The issue of Syrian fighters from Western countries is dominating Holder's trip this week to Europe, which includes a meeting in London of attorneys general from the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Open visa access among European countries and the U.S. means ""the problem of fighters in Syria returning to any of our countries is a problem for all of our countries,"" Holder said in his speech, excerpts of which were provided in advance by the Justice Department. ""The Syrian conflict has turned that region into a cradle of violent extremism,"" he said. ""But the world cannot simply sit back and let it become a training ground from which our nationals can return and launch attacks."" To combat the threat, Holder is calling on countries to pass laws to criminalize the preparatory steps that suspects often take before an attack, and to allow police to conduct undercover investigations. The U.S. has a law that makes it a crime to provide ""material support"" to terrorists, including supplying money or weapons, or helping to plot an attack. Similar laws are now on the books in Norway and France. Holder also cited the FBI's success in using undercover sting operations, which have drawn controversy in the U.S. but have been successful in prosecuting dozens of suspects who had admitted to plans to commit terrorism. Many countries don't allow such operations. But Holder said the use of such operations could help countries thwart attacks. He said the U.S. has already used these tools to carry out prosecutions of people who sought to travel to join the fight in Syria. ""These operations are conducted with extraordinary care and precision, ensuring that law enforcement officials are accountable for the steps they take and that suspects are neither entrapped nor denied legal protections,"" Holder said. He also called on countries to share information with Interpol and one another about their nationals who try to travel to Syria to fight and those who return. And he urged countries to come up with counter-radicalization programs that try to reach communities where young people may be exposed to extremists. ""We must seek to stop individuals from becoming radicalized in the first place by putting in place strong programs to counter violent extremism in its earliest stages,"" Holder said.","Eric Holder urges countries to enact new criminal laws that clamp down on suspects .

"Europe's hottest destination for tourists, Berlin offers more than bargain-priced nightclubs and Cold War nostalgia. Some of the most interesting sights in Germany are just a few hours away -- and with the deregulation of the intercity bus system, getting around is cheaper than ever. Here's a shortlist of three great day trips from Berlin. Potsdam . The site of the famous ""Potsdam Conference"" that negotiated the end of World War II and a series of opulent Hohenzollern palaces, Potsdam lies only about an hour from the center of Berlin, with all the major attractions easily reachable by public transport. It's a day trip not because of the travel time, but because there's so much to see. Highlights include the breathtaking Sanssouci Palace (Maulbeerallee, Potsdam; +49 331 9694200), the former summer residence of Frederick the Great -- who ruled the Prussian Empire from 1740 to 1786. A pale and beautiful Rococo villa, its name means ""without a care"" and reflects the idyllic atmosphere of tranquil reflection Frederick sought to create with a grand, terraced vineyard to the south and sweeping views of the surrounding countryside. An audio tour covers the palace interior, where most of the original furnishings remain just as the Prussian king preferred them, and on a fine day the huge gardens are perfect for an impromptu picnic. Hardcore palace fans may have enough energy for a gander at the Orangery and the Spielfestung, or ""toy fortress"" -- a miniature fort, complete with a working cannon, built for Frederick's son. But in our opinion it makes a better write-up than it does a visit, and it's better to take the audio tour of the Cecilienhof (Im Neuen Garten 11, Potsdam; +49 331 9694 200) This mammoth, Tudor-style mansion is where U.S. President Harry Truman, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin negotiated the partition of post-war Germany in 1945. (As always in German museums, it's advisable to spring for the headphones unless you're a history professor). Depending on where else you're headed, the Old Town of Potsdam itself can be underwhelming -- cluttered as it is with garden-variety shopping. The varied architecture of the Russian and Dutch Quarters -- built in Germany's first, misguided effort to attract ""desirable"" immigrants in the 18th century -- is, however, worth strolling through. Getting there . Pay an extra 2 euros over the standard charge for the Berlin WelcomeCard and get free travel and discounts for various attractions in Potsdam (not the biggies). Otherwise, day passes for the A-B-C zones of the Berlin transit system -- which covers buses and trains within Potsdam, as well as the so-called ""regional train"" -- are available for 7.20 euros. Leipzig . In the wake of the recent 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the nearby cultural capital of Leipzig -- which was the real nerve center of the peaceful East German revolution, as well as the longtime home of Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach -- makes an especially compelling day trip. It's two hours by bus or 70 minutes by train from Berlin. Though it was virtually destroyed by Allied bombs in World War II, the reconstruction of Leipzig's old town is so seamless that it's difficult to recognize the Renaissance churches and old market square as reproductions. Meanwhile, a growing community of artists and hipsters have created a mushrooming bar, dance club and arts scene that has some people calling it ""the new Berlin"" (or, more disparagingly, ""Hypezig""). For a tribute to the movement that brought down the Wall, visit the Nikolaikirche (Nikolaikirchhof 3, Leipzig; +49 341 1245380), the church where a small, East German prayer group known as ""Swords into Plowshares"" grew into a protest involving thousands of people. Founded in 1165, the church is a mash-up of Roman, Gothic and Baroque architectural styles, but its moment in history gives it an atmosphere that can't be beat. You can get a glimpse of Hypezig at the Spinnerei (Spinnereistrasse 7, Leipzig; +49 341 4980200; guided tours by appointment) -- a 19th century cotton mill that was converted into an artists' collective in the 1990s. Put on the map by the so-called ""New Leipzig School"" -- which includes the post-reunification works of Neo Rauch, Christoph Ruckhaberle, Matthias Weischer and others -- the complex now comprises artist studios, workshops and galleries. For classical music fans, the Leipziger Notenspur -- or ""Music Trail"" -- links prominent sites from the city's musical history along a 5-kilometer (3-mile) walking route. It includes the homes of the renowned 19th Century composers Felix Mendelsohn and Robert Schumann as well as museums devoted to Bach and Ludwig Beethoven. Regardless of your take on literature -- or deals with the devil -- it's worth enjoying a meal at the Auerbachs Keller (Grimmaische Strasse 2-4, Leipzig; +49 341 216100). One of Germany's oldest restaurants, it's where 18th century poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a frequent patron, imagined Mephistopheles downing a few with his eponymous hero, Faust. Getting there: . Tickets on the high-speed train to Leipzig can currently be had as cheap as 29 euros (around $40) from Deutschebahn. Luxury coaches with snacks, toilets and WiFi can get you there almost as quickly, starting at just 7 euros. Try MeinFernbus (+49 180 5 15 99 15) or Berlin Linienbus (+49 30 338 448 0). Goerlitz . Wee little Goerlitz, about three hours from Berlin if you time the connections right, is a bit more off the beaten track. But the number of Hollywood productions shot here -- ""The Reader,"" ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""The Book Thief,"" among others -- testify to its status as perhaps the most picturesque prewar German town, even if it doesn't make many guidebooks. In many respects, it's a place to witness Germany's moribund East -- despite thriving larger cities like Leipzig, many areas are struggling to make a comeback. There's not a lot in the way of tourist infrastructure, so it's best visited when the weather is good. It's the kind of place where the renovation team at the famous Goerlitz Department Store (Bismarckstrasse 21, Goerlitz) -- once an icon in the style of London's Selfridges or New York's Bloomingdales -- and more recently the setting for Wes Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" -- will drop what they're doing to give guided tours. In nice weather, there are walks along the Neisse River and across the bridge into Poland -- still fun even if the days of passport stamps are long gone. For some traditional Silesian food, such as pork cooked in plum gravy, the town has several fine sidewalk restaurants. Other highlights include a series of late Gothic merchant houses, some of which still have interior fittings dating back to the 1500s, a stunning Schonhof, or town hall, built in 1526, as well as a street where local glassblowers still ply their trade. The real joy of the place, though, is the feeling of discovery from exploring the streets -- which really do look like, well, a film set. Getting there: . From Berlin, regional trains run from Alexanderplatz  more or less hourly for around 40 euros (about $60). But consult the schedule to avoid a wait when transferring in Cottbus.","Gorlitz was the film set for ""The Reader,"" ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""The Book Thief""

"(CNN) -- Chinese language media often refer to Jay Chou as the ""small heavenly king,"" but the Taiwan born pop idol is more down-to-earth than the many accolades he receives suggest. At 29, Jay Chou is already a household name in many Asian countries. ""I think I tend to believe in myself. I don't know....maybe I was born to believe in myself rather than in others. That's why I like to complete my work on my own,"" the solo singer-songwriter and actor told CNN's Talk Asia. The 29-year-old has ridden his wave of inner belief to become one of Asia's biggest pop stars, and fostered an image of being something of an anti-hero, neither boastful nor too brash. His music mixes ballads with urban R&B beats, while he has also taken a march on Asian cinema, writing his own screenplays, directing and appearing in a number of hit films. Music remains his first love, having found success despite being naturally shy. He released his first album in 2000, and eight years and seven albums later he still believes he has plenty of material for songs left in him, breaking from the usual Mando- and Canto-pop themes of boy-meets-girl. In the past his lyrics have ventured into more considered and darker territory with a song about an abusive father and have taken on a variety of themes and genres. ""I think my music is quite different from the Western rap music culture. You won't find bad language in my music. I have this sense of responsibility to add an educational element in my music. That's why I would never write anything about suicide or whatever, because I think we all need the courage to deal with our lives,"" he said. Chou was brought up by his mother, a school teacher in Linkou in Taiwan. His parents divorced while he was at a young age. He began playing the piano as a 3-year-old, continuing to practice daily throughout his school days where despite being a diligent pupil he was academically average. While a so-so student he developed a way to express himself by focusing on playing the piano, and from it developed a self-reliant streak. ""I think my confidence belongs to the stage or when I'm standing in front of the screen. I'm like two different people on-stage and off-stage,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia. Chou's career was given a boost when he was spotted by Taiwanese entertainer Jacky Wu while backstage before a TV talent contest. Wu liked what he saw and introduced Chou to the music industry, at first as a songwriter for others. ""I never aimed to be a pop icon or whatever. My first album was actually a collection of songs that I wrote for other people. They didn't want them, so I made the album myself. The only aim I had was to be a singer-songwriter, not an idol,"" said Chou. Despite modest beginnings then he has reached idol status in many Asian countries, having appeared in front of crowds of tens of thousands of people across Asia and on the silver screen to millions. His huge exposure also ensures he's the sources of constant speculation from the media about his private life. ""I think showbiz in Taiwan, or even in the Chinese-speaking region, is quite different from showbiz in the U.S. The more low-profile and tight-lipped you are, the more the paparazzi runs after you. And I happen to belong in this category,"" he said.","Multi-million album selling Taiwanese pop idol still lives with his mother .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A 17-year-old South Korean promised his mother that he would study hard for his exams in exchange for a trip to Turkey. That teenager, called ""Kim,"" disappeared in a southern Turkish border city earlier this month, leading authorities to suspect that he may have slipped away to Syria to join ISIS. While police have not concluded that he joined the terror group, authorities found he had a keen interest in the Islamic militants. Using a Twitter profile picture of an ISIS flag, he frequently tweeted, ""I want join"" and asked to meet ""brothers."" He followed pro-ISIS accounts and often retweeted the group's propaganda. On his social media posts, he claimed he was from Chechnya, and lamented that ""male are being discriminated against."" ""I hate feminist,"" he said, according to a post on his Twitter account on October 5. ""So I like the isis."" He retweeted Arabic posts and tweeted in English, but never in Korean. His last tweet was sent on October 10 -- which was the same month he began asking his mother if he could go to Turkey, according to Seoul Metro Police Agency. Kim's mother told police that she had not been aware of his interest in ISIS. CNN was unable to reach Kim's parents. South Korea may not be a probable place for aspiring ISIS members -- with less than 0.3% of the population identifying as Muslim. But ISIS has expanded its reach globally. The Islamic militant group has attracted disaffected youth from around the world -- including the United States, France, Europe and Australia. There have also been reports about recruits joining ISIS from Asia, triggering concerns in the region. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? Earlier last year, there was a report of a Chinese fighter caught in Iraq in September. It's unclear how many Chinese nationals may be fighting with ISIS, but one former Chinese special envoy to the Middle East said there could be about 100. It remains unclear if some of them are Uighur, a Muslim minority group in Xinjiang. Approximately 350 Southeast Asians were estimated to be in Iraq and Syria, said a Singapore official during a Security Council meeting in November. Currently, two Japanese hostages are held by ISIS with a demand for $200 million random. No word from ISIS on hostages . South Korean police found about 517 searches for words affiliated with ISIS, as well as over 50 images of ISIS members toting guns and holding women in Kim's computer, they said. In another social media account, Kim posted: ""I want leaving my country and families just want to get a new life."" Reza Aslan, a religious scholar and adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations described  a profile of young people who seek to join ISIS as feeling ""dispossessed or marginalized. They feel somewhat they're having a crisis of identity."" ""The assumption is that the religiously zealous are the ones joining ISIS, but that's not proven out by the data we have so far."" Kim began liaising with an individual whom he met on Twitter over an encrypted messaging service, police said. On January 8, he arrived in Turkey with a Korean guardian. Two days later,  he disappeared from a hotel in Kilis, a city near the Syrian border. His guardian reported him missing to the South Korean embassy in Turkey on January 12.","Teenager expressed interest in ISIS and disappeared in Turkey near Syria border .

"The UK government raised its terror threat level Friday from ""substantial"" to ""severe,"" the fourth highest of five levels, in response to events in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS militants have seized a large swath of territory. ""That means that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said. The ""root cause"" of Britain's terror threat is ""Islamist extremism,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said. The execution of American journalist James Foley is clear evidence that ISIS's fight in Iraq and Syria ""is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore,"" according to the UK leader. ISIS is unlike other Islamist extremist groups in its primary focus not to find a country that can be its base of operations, but to create its own country. And the group has had ample success in that regard, given the vast reach already of what it calls the Islamic State. While it's been widely reviled internationally, ISIS has managed to attract some support among Muslims and drawn foreign fighters, like the masked man with an apparent British accent who took part in Foley's beheading, who some fear could soon carry out attacks back home. Even without specific threats in the West, ISIS' track record in Syria and Iraq -- where it was known to massacre minorities, forcefully institute Sharia law and stage executions and stonings -- suggest it may be capable of anything. Cameron said the group  poses a ""greater and deeper"" threat than Britain has ever known. ""This is al Qaeda version 6.0,"" Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Syria, told CNN on Friday. ""They are like nothing we have ever seen before."" Travel restrictions, an increase in police activity . ISIS has been operating for years; now its actions in Iraq are prompting the United States to target its fighters with airstrikes there and to threaten more such strikes in Syria. Cameron said military force is among the tools that can be used against ISIS, while adding that aid, diplomacy and political influence should also be part of Britain's response. That said, his focus Friday wasn't so much about what to do about ISIS overseas as it was keeping British citizens back home safe. The Prime Minister vowed he will soon announce plans to stop would-be jihadists from traveling to Syria and Iraq and to make it easier to take their passports away. Britain also needs to do more to stop current fighters from returning from the Middle East and to deal decisively with those who already have returned, he said. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups. Britain's national policing lead for counterterrorism, Mark Rowley, said -- while the threat level just went up Friday -- police have been escalating their efforts to combat the jihadist threat for months. He claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding ""terrorist activity through to the preparation and/or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training."" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen says Britain likely hiked its terror threat level because ""there's no way you can track 500 people."" At the same time, he downplayed the idea that Friday's announcement means an attack is imminent. ""This is what governments are paid to do: They are paid to worry about their citizens,"" Bergen said, noting that the UK threat level has gone up before without a subsequent attack. ""That doesn't mean their citizens should be in a constant state of worry."" Holiday security amped in U.S. -- but not due to ISIS . Security will increase this long Labor Day weekend for those traveling in the United States -- though not necessarily because of ISIS. A U.S. federal official says its customary to see increased security presence leading up to a holiday weekend, but that's not necessarily tied to an increased terror threat. To that point, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he doesn't anticipate the U.S. terror threat level will rise anytime soon. And  U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson pointed out there is no specific threat against the United States. That said, Johnson noted that ISIS has proved to be a threat to Americans overseas -- with Foley's execution and the threats of more killings to follow being exhibit No. 1. The Homeland Security department ""has taken a number of steps to enhance aviation security at overseas airports with direct flights to the United States, and the United Kingdom and other nations have followed with similar enhancements."" Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department counterterrorism director in President Barack Obama's administration, acknowledged ISIS sympathizers could lash out domestically or Americans who've gone to fight with militants could bring that fight back home. Still, that doesn't mean we should expect a coordinated attack outside the Middle East anytime soon, he said. ""I think there is a certain amount of hyperventilation at the moment,"" said Benjamin, now head of Dartmouth College's John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding. ""The long-term threat is quite serious ... But this is a group that has no track record of plotting terrorist attacks outside of its own area."" Report: ISIS computer included files on biological weaponry . So what is ISIS capable of -- whether it's in the Middle East or elsewhere? That's hard to answer definitively, since the group hasn't lashed out outside the Middle East like al Qaeda. A recent story in Foreign Policy magazine, however, suggest that ISIS is thinking big. The report talks about files on a laptop that purportedly once belonged to ISIS before being abandoned in Syria. They files reportedly include talk about biological and other such weapons, including the weaponizing of the bubonic plague. If these documents are legitimate, they'd suggest that ISIS has a grand strategy and is willing to kill thousands -- including civilians -- using weapons of mass destruction to further its aims. But that doesn't mean the group is close to putting such plans into action. CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank cautioned that there's a big difference between researching chemical and biological agents and creating the capability to use them. He noted that al Qaeda tried for two decades to develop such weapons, with no apparent success. And there's no evidence that ISIS has a dedicated WMD program of its own, said Cruickshank, who suggested the files might ""just be one guy, doing research."" ""It's extremely hard to weaponize these kind of agents -- especially on the delivery side,"" he added. Airstrikes continue . Still, even if ISIS hasn't deployed or even developed chemical or biological weapons, its fighters have proven to be plenty effective with conventional weaponry. Yet now, in Iraq at least, ISIS forces find themselves under fire. The U.S. military has carried out 110 airstrikes in that country since August 8, at an average cost of $7.5 million a day, said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. That includes more strikes Friday targeting ISIS fighters near the Mosul Dam, according to U.S. Central Command. The strikes destroyed four armored vehicles, damaged one more and destroyed three support vehicles, all belonging to the terrorist group, the military said. Iraq's air force continued its own assault on ISIS-controlled Falluja, with the militant group responding in turn. The bombardment killed 18 people and wounded 57 others, a Falluja hospital official and two residents at the facility told CNN. Kirby, like the British Prime Minister, argued that military action alone is not enough to combat extremism. ""If we've learned nothing over 13 years of war, it's that you can't completely eliminate extremism anywhere through simply kinetics, through airstrikes alone,"" he said at a press briefing Friday. Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar .","Ex-U.S. official notes ISIS has yet to attack outside the Middle East .

"Authorities are investigating an anonymous threat against the University of Mississippi's signature greenery ahead of the school's big football game Saturday against bitter rival Mississippi State. A note received Tuesday on the Oxford, Mississippi, campus of Ole Miss said, ""What's going to happen to ya'll on the field Saturday Aint nothing compared to what's going to happen on your beautiful campus. You won't be one of the most pretty campus's Next year. A lot of shrubs and trees are going to die; especially in the grove. Can't stop us."" The handwritten note was signed, ""Hail State Go to Hell TSUN."" TSUN, a reference to Ole Miss, stands for ""The School Up North"" -- both a geographical and snarky term for Oxford's location 100 miles northeast of the town of Starkville and Mississippi State and widely used when discussing the schools' matchup. It was not clear how the note came to the attention of authorities, but university police said it was sent to the FBI's office in Jackson this week. The warning against The Grove, the University of Mississippi's storied tailgating area, also prompted campus police to add additional law enforcement resources to address fan safety around the stadium ahead of the matchup, known to fans as the Egg Bowl. ""Fans are being encouraged to report any suspicious behavior,"" said Danny Blanton, director of public relations at the University of Mississippi. ""We are looking forward to having another hospitable, enjoyable experience to celebrate the final home game of the season."" The threat recalls another Southeastern Conference rivalry that prompted one fan to the poison Auburn University's trees at the school's Toomer's Corner. Alabama fan Harvey Updyke Jr. targeted the famed oaks after Auburn won a contentious November 2010 football game against the University of Alabama. Updyke served 76 days in prison for the crime. ""This longtime football rivalry has separated families and friends for generations, but while it's spirited, our attention has been focused mostly on the football field,"" Ole Miss police Chief Calvin Sellers said in a statement. ""We encourage everyone to remember that this is a game, after all, not a time for hate. We are hopeful that passions have not escalated to the point that someone is prepared to do damage to a landmark for which all Mississippians take great pride.""","FBI looks into handwritten note threatening trees and shrubs in Ole Miss' Grove .

"Health officials say they have made an important discovery in the mystery surrounding the deaths of 64 children in Cambodia. The Institut Pasteur in Cambodia tested samples taken from 24 patients and found 15 had tested positive for Enterovirus Type 71 -- a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease that can also cause severe neurologic complications, mainly in children. ""These results now give a good explanation to this outbreak,"" Dr. Philippe Buchy, head of the institute's virology unit, said in an e-mail. ""We will get more results hopefully by next Tuesday or Wednesday."" But an official with the World Health Organization cautioned that the outbreak has not been fully solved, and more analysis is needed. Outbreaks ""occur periodically in the Asia-Pacific region,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Brunei had its first major outbreak in 2006.  China had an outbreak in 2008. Though the detection of EV71 in Cambodia is significant, there may be other factors, said Dr. Beat Richner of Kantha Bopha hospitals. Over the past three months, 66 children -- between 2 and 3 years old -- were admitted to Kantha Bopha facilities. All but two died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications, Richner said. In their last hours of their life, the children suffered a ""total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs,"" Richner said. ""We have now to see what really is causing the deadly pulmonary complication and see if a toxic factor is playing a role too,"" he said. Investigators probe mystery disease killing Cambodian children . The positive test for EV71 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness, as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections, and no vaccine is available. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. Richner said the patients suffered from encephalitis, which is the inflammation of the brain. On Sunday, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Cambodia warned the new discovery ""does not mean we have solved the problem of the undiagnosed cases. A lot more analysis is needed, and further laboratory investigations need to be done."" Richner criticized WHO for previously making statements to the media ""without being clear on the facts,"" the hospital official said in his statement Sunday. ""WHO was telling whole the world: New mystery killer disease in Cambodia! This was causing unnecessary panic in Cambodia,"" Richter wrote. Richner has said the number of cases affected by the mysterious disease is relatively low -- 34 cases in June, compared with the 75,000 sick children at Kantha Bopha's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids. But Pieter van Maaren with the WHO in Cambodia rejected suggestions that his organization caused any kind of panic.  He said Richner was the one who stated, in a letter to the government, that the situation in Cambodia was ""most severe."" ""WHO has not made any statement about the disease, other than what we issued in the joint press release with the Ministry of Health,"" van Maaren said. The ministry reported the outbreak to WHO through the International Health Regulations, which 194 nations are parties to, van Maaren said.  ""Since this event fitted the criteria of being an event where the underlying agent, disease or mode of transmission is not identified at the time, WHO is obliged to communicate information to other member states.""

"A beached whale in New Jersey has tested positive for a virus that likely caused more than 1,200 dolphins to become stranded in shallow water or to wash up on shores, researchers said Thursday. After the 21-foot minke whale washed up on the shores of Atlantic City on May 1, a  necropsy and subsequent analysis by the University of California, Davis confirmed that the whale was positive for cetacean morbillivirus, according to the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey. The virus is similar to measles in humans or canine distemper in dogs, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. After consulting with disease experts and conducting tests on dolphins in several states, NOAA determined that morbillivirus is likely the cause for 1,283 dolphin ""strandings"" on the East Coast since last July. For each of the previous five years, there were an average of 253 strandings for that same time period. The strandings, where dolphins get stuck in shallow water or wash up on shores, are more than five times the historical average in the affected areas: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, according to NOAA. Some of the stranded dolphins were found alive, but most were found dead, with many in a state of advanced decomposition. Many dolphins had  lesions on their skin, mouth, joints, or lungs, according to data published on NOAA's website. The minke whale, which was tagged with graffiti the night it washed up on the beach, is the first whale that tested positive for the virus in New Jersey. Some were found in other states along the East Coast. ""We've had three humpback whales that tested suspect positive, but we're still waiting for additional lab results.  Two pigmy sperm whales have also tested positive,"" said Maggie Mooney-Seus, public affairs officer for NOAA. Robert Schoelkopf, the director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, says it's unclear how the minke whale contracted the virus, but additional testing is being done. ""Minke whales don't travel in large groups like dolphins do, so it's still uncertain,"" Schoelkopf said. Mooney-Seus said it was unknown whether ""it's a strain of morbillivirus in whales or if it was transmitted from dolphins."" NOAA officials say there is no way to stop the spread of the virus. Currently, there are no medications or vaccines that could be effectively administered to wild marine populations. ""We can't inoculate every marine mammal in the ocean,"" Schoelkopf said. Scientists hope that learning more about the virus will help them address factors that may facilitate its spread. While the virus is generally spread through the air or through contact with other animals, it is not infectious to humans. On August 8, 2013, NOAA issued an Unusual Mortality Event in response to the high number of deaths. The declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give ""insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare,"" according to NOAA's website. The UME declaration for the mid-Atlantic bottlenose dolphins was one of 60 that the agency has issued since it was established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1991. In 29 of those cases, infections, biotoxins, human intervention and malnutrition, were among the causes determined.","A beached whale in New Jersey has tested positive for a virus found in hundreds of dolphins .

"One child died and several others were hurt in a grenade attack on a children's Sunday-school class in Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross said. A Kenyan hospital reported seven children wounded. The Kenya Red Cross and local media described the incident at St. Polycarp church in Nairobi as a grenade attack. Government officials did not answer repeated telephone calls from CNN seeking comment. Four injured children were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital -- two for treatment of critical wounds, said Dr. Mutie Thomas, the hospital's senior assistant director. Doctors treated and released another three people, Thomas said. The injuries involve soft tissue damage, head wounds and broken bones, Thomas said. The children were between the ages of 7 and 10. The Kenya Red Cross tweeted that one child died, and that ""six critical children"" were taken to a hospital. Such attacks have escalated since Kenyan forces invaded neighboring Somalia last year to battle the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, blaming it for kidnappings of foreigners in the nation. The main force of Kenyan and Somali troops have taken control of police headquarters, a radio station and a seaport of the port city of Kismayo, Somalia, the Kenya Defence Forces announced on Twitter Sunday. As the joint forces gain ground, ""this has given an added impetus to the Somali peace process,"" the Kenyan military said. An advance unit landed on the beaches north of the city on Friday and has secured northern parts of the town, the university and one important highway, according to the military's Twitter account. A Kenyan military spokesman said Saturday that the operation was going well. ""Al-Shabaab has not been able to offer any resistance whatsoever to the ground forces since the ground forces landed there yesterday, and the whole of yesterday and the good part of today they have (suffered) heavy casualties,"" he said. In a series of posts Saturday on a Twitter account often used by Al-Shabaab, the group said the Kenyan military is ""waging a losing battle"" in Kismayo. It said mujahedeen forces ambushed Kenyan troops 30 km (18 miles) west of Kismayo, destroying three vehicles and killing dozens of troops in a two-hour battle. The military spokesman said those reports are ""pure propaganda."" On Sunday Al-Shabaab said on the Twitter account: ""The shelling of the city lays bare the intentions of KDF invaders & reveals that their war isn't just against (Al-Shabaab) but the Muslims of Somalia."" Al-Shabaab uses Kismayo to make money from the illegal charcoal trade and smuggling. Thousands of residents of the city fled before the fighting, according to the U.N.","Kenyan military moves into key port city, takes control of police station .

"The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un suffered a fatal stroke while she was on the phone with him, arguing about her husband's execution, according to a defector from the secretive nation. Kim Kyung Hee was the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died three years ago and left his son in power. Her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December, shocking many observers around the world. Jang, the younger leader's uncle by marriage, was considered instrumental in his rise to power. Before his execution, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion late last year, having him executed on charges that he tried to overthrow the government. ""In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year, we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists,"" the North Korean leader said in a New Year's address shortly after the execution. Days after the execution, Jang's wife suffered her third stroke, according to Kang Myung-do, a defector who was son-in-law to North Korea's ex-Prime Minister, Kang Sun San. She was on the phone with the North Korean leader when she suffered the stroke, Kang said. She was hospitalized and later died. CNN could not independently confirm the defector's information. The death was not announced because she died a few days after her husband and the government did not want people to link her death to his, according to the defector. Korean media have reported that she committed suicide five days after her husband's execution.","Kim Kyung Hee was the sister of Kim Jong Il .

"A former Guantanamo Bay detainee from Britain appeared in a London court Saturday, charged with Syria-related terrorism offenses, UK police said. Moazzam Begg, 45, from Birmingham, is accused of providing instruction and training for terrorism and funding terrorism overseas, West Midlands Police said. A 44-year-old woman, Gerrie Tahari, also from Birmingham, is also accused of funding terrorism overseas. Both suspects, who were arrested Tuesday and charged late Friday, denied the charges at Westminster Magistrates' Court. They were remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey criminal court in London on March 14. Two other men, aged 20 and 36, who were also arrested on Tuesday remain in custody, the police said. Begg was arrested as a suspected al Qaeda member in Pakistan in February 2002 and was held at the U.S. airbase at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Begg spent nearly three years in custody. He was sent back to Britain by the Bush administration in early 2005 and was never prosecuted. He co-authored a book about his experiences at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 and has appeared as a public speaker and commentator in Britain and overseas since his release.","Moazzam Begg appears in court charged with providing training for terrorism .

"A guard was freed Thursday night after being held hostage by inmates at a South Carolina maximum-security prison for almost five hours, authorities said. The incident occurred at Lee Correctional Institute in Bishopville, a prison where another guard was held hostage in June. Bishopville is about 55 miles west of the capital, Columbia. The incident started just before 5 p.m. ET in the prison's Chesterville dormitory, said Clark Newsom, a public information officer for the South Carolina Department of Corrections. The guard, who was not identified, was rescued just before 10 p.m. by a large number of officers, Newsom said. He suffered cuts to his head and arm but was able to walk out of the prison after he was freed. The guard was then airlifted to a hospital, mainly as a precaution, Newsom said. The inmates involved surrendered and the incident is under investigation, CNN affiliate WLTX reported. In June, a different guard at the facility, which holds about 1,200 prisoners, was held hostage for several hours before being freed. Lee Correctional Institute is a Level 3 or maximum-security prison ""designed primarily to house violent offenders with longer sentences, and inmates who exhibit behavioral problems,"" according to the Corrections Department website.

"French President Francois Hollande is visiting Guinea on Friday in a direct show of support for the West African nation as it battles the deadly Ebola virus. Hollande has been accompanied on the one-day trip by a delegation including the French health minister and the head of the Red Cross in France. While in Guinea, Hollande will meet with the country's leaders, visit medical facilities and hold a round-table discussion with people directly involved in fighting the disease. He will also pay tribute to the contribution of French medical workers in Guinea. This week, the World Health Organization said the spread of the virus appeared to have stabilized in Guinea, an encouraging development. In a briefing to journalists ahead of the trip, the presidential office said Hollande wanted to take stock of the efforts being made to combat Ebola, not just in Guinea but around the world. By going there, he hopes to show solidarity with Guinea and its neighbors and send the world a message about not stigmatizing countries affected by Ebola. In October, Hollande announced a comprehensive plan to fight the disease in France and West Africa, including 100 million euros for treatment and prevention efforts. France has already built one treatment center in Guinea and is in the process of building two more. Two training centers for caregivers are also being built in the Conakry area. As of Sunday, there had been 1,260 deaths in Guinea out of 2,134 confirmed, probable or suspected cases of Ebola, the WHO said in an update Wednesday. In total, 5,689 people have died from the Ebola virus, and there have been 15,935 cases in eight countries since the outbreak began. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone remain by far the worst-affected countries. They reported 600 new cases in the week ending Sunday, with 385 of those in Sierra Leone. ""Case incidence is stable in Guinea, stable or declining in Liberia, but may still be increasing in Sierra Leone,"" the WHO said. The WHO update also warned that cases and deaths continue to be under-reported in this outbreak. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have recorded 15,901 cases and 5,674 deaths attributed to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak.","French President Francois Hollande visits Guinea to show his solidarity and support .

"Los Angeles, California -- She's been called ""the female Obama"" by some media, and the president even paid her a visit this week to help her political fortunes. Like Barack Obama, she aspires to a lot of firsts. Kamala Harris is the daughter of a father from Jamaica and a mother from India, and she's seeking to be the first black woman attorney general of California. If elected, Harris would be ""the first female, the first African-American, the first Asian-American attorney general in California and the first South Asian-American attorney general in the nation,"" according to her campaign literature. On Friday, Harris joined the president at a Los Angeles rally at the University of Southern California, a day after he appeared at one of her fundraisers in Atherton, California. She worked on Obama's campaign in 2008. A Democrat, she's now the San Francisco district attorney who's running against Steve Cooley, a Republican who's the Los Angeles district attorney. In a Los Angeles Times/USC poll released Friday, Cooley held a narrow lead over Harris -- 40 percent to her 35 percent -- with 17 percent of likely voters still undecided. Harris, who turned 46 on Wednesday, was born in Oakland and grew up in the liberal bastion of nearby Berkeley during its 1960s-'70s heyday. Her parents attended graduate school there, and they took Harris to many civil rights protests, instilling in her a sense of social justice. Her first name means ""lotus flower"" in Sanskrit. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, immigrated as an adult to the United States from Chennai, Tamil Nadu state, India. She became a physician specializing in breast cancer research; she later died of breast cancer. Her father, Donald Harris, became a Stanford University economics professor. Her parents divorced when Kamala Harris was a small girl, and her mother raised her and her sister. After attending Howard University and then the University of California Hastings College of the Law, Harris worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, and then as an attorney in the San Francisco district attorney's and San Francisco city attorney's offices. She was elected district attorney in 2003, becoming the first black woman to hold such an office in California. Her pedigree, however, isn't without political liabilities, said analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior fellow at the School of Policy, Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ""There's a couple of obstacles that Kamala Harris faces: one, the San Francisco designation, which in the minds of many voters means soft on crime, rightly or wrongly. And two, I do believe that California voters still have a perception of a guy being stronger on the issues of law enforcement. There's no reason, but I do think that exists still,"" Jeffe said. One significant difference between Harris and Cooley is the death penalty, which Cooley supports and Harris opposes. In his campaign, Cooley has been publicizing his prosecution of eight former and current officials in Bell, California -- a public corruption case that has attracted national attention because officials in the small city allegedly misappropriated $5.5 million, including awarding a nearly $800,000 salary for the city manager. ""There is a fairly powerful Cooley spot (on television) that mentions that a cop killer wasn't committed to death because of her and her policies"" in San Francisco, Jeffe said. ""He's not a rigid ideologue. He's a pragmatist."" For her part, Harris said she would still enforce death penalty verdicts as attorney general. Her spokesman pointed out that the current attorney general, Jerry Brown, who's running for governor, also opposes the death penalty. Harris said San Francisco's conviction rates are at the highest level in 15 years, and as a result of her innovative initiatives, fewer repeat offenders are revolving through the criminal justice system, she said.","Kamala Harris, 46, seek to be the first black woman attorney general in California .

"Washington (CNN) -- They say you always remember your first. That's why, as election results pour in Tuesday night, Rick Santorum will be ready with a fully-charged cell phone and a spreadsheet loaded with names and numbers of Republican candidates to call as soon as their victories -- or defeats -- are announced. ""We'll be hitting the phones,"" Santorum told CNN. ""I'm one of the folks who calls either way. Sometimes it's more important to call the folks who didn't win than it is the folks who did because the folks who did get a lot of calls and the folks who didn't don't get many."" For the possible 2016 hopefuls, Election Night calls are about much more than who controls the Senate. This is an early â€” and important â€” opportunity to build relationships with candidates at all levels of politics who might come in handy should they decide to campaign for the White House. Beyond just being a kind gesture, Election Night calls are an opportunity to subtly remind candidates -- especially those in early-voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- of their support. In Santorum's case, his effort won't stop with top-of-the-ballot governors or congressional races, either. His aides plan to monitor state and local races online throughout Iowa, such the State Auditor and Agriculture Secretary elections, so he can be one of the first to be in touch. He's hardly alone. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, one of the most dogged campaign travelers this cycle, will spend Tuesday night at an event in Louisville for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other statewide candidates. Doug Stafford, a Paul adviser, will be at his side and will have cell phone numbers ready to dial. ""We will call a bunch but will also probably end up talking to more over the subsequent days when they have time to take a breath,"" Stafford told CNN. ""It has been my experience the most difficult time to reach anyone is on their election night."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to be in his home state on Election Night with the numbers handy for every GOP gubernatorial candidate on the ballot this year. He's kept an ambitious campaigning and fundraising schedule this year in his role as the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. For their part, representatives for Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden wouldn't detail their Election Night plans, although both have invested time on the trail campaigning for their party candidates. Other prominent Republicans will stay busy even if they're not going to such great lengths as Santorum's phone call spreadsheet. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential candidate, will keep tabs on the election results with local candidates and supporters in Burlington. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal will spend the night in Baton Rouge. Meanwhile, in Texas, there will be plenty of 2016 intrigue at a gathering to celebrate Greg Abbott's expected win in the governor's race. That party, at the Moody Theater in Austin, will attract three possible 2016 White House contenders Cruz, Perry and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush under one roof. The election night phone call tradition, of course, is just a small part of the effort that goes into fostering goodwill for presidential contenders. Many potential 2016ers, including Paul, Santorum, Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have logged tens of thousands of miles supporting candidates this election cycle. Those efforts kicked into hyper-drive in final days of campaign season. Christie, for instance, stumped in 15 states in the last week of the race. Over the weekend, Santorum traveled to Kansas, Texas, North Carolina and Iowa, where his advocacy organization, Patriot Voices, bussed in volunteers to knock on doors for candidates in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio went to to Iowa to promote Senate candidate Joni Ernst and others. And Cruz hoofed it to Alaska to support Republican Senate candidate Dan Sullivan. They're betting that it will all be worth the effort when the presidential primary season begins in earnest, a time when each contender will be making a very different round of phone callsâ€”asking for support for their own campaigns.","Rick Santorum will call candidates across the country when their races are decided .

"Twelve people have been sentenced to death for organizing attacks that left dozens of people dead in the restive western Chinese province of Xinjiang earlier this year. The incident -- described by authorities as an ""organized and premeditated"" terror attack -- occurred in the region's Shache County on July 28, when a gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians, a police station, government offices and smashed vehicles. Police returned fire and shot dozens of the attackers, state media reported at the time. State media has reported a wave of violent attacks in Xinjiang in recent months. Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming in March. The next month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market in May killed at least 39 people. Ethnic tensions . The province has seen longstanding tensions between its Uyghur Muslim population, a Turkic people, and the local Han population -- China's biggest ethnic group. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang -- a charge China's central government denies. Monday's hearing at the court in Kashgar, western Xinjiang, also saw 15 others handed the death penalty, but suspended for two years, according to the official news portal of the government of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and quoted by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine people were jailed for life, while another 20 defendants got four to 20 years behind bars. An additional two defendants were released on probation.

""I came out and saw the defendants, and it was about 99.9 percent Afro-Americans,"" Arrington told CNN affiliate WSB-TV of Atlanta, ""and at some point in time, I excused some lawyers -- most of them white -- and said to the young people in here, 'What in the world are you doing with your lives?'""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Three prominent tribal leaders, including the head of Saddam Hussein's Sunni tribe and two others who had been working for national reconciliation, were killed over the past 24 hours in northern Iraq. Sunnis visit Saddam Hussein's grave in 2007. The man who took Hussein's body for burial was killed Tuesday. A bomb on Tuesday killed Sheikh Ali al-Nida, head of the al-Bou Nasir tribe, which includes Hussein's family, according to an official from Salaheddin province. The sheikh was traveling from Ouja, Hussein's hometown, toward Tikrit when an explosive attached to his sport utility vehicle detonated. He and his driver were killed, and two bodyguards were critically wounded. Al-Nida was leader in Ouja of the Awakening Council, an American-backed group of former insurgents or their supporters. In December 2006, al-Nida flew to Baghdad and picked up Hussein's body for burial in Ouja after the former dictator's execution. In Mosul, gunmen shot dead two tribal leaders from Tal Afar, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Killed were Sheikh Abdul Nour Mohammed al-Tahhan of the Obeid tribe and Sheikh Mohammed Khalil Hamash of the Halabid tribe. They were headed to Tal Afar after attending a meeting in Mosul. Both are Sunni Arabs. They were working to bring together Shiites and Sunnis Turkmen in Tal Afar, which has a large Turkmen population. A Tal Afar official said both sheikhs played big roles in reconciliation there. Mosul and Tal Afar are large cities in Nineveh province, where American and Iraqi troops have been fighting al Qaeda in Iraq. Elsewhere in northern Iraq on Tuesday, Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition troops killed three suspected militants in an operation targeting al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. military said. The deaths occurred about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Kirkuk during an operation targeting an insurgent ""with a long history"" of terrorist activities around Kirkuk, the military said. ""Three armed men refused to comply with instructions to surrender. Responding to the perceived hostile threat, Iraqi and coalition forces engaged the armed men with small-arms fire and supporting aircraft, killing all three terrorists,"" the military said. Five people were detained in the operation, and troops destroyed explosives and grenades found at the scene. Coalition troops have been battling Sunni Arab insurgents in much of northern Iraq, including Tameem province -- which includes oil-rich Kirkuk, where Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Turkmens have been jockeying for political power.

"Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has ordered that his chief of general intelligence be replaced by a former ambassador to the United States, the official Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday. Abdullah's move came with his issuance of a royal order relieving Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz of his post and appointing him instead as a ministerial-level adviser and special envoy to the king. To fill the vacated spot, Abdullah appointed Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, who will retain his current job as secretary general of the National Security Council. Bandar served as ambassador to the United States from 1983 to 2005 and was friends with the family of former President George W. Bush. No reason was given for the moves, which come amid unrest in the Qatif region of Eastern Province, where a number of minority Shiites live in the Sunni-ruled country. This year, a man died in clashes between police and protesters demanding social and political reform in Qatif. Last year, Shiite protesters in the Qatif region urged the Saudi government to release Shiite prisoners and grant more rights. Those protests, which were peaceful, also urged the withdrawal of regional forces from Bahrain. Saudi Arabia names new crown prince . Saudi women slam dunk sports taboo .

"James E. Holmes is described by those who know him as a doctoral student who is clean-cut, quiet and responsible, an image difficult to reconcile with the same man who police allege opened fire in a crowded movie theater. Days after the 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of a mass shooting at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, the portrait of Holmes that is emerging is as limited as it is confusing. Pictures obtained of Holmes show a bright-eyed young man, who is tall with dark hair, which contrasts the description of the man by a law enforcement official who said he dyed his hair red and identified himself as ""the Joker"" to authorities after he was arrested early Friday morning for allegedly shooting people during a screening of the new Batman movie. Remembering the victims . By all accounts, Holmes is a bright student. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience in 2010. ""Academically, he was at the top of the top,"" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. UC Riverside police have no record of any contact with Holmes, the university said. Neither did police at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where Holmes enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, university officials said in a statement released Sunday. In fact, the sole contact authorities in Colorado appeared to have had with Holmes was a speeding summons in 2011, according to Aurora police. A syllabus that lists Holmes as a student at the medical school shows that he may have taken a class in which he studied topics as diverse as substance abuse, schizophrenia, depression and other disorders. According to the document, he was to have delivered a presentation in May about microRNA biomarkers. Though there are indications that something may have been amiss in Holmes' life in recent months. He withdrew from the program in June 2012, though ""he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school,"" said Jacque Montgomery, spokeswoman for the University of Colorado. It is not immediately clear if Holmes, who also worked in a paid position in the university's neuroscience research program, was still employed there after withdrawing from the program. Holmes received a large volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, Aurora Police Chief Paul Oates. The police chief has declined to release details about a possible motive or Holmes' appearance at the time of his arrest, citing an ongoing investigation. But he did say Holmes purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months. Police: Evidence of 'calculation and deliberation' in Colorado theater shooting . Police allege Holmes was dressed in black, wearing a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector and a gas mask during the attack. Witnesses to the shooting say because the gunman wore a gas mask, they did not see his face. Unlike most people his age, Holmes does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no Facebook, no Twitter and no Tumblr account, though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on sex website Adult Friend Finder. The profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair, a law enforcement source said. Police believe it may be a picture of Holmes, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The profile said it was created by a 24-year-old man from Aurora and has since been taken down. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . It's a profile that contrasts with news that Holmes worked as a counselor at a summer camp for needy children in 2008. Camp Max Straus caters to needy children ages 7-14, and is run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment. The man who grew up in the upscale northwest San Diego neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos was renting an apartment on in Aurora, according to police and realty records. Tom Mai, a neighbor of the Holmes family in San Diego, described Holmes as ""clean-cut, quiet, responsible."" At the time of his arrest, Holmes was living in a small, three story  brick building on Paris Street in Aurora, in Apartment 10, within walking distance to the university. ""Neighbors report he lived alone and he kept to himself,"" Oates said. A neighbor who lives one floor below Holmes' third-floor apartment, Tori Lynn Everhart, described the apartments this way: ""It's not like true ghetto. It's not the safest neighborhood, but it's definitely improving."" Apparently, Holmes told police during his arrest he had booby-trapped the third-floor apartment. Kaitlyn Fonzi, a 20-year-old grad student and neighbor, said she heard techno music blasting from his apartment around the time of the shooting, and had nearly opened Holmes' unlocked apartment door to complain, unaware that the unit was booby trapped with explosives. Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars' A timer had turned the music on so that it would blare in his apartment after he left for the Aurora multiplex, according to a law enforcement source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Bomb technicians worked Saturday to clear ""all hazards"" from the apartment, and began allowing some evacuated residents to return. Jackie Mitchell, who lives close to Holmes, had a beer with him on Tuesday. Mitchell was stunned at news of Holmes' alleged involvement in the attack. ""You would never guess he was a violent guy,"" Mitchell said, describing Holmes as ""nerdish"" and ""a book-smart type guy."" In San Diego, the suspect's family issued a statement saying they were still trying to process the news. ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,"" the Holmes family said, without giving any information about him.

"(CNN)Not one, but two alligators have been found just a few miles apart in the Los Angeles area this week. On Thursday, Los Angeles Animal Services responded to a home with an eviction notice only to find an abandoned alligator in the backyard -- about six miles from where another alligator was found Monday. The 2½-foot-long American alligator found Thursday was in a large aquarium, a news release from the agency said. American alligators are primarily found in the Southeastern United States, around Florida and Louisiana, according to National Geographic. That's a long way from Southern California. ""It is illegal to keep wildlife without a permit in the City of Los Angeles,"" according to LA Animal Services. The owners were not home at the time, and authorities are looking to talk to them. The alligator is being held at the West Valley Animal Shelter in conjunction with the Los Angeles Zoo, which is looking after the alligator's health. The case is unrelated to Jaxson, a 8-foot-long, 37-year-old alligator that was found Monday at a house where the residents said Jaxson had been their pet for nearly four decades. ""You cannot own a reptile, or wildlife for that matter, like this, in the city of Los Angeles without having a proper permit,"" Mark Sanchez of Los Angeles Animal Services said of the Jaxson case. Criminal investigations are being performed in both cases, but authorities have not said what charges the alligators' owners might face.","On Monday, authorities found an 8-foot-long alligator at an LA home .

"(CNN) -- She was a call girl working the streets of Sin City. He's a guitarist in a heavy metal band. They found commonality in their Christian faith and Friday evening, the two were married in a Las Vegas, Nevada, ceremony broadcast live via the Web.

Annie Lobért, who founded Hookers for Jesus, and musician Oz Fox of the Christian band Stryper said their ""I do's"" at the Church of South Las Vegas in front of an applauding crowd and an audience on the Internet. The wedding had been widely touted on several Christian Web sites. Lobért, 41, walked up to the stage in a white strapless gown, gloves and veil. Earlier this week, she wrote on her MySpace blog: ""I am getting married. It's about time."" She had worked as a prostitute for 11 years, making as much as $500 an hour. She said she hit rock bottom when she overdosed on cocaine and everything went black, according to an ABC interview posted on her Web site. She asked Jesus to help her and became what many jokingly call a ""porn-again Christian."" Lobért says her mission now is to save the souls of women who sell their bodies. She often spends time at night on Las Vegas streets handing out Bibles to prostitutes and seeking to convince them there is a better way to make a living. The Hookers for Jesus Web site describes the organization as ""an international, faith-based organization that addresses the realities of human sex trafficking, sexual violence and exploitation linked to pornography and the sex industry."" Before he administered the vows, Pastor Benny Perez said Lobért was a shining example of Christ's love for everyone.

"(CNN)Roger Federer was back in the mix as a grand slam contender after a superb 2014 season. He reached the Wimbledon final -- taking the world No. 1 Novak Djokovic to five sets -- and ended the campaign by helping Switzerland to a maiden Davis Cup title. But did all the tennis last year cost Federer -- and his 33-year-old body -- at the Australian Open this year? Was it a hand injury that he sustained earlier this week? Or was his opponent simply too good? No matter what the potential reasons, the end result is that Federer will have to wait for a record-extending 18th grand slam title after he lost to Andreas Seppi 6-4 7-6 (5) 4-6 7-6 (5) in the third round in Melbourne on Friday. There were no such troubles for Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Simona Halep. That Seppi was the man who knocked out Federer was a surprise -- in their 10 previous matches, the Italian had never won. He had claimed just one set. And against tennis' big three of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal, Seppi owned a dismal 1-25 record. But the world No. 46 played one of his best matches, crucially not crumbling when the finish line was in sight. Instead it was Federer who blinked in the fourth-set tiebreak. He led 3-1 only to double fault at 3-2. Then leading 5-4, Federer made a costly backhand unforced error. Federer rued missed opportunities in the second set tiebreak, too, when Seppi was there for the taking. ""It just broke me to lose that second set,"" Federer told reporters. ""And actually the fourth, I should win it, too. Just a brutal couple of sets to lose there."" Seppi completed the upset in stunning fashion, scrambling before hitting an instinctive forehand passing shot winner down the line. ""For sure it was one of the important shots of my life,"" said Seppi. Federer thus exited, despite winning more points in the match overall, 145 to 144. ""I felt for some reason yesterday and this morning it was not going to be very simple today,"" Federer said. ""Even in practice I still felt the same way. ""I was just hoping it was one of those feelings you sometimes have and it's totally not true and you just come out and you play a routine match. I was aware of the test and was well prepared. ""Just somehow couldn't play my best tennis today. It was definitely partially because of Andreas playing very well."" Perhaps the warning signs were there from his previous round. Federer lost a set in the second round to Seppi's fellow Italian, Simone Bolelli. He -- and this is rare for Federer -- called for the trainer to address an issue with his hand. Federer thought he might have been stung by a bee. He didn't mention the hand or any other physical issue in his briefing with reporters. Federer also defended his decision to play exhibition matches in India in December during tennis' notoriously short off-season. ""I wanted to go to India,"" said Federer. ""I wanted to go back to Switzerland for Christmas. I practiced as hard as I possibly could. ""Can't do more than that. Sure, the year ended late, but one week later than normal. At the end of the day, honestly I'm confident that what I did was the right thing."" Federer's exit means Murray's path to the semifinals has become significantly easier. The two-time grand slam champion and Federer were, on paper, due to meet in the quarterfinals. While Federer was sent packing, Murray easily dispatched Portugal's Joao Sousa 6-1 6-1 7-5. Murray's performance wasn't the only topic of conversation during his press conference, though. A particular tweet was mentioned, too. After Nadal visibly struggled on court in the second round and was close to vomiting in his five-set victory over Tim Smyczek, Murray appeared to criticize the Spaniard in this tweet: ""When I cramped and won in the us open last year I was a 'drama Queen, unfit, needs to see a shrink, faker' weird..."" Murray wrote. But he insisted Friday he wasn't targeting Nadal. ""I didn't watch the whole match the other night, but clearly Rafa was struggling pretty badly,"" Murray said. ""It was a great effort to come through it, which rightly is what everyone was saying. ""But that certainly wasn't the case at the U.S. Open when I was in a similar state. And yeah, I just don't understand why that would be the case."" Nadal looked better physically on court after suffering from cramps against Smyczek, eliminating Israel's Dudi Sela 6-1 6-0 7-5 under the lights in Rod Laver Arena. He saved all seven break points he faced -- and they all came in the third set. He said in an on-court interview that he slept a lot in a bid to recover but didn't budge when asked for a percentage of how he felt physically. ""Uh, I was never very good in mathematics,"" Nadal joked. Nadal and Murray were joined in the fourth round by seventh-seed Tomas Berdych and 10th-seed Grigor Dimitrov. Dimitrov survived Marcos Baghdatis' upset bid, edging the charismatic 2006 finalist 4-6 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-3. Winners in the women's draw included third-seed Halep and seventh-seed Eugenie Bouchard.","Roger Federer loses to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open .

"(CNN)Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played Theo Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show,"" has been quiet about his onetime TV father, Bill Cosby -- until now. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Warner said that Cosby was a major influence in his life, and it's ""painful"" to watch him become the subject of rape allegations. ""He's one of my mentors, and he's been very influential and played a big role in my life as a friend and mentor,"" Warner said. ""Just as it's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not, it's just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this."" About two dozen women have accused Cosby of drugging and sexual misconduct in allegations that go back decades, in some cases. Cosby has never faced criminal charges. He and his attorneys have repeatedly denied the allegations. At least three of Cosby's accusers have filed a federal defamation lawsuit against him, claiming that after they came forward with allegations, they were called liars. Warner isn't the only ""Cosby Show"" star to talk. Phylicia Rashad, who played Cosby's wife on ""The Cosby Show"" as well as on the later ""Cosby,"" said she sees the controversy as part of a larger plot. ""Someone is determined to keep Bill Cosby off TV,"" she told Showbiz 411's Roger Friedman. ""And it's worked. All his contracts have been canceled."" Cosby was supposed to appear in a new NBC sitcom, but the project has been shelved. He continues on his concert tour, though some stops have attracted protesters. Warner said he thinks of Cosby positively. ""I can't really speak on any of the allegations because obviously, I was not there. The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people,"" he said. ""What he's done for comedy and television has been legendary and history-making.

"(CNN) -- Scotland may have voted no on independence, but 16- and 17- year-olds offered a resounding yes to the question of whether young people can be motivated to take part in the political process after being allowed to vote for the first time. With voter turnout reportedly edging close to a remarkable 90% in some areas, many are pondering what we can expect from the youth vote in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections. As members of America's largest generation, the millennials, young voters certainly made their mark on U.S. politics when they turned out in force and paved the way for Barack Obama to win the Iowa caucuses in 2008. In fact, if that vote had taken place only among caucus-goers over 30, Hillary Clinton would have won Iowa (and likely would be president today). Six years later, however, a different picture emerges. Rather than being empowered to remain active in politics after making history in 2008, young voters are sadly becoming more disillusioned and distrustful of all things Washington. In our most recent Harvard Institute of Politics survey, only 23% of 18- to 29-year-olds indicated they would ""definitely"" be voting in November -- a number that has grown smaller as the election nears and that trails the benchmark from 2010. Meanwhile, trust in almost every institution tested annually in our survey has also fallen since the last midterm campaign: Trust in the presidency is down 12 percentage points to less than one-third, trust in both Congress and the federal government is also down -- to 14% and 20%, respectively. Meanwhile, the number of young voters who believe that elected officials seemed to be motivated by selfish reasons has increased from 54% in 2010 to 62% today. The factors leading up to Obama's runaway victory against John McCain in 2008 were clear. The older millennials were raised in the shadows of the patriotism Americans felt after 9/11; they felt let down by President George W. Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina and the march to Baghdad, had witnessed two razor-thin presidential wins in 2000 and 2004 and quickly connected with the first-term senator's powerful combination of message and media. Young voters came out in force then, turning red states to blue because in their mind, in this one instant, politics mattered. For millions, the election of 2008 was their chance to become an active participant in an unfolding chapter in America's proud history. The same went for Scotland on Thursday, with the vast majority of teenagers over 16 voting because it mattered to them as well. Like their cousins in America, they imagined a time telling their grandchildren what it was like the day everyone voted. The problem today is that through word and deed, it seems like every elected member of our government is going out of his or her way to illustrate to young people that government does not matter, that the fundamental challenges of our time are better left for others. This is why youth turnout has fallen in every election since Obama's first. In a poll we released a few days ago for Politico, for example, we found that millennials are less likely than every other age group to vote in November, they are less enthusiastic about the election, and more than 60% disapprove of the way that each party is doing its job in Congress. It is impossible to have an election without choices, even bad ones. This week Scotland chose to remain part of the union rather than forge its independence, a choice with real consequences. Unfortunately, young U.S. voters by and large just do not see the midterm elections offering legitimate choices because, in their eyes, Congress has proven to be largely ineffectual, and worse uncaring. By eschewing regular participation in electoral politics, young people are making the choice to serve their community and country in other ways, namely through volunteerism. It is now up to the President and members of the House and Senate to take heed of this disillusionment and make a choice to inspire our largest generation to be civic-minded, to participate in the debate and process of politics working together to make our country a better place. In fact, when you step back and think about it, it really shouldn't be a choice at all.","Young voters paved the way for Obama to win Iowa caucuses in 2008, John Della Volpe says .

"(CNN)Well, the Senate says climate change isn't a hoax. Phew. But are we causing it? Oh no-no-no, says half the Senate. Forty-nine senators (full list here) voted on Wednesday against an amendment that said climate change is happening and, crucially, that it's actually-for-real caused by human emissions. That's something scientists are pretty darn sure about, and have been for more than a decade. These votes -- particularly the not-a-hoax vote -- have been heralded by some in environmental circles, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, as a sign of progress, like a ""coming out"" party of sorts. At least the senators are going on record, the argument goes. At least, in a 98-to-1 vote, they said, in public, that climate change is not a hoax. I'm not so sure. True, there would be value in knowing where every senator stands on climate change. Americans -- 61% of whom say climate change is real and 40% of whom know it's caused by people, according to to a 2014 Pew survey -- have a right to know where their elected officials fall on this and many other important policy issues. But -- and this is an important ""but"" -- that's not what we learned on Wednesday. We learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening -- without blaming humans for it. Among them is Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who is perhaps Washington's most vocal climate denier. He continued that streak this week. ""Climate is changing, and climate has always changed, and always will, there's archaeological evidence of that, there's biblical evidence of that,"" Inhofe said on the Senate floor, according to Bloomberg News and others. ""The hoax is that there are some people that are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful that they can change climate. Man can't change climate."" Helpful, huh? We also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is, in fact, caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. That could seem like a win for the left, at least an effort to pin down senators who don't buy the science saying humans do contribute. But among the no votes was Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said her reason for voting no simply was the word ""significantly,"" according to The Hill. (The amendment said ""human activity significantly contributes"" to the warming climate.) That's an artful dodge. And it means neither vote offers true clarity. These votes are more witch hunt than substance. The political left seems to want to embarrass the right for denying the facts of climate change. The right, as Elana Schor of Politico smartly noted, played this brilliantly, appearing to take a the-Earth's-not-flat stance on this, while actually ceding next-to-nothing. Meanwhile, the people we actually need to be listening to on this issue are not the politicians. They're the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions. I hate doom-and-gloom climate politics as much as the next guy, but that's the reality. And here's the other part of it: There's time to act. Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence. The other voices that need to be heard in this debate are those of ordinary people, all over the world, who already are seeing their lives and livelihoods disturbed by warming temperatures and changing oceans. I met some of them last year at a 300,000-person climate rally in New York. They're people like Bren Smith, this oyster farmer in Connecticut. And Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a young mom from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels. ""I am fearful,"" she told me, ""but for the most part, I'm optimistic."" Congress could take note, and so should we. We should listen to their stories. Listen to the science. Debate the solutions. And skip the rest. It's mostly hot air.","John Sutter: Senate's climate vote is mostly hot air .

"(CNN)President Obama's new tax plan includes some sensible ideas. Unfortunately, it would mean increasing taxes on saving and investment, which are key drivers of economic growth, according to various experts. On balance, I believe the plan moves in the wrong direction. The President's proposal to boost the earned income tax credit for childless low-wage workers is a sensible step to strengthen the social safety net and encourage people to work. Expanding the credit, an idea also put forward by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, would draw childless adults into the labor force and give them income support. The President is also proposing two supply-side measures that would reduce barriers to work. Under today's tax system, secondary earners often face high tax rates based on the couple's combined earnings. That penalizes two-earner couples and discourages spouses from entering the work force. Some supporters of the tax penalty see it as a way to strengthen their vision of traditional family values. But Americans should be free to choose their own family values, without interference from the tax system. Obama tax plan: Middle-class credits, increases for rich . The President's plan would reduce the tax bias against two-earner couples by providing a second-earner credit and expanding the credit for child care costs. A bigger child care credit is particularly good tax policy. Any tax system that taxes workers on their income should offer relief for work-related costs. Child care costs are definitely work-related; statistical studies confirm that the availability of cheaper child care promotes work by parents, particularly mothers. However, even as the President's plan eases tax barriers to work, it introduces major obstacles to saving. The plan starts on the right track, with measures to make it easier for people to save at their workplaces. But it turns around and strikes a heavy blow against saving by taxing some capital gains at death and raising the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends. Those proposals would amplify the income tax's central flaw, its penalty on saving. People who earn wages and spend them immediately pay tax only on their wages. But those who earn wages, save and consume the proceeds in the future pay tax on both their wages and the returns on their saving. It doesn't make sense to put heavier tax burdens on people who choose to save for the future rather than spend today, particularly when their savings finance the investments that drive the economy's long-run growth. Taxing capital gains at death could be a step forward if tax rates on capital gains and dividends were cut by enough to prevent an increase in the overall burden on saving. For that matter, the combination of taxing gains at death and raising the rates could be a step forward if it was offset by scaling back the corporate income tax, a particularly complicated and destructive levy on saving and investment. But that's a far cry from what the President is proposing. His plan would leave the corporate income tax in place while taxing capital gains at death  and increasing the top tax rate on gains and dividends by more than 4 percentage points (on top of an increase of almost 9 percentage points in 2013). Taxing the savings of ""the 1%"" to finance tax cuts for the middle class may be good politics, but it's a shortsighted approach that could  undermine long-run economic growth. A better approach would have been to curtail the growth of entitlement benefits for those well above poverty and to limit tax breaks for expensive owner-occupied homes. The President has put forward some good ideas to help childless low-wage workers and ease the tax penalty on two-earner couples. But it would be a big mistake to pay for them by penalizing the saving and investment on which our economic future depends.","Alan Viard: President Obama's plan to increase taxes on saving and investment may not be wise .
