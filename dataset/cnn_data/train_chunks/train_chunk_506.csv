A 16-year-old schoolgirl who is accused of her mother's murder was allegedly helped by her female lover. The daughter of Mary Ann Murphy, 48, is accused of taking part in the stabbing of her mother on July 16. Now Rebecca Renee Keller, 20, from Houston, Texas has also been charged with murder and court records claim she had a sexual encounter with the daughter around the time of the slaying. Accused: Rebecca Renee Keller (left), 20, and Zein Imran Ahmed (right), 21, have been charged with the murder of Mary Ann Murphy in Houston, Texas . Keller has also been charged with the sexual assault of a child. A friend of the daughter, Zein Imran Ahmed, 21, has also been charged with the murder at Mrs Murphy's home in the 8300 block of Poplar Ridge Lane, according to my fox houston. While her mother was being murdered, her daughter ran into a neighbor's home and told them that someone was attacking her mother. 'She said her mom was screaming loud, and I did think I heard a scream but I didn't know for sure,' Marcus Cox, the neighbor, said that morning. 'I just thought it was some kids down the street.' When police first went to the home of Murphy, her daughter said that two men had forced their way into the home when they were in bed and murdered her mother before fleeing the scene. It was just days before detectives realized it was a fabricated story and arrested the 48-year-old's daughter and Ahmed, after the knife used in the brutal stabbing was found at his home just blocks away. Scene: Mary Ann Murphy was stabbed to death on July 16 at her home in the 8300 block of Poplar Ridge Lane . Prosecutors said Ahmed admitted slipping into Murphy's bedroom with her daughter's permission. He allegedly got on top of the woman and began stabbing her when she woke up. 'I’ve got testimony and video,' Don Hecker, Ahmed’s attorney told HCSO. 'I’ve got a lot of stuff and he’s just not guilty. 'It is either the desire of the girl to cover her tracks or to keep someone that she knows from being blamed,' he said. The investigation continued after Ahmed and the teen were taken into custody and led to Monday's arrest of Keller. Murphy's daughter was then placed in the custody of the Harris County Juvenile Probation Office.A motive for the murder is not yet clear.

A Mexican robber has admitted murdering a U.S. Border patrol agent whose death revealed a failed federal gun smuggling operation. Manuel Osorio-Arellanes pleaded guilty to killing agent Brian Terry in 2010 - the highest profiel conviction in the case which has embarrassed the federal government and prompted a series of congressional investigations. The killer also confessed to being part of a criminal gang who crossed into the country a week earlier to rob marijuana smugglers, stashing guns and food supplies. Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, pictured, has pleaded guilty to murdering U.S border agent Brian Terry and admitted being part of a robbery gang . Terry's death exposed the . government’s botched ‘Fast and Furious’ gun-smuggling investigation, . during which agents lost track of more than 1,000 guns. Two rifles bought by a smuggling ring were found at the scene of the shooting near the town of Nogales, Arizona. Of the five men charged with the murder, two are in custody and three are fugitives. Osorio-Arellanes is the first to plead guilty, but police are yet to reveal who they believe fired the fatal shot. Prosecutors . agreed not to seek the death penalty against Osorio-Arellanes, who . could be sentenced to life in prison for the first-degree murder . conviction. Federal . authorities have been heavily criticized for allowing suspected straw . gun buyers to walk away from shops with weapons instead of arresting the . suspects and immediately seizing the guns throughout the operation. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, pictured, was killed during an attack on him and three colleagues in 2010 . The . two rifles found at the scene of the shooting were bought by a straw . buyer for a smuggling ring suspected of purchasing guns for the brutal . Sinaloa cartel, according to investigators. Authorities have declined to say whether the murder weapon in Terry's death was linked to a purchase from the operation. Terry and three other agents came under attack in a canyon north of the Arizona border city of Nogales by Osorio-Arellanes and his four other gang members, investigators said. The shooting happened close to the U.S side of the Arizona border town of Nogales. Mexican territory is pictured to the left of the border . Osorio-Arellanes, of El Fuerte in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, was shot during the gunfight and has been in custody since the night of the shooting. He told investigators he raised his weapon toward the agents during the shootout but didn't open fire, the FBI said. Sentencing has been set for January before U.S. District Judge David Bury. ‘Today's plea is an important step in seeking justice on behalf of Agent Terry,’ Laura Duffy, the top federal prosecutor in San Diego whose office is prosecuting the case, said in a statement. ‘Operation Fast and Furious’ was launched in 2009 to catch trafficking kingpins, but federal agents lost track of about 1,400 of the more than 2,000 weapons - including AK-47s and other high-powered assault rifles. Some of the guns purchased illegally with the government's knowledge were later found at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S. Critics have hammered federal authorities for allowing informants to walk away from Phoenix-area gun shops with weapons. Jaime Avila, 25, has admitted in court to buying the two guns and has pleaded guilty to gun charges in a smuggling case that's separate from the prosecution into Terry's death. Avila, who isn't charged in Terry's death, faces up to 10 years in prison when he's sentenced on Dec. 12. Authorities have offered a $1million reward for information leading to the capture of the fugitives. The FBI said it continues to aggressively pursue them.","Brian Terry was shot dead in 2010 near the U.S/Mexican border of city of Nogales, in Arizona .

Cruel: Christine Morgan (pictured) also held the child’s head under bath water, threatened to kill her and hit her in the face . A girl subjected to a decade of abuse was forced to drink bleach from a dirty cloth that had been used to clean toilets, a court heard today. The youngster was left with a 'burning sensation' in her mouth after Christine Morgan, 61, shoved the grimy rag into her mouth. Morgan also held the child’s head under bath water, threatened to kill her and hit her in the face. The violence - which included grabbing the girl by the throat - started when the child was just four years old. She is now an adult but still suffers nightmares and is 'haunted' by her memories of the widow, Southampton Crown Court heard. A judge today told Morgan she can expect to be jailed after a jury took five hours to convict her of two charges of cruelty to a child under 16. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence from behind a screen so she could not be seen from the dock. She recalled how Morgan told her moments before holding her head under water: 'No one wants you - I’m going to murder you in the bath.' She added: 'I have vivid dreams about when I was pushed in the bath. That’s an incident I can always remember.' And the woman said she had been left with a 'burning sensation' in her mouth and 'felt a bit sick' after being force fed the bleach-soaked rag. In a police interview played to the court, the victim said: 'It’s been affecting me for a long time. 'I need something to be done about it for my peace of mind because it’s affected my mental health, everything. 'It’s playing on my mind all the time. It’s always felt in the back of my head that she’s haunting me all the time and I’ve lately just cracked. 'I’m paying for what she did.' Prosecutor Elizabeth Bussey-Jones said: 'She describes from a very early age being subjected to various forms of verbal abuse. 'She was told by Christine Morgan that she hated her, that she was a waste of space and she wanted to kill her. She recalls various acts of violence towards her. 'They vary from being pinned up by the throat against the wall, being smacked and having her hair pulled.' Morgan, from Romsey, Hampshire, was cleared of one charge of indecent assault on a girl under 13. Shocking: The victim, who has not been identified, is now an adult but still suffers nightmares and is 'haunted' by her memories of the widow, Southampton Crown Court (pictured) heard . She denied all charges but told police in interview: 'I would strangle her now.' David Reid, defending, said Morgan was of previous good character and lived on her own.

She will be sentenced at a later date.","The youngster was left with a 'burning sensation' in her mouth after Christine Morgan, 61, shoved the grimy rag into her mouth .

New popularity: The Pill has overtaken the condom as the go-to contraceptive for under-age teenagers . Girls under the legal age of consent are more likely to choose The Pill over the condom as their preferred method of contraception, new figures show. The research suggested 70,000 girls aged 15 and under attended NHS community contraceptive clinics between 2011 and 2012. Forty one per cent of 15-year-olds who . attended clinics opted for the Pill, while 36 per . cent asked for the male condom. This was a turnaround on the previous year when the figures were reversed. The research by the Health and Social . Care Information Centre (HSCIC) also revealed the clinics were used by eight per cent of teenage girls aged 13 to 15 and just under a quarter of 16-to-19-year-old women in England. The HSCIC said that oral contraception has been the most common method of contraception for all the older age groups for many years but it is the first time that the pill has become the most popular form of contraception for 15-year-olds. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'The report captures the changing way in which women across the age range are managing their reproductive health. 'While the oral contraceptive pill is clearly the most popular form of contraception among older women, this report indicates that now, for the first time, it has become the preferred form of contraception among 15-year-old girls too - overtaking the male condom. 'Together with the continuing rise of the long-acting reversible contraceptive, this captures just two of the ways in which people’s choice of contraception is changing.' Rebecca Findlay from the Family Planning Association, said: 'The pill is still a popular method of contraception, it’s easy to use, easy to get hold of and very reliable so it’s not surprising that younger women want to use it. 'It’s important that women whatever their age are offered a choice of the 15 methods so they find the right one for them and also that they remember to use condoms to protect against Sexually Transmitted Infections.'","Report found 70,000 girls aged under 15 attended an NHS contraceptive clinic last year .

Pearl, a Shar Pei dog, suffers from demodectic mange - a skin condition caused by an over-sensitivity to parasitic mites that live on canines' skin. In most dogs, these mites never create problems, but they can cause irritation and hair loss when animals have an impaired immune system or have recently suffered intense . stress or malnutrition. Abandoned: Pearl, pictured with an RSPCA worker Lizzie Aston, was found abandoned in Bulkington Recreation Ground in Nuneaton, West Midlands, after she developed demodectic mange causing all her fur to fall out . Common ailment: Demodectic mange is caused by an over-sensitivity to parasitic mites that live on the skin . But the condition can even lead to death by causing severe inflammation if not treated. The dog could have been treated easily but its owner chose instead to abandon it in a park. Pearl was rescued by the RPSCA in Bulington, Warwickshire on October 13. RSPCA inspector Louise Labram said: 'When our officers found this poor dog, she was suffering from demodectic mange, and she had clearly been left untreated for weeks. 'This could have been treated and sorted quickly and easily had the owner just taken her to a vet. 'But for whatever reason, whoever owned Pearl just abandoned her and left someone else to pick up the pieces.' Demodectic mange is considered a common puppyhood ailment with around 90 per cent of cases resolving on their own with no treatment. Easily treatable: If Pearl's owners had taken her to the vet, she could have been treated with insecticides, antibiotics or shampoos . New home: Pearl is now being cared for by Lizzie Acton and other RSCPA staff in Coventry, Nuneaton . But more severe cases, where the condition is spread over the whole body like Pearl, can be treated with insecticide, antibiotics and shampoos. The 10-month-old pup is now being cared for by staff at the RSPCA Coventry, Nuneaton and District Branch. Glenn Mayroll, animal centre manager, said: 'Pearl is doing well and has now begun treatment for the demodectic mange - and this involves various dips and baths - which she doesn’t seem to mind. 'We think she is just around 10 months old. Pearl is a gorgeous and happy friendly girl and really affectionate and fussy. 'It breaks my heart to think someone has left her to suffer and then just dumped her without a care in the world.'

New York’s major airports have all reopened after more than 19,000 flights were cancelled due to Superstorm Sandy. At JFK Airport, at least 180 flights will take off and land while at Newark airport more than 170 flights are scheduled, with both running normally by tomorrow. In an incredible turnaround, LaGuardia Airport also opened at 7am this morning with a limited service, only days after its runways were completely flooded. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says the first plane landing at LaGuardia was a Delta Air Lines flight out of Syracuse, adding passengers must confirm their flights are going before heading to the airport. Scroll down for video . Turnaround: The scene at LaGuardia Airport after the storm hit. It opened at 7am this morning after its runways were completely flooded . Operation: Emergency services worked around the clock pumping thousands of gallons of floodwater into the East River so the airport could reopen . LaGuardia Airport was the last of New York's three major . airports to reopen with plans for more than 100 flights to fly to and . from its two runways today . UK airlines were able to offer near-normal services to storm-lashed New York today. Virgin Atlantic operated its usual four-flights-a-day service to New York and was also operating normal schedules to Newark in New Jersey and to Boston and Washington DC. British Airways was flying all but one of its 11 daily services to New York as well as normal services to Newark and its other US east coast destinations. 'We flew an extra flight to American yesterday to clear the backlog and we are gradually getting the held-up people home,' said a Virgin spokeswoman today. BA was operating an extra flight to Newark today and the airline has added more ticket machines at airport terminals in New York and Newark to help customers through the rebooking and check-in process as quickly as possible. A BA spokesman said: We would like to thank our customers for their continued patience and understanding.'

Amtrak says it plans to restore some service on Friday to and from New York City with the continual removal of water from flooded train tunnels under the Hudson and East rivers, allowing repairs to tracks, signals and power systems. They plan to announce these schedules sometime today. Lone passenger: A traveller walks onto the Reagan National Airport Metro platform just after it reopened on Tuesday, the day airports in both Washington and Philadelphia reopened . Frustration: Many passengers have found themselves stranded after flights were cancelled . Service to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey has been restored, but Northeast Regional service between Newark and New Haven, Connecticut, and Acela Express service for the length of the Northeast Corridor are cancelled today. American Airlines spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said of their LaGuardia Airport base: 'There is some damage to our offices and facilities. ‘It's not pretty, but we can operate. ‘Our employees are cleaning up for our customers.' Airline employees will also face challenges getting to work. Not only is mass transit severely restricted, but driving in will be more difficult. A passenger sleeps on a cot at the Newark Liberty International Airport . Sandbags line luggage drop off desks at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.

Southwest spokesman Paul Flaningan said yesterday: 'There are a lot of contingencies before we can re-open at LaGuardia. 'It's still barricaded at the front entrance, which makes drop-offs from taxis and buses difficult.' Travel in the Northeast creaked back into motion yesterday, allowing workers to check runways and railroad tracks for water damage. It was a grinding, patchy recovery that made it clear that stranded travellers will struggle to get around for days to come. Failed flights: More than 19,500 flights have been cancelled since Monday night's Superstorm Sandy . Airlines continued to waive fees to change tickets for flights to New York airports. Delta and United said that anyone who planned to fly there through Saturday could change their ticket. However, the re-booked travel still had to begin by Nov. 9, giving travellers a relatively narrow window to make their trip. American's waiver was broader, covering New York tickets through Nov. 7, and allowing rebooked travel through Dec. 20. Airports in Washington and Philadelphia re-opened on Tuesday. The loss of East Coast flights has stranded tourists in New York and kept travellers stuck in Hong Kong. The lack of trains left suburban commuters without a way into work.

Derek Knight was banned for life from driving today as he walked away from Truro Crown Court with a suspended jail term for killing partner Wendy Buttery in a car crash . A motorist who killed his partner when he smashed into a tree has been banned from driving for life. Derek Knight, 68, showed no remorse for causing the death of Wendy Buttery, his partner of 25 years, a judge said as he handed out the ban and a suspended jail term. Knight, 68, lost control of his Peugeot 307, veered off the road and crashed into a tree as he overtook a cyclist on the A39 in Trispen, Cornwall. Mrs Buttery, 76, was travelling in the front seat of the car. She suffered severe chest injuries and died at the scene after the accident on June 4 last year. Knight, of St Ewe, Cornwall, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving at Truro Crown Court. He had never held a UK driving licence but claimed to hold an international licence and said he had driven across 42 countries in his lifetime. He was convicted by a jury at Truro Crown Court of causing the death by careless driving of Mrs Buttery, a grandmother-of-six. Judge Graham Cottle jailed him for nine months, suspended for two years, imposed a three month weekend nighttime curfew and imposed the lifetime driving ban. Knight denied the charge. He told the jury a piece of cardboard fell from the dashboard and obstructed his pedals, causing the engine to rev and preventing him from braking. But forensic examinations found nothing that would have affected the controls. Prosecutor Philip Lee said Knight threw ‘explanations in the air like confetti in the hope they would land in the right place’ and branded his explanation an ‘invention’. A judge said Knight showed no remorse over the death of long-term partner Wendy Buttery. The couple had been together for 20 years . After the verdict, Judge Graham Cottle told the court: 'Anytime he got into that vehicle, or any other vehicle, he was committing a crime. 'I don’t think he should drive again quite frankly.' The judge said Knight had not shown ‘any kind of remorse’ for Mrs Buttery’s death. He said: 'If you kill your partner of 25 years by a piece of driving that is pretty poor. Don’t you feel sorry for that?' Maria White, one of Mrs Buttery's four stepdaughters, said: 'As the judge said he showed no remorse and that’s what hurts. 'He could not even say ""I’m sorry I killed her"".'","Derek Knight drove without a licence for all his life .

Government's chief scientist said it could be too late to stop the . spread of ash dieback, a fungal  disease threatening 80 million ash . trees. Under threat: Experts have already warned that the battle against the ash dieback could already be lost, with the killer fungus that causes it now discovered in 30 sites in the UK .

It warns horse chestnuts are at risk . from a disease called bleeding canker, and the London skyline could be . changed by 'plane wilt', which threatens plane trees . These are found in many cities . because of their resistance to pollution. In total, 25 new pests and . diseases are either already established, recently arriving, on their way . or seen as likely threats to Britain's trees, woods and forests. The report warns: 'Even English oaks . are in trouble, declining under assault from two new, as yet . incompletely understood conditions.' The oak – our most common woodland . tree which is often used as a symbol for England – is threatened by two . of the top five diseases; 'acute and chronic oak decline', and the 'oak . processionary moth'. Peter Goodwin, of Woodland  Heritage, . said of acute oak decline: 'Its impact is going to be far greater than . that of ash dieback. There is not a forester in Britain . who is not terrified of this one. 'The oak is the country's dominant . tree because of its size, importance and history.

Dr Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist . from Oxford University, said the future of our oaks was at a . 'crossroads' because of the threat from acute oak decline.

A Florida man accused of strangling to death two prostitutes and burying at least one of them in his backyard filmed himself raping a third woman after trying to kill her, according to newly released court documents. James Lee Maxwell, 44, has been charged with the murders of Pamela Will, 49, and Chasity Starr, 27. Although Maxwell entered a not guilty plea in August, search warrants that were made public Wednesday show that the man had admitted to strangling Starr to death when questioned by detectives, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Guilty: James Lee Maxwell (pictured) has been charged with the murders of two prostitutes . Her skeletal remains wrapped in a red, white and blue bed spread were unearthed on Maxwell's Port Orange property back in June. Will's badly decomposed body was discovered in a ditch in Ormond Beach, where the suspect worked at one time. Police said she was also throttled. According to authorities, Starr was killed January 15, 2011. A day later, Will's body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with her skull sticking out of the mud. The gruesome discovery was made nearly four months after she was reported missing from an area motel. The Orlando Sentinel reported that the 49-year-old was kicked out from the Red Carpet Inn because she was no longer able to pay for her room. Tragic: Chasity Starr (pictured), 27, was strangled to death . Pamela Will's badly decomposed body was discovered in a ditch in Ormond beach where Maxwell once worked . A short time later, another woman working in the sex industry came forward telling police that Maxwell almost killed her in his garage in 2007, according to the search warrants. The unnamed woman, who is now 33 years old, told detectives how the 44-year-old carried her to his bedroom where a camera had been set up to capture her rape. The alleged victim said she never reported the incident for fear that no one would believe a prostitute’s tale of sexual assault. In 2010, a dancer from a Daytona Beach club also told the authorities that Maxwell took her home and began to get rough with her, but she managed to get away unharmed, the warrants state. Unearthed: Chasity Starr's remains were found wrapped in a red, white and blue bed spread . Starr's body was found in James Lee Maxwell's Port Orange property back in June . In June, police arrived at Maxwell's Brandy Hills Drive home after two people reported his concerns over a proposed construction in the backyard of his property that would have involved digging. Using cadaver dogs and a ground radar, officials unearthed Starr’s severely decomposed remains. At the time, Maxwell was in jail awaiting trial in the rape of a nine-year-old neighbor whom police said he kidnapped from her home after a Christmas party and sexually battered in a wooded area in December 2011. According to court records, Maxwell served time nine years in prison for the attempted murder of a prostitute whom he stabbed in the chest multiple times in 1998.","James Lee Maxwell was charged with the prostitutes' murders .

A Greek journalist put on trial for publishing the names of more than 2,000 tax cheats was sensationally acquitted last night. Costas Vaxevanis was told he was a free man by an Athens court in a case which has created international  concern over press freedom. The 46-year-old had been accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. He faced up to two years in jail if convicted.

Mr Vaxevanis (left) had been accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. Above, he was led away by police following his arrest last week . Commenting on the trial before his acquittal yesterday, Vaxevanis, editor of Hot Doc magazine, told reporters: 'Obviously there are political motives'. Pictured outside the prosecutor's office in Athens . Commenting on the trial before his acquittal yesterday, Mr  Vaxevanis told reporters: ‘There are political motives. You see most of the names on the list are friends of the political system.’ He also claimed his prosecution was ‘targeted and vengeful’, adding: ‘There isn’t the slightest evidence to support the charges.’ But after just one day, he was sensationally acquitted – although no reason was given. ‘The court has ruled that you are innocent,’ Judge Malia Volika said. The  journalist told supporters afterwards: ‘This decision allows journalists to do their job.’ The list has been dubbed the 'Lagarde List' after Christine Lagarde (above), head of the IMF, who was the French finance minister when it was passed to Greek authorities . At a time of unprecedented  austerity in Greece, his exposure of allegations involving £1.6billion took on huge significance. Many Greeks believe tax evasion is undermining a struggle to cut public costs and raise revenue under an EU/International Monetary Fund bailout deal. Mr Vaxevanis, who edits the  magazine Hot Doc, was arrested on  Sunday after he published the list. He has always insisted that he acted in the public interest. Before yesterday’s acquittal, his supporters had packed the courtroom as Mr Vaxevanis’s lawyers began their defence. They questioned why the prosecution had charged him, despite no one on the list filing a complaint about privacy violation, a rare occurrence in a freedom of speech or defamation case in Greece. Marek Marczynski, of Amnesty International, said: ‘It is deeply troubling that Vaxevanis was facing criminal charges, and possibly jail time, for disclosing information in the public interest. ‘This step increases the risk that other journalists will censor themselves and refrain from legitimate criticism of the government to avoid prosecution. ‘This chilling effect would seriously undermine freedom of expression – a central purpose of which is to foster informed public debate about the functioning of government. ‘The authorities must clearly demonstrate why this severe sanction was necessary and proportionate. The right to privacy should not be used to silence criticism of the government.’ The 2,059 Greeks named on the list, who have a combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent business figures and two former ministers. Above, Vaxevanis talks to the press . The document at the centre of the case has been nicknamed the ‘Lagarde list’ after Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF. She was the French finance minister when it was handed to the Greek government by France over two years ago. Mr Vaxevanis has said an anonymous source gave him a copy because ministers had done nothing with it. The 2,059 Greeks named on the list, who have a combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent business figures and two former ministers. Mr Vaxevanis’s supporters included the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which also published the list over 11 news pages. It made clear there was no evidence any of those named had broken tax evasion laws. Riot police are engulfed in flame by a petrol bomb thrown by protesters earlier this month. Greek trade unions called a 24-hour general strike to oppose new austerity measures just last week . Greece has so far failed to convict any big names of tax evasion, further alienating voters. Prime minister Antonis Samaras’s government has not commented on the accuracy of the list, although two former finance ministers have acknowledged they had copies of the document. A former Greek minister whose name appeared on a list of tax  evaders has committed suicide. Friends of Leonidas Tzanis, who  hanged himself at his home, claimed the 57-year-old had said he could no longer bear the humiliation of being publicly accused. His brother Mihalis, 67, a retired taxi driver, said: ‘He was a self-made man. He was very sensitive and the list really affected him.’ VIDEO: Journalist Costas Vaxevanis is acquitted .","Costas Vaxevanis, editor of Hot Doc magazine, had been accused of violating privacy laws .

Those in the UK also took the most time off as a result of the illness, recording 41 days on average compared with the European mean of 36. Stigma? One in four of depressed workers surveyed said they didn't tell their employers about their condition for fear of losing their jobs . The study from the European Depression Association, also revealed than one in 10 working people in Europe have taken time off because of the debilitating psychological condition, which is equivalent to 21,000 lost working days. In 2010, depression was estimated to cost the EU £73billion. Despite the size of the problem, . nearly one in three managers reported they had no formal support or . resources to deal with employees who have depression, and 43 per cent called for . better policies and legislation to protect employees. Below are the more common symptoms associated with depression: . Persistent sadness or low mood. This may be with or without weepiness. Marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities you normally enjoy. Disturbed sleep compared with your usual pattern. Change in appetite. Fatigue (tiredness) or loss of energy. Agitation or slowing of movements. Poor concentration or indecisiveness. Even simple tasks can seem difficult. Feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt.

The IDEA survey (Impact of Depression in the Workplace in Europe Audit) polled more than 7,000 people in Europe. MEP Stephen Hughes said: 'Depression in the workplace is an employment and societal challenge that is causing serious damage and which requires attention and action from the European Union.' Depression is the biggest mental health challenge among working-age people, affecting one in five people at some point in their lives. However, the poll revealed there is still poor awareness of common symptoms. While 88 per cent identified low mood or sadness as a sign, just a third knew that forgetfulness could point to depression and around half knew it could affect concentration. When asked what is needed to support employees with depression in the workplace, managers most often cited more counselling services and better government legislation and policies. Dr Vincenzo Costigliola, President of the European Depression Association said 'The results of the IDEA survey show that much needs to be done in raising awareness and supporting employees and employers in recognising and managing depression in the workplace. 'We ask policymakers to consider the impact of depression on the workforce and charge them with addressing depression and workers and workplace safety.'

France threatened on Wednesday to reject a European Union budget proposal for the 2014-2020 period if it implies cuts in the bloc's agriculture spending. A compromise proposal on the EU long-term budget by the EU's Cypriot presidency, cutting more than 50 billion euros ($64.5 billion) from the original blueprint, ran into a crossfire of criticism on Tuesday from governments on both sides of the spending debate. 'We oppose the proposed reduction to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has already been the subject of significant (reduction) efforts in the original proposal of the European Commission,' French EU Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement. French Junior Minister for European Affairs Bernard Cazeneuve says his country will oppose the budget if it cuts the CAP . 'France would not support a multi-annual budget that does not maintain the funds of the Common Agricultural Policy,' he added. France is by far the largest beneficiary of the CAP. It has been actively trying over the past months to find allies in its fight to keep the CAP stable after 2013, with its farm minister sealing deals to this effect with Germany, Spain and Italy earlier this month. Prime Minister Cameron is under pressure on the home front to support EU budget cuts . Britain on Wednesday weighed in with a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron saying the country would prefer to see a real terms decrease in the EU budget. Cameron, who is currently demanding a real terms freeze in the 2014-2020 EU budget which would see it rise in line with inflation, has come under pressure at home to accept nothing less than a real terms cut in the budget. The EU's proposal, which should be the basis of negotiations to seek a deal on the budget at a summit of EU leaders on Nov. 22-23, recommended the deepest cuts to infrastructure spending in the poorest member states. Spending on farm subsidies, which account for about 40 percent of the current EU budget, would only fall by about 5 billion euros under the compromise. Direct payments to farmers would total more than 277 billion euros over seven years. Cazeneuve said he was convinced other cuts in spending could be found to make the budget more compatible with the member states' efforts to reduce national debt. He also indirectly repeated France's opposition to Britain's multi-billion annual budget rebate, won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, to which France is one of the biggest contributors.","A cut of 50 billion euros is proposed in the EU's long term budget .

Plunging house prices have triggered a new negative equity crisis, with the North bearing a far greater burden than the South, a report revealed yesterday. Hundreds of thousands more families have become trapped in the nightmare of having a mortgage bigger than the value of their home over the last 18 months. The report, from the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s, said 3.6 per cent of mortgage-holders were in ‘negative equity’ during the spring of 2010. By the end of last year, the number had risen to 5.6 per cent. But those in the North are hurting more than those in the South. The report’s author, Mark Boyce, . estimates that about 8.5 per cent of homeowners in the North are in . negative equity, compared with only 3.3 per cent in the South. This is because house prices have . fallen dramatically in many parts of the North since the credit crunch . struck in 2007, but have reached record levels in parts of the South. Official figures from the Land . Registry show that the price of the average home in the North East . peaked at £129,402 in October 2007. Today it is worth £99,385, a drop of . about £30,000, equal to a 23 per cent fall. This makes  the North East . Britain’s negative equity hotspot with nearly 12 per cent of homebuyers . affected. By contrast, homeowners in London have seen their property’s . value reach an all-time high, with an average price of £354,300. Homes such as those pictured in Kensington are amongst the most expensive in the capital . To make . matters worse, the number of homeowners who are on the brink of falling . into negative equity has also grown rapidly. Over the same period, the  percentage . whose mortgage equals 90 per cent or more of the value of their property . has jumped from 13.5 per cent to 16.6 per cent. In Standard and Poor’s research, ‘the . North’ is classified as the East Midlands, West Midlands, North East, . North West, Yorkshire & Humber, Wales and Scotland. ‘The South’ is East Anglia, London, the South East and the South West. Mr Boyce said one of the  big worries . facing homeowners is the struggle to find a  new mortgage after the . equity  in their home has dropped sharply. Banks and building societies will give their cheapest deals only to homeowners who have a deposit of at least 20 per cent. Standard and Poor’s does  not . calculate how many are in negative equity, but the  Council of Mortgage . Lenders’ latest estimate put the total  at around 830,000, lower  than . the 1.6million peak in the early 1990s. Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said negative equity does not necessarily trigger a problem with mortgage repayments.","Rise of 2% between 2010 and end of 2011 in number of homeowners with negative equity mortgages .

Tragedy: An elderly married British couple were killed when a heavy rainstorm caused flooding in a popular weekly market in Cala Finestrat near Benidorm in Spain . The flooding followed two hours of heavy rain this morning and swept away cars and market stalls. Huge amounts of water ran down a ravine and into the market at around 11.30am. The area saw 7.2 litres of rain fall per square metre in just 25 minutes. Government spokesman Jose Perez Grau confirmed the dead couple were a British man aged 72 and his wife aged 70. He said the intensity of the rainfall had 'come from nowhere' and had made it very difficult to predict. Spanish . newspapers reported that emergency alerts were usually set off when 40 . litres of water fell per square metre - and as it was just 7.2 litres . this did not happen. Flooded: Five other people were injured in the incident at Cala Finestrat, two miles from Benidorm, on the south east coast . Clear up: Market traders have spent the day clearing up after their businesses were devastated by the floods . Recurrence: It is not the first time the area has been hit by flash floods, with videos online suggesting it suffered similarly in 2007 and 2009 . Footage on the internet has revealed that the town has suffered with flash floods before, most notably in 2007 and 2009. An 88-year-old man was taken to hospital with a broken arm and a 51-year-old was hospitalised with severe cramp. A 90-year-old Spanish woman feared missing in the flood was found safe. Market trader Blanca Maria said she and others had previously complained about the risk of flooding because of the position of the market near the ravine. She added: 'What happened was foreseeable but nobody cared.' Other traders complained that emergency services took too long to arrive at the scene. Luis Alberto Lamchimba, who sells textiles from his stall, said the flood had cost him 10,000 euros worth of stock. The mayor of Finestrat, Honorato Algado, said: 'Our condolences go out to the family of the two victims.' He said there would be two days of official mourning following the deaths and that flags around the town would be flown at half-mast from midnight tonight for 48 hours. News agency Europa Press has reported that the town's . council was fined 83,000 Euros in July 2010 for asphalting an area . around the market without permission. It had also been warned by the . Spanish government's Ministry of Environment not to hold public events . there until further works had been carried out - and was told it would have to pay damages for any incidents that occurred.","Finestrat Council fined 83,000 Euros in June 2010 for asphalting bed of the ravine without permission .

A sex monster who broke into an 89-year-old frail woman’s bungalow, threw her to the floor and raped her was yesterday jailed for 13-and-a-half years. Anthony Borrowdale smashed a bedroom window, climbed in and turned off the lights so the victim, who lives on her own, could not identify him. As he raped her, the victim was crying and shouting for help but nobody heard her, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Prison: Anthony Borrowdale (pictured) smashed a bedroom . window, climbed in and turned off the lights so the victim, who lives on . her own, could not identify him. He has been jailed for more than 13 years . The vulnerable pensioner, who suffers from Parkinson’s, kidney and heart disease also has hearing and speech impairments which makes it hard for her to communicate. Just two days after the incident she wrote a note for a carer which read: 'I can’t forget what that man has done to me.' Borrowdale, 56, who has a wife and daughter, is believed to have gone off the rails after his marriage broke down and had been acting bizarrely in his neighbourhood, knocking on the windows at passing schoolchildren, urinating out of his bedroom window, and burping out of his letter-box. He was arrested for flashing at schoolgirls at a bus-stop 18 months ago but the case was dropped due to lack of evidence. After Borrowdale was jailed, Det Con . Chris Horsley of Barnsley CID said: 'It was a horrific crime. We believe . the lady was specifically targeted and even his own defence barrister . acknowledged he is a dangerous man. 'It . is difficult to say what his motive was but there were male neighbours . living either side of the victim and he targeted her because of her . vulnerability and the fact she was female.' Court case: Borrowdale, of Wombwell, near Barnsley, admitted rape at Sheffield Crown Court. He was described as 'vulnerable' and was being investigated for possibly having learning difficulties . Rachael Harrison, prosecuting, said the woman, who never went out of her council bungalow but often sat at the window, used a walking frame to get around. She had to write things down for people to communicate or shake her head. Three care workers visited daily and she was left at 6.15pm on May 31 this year in an armchair in her sitting room, wearing her nightie and dressing gown and happily watching television. About 11.10pm a next-door neighbour heard a smashing sound outside and went to investigate but could find nothing amiss so went back to bed. At midnight the distressed victim knocked on her neighbour’s door at the other side but she could not make him understand what was wrong. Eventually she activated her personal alarm at 12.43am and call centre staff contacted the emergency services. When a paramedic arrived she took him to her bedroom and showed him the broken window and the police were called. Miss Harrison said: 'She wrote replies to questions and said 'he knocked her down' and 'he raped me'. She pointed at her groin and became quite upset.' Police recovered her nightdress and forensic tests and fingerprint evidence led them to arrest Borrowdale two days later. He made no comment during police interviews. His victim was taken to a care home and she has never returned to her old bungalow. She was not fit to give evidence in court. Borrowdale, of Wombwell, near Barnsley, admitted rape. He has numerous previous convictions dating back to 1973 for dishonesty and offences involving some degree of violence but no sexual matters. His barrister Ian Brook said it was a 'heinous' offence and Borrowdale understood the gravity of the crime and had expressed a degree of remorse. He denied he targeted her because of her age and vulnerability and he did not know who lived in the bungalow and might never have seen her before. No weapons were used or threats made and the woman had not suffered any physical injuries although there would be psychological scarring. Borrowdale was of 'rather dull intelligence' and MENCAP the mental health charity had been investigating whether he had learning difficulties before his arrest. 'Ironically he appears to be a very vulnerable person himself,' he said. Judge Jeremy Baker said the woman was susceptible to strokes and had suffered a heart attack just three months previously and the stress of the assault had put her at further risk. The judge told him: 'You knew at the least by the time you entered her property that she was a highly vulnerable individual because of her age and physical infirmities.' He went on: 'Those who are subject to such an ordeal are unlikely to forget it and the psychological damage will be profound and long-lasting.' It emerged after the hearing that Borrowdale had been in contact with the local mental health team but it was not deemed necessary to offer him treatment. Neighbours regarded him as a 'nuisance' with rubbish, unopened tins of beans and even a mattress dumped in their gardens. It all stopped when Borrowdale, who rarely opened his door to anyone, was arrested. One resident said: 'We reported him to the council and police within two months of him moving here. If they had listened to us and everyone else this probably wouldn’t have happened.'","Anthony Borrowdale smashed a bedroom .

Facing jail: Canoe coach Peter Lawler (pictured) sexually abused one of his pupils when she was as young as 13. He was paralysed in a horse-riding accident four years ago . A top canoe coach who represented Great Britain in three Olympics was found guilty today of sexually abusing one of his promising young pupils. Peter Lawler, 71, faces a jail sentence for indecently assaulting the girl over a two-year period when she was just 13. His conviction represents a shocking fall from grace for the one-time sporting star, who reached the semi-finals in 1,000-metre Kayak events at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, again in Mexico City in 1968 and just missed out in the same event at 1972 Munich Games. It comes four years after a horse-riding accident left Lawler, from Cockermouth, Cumbria, paralysed and contemplating suicide. The defendant was convicted of one charge of indecent assault following a four-day trial. Judge Neil Stewart said it was a sample count which reflected a number of incidents. Guildford Crown Court was told that Lawler abused the girl repeatedly while they were on training runs. Prosecutor Ruby Selva said: ‘He got her to masturbate him on several occasions.’ Jurors heard that the defendant furtively touched the victim’s groin with his foot under the dinner table when he was having a meal with her and her parents. Judge Stewart remanded the wheelchair-bound defendant on bail until July 6 for a medical report before sentencing him. He added: ‘I would also like a report from the Governor of HMP Highdown as to what the facilities are like in prison for people suffering from Mr Lawler’s condition.’ The ex-Olympic star was also made to sign the sex offenders’ register. A victim impact statement from the victim, now 37, will be handed to the judge in time for the sentencing hearing. The jury acquitted Lawler of two counts of rape, one of indecency with a child and two others of indecent assault. Lawler . had denied all the charges, saying that a bladder operation had left . him impotent and medically incapable of having sex two years before the . offences were said to have started. Sick: Guildford Crown Court (file picture) heard how Lawler made his victim perform sex acts on him during training runs . But Ms Selva said he had not mentioned this to the police when he was being questioned or raised the matter with his doctors. The court was told that Lawler began forcing his attentions on the victim when she was just 13 after gaining her trust and that of her parents. Eventually the girl, who had won medals in junior championships in the UK, gave up her interest in the sport she loved to escape the defendant’s clutches. She blamed the abuse for sending her into a downward spiral of drinks, drug and self-harming. ‘I was good. If I hadn’t quit canoeing, I could have gone to the Olympics,’ she said. The victim, who was friends with girls who went on to achieve Olympic status, said the defendant had ruined her life. ‘He abused my trust and my parents' trust. I hate him,’ she said. The victim said she had been too afraid to reject Lawler’s advances. ‘I thought he wouldn’t like me and would stop training me,’ she said. In 2008, while on holiday in Canada, Lawler came off a horse suffering spinal and rib fractures which left him paraplegic - reliant on the care of others for his day to day and most intimate needs. ‘To go from being extremely fit to this has been very hard,’ he said, . Lawler's victim . He added that he had thought of killing himself - and had to take what he described as ‘anti-nutty pills’ to control his mood swings. It was when he was in the depths of despair that he was confronted in 2010 by police investigating the girl’s complaints about his conduct when he was in his late 40s. Divorced father-of-two Lawler coached at the internationally renowned Elmbridge Canoe Club, in Weybridge, Surrey, that he helped set up with his brother and sister-in-law. It was then that he started making advances to the youngster. Ms Selva said the abuse began when Lawler was coaching, among others, canoeists for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. After the abuse had gone on for two years, the victim said that she left the canoe club. She said she had bottled up her experiences after receiving an unsympathetic response from a friend she had confided in. ‘I started smoking, drinking and taking drugs. I also began self-harming. I would cut myself and burn myself with cigarettes,’ she said. She added: ‘I’ve had nightmares and suffer depression.’ The girl insisted: ‘If I had continued canoeing, I could have achieved sporting success. I would say that I had had the potential to go to the Olympics.’ Ms Selva said the victim’s ordeal had taken a heavy toll leading to ‘significant physical and mental decline’. Previously, Lawler said that his former town home in Weybridge, had been ‘open house’ to young people, including the victim, who had frequently stayed there.","Peter Lawler, 71, faces jail for sex assaults 25 years ago .

A pensioner who was accused of letting his dog foul on a public beach has been cleared by a court of any wrongdoing in just 10 minutes. The £1,000 cost of the failed dog fouling prosecution - which included a trip to the seaside - has been branded 'ridiculous'. Shih Tzu owner and respectable pensioner Bob Hewling, 71, had been accused of allowing his dog to defecate on the beach in Redcar, Cleveland. So in a bizarre move, magistrates visited the soggy beach on a wet Friday nine months after the alleged dog fouling. The visit was requested by Redcar and Cleveland Council, who were attempting to prosecute Mr Hewling for the alleged mess. The three magistrates were joined by Mr Hewling, the prosecutor, defence lawyer, court clerk and community protection officer - and the dog in question, Monty. Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard how Monty was allegedly seen 'doing his business' on Redcar beach last September. Community protection officer James Sexton told the court he was '100 per cent sure' he had seen the dog fouling the beach. Giving evidence, he told the magistrates: . 'I witnessed the faeces leaving the dog.' Denial: The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag . But Mr Hewling was equally adamant that his beloved pet had not fouled. The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag. He told the court: 'I had my bag in my hand ready to pick it up. There was nothing there at all, I am sure.' In fact the former British Steel and ICI worker said he took a dim view of dog fouling, adding: 'I don’t like it at all.' He said he always cleaned up after his dog and even after other people’s dogs. The court heard that Mr Hewling was given the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty notice but declined. He told the magistrates it was 'a matter of principle'. He said: 'If I thought Monty had done it I would have paid the fine a long time ago.' Mr Hewling, of High Street, Eston, Cleveland, has no previous convictions. His solicitor Gary Wood said the pensioner had never been in a courtroom before - apart from jury service and receiving a bravery award for rescuing a man from a river. The only time Mr Hewling had been in a police station was to hand in some lost money and World Cup tickets, said Mr Wood. Taking just 10 minutes to find him not guilty, chair of the bench Pamela Ross said they believed the officer had 'made an honest mistake'. After the case Mr Hewling said: 'I feel relieved it is all over and done with. 'It was very tempting to pay the fine but it is the principle. I knew the dog hadn’t done anything.' Wife Ann, 68, said: 'It has been really stressful for both of us. 'I haven’t been sleeping properly for the last few months, neither has my husband. 'I think it is ridiculous, it is not right. It was a waste of public money. It shouldn’t have gone as far as it did.' Mr Wood said: 'I would expect it would cost in excess of £1,000. It has taken a full day’s worth of magistrates’ time. It has proved costly.' A Redcar and Cleveland Council spokesman declined to comment on the cost of the case. He said: 'We do take the issue of dog fouling extremely seriously as it has regularly been highlighted by residents as one of their main concerns. However, on this occasion, a mistake has clearly been made and we would like to apologise for any distress that was caused.'","The £1,000 cost of prosecution - which included a trip to the seaside - has been branded 'ridiculous'

Concerns that the Duke of Edinburgh might still be out of sorts after his bladder infection were quickly dispelled when he offered a characteristically dry retort to a reporter's question as he left hospital yesterday. When asked if he was feeling better as he left the Edward VII Hospital in London, the Duke – who is 91 today – replied with the hint of a smile: 'Well I wouldn't be coming out if I wasn't!' Prince Philip missed some of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee events because of his five-night hospital stay, and yesterday his granddaughter Princess Eugenie said his absence for the final two days of the Jubilee celebrations was keenly felt by the Queen. Good news: Prince Philip smiled and waved as he headed home to be with his family at Windsor for a private celebration tomorrow . Walking tall: The Duke of Edinburgh looked in good spirits as he left hospital this morning . 'Together, they are invincible. They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other,' the 22-year-old said. 'For Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock, really, and she is his.' Prince Philip is expected to attend a . Diamond Jubilee garden party at Sandringham on Tuesday and accompany the . Queen on a two-day trip to the East Midlands on Wednesday. The Prince's birthday will be . celebrated by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery when it fires a . 41-gun salute in his honour in Hyde Park, London, tomorrow but Philip is . not expected to attend. A Buckingham Palace spokesman . confirmed that Prince Philip was heading back to Windsor to spend his . birthday celebrating privately with his family. The spokesman said: 'He's out of hospital, his condition is improving and he will continue his convalescence at home.' Heading home: The Duke of Edinburgh had not thought he would not be back at Windsor in time for his birthday after spending five nights at the hospital with a bladder infection . Yesterday, he was visited by grandsons Princes Harry and William, who was on leave from his RAF Search and Rescue duties. Looking relaxed: Prince William and Harry leave the King Edward VII hospital in London after visiting their grandfather . Harry, meanwhile, has been spending the . week since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations on pre-deployment training . at Wattisham in Suffolk. The Princes, dressed in jeans and . V-neck jumpers, left the hospital after 20 minutes looking relaxed, and . were whisked away in a silver Range Rover after their visit. Philip had already been visited by . the Queen, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their . children, Louise and James. Prince Andrew had said on Wednesday . his father was 'mending very well', but the Palace had said he was not . expected to be back at home in time to celebrate his birthday with the . family. Prince Edward had added that the Duke had . watched the thanksgiving service at St Paul’s on television. ‘He’s feeling a lot better, he just needs some rest,’ he said. Philip is not due to attend his next . scheduled engagement until Tuesday, when the Queen hosts a garden party . at the Sandringham Estate to mark her Diamond Jubilee. It is hoped her husband will be by her side at her Norfolk retreat if he is feeling strong enough. It is also hoped he will be able to . accompany her to the East Midlands on Wednesday for a two-day visit as . part of the Queen's Jubilee tour of the UK. Princess Eugenie has told how her grandmother the Queen would have found the final two days of the Diamond Jubilee 'quite testing' without Prince Philip by her side. But the princess described her grandparents as a 'power couple who kind of astound people' as she gave the first interview by a royal following the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Eugenie, 22, told Sky News: 'To see Granny and Grandpa standing for four hours, I mean, together, they are invincible. Optimistic: The pictures of Princes William and Harry smiling will give confidence to the nation that the Duke of Edinburgh is well on the way to recovery . 'They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other. Grandpa was unfortunately taken ill and for Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock really and she is his.' Philip's admission to hospital meant he was forced to miss some of the Jubilee celebrations this week. He spent Sunday braving the elements . for the Thames River Pageant, which doctors suggested might have . exacerbated his condition if he did not make enough visits to the . toilet. The Palace said earlier this week that he was being treated with antibiotics and was in good spirits. The . King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery is expected to fire a salute in . London's Hyde Park to mark Philip's birthday, the Ministry of Defence . said. The . salute is fired every year to herald the occasion and the event is open . to the public but not customarily attended by members of the royal . family.

Together: The Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, are pictured onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thames in London . Emotional time: The Queen found Philip in good form on Wednesday, leaving her in better spirits than she had seemed to be in at St Paul's Cathedral on Tuesday . The . illness forced the Duke to miss several key events of the Queen's . Diamond Jubilee celebrations, including the service of thanksgiving at St . Paul's Cathedral and the concert outside Buckingham Palace. Edward said the Queen was ‘bearing up’ but added: ‘She’s missing him, obviously.’ Edward’s wife, Sophie, said . the Duke was ‘naturally upset’ to miss the celebrations but added: ‘He’s . on good form. He is in good spirits.’ As the . Queen left on Wednesday, she beamed with delight, seemingly hugely relieved at what she had seen. Speaking yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that everyone was concerned about the health of the Duke after he was . taken to hospital with the infection. Unwell: Prince Philip waves during Sunday's pageant on the River Thames. He was taken ill the following day . Time well spent: The Queen spent approximately 50 minutes with her husband . Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant . Mr . Cameron said he was sure the Queen and the Duke would have gone ahead . with Sunday’s river pageant in torrential rain regardless of the risks . to their health after the day’s exertions - spending four hours on the . water - were blamed for his turn of ill-health. Speaking . to Sky News, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a most extraordinary spectacle . and obviously everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know . that (the Duke) is going to be OK. 'The thing about our Royal Family is . that they are incredibly dedicated to what they do and they are . incredibly dedicated to doing it, no matter what the circumstances. 'I don’t know all the conversations . that took place but I would be pretty certain that Her Majesty and the . Duke of Edinburgh would have wanted to do what they did and would have . carried on doing it.' On Monday night the Queen was visibly . moved as Prince Charles joked that the Duke of Edinburgh might hear the . Jubilee concert from his bed if the crowd shouted loud enough. Happy: Prince Andrew (left) visited his . father on Wednesday . He said Prince Philip was 'mending well'. His . brother Prince Edward (right) also paid a visit to the King Edward VII . hospital in London . All smiles: Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, is pictured leaving the hospital with her son James . In a warm, emotional and often witty . speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert, . that appeared to make her lip quiver more than once, the . Prince of Wales said it was sad that the Duke of Edinburgh could not be . at the event after being taken unwell . While the Duke’s condition is not . believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given . his advancing years, because bladder infections in the elderly can get . worse very quickly if not treated promptly. Questions are likely to be asked . whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his . heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee . Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours. It is understood that staff at . ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle . shortly after 2pm on Monday reporting that Prince Philip was feeling unwell.","Duke of Edinburgh had thought he would miss celebrating with family .

Denise Rich, the wealthy socialite and former wife of pardoned billionaire trader Marc Rich, has given up her U.S. citizenship - and, with it, much of her U.S. tax bill. Rich, 68, a Grammy-nominated songwriter, top Democratic donor and glamorous figure in European royalty circles, renounced her American passport in November, according to her lawyer. Her maiden name, Denise Eisenberg, appeared in the Federal Register on April 30 in a quarterly list of Americans who renounced their U.S. citizenship and permanent residents who handed in their green cards. Wealthy: Denise Rich, a songwriter who was married to pardoned billionaire trader Marc Rich, has denounced her American citizenship and will save millions in U.S. tax bills . By dumping her U.S. passport, Rich, who was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, likely will save tens of millions of dollars or more in U.S. taxes over the long haul, tax lawyers say. She also has Austrian citizenship through her . deceased father, said Michael Heidt, a lawyer in Hollywood, Florida, . who represented her in a recent lawsuit. She plans to live in London. Rich, who wrote songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson, is the latest bold-faced name to join a wave of wealthy people renouncing their American citizenship. Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin gave up his U.S. passport to become a citizen of Singapore, an offshore tax haven, before the company's initial public offering in May. Moving on: Her lawyer said she gave up her U.S. passport to be closer to her family and partner, Peter Cervinka . Nearly 1,800 citizens and permanent . residents, a record since data was first compiled in 1998, expatriated . last year, according to government figures. Heidt said Rich had dumped her U.S. passport ""so that she can be closer to her family and to Peter Cervinka, . her long-time partner."" On leaving the U.S., Rich will have to pay 'exit tax' on property she owns across the world. But, as an Austrian citizen, she will get tax breaks. While Austria generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income, it has generous breaks for citizens who spend half the year abroad. Rich will fulfill this criterion as her main residence will be in London, her lawyer said. But while in the United Kingdom, she can claim 'non-domiciled' status, the coveted tax status of the international private jet set. Being a 'non-dom' means you do not have to pay income and capital gains tax on earnings made outside the United Kingdom. Those earnings will only be taxed if they are remitted to the U.K. This is at odds with the U.S. which generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income. Rich's two daughters live in London; Cervinka, a wealthy property developer, is an Austrian national. Rich plans to make London her main residence and does not intend to acquire other passports, Heidt said. Rich's ex-husband, commodities trader Marc Rich, fled the United States in 1983 when indicted on charges of tax evasion, fraud, racketeering and illegal trading of oil with Iran. They divorced in 1996. Marc Rich received a presidential pardon in 2001 on President Bill Clinton's last day in office. Federal . prosecutors and Congress investigated the pardon, and in 2002 a House . of Representatives committee concluded Denise Rich had swayed the action . through donations to the Clinton library and campaign. Dubbed ""Lady Gatsby"" by Yachting . magazine, Rich owns multiple properties, including a mansion in Aspen, . Colorado. She is a frequent habitue of Cannes, Monte Carlo and St. Tropez with celebrities and singers aboard her 157-foot yacht, Lady Joy. Rich will escape future U.S. taxes but possibly not all current ones. In 2008, Congress imposed an . expatriation tax on persons with a net worth of more than $2 million who . dump their U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. Famous friends: Rich, left, with Michael Jackson, Hillary Clinton and President Clinton pictured in 2000. Rich is also a citizen of Austria and will live full time in London . Pardon: Rich's ex husband received a pardon from Bill Clinton on his final day in office in 2001 after Marc Rich fled the country on accusations of tax evasion, fraud, racketeering and illegal trading of oil . Privilege: A committee found Denise Rich had swayed the pardon with donations to the Clinton campaign . Under the law, those people owe an ""exit tax"" on their worldwide property, computed at a fair market value the day before they leave. But tax lawyers say the tax can be reduced or avoided by structuring asset holdings through foreign annuities. While Austria, like the United States, generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income, it has generous tax breaks for citizens who spend half the year abroad. In January, Rich put her 5th Avenue . penthouse in New York on the market for $65 million, according to the . listing agent, The Corcoran Group. Career: Rich wrote songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson . Former flame: She was married to trader Marc Rich until 1996. He is worth around $1 billion . New York property records show Rich acquired a 100 percent stake in the apartment, described by Corcoran as ""the epitome of luxury and grandeur,"" for $200,000 in 2006. Bonnie Evans, the Corcoran broker for the property, declined to discuss details. The recent lawsuit against Rich was filed on behalf of Lee Goldberg, the former protector of a Cook Islands trust of which Rich is a beneficiary, in February. The case was dismissed in April, court records show. The Cook Islands, a South Pacific tax haven, offers Swiss-style secrecy for wealthy investors. Life of luxury: In January, she put her 5th Avenue penthouse in New York on the market for $65 million . Opulent: The 12,000 square feet property has seven bedrooms and eleven bathrooms . High life: The property, which also has a recording studio, has a stunning view over Central Park . The lawsuit accused Rich and Richard Kilstock, a British real estate entrepreneur who is married to Rich's daughter Daniella, of ""transferring, moving or secreting trust assets, in violation of the trust's guidelines and without the knowledge or permission of Goldberg."" Rich and Kilstock denied the charges and accused Goldberg of altering trust documents, court filings show. Both Goldberg and his attorney, Donald Thomas, declined to discuss the case. Rich recently dismissed Goldberg, one of her long-time lawyers, as protector of the trust. Heidt, who also represents Kilstock in the case, declined to discuss the lawsuit. Kilstock did not return calls requesting comment.","Songwriter also has Austrian citizenship through her late father .

"The alleged killer plunged the sharpened edge of the comb into the skull of Julie Sheriff . A young boy who witnessed the attack said it sounded 'like the noise it makes when we kill a goat back home' Police found a message on alleged attacker's phone admitting to a friend 'she kind of stabbed' the victim . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:20 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 16 July 2012 . A 15-year-old girl murdered a teenage rival with a steel afro comb because she spread gossip about her, the Old Bailey heard on Monday. The alleged killer is said to have plunged the sharpened end of the comb into the skull of policeman's daughter, Julie Sheriff, 16, after spotting her on her south London ‘territory’. Julie remained in a coma for 19 weeks following the attack but never regained consciousness and died in hospital on September 21 last year. Julie Sheriff was stabbed in the skull with an afro comb and was in a coma for 19 weeks following the attack and died in hospital on September 21 last year . Julie’s family moved to Britain in 2006 from Sierra Leone, West Africa, where Julie’s father, Raouf, was a police officer. Jonathan Turner, QC, prosecuting, said the two girls ‘actively disliked’ one another by the time of the attack on May 7. ‘What lay behind this antagonism, the crown cannot say with any certainty,’ he said. ‘But there seems to have been a row brewing between them over certain allegations that Julie had been making about the defendant, and some boyfriend or boyfriends of hers.’ He said the gossip had been spread via the mobile phone network using ‘telephonic sites’. The defendant, now 16, spotted Julie close to a William Hill betting shop in Falcon Road, Clapham, and angrily snapped: ‘What do you think you are doing in Clapham? Why are you here?’ Mr Turner said: ‘There seems to have been some territorial issue between them.’ Just moments after the chance meeting, the defendant was allegedly seen to thrust an overarm blow at Julie’s head. A boy who witnessed the attack described it sounding ‘like the noise it makes when we kill a goat back home’, the court heard. ‘He described [the 16 year-old] as . reaching into her bag and pulling out a pin-tail comb and stabbing Julie . with it not once but twice,’ Mr Turner said. ‘The first one was to Julie’s . collarbone, but it barely penetrated, and it was the second blow that . went into her making a noise, he said, like a noise it makes when we . kill a goat back home.’ Jurors heard a friend of the victim only saw one blow but did not notice a weapon. Scene: The attack is alleged to have taken place outside this south London bookmakers . Within seconds of the attack Julie was said to have complained of a sore head and collapsed against the side of the betting shop. At hospital a CT scan showed . ‘substantial swelling of the brain and internal hemorrhage deep with in . the brain,’ said Mr Turner. She underwent a series of operations without improvement before suffering a cardiac arrest 20 weeks later on September 21. Passing a comb of the same type said to have been used in the killing to members of the jury to inspect, the barrister added: ‘Who exactly brought it to the scene will be one of the issues for you to decide.’ Police arrested the alleged killer as she walked to her home in Pimlico in the early hours the next day. She is said to have initially given . officers a false name, before asking: ‘Is it about the fight yesterday? I . don’t think I did anything wrong.’ Upon searching her, police found a metal comb in her handbag which was later found to have only her own DNA on it. ‘This does not necessarily preclude it from being the murder weapon,’ said Mr Turner. ‘After all, she had a couple of days to wash it clean.’ In a taped interview with police the alleged attacker refused to answer police questions. The girl instead read a pre-prepared statement in which she described taking a bus to Clapham Junction station and then meeting a friend in the street. She said: ‘I noticed another girl, and I do not get on with the other girl.‘She has been abusive to me in the past, and she became very aggressive and was abusing me. ‘The second girl had a comb in her hand and she was waving and pointing it at me in an aggressive manner. ‘I feared for me safety - I was convinced she was going to stab me. ‘In self-defence, I took the comb from her and jabbed it at her. If I hadn’t taken it from her, I’m convinced she would have stabbed me with it.’ After analysing her Blackberry mobile phone, officers found a message sent shortly after the attack reading: ‘Basically I was in Junction, yeah, and I see some girl that I hate, like I actually hate her with a passion. ‘And I kind of stabbed her...’ Dressed in a khaki top, black cardigan, and black trousers, the defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked down and spoke softly to confirm her identity. She sat flanked by three security guards in the dock, while her parents watched on from the public gallery. A jury of six men and six women were earlier selected to try her case. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC, his clerk, and the barristers in the case have removed their wigs in an effort to make the courtroom appear less intimidating for her. The defendant, from south London, denies murder and the trial is expected to last two to three weeks. The trial continues.

Britain's soggy summer looks set to continue until at least the start of the Olympics with forecasters pointing the finger of blame at the jet stream for two months of torrential downpours. As the country endured another sodden week, following the wettest spring and early summer period since records began, it emerged that the wet weather will continue for another seven to 10 days. Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, . said the main culprit was the jet stream, a fast wind that blows round . the planet and moves our surface pressure systems. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Freezing fog: An ice cream van stands on a foggy beach in Whitby, North Yorkshire this weekend . ‘Our . weather is really stuck in a rut because the jet stream is further . south than it should be at this time of the year – over France and . northern Spain – and we are under a blanket of low pressure on the . northern side of it,’ he said. ‘Although there will be some sunny interludes – with Monday not looking too bad – the weather will remain unsettled. ‘Tuesday . and Thursday will see the worst of it, with thundery downpours on the . way for Tuesday and heavy rain set to sweep through the country from the . south-west on Thursday.’ Flash flooding on the M62 in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has made the drive home hazardous for motorists this afternoon . The continuous rain will affect thousands of drivers on their way home . The weather is already causing problems and tonight drivers trying to get home along the M62 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, were caught out by flash flooding. The heavy rain built up on the lanes and resulted in queues of slow-moving traffic, while other cars barely made it through the deep surface water. A driver is caught out by the rain as he attempts to move through the deep water . Drivers endure slow moving traffic as the rain continues to cause problems . This weekend, roads turned into rivers amid flooding in Devon, leaving many homes under water, racegoers at . Silverstone were towed out of the mud and the Wimbledon final was . interrupted by downpours. One driver died when his car left the road after a month’s . worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in many parts of the country. Mr Dobson said despite the unsettled weather prevailing, today and tomorrow will be brighter. He said: 'Today we are looking . at more scattered showers but it should be a little bit better than it . has been over the past few days. Looking ahead it is a very unsettled week with no respite from the wet weather. Rut: Our weather is stuck because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of year - over France and Spain, meaning Britain is under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it . Outlook: The nation can look forward to days of more cloud and rain this week. Wednesday looks especially bad in the south with heavy rain and thunder on the way although it is expected to clear up by Thursday . 'There will be heavy downpours . tomorrow and Thursday, particularly across England and Wales, and no . sign of any sunny weather for the next 10 days.' Mr Dobson said scattered heavy showers . were affecting east Wales and the West Midlands, with heavy . thunderstorms over Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Heavy showers will hit London and the . south coast today, and there will be a risk of thunderstorms over . central and eastern England, he said. The . Environment Agency still has 89 flood alerts and 14 flood warnings in . place, but the Met Office has no weather warnings currently issued for . the UK.

'However, . due to the unseasonably poor weather in May and June people who already . have a major problem with depression have been having relapses, and . patients at the other end of the spectrum have been attending GP . surgeries reporting that they are ‘tired all the time’.'

A joint statement from the four companies said they were heavily dependent on ground water supplies but these have now recovered sufficiently to enable them to lift the bans. It said: 'The companies would all like to thank their customers for complying with the restrictions and supporting their plea to use water wisely. This has kept demand for water well below levels normally experienced at this time of year. 'Significant - or indeed any - recharge of underground resources at this time of year is most unusual but it follows the abnormally heavy rainfall experienced since spring which has finally brought to an end the severe drought after two dry winters.' Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman . yesterday met flood victims in Devon, where a huge clean-up operation . was under way after the area saw the worst of the bad weather. Ms Spelman spoke of the importance of flood prevention schemes during a visit to Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, which had a number of defences put in place after previous flooding.

The . trade body, English Wine Producers, said some vineyards in Kent had . been sheltered from the wet weather and were in line for a 'fantastic' crop. 'So we were so much luckier on this side of the town, I mean the defence worked, and thank goodness for it, when you think it’s only been finished a few weeks it was exactly at the right time.' The Environment Secretary also spoke about how important social media had become as a way of warning residents as she thanked staff at the Met Office in Exeter for the work they have been doing to warn people about the bad weather. Philip and Nolwenn Luke told Ms Spelman that the Environment Agency’s early warning text message system had allowed them to move their car to safety before the floods hit. Ms Spelman said she had been given assurances that all Olympic sites would be resilient to floods after flooding at a park-and-ride car park in Weymouth, Dorset, which will be used to transport spectators to sailing events. Elsewhere, firefighters had to be airlifted to safety by a coastguard helicopter when they became trapped by flood water while rescuing a flock of drowning sheep in Somerset, an RSPCA spokeswoman said. The animals were stranded by rising water near a railway line at Batemans Farm in Chard, but were eventually rescued by RSPCA inspectors using a boat. So much for speed...

Brandishing two handguns in a California nightclub, this scantily-clad woman shows off her new acquisition - an official sheriff's badge proudly displayed on her cleavage. The image has caused uproar as the badge belongs to a Cudahy councilman at the centre of an FBI corruption probe who had been given the credentials by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Lee Baca has now decided to recall some 200 badges his department has handed out to local politicians just two weeks after the picture was released by the U.S. attorney's office in support of bribery charges against three city officials. 'Vulgar display': This picture of a woman brandishing two guns while wearing an official sheriff's badge has re-ignited the debate about the abuse of credentials handed out to civilians with no law-enforcement roles . Abused: The badge, which is similar to the official ones worn by LA County law enforcement officials (left), had been given to Cudahy councilman Osvaldo Conde (right), who has been accused by the FBI of taking bribes . The sheriff's department has long . faced criticism for dishing out badges to civilians with no . law-enforcement duties because of fears it could lead to abuse. With the same six-pointed star design, . they are very similar to the ones worn by deputies, although they read . 'City Official Los Angeles County' instead of 'deputy sheriff'. The department said the badges were handed out so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies, but some believe they are issued as rewards for political contributions. The gun-toting woman was pictured in . the El Potrero nightclub in Cudahy wearing the badge given to Councilman . Osvaldo Conde, one of three officials accused of taking a total of . $17,000 in bribes from the owner of a medical marijuana dispensary who . wanted to open a store in the city. Under pressure: LA County Sheriff Lee Baca (pictured) is now recalling some 200 badges given to politicians, but insists the timing of the move was not linked to the release of the picture of the gun-toting woman . The practice of giving out sheriff's badges to city officials has been around since 1986, according to an internal policy memo seen by the LA Times. Law enforcement officials say the credentials are issued so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies. But critics claims it is more to do with rewarding political contributions. The policy was reviewed in 2010, but continued despite the attorney general's concerns that it could lead to abuse three years earlier. Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore insisted the timing of the recall was coincidence and had actually been prompted by a warning by the state attorney general in 2007. The AG's opinion was that the badges had to potential for civilians to falsely pose as police officers. But when questioned by the Los Angeles Times about why it had taken more than four years to take action, he replied: 'That's a good question.' Whitmore admitted the picture was a 'vulgar display', but said he was not aware of any other incident when a badge had been misused. The LA Times reports, however, that it had been a problem in the past. One of the most notable was the case of the 'Hillside Strangler' Kenneth Bianchi who had used a county emblem to pose as a police officer when luring his victims in the 1980s. One political contributor revealed previously how they used their honorary badge to gain access to a secure area of Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.","Credentials belonged to Cudahy councilman accused of taking bribes .

But the Fender Stratocaster that Bob Dylan brought on stage on the night he 'went electric' has allegedly been found in a dusty attic bolthole after 47 years in hiding. And even after nearly five decades away from the public eye, it appears the instrument is still a slave to controversy after a row broke out between a TV show and Dylan himself over who actually possesses the original. Booed off: Dylan was met with cries of 'Judas' when he launched into Maggie's Farm at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25 1965, backed by a full rock band . If the authentic 'Dylan goes . electric' guitar ever went on the open marketplace, experts say it could . fetch as much as a half million dollars. Now American prime-time hit The History Detectives say the New Jersey daughter of a pilot who flew Dylan to appearances in the 1960s found the guitar in a family attic. They have billed the guitar as the centrepiece of next . Tuesday's season premiere of PBS' History Detectives, and the show said . it stood by its conclusion that Dawn Peterson, has the . right instrument. But a lawyer for Dylan claims the . singer still has the Fender with the sunburst design that . he used during one of the most memorable performances of his career. Claims: Dawn Peterson, left, said Dylan left the Fender behind on an airplane and her father took it home. Pictured with Elyse Luray and Wes Cowan from History Detectives with 'Bob Dylan's' guitar . 'This is not just kinda cool. This is . way cool,' said guitar expert Andy Babiuk. 'We all love Bob Dylan, but . this is really a pinnacle point not just in his career but for music in . general. 'I don't think music in the 1960s would have been the same if Dylan had not gone electric.' Victor . Quinto briefly flew music stars like Dylan, The Band and Peter, Paul . & Mary around during the 1960s. Dawn Peterson, his daughter, said Dylan . left the Fender behind on an airplane and Quinto took it home. With his acoustic songs of social protest, a young Bob Dylan was a hero to folk music fans in the early 1960s and the Newport festival was their Mecca. But he was met with cries of 'Judas' when he launched into Maggie's Farm on stage on July 25 1965, backed by a full rock 'n' roll band. Bringing an electric guitar and band with him on-stage was more than an artistic change, it was a provocative act. Most folk purists hated rock 'n' roll. What happened next is a little foggy. Did an enraged Pete Seeger really try to cut Dylan's electric power? Was the crowd upset about the noise, or by Dylan leaving the stage after only three songs to a chorus of boos? Was it even upset at all? He later returned for a couple of acoustic songs. Either way, Dylan never looked back. She was told that her father contacted Dylan's representatives to get them to pick it up, but no one ever did. Quinto died at age 41, when his daughter was 8, and she treasures any remaining connection to her dad. The guitar was in her parents' attic until about 10 years ago when she took it. Peterson had no idea about its history until a friend of her husband's saw it and mentioned the possible Newport connection. After unsuccessfully trying to verify it on her own, she turned to 'History Detectives' about a year ago for help. 'When I heard it, I was like, ""Yeah, right,""' said Elyse Luray, a former Christie's auction house appraiser and auctioneer who co-hosts the PBS show. But there were intriguing clues. Peterson's father left behind an address book that included a phone number for 'Bob Dylan, Woodstock.' Luray showed the guitar case to a former Dylan roadie who recognized the name of a little-known company that Dylan had formed at the time stenciled on its side. A sheaf of papers with handwritten song lyrics was in the guitar case and PBS took them to an expert, Jeff Gold, who said the handwriting matched Dylan's. The fragmentary lyrics later appeared, in part, on songs that Dylan recorded but rejected for his 1966 'Blonde on Blonde' album. Luray took the guitar to Babiuk, an appraiser of instruments who consults for the rock hall. He took the guitar apart to find a date written inside (1964) that made its use in Newport plausible. He drew upon blown-up color photos from Newport to compare the wood grain on the guitar Dylan played that day to the one in his hands. He's confident it's a match, likening the wood grain to a fingerprint. Dylan's lawyer, Orin Snyder, said late Wednesday that the singer had the guitar. 'He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics,' Snyder said. 'In addition, Bob recalls driving to the Newport Folk Festival, along with two of his friends, not flying.' In a response, 'History Detectives' spokesman Eddie Ward said the show continues to believe Peterson has the guitar in question and would 'welcome the opportunity' to examine the guitar that Dylan says is the one he played that day.","Experts say the Fender Stratocaster is worth over $500,000 .

But research out yesterday might make it a bit easier – by naming the destinations that make you put on the most weight. It found that the kebabs, tsatziki and chips of Cyprus prove too much for many Britons. Mediterranean beaches attract holidaymakers from all over the world. But there's a hidden catch to a sunkissed vacation in Greece, Cyprus or Turkey . On a typical ten-day break an adult would add 3.3lb to their waists, whether in the Greek or Turkish parts of the Mediterranean island. Turkey came a close second – with holidaymakers putting on 3lb during their stay there – while Portugal was third with 2.9lb. An unhealthy diet of kebabs and chips means tourists typically pile on the pounds . The survey placed much of the blame . on the all you can eat hotel buffet, which Britons cited as the chief . reason for filling out. The United States, which is  known for huge portions of fast food and a growing obesity crisis, was in fourth place. In the survey for Fly Thomas Cook, one in five people said putting on weight had spoilt their break. Large numbers said food abroad was cheaper and better than back at home, making them want to eat out too often. In France, which came seventh in the poll, ‘high quality food’ was said to be the main reason for coming home heavier. Half of the holidaymakers admitted drinking more alcohol than they would have at home. Women were much less affected by excess, gaining just 1.5lb on average compared with a hefty 5.5lb for men. Those who stayed at home to holiday in the UK did not escape without some ‘extra baggage’. They put on half a pound, according to the survey of 350 holidaymakers. A remarkable one in five claimed to have lost  weight while on holiday. Extra exercise was the explanation in 74 per cent of cases. Some 55 per cent cited hot weather for slimming down, while 38 per cent attributed their success to healthy local food and 16 per cent to the need to fit into beachwear. Others said that atrocious or over-priced meals had helped them reduce their intake. For the women who slimmed down the average weight loss was 2.2lb, while for men it was 7.2lb. The three countries where people reported losing weight were Ireland, Canada and Germany – none of which is known for sunshine or great food. Exercise – strolling the streets of Dublin or hiking in the Rockies or in the Black Forest – was cited by respondents as the reason for their weight loss. Belgium, the land of chocolate, waffles and chips, came in at a surprisingly low number ten on the list. Those who stayed there mainly blamed the country’s famous beers for the fact they had bulked up.","Visitors to Cyrpus gain 3.3lbs during a 10-day holiday, feasting on kebab, chips and tsatsiki .

As well as customer backlash, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has vowed to block Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant in the city. To appease disgruntled consumers . Chick-fil-A issued a statement via the company's Facebook page on . Thursday saying their restaurants ‘treat every person with honor, . dignity and respect – regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual . orientation or gender’. The statement continued: ‘Going forward, . our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the . government and political arena.’ More than 13,000 comments were posted on the company's Facebook page in response to the statement. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mr Cathy he previously said: ‘We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are . married to our first wives.’ Contradictory: Mr Cathy's backing of 'traditional' families as husband and wife is a far cry from the ensuing statement from Chick-fil-A . The Atlanta-based business currently has 1,608 locations and boasts sales of more than $4billion. According to the Los Angeles Times, Chick-fil-A workers are trained ‘to focus on values rooted in the Bible,’ and the eateries nationwide are closed on Sundays. Mr Cathy said: ‘We don’t claim to be a Christian business. ‘Companies are not lost or saved, but certainly individuals are but as an organisation we can operate on biblical principles.’ In response to Chick-fil-A's Facebook statement there was a range of criticism and support for the company's position. One user posted: 'I believe that anytime a person or a . business uses their time and money to ensure that someone does not have . an ability or a right they are not acting with grace, only with selfish intent and fear.' Another posted: 'You can stop eating there if you want but I don't think he should have to change his values and beliefs. 'You want you rights to be ""gay"" but you want to take our right to believe what we want from us?' On Twitter user posted: ‘I shall not ever eat at chick-a-fil-a again.’ The company, founded in 1946 by . Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, has also come under fire for donating more . than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organisations with a . well-known anti-gay agenda, among them the Marriage & Family . Foundation and the Family Research Council. According to a report from LGBT advocacy group Equality Matters, in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes.","The Jim Henson Company, which is behind the Muppets, have said they will never work with Chick-fil-A again .

A fraudster has posed as the brother of missing millionairess Carole Waugh and tried to sell her Marylebone home in London. Carole Waugh, 50, has not been seen by her family since mid-April and financial activity linked to her identity has become 'incrementally more suspicious' since then, Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said. Her brother Chris Waugh, 54, who lives . in Cumbria, said it was 'a very distressing moment' to discover the . conman had posed as him when he tried to sell the £650,000 property. Two women were arrested yesterday after police released CCTV images of two women they wanted to speak to in connection with the investigation. Carole Waugh was last seen shopping in Central London on May 4. She failed to turn up for family birthday celebrations or for the start of a new job in Malta . One man has been committed to trial charged with three counts of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation. 'Very substantial sums of money' have been stolen since the businesswoman vanished after she was last seen by relatives at a family party at Easter, police say. Detectives believe at least three . women have tried to impersonate the oil industry executive - one at the . Westfield shopping centre in west London on July 13. DCI McFarlane said: 'From the . inquiries since Carole has gone missing, we’ve established that there . have been at least three women impersonating her at various locations, . at various financial institutions and other premises. 'We know that there has been a man, . who we haven’t as yet identified, who has been impersonating Chris who . was endeavouring to raise finances and engage in the selling of her . flat.' The man was impersonating Chris, who has a wife and daughter, up until late June, he said. A 'significant amount' of the . businesswoman’s personal property has also gone missing, but DCI . McFarlane would not reveal what has disappeared. Her cash cards have been used in shopping . sprees at the Westfield centre in West London. Detectives believe a gang may have abducted Miss Waugh and made her divulge her PINs. Fraudster: Carole Waugh lived in an exclusive area of London and a fraudster is believed to have tried to sell her home . Officers from Scotland Yard last week . arrested four men and two women in connection with their inquiry and . yesterday charged unemployed Rakesh Bhayani with three counts of . conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The charges relate to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth in the region of £280,000, police said. Bhayani, 40, of Wembley, appeared via virtual court at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday and was committed for trail to Southwark Crown Court for September 25. He remains in custody. The five other suspects have been bailed pending further investigations, the Met added. Ms Waugh, whose disappearance is . being investigated by the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, lives in . the exclusive Marylebone area of the capital. The . detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being . examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take . several days. The former civil servant, who made a . fortune working in Libya as a finance manager for oil companies during . the reign of Colonel Gaddafi, returned to London in 2008, apparently . looking for love. She was single and police are trying to trace men she may have met through internet dating sites. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said there has been no . confirmed contact with her for three months. He said: 'There have been a number of . sightings of her but I have not been able to confirm them at this . stage. The last time she had any contact with her family was on April . 17. 'Since Carole was last seen at least . three women have been involved in impersonating her at a number of . different venues. I also believe there are a number of men involved in . the fraud.' Yesterday it emerged that power cables to a CCTV camera pointing at her flat were cut in the lead-up to her disappearance. Neighbours have reported large numbers of people coming and going from her home following her disappearance. Yesterday her brother said: ‘She is a very confident businesswoman . who has done very well for herself. Miss Waugh's family say her disappearance is 'totally out of character' ‘She is very wealthy and she doesn’t need to work. Despite her being a very focused businesswoman, she was looking for Mr Right. ‘I think someone has targeted her as a . single woman in London with a nice property and money and we don’t know . if they have befriended her or just taken her.’ Just before she went . missing, Miss Waugh turned down a job offer in Malta and was planning a . 50th birthday trip to Las Vegas with a group of friends. Her brother and 78-year-old mother . Margaret, who both live in Durham, last saw her at Easter when she told . them about the American trip scheduled for June. ‘She seemed fine. She . was really looking forward to it,’ added Mr Waugh. ‘She was not worried about turning 50. She was looking forward to all the fuss and attention. ‘She phoned her mother every other day and suddenly the calls just stopped. My mother is absolutely beside herself. ‘We are very concerned about her. My mother is rather ill and it has had a real impact on her health.’ Forensic experts are now examining . Miss Waugh’s two-bedroom flat near Marble Arch in central London for . signs of a break-in or struggle. Police say she was last seen shopping in the capital on May 4. Her hobbies included going to the . opera, ballet and jogging and she was often seen sporting a £4,000 . Cartier gold bracelet and a man’s Breitling watch worth a similar . amount. Detective Chief Inspector John . McFarlane, said: ‘Miss . Waugh is a successful businesswoman, originally from the Durham area. ‘She has worked in the Middle East and has maintained a home in central London for a number of years. ‘Her disappearance is very out of . character. Both her family and I are very concerned, and ask for the . help of the public in tracing her. The detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take several days.

After securing the gold medal in an Olympic race, many would avoid admitting that they cheated for fear of having their title taken away. That was not the case for South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh who did just that. The 24-year-old freely stated that he took an additional underwater kick at the start of his 100m breaststroke race last week but justified the move by saying that everyone does so. Questionable kicks: South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh won the 100m breaststroke last week . Both guilty: The footage shows that both van der Burgh (left) and Australian Brenton Rickard (right) took two vertical butterfly kicks immediately after diving in the water and before taking their sanctioned horizontal breaststroke kick . 'If you're not doing it, you're falling behind,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'It's not obviously- shall we say - the . moral thing to do, but I’m not willing to sacrifice my personal . performance and four years of hard work for someone that is willing to . do it and get away with it.' Victory: The 24-year-old said that while the extra kick may not necessarily be 'moral' it is what everyone does . The Australian newspaper asked the South African about the issue in depth because van der Burgh narrowly beat out their native son Christian Sprenger who came in second. Van der Burgh came in first in lane four, then Sprenger came in second in lane six and American Brendan Hansen was in lane eight. Because of the limited view of the underwater footage that was posted by NBC Sports, van der Burgh's kick- and that of his neighbor in lane five (who came in seventh place) are shown in detail. If his world-record time is taken away because of the extra kick, Sprnger could move up to first and Hansen could earn a silver medal. The victor defends his title, however, saying that underwater video shows that the other swimmers near van der Burgh did the same thing: they all took two quick vertical kicks immediately after diving in the water. Participants are only technically allowed to take one quick vertical kick before going on to take a breaststroke kick (which appears more horizontal) while they are still gliding underwater from their dive. 'I think it's pretty funny of the Australians to complain because in the underwater footage if you actually look at Brenton Rickard in the lane next to me, he’s doing the exact same thing as me yet they’re turning a blind eye,' van der Burgh told the paper. There is a complicated history over the use of the so-called dolphin kick, which is the kick officially used in butterfly, in breaststroke races and it was previously legal in the sport for an unspecified number of kicks. The competition: van der Burgh seems pleased with himself after the race (right) while Fabio Scozzioli of Italy congratulates him (left) Now, certain races incorporate underwater video technology in their efforts to curtail misuse, but since the Olympics is not one of those races, van der Burgh believes that there is little incentive to keep to the rules. 'I’m really for it. If they can bring it, it will better the sport. But I’m not willing to lose to someone that is doing it,’ he said. NBC Sports reports that while the swimming governing body- FINA- will presumably leave the results as they are, there is a chance that the Olympic committee could reverse the results after reviewing the tape and van der Burgh's revelations.","Cameron van der Burgh, 24, won the men's 100m breaststroke race .

It is Britain's first Olympic men's . football match since 1960, but it's 100 years since they last lifted . gold in this tournament. Both Captain Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy were criticised for failing to sing the National Anthem at the start of the match. GB captain Giggs and his fellow Welshmen  Bellamy, Joe Allen and Neil Taylor remained tight-lipped during the rendition of God Save The Queen at Old Trafford. Giggs, turning out for . his first major tournament at the ripe old age of 38, was clearly fired . up as he spoke to reporters before the match. He . said: 'My bread and butter is playing for United in front of United . fans at Old Trafford. This is going to be a bit different.' But it follows another embarrassing day for the Olympic organisers after . Welsh player Joe Allen was described as English in the official . programme. The midfielder, who speaks fluent Welsh and plays for Swansea City, is . set to start for Great Britain this evening in their opening match with . Senegal at Old Trafford. Allen, 22, is one of five Welshmen in the Team . GB squad but while the others - Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy, Neil Taylor . and Aarson Ramsey - were correctly identified, Allen's entry read: . 'Nationality: English.' A London 2012 spokeswoman said: 'There was an error in our programme and we inadvertently listed Joe Allen as English.

'The word region is a clumsy mistake even from the point of view of English grammar.'

But there were reports of long queues outside St James' Park in Newcastle as spectators for the Mexico vs South Korea match were left waiting for up to two hours to collect their tickets. Many who had bought tickets missed the kick-off as a box office staffed by just four or five officials was overwhelmed. It will be the first time a British team has competed in an Olympic finals since 1960 but the side will only contain players from the English and Welsh national teams. The Scottish and Irish national associations declined to make players available because they feared for their integrity as individual football nations. Coach Stuart Pearce expressed his enthusiasm for the competition yesterday. The former England international said: 'We've got a fantastic opportunity to sow a seed and say 'can this happen more often?' and say to the public this is a valid tournament. 'It always boils down to me as a coach that the players go back to their clubs having had a fantastic experience and [having] been very proud to represent Great Britain.'

His captain, the Manchester United stalwart Ryan Giggs, added: 'To be involved in a tournament at such a late stage of my career is one I'm looking forward to. 'All the lads have embraced it, we were fortunate to go to the village last week, you want to enjoy the Olympic experience but the bottom line is you want to win football matches.'

Team GB may be relieved to get on with . the action proper after a number of selection controversies in the . run-up to the Olympics. David Beckham, widely expected to be included in the 18-man squad as one of three permitted 'overage' players, was controversially omitted. But the former England international, who had an active role in securing the Olympics for London in 2005, is still keeping busy.

She was tormented by her peers, who taunted her incessantly for her ears, which protruded from her head further than normal. But thanks to a charity organisation, Nadia received a transformative surgery that she says has restored her confidence, and for the first time, made her feel beautiful. Confidence: Nadia Isle, who has been bullied all of her life for her protruding ears, said she felt beautiful after a surgery sponsored by a charity organisation . Point of operation: The Baby Face Foundation paid for Nadia's flight to New York, where surgeons worked to correct her ears, nose, and jawline . Transformation: Speaking to CNN after the procedures, Nadia looked radiant and confident . The charity organisation, Little Baby Face Foundation, was founded by Dr Thomas Romo III, a plastic surgeon with many high-profile clients. Board member Don Moriarty explained to MailOnline: ‘Dr Romo felt the need on a personal level to utilise his expertise to help transform the lives of children who were facially deformed.’ Nadia’s mother contacted the organisation, which flew her and her daughter to New York City from their home in Georgia, where Nadia was evaluated with a team of specialised surgeons. CNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta followed Nadia’s story from start to finish. Before the surgery, Nadia told Dr Gupta that the constant bullying ‘hurt so much.’ Because she was made fun of, Nadia stopped socialising and became incredibly withdrawn. She said she was the victim of bullying from first grade and onward. Her mother told CNN that she had often inquired about surgery, but the sky-high costs made it far beyond their reach. Tense: Nadia speaks with doctors in a Manhattan operating room before her surgery . First glance: Days after the surgery, she admires the doctors' handiwork; Dr Thomas Romo III, founder of Baby Face Foundation, in the background . The four-hour surgery, led by Dr Romo at the Manhattan Eye, Ear, & Throat Institute of the Lenox Hill Hospital system, included pinning Nadia’s ears back and doing corrective work on her jawline. A partial rhinoplasty was also performed to correct a deviated septum. The operation, which was seven years in the making, helped balance out Nadia’s facial features. The surgical procedures would have cost the Isles an estimated $40,000, but the foundation – which is fuelled solely by donations – picked up the check. Dr Gupta spoke with Nadia after her initial surgeries, showing a person transformed. Nadia’s deviated septum was corrected, her ears lay flat against her head, and her jawline was more pronounced. Trail of torment: Nadia said she was bullied starting in first grade, saying classmates would make fun of her looks and ears . ‘I look beautiful,’ she had said after the operation. While in New York, the Baby Face Foundation also paid for Nadia to go to counselling, to help her cope with the years of cruel words from her peers. According to Mr Moriaty, that is exactly the purpose of the foundation. ‘We like to say that Baby Face transforms the lives of these children and gives them new-found confidence,’ he said. ’They’re able to navigate socially, and not afraid to engage with people.’ To donate to the Little Baby Face Foundation, or to find out how to help, please click here.","Nadia Isle was bullied for her looks since first grade .

Months went by after the video was filmed - and Ms Sahoury heard nothing about when it would appear on the Parents.com site. But one day, during a Google search of her name, she was terrified to find that dozens of links to pornographic websites.

Twenty rebels were killed by the military in a helicopter gunship raid in Egypt's troubled Sinai region today. The operation happened days after 16 soldiers were killed in an attack attributed to Islamic extremists, a military official said. The attack in a village named Tumah, the first time the military has used air strikes in Sinai for decades, came as security forces massed near the Rafah border town for what they called a decisive confrontation with the militants. Scroll down for video . Egyptian security forces stand by their Armoured Personell Carriers ahead of a military operation in the northern Sinai peninsula . A senior military official in Sinai, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said '20 terrorists were killed' in Apache helicopter air strikes and when soldiers with the 2nd Infantry Division stormed Tumah. 'The operation is continuing,' he said. Other security officials in the north of Sinai reported air strikes near the town of Sheikh Zuwayid, close to the village. Overnight, unknown assailants attacked security checkpoints near the town of El-Arish, the officials said, adding that no one was killed in the confrontation. The air strikes came a day after the military held a funeral for the 16 soldiers killed on Sunday's attack by militants amid widespread calls for vengeance. The soldiers were killed when Islamist militants raided a border guard base under the cover of mortar fire, and comandeered a military vehicle into neighbouring Israel before they were stopped by an Israeli helicopter strike. Security forces had raided homes on Tuesday in search of suspects in the attack, as they prepared to close tunnels to the Palestinian Gaza Strip used to smuggle weapons and militants as well as food and other supplies. Members of the Egyptian security forces take position during the raid . Egypt, which launched air raids against Islamist militants in Sinai for the first time in decades, faces a tough enemy that has used the peninsula's rugged terrain to evade capture in the past . The military said it deployed Apache helicopter gunships in the strikes that killed 20 'terrorists' in the Sinai village of Tumah, in retaliation for a weekend ambush that cost the lives of 16 soldiers . Israel had handed over to Egypt six 'completely charred' bodies that were in the armoured personnel carrier that was driven into Israel before being destroyed, said a medical official in El-Arish. The bodies have not yet been identified. But security officials blame Bedouin militants and Palestinian Islamists from Gaza for the attack. Sunday's bloodshed highlighted the government's tenuous grip on the Sinai Peninsula, from where Islamist militants have launched several rocket attacks on Israel and a deadly cross border raid last year. Fear and uncertainty: Egyptians waited outside the El Arish Hospital after the jihadist attack, which killed 16 of the country's border guards . Volatile territory: This map shows the Rafah border crossing on the Egypt-Gaza Strip border, where 16 Egyptians were killed by gunmen . It also presents a challenge to Egypt's new Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood has good relations with the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip. Morsi did not attend the funeral, where some protesters chanted slogans against the Brotherhood, and according to witnesses, tried to assault the Islamist Prime Minister Hisham Qandil. His spokesman said in a statement that Morsi did not attend because the security measures needed to guard the president would have impinged on the 'popular character' of the ceremony. Morsi has received both Hamas's chief and its prime minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniya, in visits, along with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, and his government had eased border restrictions on Gaza. Following Sunday's attack, Egypt closed until further notice its Rafah crossing with Gaza, the Palestinian territory's only access to the outside world that is not controlled by Israel.

A double decker bus has had its roof torn off after hitting a notorious blackspot bridge where up to six serious crashes happen every year. The spectacular accident in Manningtree, Essex, has ignited calls for urgent action before someone is killed. Fortunately no passengers were on board the bus when the incident took place yesterday morning. Fortunately no passengers were on board the bus at the time of the accident yesterday morning . A local councillor has described the lack of casualties as a huge stroke of luck and called for a review to take place to put a stop to the crashes which have plagued the bridge for the last three decades. Councillor Carlo Guglielmi, said: 'Thank God we have not had a fatality there. The accident at the blackspot in Manningtree, Essex, has ignited calls for a safety review before someone is killed . 'But if we keep having accidents something sinister is likely to happen in the near future. 'A solution could not come soon enough. 'I call on the three agencies - Highways, Essex County Council and Network Rail - to discuss this problem once and for all.' The entire top half of the double decker bus was ripped off after smashing into the bridge in Essex . Mr Guglielmi said there had been about six serious accidents a year at the notorious bridge over the last three decades and that better signposting would make the area safer. As well as the road being closed for five hours whilst the crash scene was cleared, train services were also affected in the area as structural engineers assessed the damage to the railway bridge. The town's Mayor said she backed demands to improve safety at the bridge. Local councillor Carlo Guglielmi said it was a huge stroke of luck that no one has died at the accident blackspot . Mrs Lay-Flurrie said: 'We have known for years there's something wrong with the crossing. 'It's always been such a nightmare there. 'I find it amazing that a double-decker bus would even try to get under there.' 'I'm pleased no-one was hurt and I feel sorry for the driver - he must be feeling awful.'

Mayor Boris Johnson . seen at the London Studios this morning prior to his appearance on ITV's . morning programme Daybreak . Boris Johnson has dismissed talk of him becoming the next prime minister, joking: 'How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?' The London mayor was repeatedly asked in an interview if he would like to be the next prime minister but dismissed speculation as a 'silly season' story. He was shown footage of him stuck last week on a 150ft high, 1,000ft long zip wire at the London Live event in Victoria Park, east London, when he was left dangling over a crowd of people after losing momentum. 'There you have got it,' he said. 'How on earth could you elect that guy? How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?' 'I tell you what happened, I was trying to publicise our live site in Victoria Park, which is a wonderful place, by the way.' Speaking on ITV Daybreak, he added that the experience had been 'slightly scarier' than it appeared, joking that his actions had been 'heroic'. 'After I got stuck on that thing, we did have a big increase in the number of visitors, so it wasn’t totally fatuous, contrary to appearances,' he said. Asked by presenter Kate Garraway if he fancied being prime minister, he responded: 'No, of course not, because I have got four years of mayor of London ahead ... perhaps this is the moment to knock this once and for all on the head?' 'I am mayor of London and my cup runs over, and plus ... we have got the Paralympics and they are going to be fantastic too.' Speculation has been rife that Mr Johnson is positioning himself to replace David Cameron in the Tory top spot before the next General Election in 2015. Although he has publicly denied any ambition to lead the Conservatives, sources close to the London mayor say he is determined to succeed Mr Cameron. It emerged on Monday that Mr Johnson will embark on an ambitious 'world tour' to capitalise on his Olympic popularity, which has only increased speculation as to his ambitions. The London Mayor is hoping to capitalise on the so-called ‘Boris Bounce’ with a series of overseas trips to India, the Middle East, Brazil and China. The official purpose of the trip will be to drum up trade for the capital, but senior Tories believe he is aiming to boost his image as an international statesman. Scroll down for video . On your way to Number 10? Speculation has been . rife that Mr Johnson is positioning himself to replace David Cameron in . the Tory top spot before the next General Election in 2015 . A number of Tory MPs are understood to be happy to stand aside to give him a safe Westminster seat and influential backbenchers like Nadine Dorries have said he is the party's only hope of avoiding electoral oblivion. 'On our present trajectory, the Conservatives are facing electoral oblivion under Mr Cameron,' Ms Dorries said. 'We are going to have our backsides metaphorically kicked in next year’s county council elections, we will suffer big losses to UKIP in the 2014 Euro elections and the year after that we face the prospect of defeat  in the General Election.' She added: 'As last week’s events have shown, Boris has an appeal and charisma that David Cameron lacks. Which other political leader could get stuck dangling from a zip wire and come out of it smelling of roses?' 'There you have got it, how on earth could you . elect that guy?' Mr Johnson dangles from a zipwire in London's Victoria . Park after losing momentum during a stunt to publicise viewing areas in the capital for the Olympics . 'How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?' Speaking on ITV Daybreak, he added that . the experience had been 'slightly scarier' than it appeared, joking that . his actions had been 'heroic' Today Mr Cameron, in an interview with London talk radio station LBC, dodged the question of whether his rival might make a good job leading the country. ‘I think that London is lucky to have him as mayor. He’s done a great job,' Mr Cameron said. ‘He got a huge amount to offer the country, but he’s got a term to serve as Mayor of London. ‘I have seen him every day during the Olympics and we work together extremely well.’ Worried, David? Mr Cameron appeared to dodge the question of whether Mr Johnson would make a good PM in an interview with LBC this morning . When asked whether he would want to share a rowing boat with either Boris or Nick Clegg he said: ‘For weight and strength you would go for Boris. ‘We are in the building where the rumble in the lift took place so we know he has it when he needs it.’ The PM was referring to Mr Johnson's furious spat with London mayoral rival Ken Livingstone following a joint radio interview earlier this year. In an apparent attempt to head off a potential challenge by Mr Johnson, friends of Mr Cameron have insisted that the London mayor can never take the Tory top job because of his colourful private life and buffoonery. One source said: ‘It is one thing for Boris to be London Mayor, but quite another to be Prime Minister. 'All the stuff in his private life would be in the media and people would not like it. 'They just won’t put up with that kind of thing from a Prime Minister.’ According to Tory aides, No 10 was irritated by Mr Johnson’s refusal to tell them which Olympic events he was to attend, risking an unforeseen situation where he and the PM were at the same event. Friction between the two rivals was heightened by an opinion poll that suggested the Tories would have a better chance of winning the next General Election if Mr Cameron was replaced by Mr Johnson. Popular: Mr Johnson poses for pictures with fans . Team GB at an event in London. Opinion polls have shown that . the Tories would have a better chance of winning the next General . Election if he replaced Mr Cameron . There are signs that Mr Johnson's colourful private life - which have earned him the moniker 'Bonking Boris' - may not be the handicap that Mr Cameron's cronies suggest. Former Tory leader Michael Howard said over the weekend that he blundered when he fired  Mr Johnson as a frontbencher after his affair with writer Petronella Wyatt was revealed in 2004. ‘I think I was wrong to sack him, it is something I regret,’ Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4’s Profile in an episode on Mr Johnson. Asked if the scandal had damaged Mr Johnson, Lord Howard said: ‘I am not entirely sure that it had any lasting effect because Boris is his own man and does what he thinks appropriate at whatever time and whatever situation he is in.’ Charisma: Mr Johnson gestures towards the crowd as he stands on stage at the Olympic Torch relay finale concert in Hyde Park, where he gave a spirited rallying cry to Londoners on the eve of the Games . Leading Tory donors have also thrown their weight behind Mr Johnson. Financier Peter Hall, who has given . more than £450,000 to the Conservatives, told the Sunday Times that Mr . Johnson could be the right leader for Britain if the country sinks into a . very deep recession. 'Boris's . great strength is his confidence and his optimism and his ability to, . in an almost Churchillian way, inspire people to hope for a better . future,' said Mr Hall. However, Mr Johnson and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt have faced questions about their judgment after both were pictured with Rupert Murdoch at the Olympics. Error of judgement? Mr Johnson sits next to media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendy Deng to watch Rebecca Adlington swim in the 800m final at the Aquatics Centre last week . The mayor was criticised for inviting . the media mogul to watch the swimming with him last Friday. And Mr Hunt . was filmed smiling and shaking hands with Mr Murdoch at the Aquatics . Centre on the same night. Mr . Johnson has reportedly discussed with Mr Murdoch whether Mr Cameron . will lead the Tories into the next Election. Critics said both men . should have avoided contact with Mr Murdoch because of the investigation . into phone-hacking at the News of the World. On Daybreak this morning, Mr Johnson insisted that the long-term economic benefit of the Olympics to London was 'massive'. 'Around the world people are looking at pictures of London. They are seeing a happy city, a city of fantastic places to visit and they are going to want to invest in this city,' he said. 'The long-term economic benefit is massive.' He added that one of the most moving aspects of the Olympics had been the number of people who volunteered to help. He said: 'They are doing stuff in their own free time. Wouldn’t it be a wonderful thing if we could mobilise them, and people who want to join them, through Team London to help with sport in schools? 'It is often not the shortage of facilities, the problem is a shortage of people who have got the CRB checks and all that stuff who are willing to come and help out.'

The 911 call made by disgraced football star Chad Johnson's wife shortly after she ran to her next door neighbor's house after her husband allegedly head butted her during an argument on Sunday. The unidentified male neighbor is heard speaking in hushed tones as he explains the situation and urges emergency operators to send police to his home but to avoid alerting the press. 'I have somebody here at my house that was in a little domestic dispute with their husband and I think we need to have a police officer come over here and talk to her,' the neighbor says. He says that the woman, who is Johnson's 36-year-old wife Evelyn Lozada, had a 'nice cut on her forehead' that came from Johnson when he 'hit her with his head'. Scroll down for video of court appearance . Released: NFL star Chad Johnson bonded out of jail 16 hours after being arrested for allegedly headbutting his new wife Evelyn Lozada, right, outside their home in Davie, Florida on Saturday night . 'I think it was just a misunderstanding but we're worried that he's going to come and get upset,' the neighbor explains. 'I don't want the police to come with their lights on but I just want them to come until everybody calms down.' The neighbor is heard whispering to Lozada and reporting her answers back to the emergency operator, saying that she believed Johnson was either in their house or driving around the neighborhood looking for her in his black matte Smart car. The Miami Herald reports . that the police department released the tape Monday evening, a day . after he was released on a bond and promptly kicked off the Miami . Dolphins. Johnson signed a one-year deal with . the Miami Dolphins - worth just under $1million - in June to revive his . career after he was released by the New England Patriots.but the Dolphins have now cut ties with the wide receiver, after team officials met with him following his release from jail. The argument allegedly occurred outside the couple's Miami home after Lozada confronted him about a condom receipt she found in their car’s trunk. The team announced via the team's website and Twitter late Sunday that they terminated Johnson's contract. Charged: Johnson has been charged with battery and domestic violence. According to the police report, his wife fled to a neighbour's house fearing for her safety after Johnson attacked her . He was released from Broward County . jail at 1pm on $2,500 bond after appearing in court earlier Sunday . morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence. Johnson's defense attorney, Adam Swickle, said a no-contact order has been issued that prevents Johnson from contacting Lozada. Swickle . accompanied Johnson as he walked free from jail on Sunday at lunchtime . wearing casual gray tracksuit pants and Croc shoes. Allegations: Dolphins star Chad 'Ochocino Johnson' has been charged with headbutting his new wife in a car in Davie, Florida . Johnson . and his wife were at dinner when she confronted him about a receipt she . had found for a box of condoms, said Davie police Capt Dale Engle. The argument got heated and continued on the drive home, he said. When they arrived in their driveway in Davie, the 34-year-old Johnson head-butted Lozada, she told police. According . to the police report, Johnson started screaming at his wife, yelling, . ‘I don’t give a f***! I don’t give a f*** about my career!’ Fearing for her safety, Lozada fled to a neighbour’s house and called 911 from there, the report says. TMZ . posted the police report which says that Johnson then drove around the . neighbour searching for his wife. However, Johnson told the officer that . he went for a drive to give Lozada time to calm down, according to the . document. The responding officer who filed the . report said that Johnson admitted to having an argument but said that . Lozada had head-butted him. Lozada sustained a 3inch laceration on her head while Johnson suffered no injuries, the report states. Lozada, who is on the reality show, ‘Basketball Wives,’ was treated at a hospital for a 3-inch cut to her forehead, Engle said. Johnson, . who changed his last name back to Johnson from Ochocinco after his July . 4 wedding to Lozada, was held Saturday night in Broward County Jail. Happy couple: Johnson and Lozada tied the knot on July 4 at Le Chateau des Palmiers on the island of St. Maarten . Johnson's lawyer, Adam Swickle, said in court today, 'Mr. Johnson has been a resident of the state of Florida for pretty much his entire life. He has no prior offenses, and essentially, we're asking for the court to set a standard bond.' The state asked for a bond of $5,000 or more. Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene originally said the team was 'aware of the situation' and were in the process of gathering of relevant information.' Johnson's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, declined to comment. Johnson signed with the Dolphins in . June, four days after he was released by New England. A six-time Pro . Bowl receiver with Cincinnati, he caught only 15 passes in 15 games for . the Patriots last year after they acquired him in a trade for a pair of . draft picks.

Court appearance: Johnson appeared at Broward County court on Sunday morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence and had his bond set at $2,500 by Judge Mindy Solomon . Lovers' quarrel: The argument that ended in Johnson's arrest broke out when his wife, Evelyn Lozada, left, confronted him about finding a receipt for condoms . Johnson was known as Ochocinco for the past four seasons. He chose the name in honour of the No. 85 he wore on his jersey. Johnson and Lozada were prominent in the recent first episode of HBO's 'Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins.' As he walked out of the Dolphins' training facility on the first episode of the series documenting the . team's training camp, Johnson jokingly yet prophetically, told team . officials, ‘I'm going to get arrested this weekend.’ While still in college, Johnson was . arrested in connection to a domestic dispute incident, but has since . stayed out of trouble with the law – a fact he mentions in his 2007 . autobiography Ocho Cinco: What Football And Life Have Thrown My Way, . according to the site SB Nation. In a passage addressing an alleged . altercation with an NFL employee, Johnson writes in part: ‘You see, the . funniest part is that people think I’m so bad, but do you see one arrest . on me since I got to the NFL? Do you see me getting suspended for using . drugs or steroids? Do you see anything about me beating up my . girlfriend or some other guys? No, none of that.’ Switching teams: Johnson signed with the Dolphins in June, four days after he was released by the New England Patriots .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:32 EST, 13 August 2012 . Accused: Dr Michele Koo is at the centre of 10 lawsuits filed by fuming patients . Ten horrified plastic surgery patients are suing their doctor after finding pictures of their naked selves posted alongside their names on the internet. The St Louis area women, aged from 21 to 58 at the time of their surgeries, have filed lawsuits against their cosmetic surgeon after undergoing breast augmentation procedures. They said they were outraged when internet searches of their names pulled up before and after photographs of their breasts, which they say they had been led to believe would be used only anonymously. Some found the photos doing internet searches of their own names, others were informed by friends who came across the images. All 10 of the suits accuse Kirkwood plastic surgeon Dr Michele Koo of negligence and lawyers claim there are more than 30 other women who suffered the same mis-treatment. The photos are used as a marketing tool by Koo's clinic. They are not publicly labeled with names but if names aren't removed from the picture file on databases then they can crop up during internet searches. So it has now become a blame game between Koo and the company that ran her website, the St Louis Post Dispatch reported. Long Island, New York based MedNet Technologies Inc manages sites for more than 2,500 health care providers worldwide, opening up the alarming possibility that the problem is even more widesppread than realised. In court filings, Koo's lawyers blame MedNet, saying it failed to maintain Koo's site in a 'competent and professional manner.' One lawyer, Jonathan Ries, said: 'Whatever Dr. Koo did do or didn't do' she had 'no intention' of linking pictures and names. Predictably MedNet denies responsibility, claiming legal immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which protects websites from suits over postings by third parties, and insisting it was Koo's responsibility to prevent the leaking. As the issue deepens it seems that other website-running companies may be involved as well. Neil Bruntrager, a lawyer for eight of the patients, said he has been contacted by lawyers from four states, concerned about other companies. 'I think this is a much bigger issue,' he said. Einstein Medical is one of them, running a website for Dr Dennis Hurwitz in San Diago. The company is already involved in a lawsuit after pictures of a patient came up in a similar issue. Outraged: The women came across photographs of their breasts alongside their names . The women suing Koo believed the photos were taken for solely for medical purposes and say they were originally told their names would not be linked to any of the photos. In court filing's Koo's laywers say her patients signed waivers, allowing their photographs to be used.But while patients give permission for them to be used 'for the purpose of informing the medical profession or the general public' the next line asserts that 'neither I, nor any member of my family, will be identified by name in any publication.' The arrangement appears to comply with HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, but only if the photos do not reveal identities. The women involved in the lawsuits are suing anonymously and say they feel violated by what has happened. Court papers state the women suffered 'shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety, nervousness, [and] loss of sleep' as a result of the pictures. Denial: Dr Koo blames the company that runs her website . One of the lawsuits states: '[The] Plaintiff did not consent to the use of her photographs or the disclosure of her name on the internet. 'Plaintiff was not notified or advised that her photographs were on the internet either before or after the photographs and name were published by Dr. Koo. 'Defendant Dr. Koo knew or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care that plaintiff's photographs and name had been improperly disseminated and used and knew or should have known that they did not have authorisation to disseminate and use the plaintiff's photographs or personal information.' Upset: The women said they felt violated and humiliated on finding the photographs . The victims claim the pictures are an invasion of their privacy, an exploitation of the plaintiff's images and medical information, a use of unreasonable 'publicity', and a breach of fiduciary duty and wrongful commercial appropriation. Bruntrager said his clients are particularly eager to get every picture off the web, but there is no way to know how each may have been shared. 'There's always the possibility it will reappear,' he said. 'We will never have absolute certainty that we will have it all.'","Say they were left feeling violated and humiliated after seeing their photos on the internet .

When a Long Island, New York, hedge fund manager reached out to his Congressman for help obtaining permits so he could have a fireworks show at his son's bar mitzvah, he received a request for a $10,000 donation two days later -- before the paperwork was secured, according to e-mails. Now, Rep Tim Bishop is defending himself against allegations he violated house ethics rules, accused of soliciting money in exchange for greasing the wheels of federal bureaucracy. In e-mails obtained by Politico, Eric Semler called the request from Rep Bishop's surrogate 'really gross,' but said he planned to pay up so the fireworks could go ahead as scheduled. Quid-quo-pro? Rep Tim Bishop was asked to help a constituent secure an environmental permit and two days later his daughter sent a request for a $10,000 donation to the constituent . The political news site reports that Mr Semler asked Rep Bishop, a five-term Democrat, for help with the pyrotechnics on May 21 -- five days before his son's party -- because his attempts to work with federal environmental agencies had gone nowhere. His 3,400-square-foot home in the Hamptons sits near wetlands that are used as nesting grounds by protected species like the piping plover. Several, local, state and federal departments worried that a large fireworks display would harm the nearby wildlife. The fireworks firm, Fireworks by Grucci, is owned by former Congressman Felix Grucci, a Republican who Rep Bishop unseated in 2002. Two days after making the request, Mr Semler received an e-mail from Rep Bishop's daughter Molly, asking for a donation. Wealthy: Eric Semler wanted to launch fireworks from his house in the Hamptons (center) to celebrate his son's bar mitzvah . Rep Tim Bishop won his Congressional seat in 2010 by only 593 votes after spending nearly $3.1million. This year, he faces the same Republican opponent -- local businessman Randy Altschuler -- and clearly expects the race to be another dogfight. Rep Bishop has raised $1.9million so far this year, nearly half of it from large donations. Rep Bishop serves in New York's First Congressional District, which encompasses the exceedingly wealthy Hamptons. Some of the rich and famous who live there have taken Bishop's side in his five terms in Congress and given generously to his campaign. Donors include: . 'Our Finance Chair, Bob Sillerman . suggested to my dad that you were interested in contribution to his . campaign and that I should be in touch directly with you. We are going . to be in a tough, expensive campaign and so we are very grateful for . your willingness to be of help,' the e-mail says, according to Politico. 'If you make a contribution before June 26th you and your wife may each contribute up to $5,000; after June 26th the most you can each contribute is $2,500.' When the e-mail was sent, the question of the environmental permit was still up in the air and Mr Semler didn't know whether he would be allowed to have fireworks at his son's party in three days. The permits were eventually approved and the fireworks were shot off from the roof of Mr Semler's home. However, he says, debris from one of the rocket's landed on his neighbor's Bentley and caused $7,500 worth of damage he had to pay for out of pocket. Campaign records show Mr Semler and his wife donated $2,500 each to Rep Bishop's campaign on June 26. It was the first time either of them had given to the Congressman. Politco reports that the request seems to violate Congressional rules. The House Ethics Manual says, 'a solicitation for campaign or political contributions may not be linked with an official action taken or to be taken by a House Member or employee.' Rep Bishop denied that he made asked for a donation in exchange for helping Mr Semler. The hedge fund manager's gift was simple was simply a show of gratitude, the Congressman told Politico. Mr Semler also disagreed with Polico's take and said there was no quid-pro-quo with Rep Bishop. He willingly gave to his campaign and was glad to to so, he said. Mr Semler called the issue a 'non-story.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:11 EST, 20 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 20 August 2012 . A police officer has described the horrifying moment his colleague lost control of a patrol car and careered into a cyclist. Jurors were told that British Transport Police Pc David Lynch, 31, was driving ‘dangerously’ at more than twice the speed limit when his van hit talented musician Joseph Belmonte, leaving him seriously injured. The court heard he was driving the marked police vehicle at speeds of up to 68mph in a 30mph zone as it approached a hump-backed bridge in Hackney, east London. On trial: Pc David Lynch, 31, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court, has previously admitted careless driving but denies the more serious charge of dangerous driving . Eyewitnesses described seeing the vehicle ‘taking off’ and all four of its wheels leaving the ground as it sped over the bridge before slamming into Mr Belmonte on March 31 last year. Southwark Crown Court heard that Mr Belmonte, known as Pepe to his friends, was thrown on to the bonnet of the Mercedes Vito van before hitting a tree. A statement from Pc Gary Thomas was read out in which he described how the police vehicle had its lights and sirens on as it responded to the incident it was going to at around 3.40pm. As it approached the bridge which crosses Regent’s Canal he said it was not possible to see what was on the other side and whether there were any other road users or pedestrians beyond it. He said: ‘I believe we were approaching the bridge too quickly as I couldn’t see over the bridge and whether there were any hazards on the other side. ‘I was about to tell Pc Lynch we were going too fast and needed to slow down but we were already going over the bridge. ‘I believe all four wheels of the vehicle left the ground and we landed heavily in the middle of the road. ‘It caused me to panic as I thought something could be coming towards us.’ Pc Thomas said he then became aware of a cyclist who was travelling in the same direction as the police van, around one metre away from the kerb. His statement described a ‘loud bang’ as they hit him and he was thrown on to the bonnet and carried along until the van came to a halt and he was then propelled into a tree. Horror: Soutwark Crown Court, pictured, heard eyewitnesses describe seeing the vehicle 'taking off' and all four of its wheels leaving the ground as it sped over the bridge before slamming into Mr Belmonte . He went on: ‘The cyclist had no chance of avoiding impact with us as he was facing in a forward direction.’ Pc Thomas said he had gripped the handle of the door as it had sped along. After calling for an ambulance and further police assistance, he went to Mr Belmonte, who was lying on the ground groaning with visible facial injuries. Mr Belmonte remained in hospital for two weeks and has no recollection of the incident. Lynch, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has previously admitted careless driving but denies the more serious charge of dangerous driving. Mr Belmonte, 31, who was not wearing a helmet, was cycling to his girlfriend’s house in Newington Green and had travelled the route on many occasions before, the court heard. Lynch and his passenger PcThomas were on their way to an incident in the Old Street area when the collision occurred on Queensbridge Road on what was a dry and bright sunny day. Opening the case, prosecutor Sam Brown told jurors that Lynch had pleaded guilty to the careless driving charge. He added: ‘Through that admission he accepts that his driving on this day in March fell below that of a competent and careful driver. ‘The prosecution however allege that his conduct amounts to more than careless driving but that of dangerous driving. ‘And what is alleged in this case is that the defendant’s driving was to fall far below the standard expected of a competent and careful driver and that it would be obvious to a careful and competent driver that driving in that way would be dangerous. ‘These allegations represent serious, avoidable and ultimately criminal failures by a police officer.’ Witness Kathleen Coyle, who was standing on the pavement nearby, said she heard the police van as it approached with its sirens blaring. In a statement read out to the court, she described how the van lifted 18 inches above the ground as it went over the bridge, then landed heavily in the middle of the road and swerved left to avoid a traffic island in the middle. She said: ‘It looked as though the driver lost control. ‘It swerved first towards the middle of the road and then in the other direction.’ She said she saw the cyclist end up ‘wrapped around a tree’. She added: ‘He looked like a ragdoll. He looked like he was dead.’ A statement was also read out from Mr Belmonte. He said he had no recollection of the incident as he was heavily sedated. But he added that he was an experienced cyclist, was fully aware of the road at the time and did not have any headphones in. Sergeant Paul Tydeman, a senior collision investigator with the north-east London road collision unit, said he attended the scene of the accident at 4.20pm that day. He told jurors the police van had been travelling at 68mph as it approached the bridge but had then braked to 63mph as it went over it and reduced to 45mph as it hit Mr Belmonte. He also pointed to evidence that the vehicle’s wheels had left the ground as it went over the bridge and said that two gauge marks in the road indicated where it had then scraped the ground as it came back down. He said: ‘I’d say the driver was having to fight quite hard to control the vehicle at the point that contact was made with the cyclist. ‘Pc Lynch was responding to this call for assistance but in my opinion he misjudged the severity of the hazard that was presented by the bridge, approaching as he did at 68mph. ‘It was because of that speed he was unable to retain proper control of his vehicle as he approached the brow of the bridge. ‘It was while he was trying to keep or retain control of the vehicle that the collision occurred with Mr Belmonte.’ No details of singer-songwriter Mr Belmonte’s injuries were given in court. The trial continues.

Witty: Writer Christopher Hitchens wrote of his cancer using a hospital food tray for his desk . As he faced death from cancer, author and journalist Christopher Hitchens kept his wry sense of humour to the very end, it emerged today. He used a hospital food tray as a desk for his computer to record his last thoughts about the illness which claimed his life at 62. Hitchens,  a smoker, described the disease as a 'vulgar little tumour' and 'the alien' that was 'burrowing into me even as I wrote the jaunty words about my own prematurely announced death.' In his fragmentary jottings, published in the Daily Telegraph, he wrote: 'I am not fighting or battling cancer, it is fighting me. My two assets were my pen and my voice.' The British-born writer and essayist died from pneumonia, a complication of his oesophageal cancer, at a Texas hospital. But he lost none of his wit and trenchant views as he faced the end of his life. In his final book, Mortality, he wrote: 'Lost 14lbs without trying. Thin at last. But I don't feel lighter because walking to the fridge is like a forced march. 'All the sleep-aids and blissful dozes seem somehow a waste of life - plenty of future time in which to be unconscious.' Hitchens knew he was dying but saw the funny side of all the glowing praise for his literary work. 'Now so many tributes that it also seems that rumours of my LIFE have also been greatly exaggerated. 'Lived to see most of what's going to be written about me: this too is exhilarating, but hits diminishing returns when I realise how soon it, too will be ""background.""' Couple: Carol Blue and her 'dazzling' husband, the essayist and author Christopher Hitchens . The author of 17 books, including God . is Not Great, The Trial of Henry Kissinger, How Religion Poisons . Everything, and a memoir, Hitch-22, still wrestled with the questions of . faith and death. God Is . Not Great made him a major celebrity in his adopted homeland of the U.S. and he happily took on the role of the country's best-known atheist. He wrote: 'Those who say I am being punished are saying that god can't think of anything more vengeful than cancer for a heavy smoker.' His widow Carol Blue, writing in the Daily Telegraph, described her husband as 'dazzling' and how his charisma never left him 'in any realm.' Author: God Is Not Great made Hitchens a celebrity in America where he became the best-known atheist . She described running towards him down a . street in Manhattan, New York, during a book tour when she caught . sight of him in his white suit. They found out he had cancer on the first day of the tour and she tells how he coped with the illness for 19 months before his final trip to hospital which he though would be a brief stay. She said he was an 'impossible act to follow' and revealed that her husband 'insisted ferociously on living.' He maintained his devout atheism after . being diagnosed with cancer, telling one interviewer: 'No evidence or . argument has yet been presented which would change my mind. But I like . surprises.' Family: Christopher, left, and Peter Hitchens. Peter admired his brother's courage, a 'virtue he possessed to the very end' The author and prominent atheist Richard Dawkins described him as the 'finest orator of our time"" and a 'valiant fighter against all tyrants including God'. His brother Peter, the Mail On Sunday columnist and writer, paid a tribute shortly after his death last December. In this extract he wrote:  Here’s a thing I will say now without hesitation, unqualified and important. The one word that comes to mind when I think of my brother is ‘courage’. By this I don’t mean the lack of fear which some people have, which enables them to do very dangerous or frightening things because they have no idea what it is to be afraid. I mean a courage which overcomes real fear, while actually experiencing it. I don’t have much of this myself, so I recognise it (and envy it) in others. He would always rather fight than give way, not for its own sake but because it came naturally to him. Like me, he was small for his age during his entire childhood and I have another memory of him, white-faced, slight and thin as we all were in those more austere times, furious, standing up to some bully or other in the playground of a school we attended at the same time. This explains plenty. I offer it because the word ‘courage’ is often misused today. People sometimes tell me that I have been ‘courageous’ to say something moderately controversial in a public place. Not a bit of it. This is not courage. Courage is deliberately taking a known risk, sometimes physical, sometimes to your livelihood, because you think it is too important not to. My brother possessed this virtue to the very end, and if I often disagreed with the purposes for which he used it, I never doubted the quality or ceased to admire it. I’ve mentioned here before C.S.Lewis’s statement that courage is the supreme virtue, making all the others possible. It should be praised and celebrated, and is the thing I‘d most wish to remember.","He used hospital food tray as desk for computer to write witty thoughts .

A 16-year-old California girl has been killed in a horrific jet ski crash as her mother and step-father looked on. Kristen Fonseca, of Valcaville, was struck in the back of the head by Australian tourist Tyson Dagley who was driving recklessly and died in hospital the next day. Authorities said Dagley, 20, was standing up on his jet ski and posing for videos and photographs for his girlfriend before ramming the pretty teen on August 5. They also said he was going 40 miles per hour - four times the speed Kristen was traveling at. Dagley is being charged with third degree negligent homicide, a misdemeanor. If convicted he faces a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a $1,000 fine, but Kristen's parents believe the punishment should be tougher. 'As far as I'm concerned that is not . enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe . negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40. The family is now suing Dagley, claiming they 'have suffered horrible emotional pain, suffering and distress' after witnessing the horrific crash, which took place at Keehi Boat Harbour on the southern coast of Oahu, about five miles from Waikiki Beach. They are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, including medical and funeral expenses. According to investigators, Dagley was standing on his rented watercraft before it hit the teenager's jet ski from behind. He was allegedly looking at his girlfriend, who was taking photos and filming him, and not paying attention to where he was going. Scroll down for video . Loved Hawaii: Kristen, pictured left with a friend, loved holidaying in Hawaii . Dagley's girlfriend Natasha Ryan, 21, is . charged with hindering his prosecution after she told investigators he . was sitting down and looking straight ahead before the collision, and . that she didn't see the crash. However, a forensic computer examiner . recovered two deleted videos from the memory stick in Ryan's camera . which showed the crash. Court documents said that in the video, Dagley appears to be standing on the watercraft and that someone is heard yelling 'watch out.' Ryan was released on $500 bail and is shown in her mug shot to be extremely distressed. Dangerous: The teen's parents are now suing Australian tourist Tyson Dagley, pictured . False statement: Natasha Ryan, pictured, is charged with lying to investigators . Dream holiday: Australians Tyson Dagley, left, and Natasha Ryan, right, had saved up for their dream trip . The young man, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death. 'Ever . since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and . prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who . has now been in custody a week, said in court. Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.' The 20-year-old carpet cleaner's family have traveled from Crestmead, Queensland, to Hawaii to support him. Dagley's distraught father, Alan Dagley, told Australian newspaper The Courier-Mail from a Hawaiian hotel room that he feared his son would not return home with him. 'The maximum penalty is a year in jail, so we're trying to prepare ourselves for the worst and go from there,' he said. 'We know they (the victim's family) are hurting and we couldn't imagine being on their side. Tyson was saying to us that he wished it was him.' Mr Dagley said the young couple had been saving for nearly two years for the holiday. 'Tyson and Natasha had been saving very well to do this (the holiday) all by themselves,' he said. Rammed: Kristen, 16, pictured, was struck in the back of the head by the speeding tourist . Horror: Kristen's parents witnessed the fatal crash and are now suing . Aspiring nurse: Kristen, pictured, was about to start a work placement as a nurse . 'He's very scared, he's still not . that well with the injuries he got through his neck, head and shoulders. He's a good kid, he hasn't got a bad bone in his body, he wouldn't hurt . anyone and that's the honest truth, he's so kind-hearted and accidents . happen.' His lawyer, Walter Rodby, told KHON 2 Dagley was 'depressed' about what happened. 'I mean let's face it. He came here . for a vacation, now he's locked up, in can you imagine in OCCC with some . of Honolulu's finest,' he said. In . a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca . family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts . to the pair, as a defendant. The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly. An employee who rented the jet ski to . Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings . about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the . papers state. A Honolulu . judge denied Dagley's request to reduce his $100,000 bail at his . arraignment on Tuesday, considering him a flight risk. Crash scene: The accident took place at Keehi Boat Harbor, pictured, on the southern coast of Oahu about five miles from Waikiki Beach . The young man requested a jury trial on the misdemeanor charge. His next court date is August 23. At a vigil back in California on Sunday, friends and family of the aspiring nurse shared memories, lit candles and let balloons into the sky. Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home. 'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said. Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen. 'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox. Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'","Kristen Fonseca struck in the back of the head by another jet ski .

A sleeping six-year-old Wisconsin girl was repeatedly stabbed by her mother with a 7-inch steak knife, police say. ‘Mommy tried to kill me,’ the terrified young victim, Adrianna - who is recovering from life-threatening stab wounds, told an officer after the harrowing attack. Tasha D. Harmon (in a 2009 mugshot) allegedly stabbed her sleeping 6-year-old daughter several times . Police say the girl’s mother Tasha D. Harmon, 29, entered her daughter's bedroom while the girl slept, around 2:30am on Monday at Harmon’s apartment in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. The crazed mom allegedly stabbed the girl several times in the chest and back, inflicting critical injuries including a punctured lung. The mom then turned the knife on herself, stabbing herself on her chest and throat. Covered in blood after the attack, Harmon walked next door to the apartment of a neighbour and said, ‘I just stabbed my daughter and myself,’ according to the search warrant obtained by the Wisconsin State Journal. In a panic, the neighbour raced to Harmon’s home to find Adrianna covered in blood, laying on her bed with the steak knife at her feet. The girl was hospitalized and listed in critical condition. She is expected to recover. The mom was also hospitalized for her injuries. She was released on Thursday and moved to the Dane County Jail, where she is expected to be charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, according to Fitchburg police Lt. Todd Stetzer. The motive for the attack remains unclear. Court documents reveal Harmon told police, ‘I went crazy.’ Court records show that the 29-year-old has a rap sheet -- with a previous felony conviction for second-degree reckless . endangerment in 2007 and misdemeanor convictions for issuing bad checks, in addition to other charges.

BBC's Will Gompertz brands the board 'hysterical' The BBC's own arts editor has called the corporation's Arts Board 'hysterical' – as he confessed it was just like BBC sitcom Twenty Twelve. The Corporation employs a raft of executives to manage its arts coverage, including its highly paid creative director Alan Yentob. However, its arts editor Will Gompertz has labelled the board 'hysterical', admitting it has completely failed to produce an 'arts strategy'. Mr Gompertz, 46, was the media director at the Tate group of galleries before he was poached by the BBC in 2009. And in damning comments, he revealed that Arts Board members - paid a combined £1.7million - spend much of their time deciding which arts events to avoid. He also compared their fruitless conversations to BBC2 Olympics satire Twenty Twelve, in which Hugh Bonneville played the hapless leader of the Games' 'deliverance team'. Appearing on BBC Radio Five Live, Mr Gompertz said: 'I also get to sit on something called the BBC's Arts Board, which is hysterical. 'It's like being on an episode of Twenty Twelve, when people like Alan Yentob and all the rest of them come in. 'We talk about the BBC's arts strategy. And there isn't one, it transpires. It is great fun to talk about it. 'It really is like being in an episode of Twenty Twelve. There are quite a lot of conversations about what arts events people might be able to miss, not go to.' The Arts Editor likened the board to the satire Twenty Twelve, where bumbling staff are put in charge of the Olympics 'deliverance team' In his surprisingly frank admission, Mr Gompertz also mocked the Cultural Olympiad, originally designed as a four year programme of cultural activity in preparation for the Olympics. He said: 'There's been lots of conversations about the Cultural Olympiad. Are people aware of the Cultural Olympiad? No. Alan Yentob has built up a £6.3million pension pot on top of his total package of £183,300 for his role . 'The BBC have been very involved in the Cultural Olympiad. And then it got narrowed down to something called Festival 2012, which has been very good.' The BBC's Arts Board was created in 2009 to coordinate arts commissioning across its radio, TV and online channels. Overseen by 'arts co-ordinator' Mark Bell, its members include Mr Yentob, who has built up £6.3million pension pot on top of his total remuneration package of £183,300. Earlier this month, Mr Yentob claimed £1,216.05 for taxis for the period and a total of £722.81 for discussions about 'projects' and 'BBC films', although executive expenses were down four per cent. Other key figures on the board include BBC One controller Danny Cohen, who draws a £270,400 pay package, and his BBC2 counterpart Janice Hadlow, paid a total of £235,050. With the controllers of Radio 3 and Radio 4, director of audio Tim Davie, and Mr Gompertz himself - paid £150,000 a year - the total pay package of the board members exceeds £1.7million. Describing his own role in the BBC, Mr Gompertz appeared to have an attack of modesty. He said: 'It really is a fancy title for quite a straightforward job, which is to be the correspondent for the arts in the news. That's really what the job is.' Described by one BBC source at the time as a 'complete maverick and an eccentric', he had almost no journalistic experience before taking over the role. In the past, he has performed a one-man show at the Edinburgh Fringe, during which he asked the audience to draw pictures of penises. The BBC declined to comment.","Branded the board 'hysterical' and compared them to bumbling staff on satire Twenty Twelve .

Killer: John Balentine was convicted in 1998 of killing three teenagers as they slept in Amarillo, Texas . A mechanic who shot and killed three teenagers as they slept is to be executed - after avoiding the death chamber twice in the 14 years since his crime. John Balentine has previously been within hours of execution but was granted reprieves on two separate occasions. His lawyer is now fighting to block his execution a third time. The 43-year-old, who had an extensive criminal history in his native Arkansas, Texas, was granted a reprieve by a federal appeals court a day before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection in September 2009. In June 2011 he was within an hour of execution when it was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court. The killer is now due to be executed in Huntsville, Texas, on Wednesday. His lawyer has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to delay the process once again. The mechanic was convicted of shooting Mark Caylor Jr, 17, Kai Brooke Geyer, 15, and Steven Watson, also 15, in January 1998. Caylor was the brother of Balentine's former girlfriend, and prosecutors said a feud between Caylor and Balentine led to the shootings in a house in Amarillo, Texas, where the killer also once lived. Evidence indicated that all three teens were shot once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol as they slept. Balentine's lawyer Lydia Brandt has argued that he had deficient legal help at his trial in 1999, and that his legal assistance during early appeals was also faulty, according to a report in the Amarillo Globe News. She claims those deficiencies have resulted in issues that should be reviewed in court but cannot be addressed now because they weren't raised properly at an earlier time.

Secret mission: Gwilym Williams from Swansea was sent to Belgium in 1939, by the MI5 to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler's spy service . A former Welsh police inspector became a double agent pretending to work for Hitler while feeding vital information to MI5. Gwilym Williams from Swansea was sent to Belgium in 1939, to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler’s spy service. He constructed a fake persona as a  fanatical Welsh nationalist and was so convincing that he managed to uncover a series of secrets. He informed the M15 about a plot to land a German . U-boat on a South Wales beach, a scheme to steal a Spitfire. He even intercepted a plan . to pour poison into the Cray Reservoir near Brecon, which would have caused havoc if it had been successful. Mr Williams died aged 62 in 1949, but his story was only recently discovered after an author researching a book learned of his story in declassified security files at the National Archive. His escapades are detailed by John Humphries in his book called Spying For Hitler, reported the Mirror. The files revealed that he left the police force in his home city of Swansea with a record showing   he been reprimanded for being drunk on duty and assaulting residents. The only noteworthy fact on his record was that he had once stopped a run-away horse. But in September 1939, MI5 sent him to Belgium to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler’s spy service. The book tells how Mr Williams was recruited after intelligence led spy chiefs to realise that the Nazis were planning to forge links with Welsh nationalists. As a direct response MI5 invented an imaginary cell of Welsh saboteurs led by the retired police inspector, who had learned French and German during the First World War. Infiltrate: Adolf Hitler speaks to a crowd of German soldiers at a large rally in Hannover . Mr Williams' training was almost non-existent and the only demand was that he had to memorise the names of prominent members of the Welsh nationalist party. He was dispatched to Antwerp to meet his German handlers and carried out his spy duties with resounding success,  although he risked being tortured if caught. 'He had the Abwehr jumping through hoops and helped us win the intelligence war,' said Mr Humphries. Among his missions were plans to destalbilise the enemy bases such as aerodromes, power stations and munitions factories. He became so deeply entrenched with the Nazis that at one point he was offered  £50,000  to fly a British spitfire over to France so it could be examined by them. Mr Humphries said: 'John .

Carol O'Brien, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, is struggling to find new homes for the animals after they were abandoned or given away by their owners. They are among about 60 cats which the Sunderland charity Ms O'Brien works for, Animal Krackers, is trying to rehome - the largest number in the organisation's 10-year history. The charity has even warned it may have to start turning cats away unless new owners come forward. Needing a home: This kitten is one of 30 that have been taken in by Carol O'Brien in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear . Ms O'Brien is fostering 30 kittens at her home, while a further 30 mature cats are being cared by for by other charity workers. Ms O'Brien said: 'There are cats all over the place.

'I have had 17 pregnant cats since Christmas, then you will get four or five in a litter. The baby kittens used to be quite easy to re-home, but not now. 'I have been doing this for 11-years now, and my house has never been so crowded with them.' Some of the kittens are still with me after five months, which is very unusual.'

O'Brien said the number of cats in her care had risen so quickly that . her friends had offered to foster some until new homes can be found. The sharp increase in numbers is being blamed on the recession. Staff say people who see animal breeding as a quick way of making money can later find they are unable to look after them. Ms o'Brien said: 'I think part of the problem is that it is so easy now to advertise animals for sale on Facebook. 'You get people eager to make some quick money by breeding cats. 'They think they are being clever business people, making £40 or £50 a cat, but often they can’t sell them quickly enough as people want the kittens when they are very young, and then they find they can’t cope. 'They don’t have to pay to advertise in a newspaper. Facebook is really convenient for them. 'Then the cats are getting dumped, or brought here.'

Warning that pets 'always suffer' during a recession, Ms O'Brien called for more financial help to be made available to owners who need to have their cats neutered. She added: 'At the moment my house is completely crowded with cats, scratching my doors and making a mess. 'But I have some really lovely kittens and I just hope there are some people out there who are willing to give them a home.' Sue Hardy, co-founder of Animal Krackers, who has nine rescue cats at her home, said: 'We’ve just had our 10-year anniversary and this is the most amount of cats we’ve ever had to re-home. 'We get cats for a variety of reasons, sometimes people tell us they need to get rid of their cat because they’ve just had a baby or fallen pregnant, we’re getting an increasing number of people who say that the council will not let them have more than two pets. 'The council and housing associations seem to be cracking down on the amount of pets people can have in their properties in recent years. 'Sometimes people come to us with genuine reasons - for example. elderly people who are unable to care for their pet due to ill health. 'We get a lot of pedigree cats and people don’t seem to be getting them neutered.

A Royal Marine due to receive a bravery medal from the Queen has been . given a two-year conditional discharge for biting a man's arm during a brawl. Corporal Paul Vice, 29, became embroiled in a fight after a row in a city pub escalated. A court heard how Vice, who suffered horrendous injuries after being . blown up by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, is due to receive the . Military Cross later this year. Exeter magistrates said they were 'sad to see someone like him' before . them as they issued the conditional discharge, which allows him to still . receive the medal. A custodial term could have prompted a dishonourable discharge from military service. Father-of-four Vice, from Exeter, . Devon, was charged with using . threatening, abusive or insulting words and behaviour alongside Krystle . George, 28, who faced the same charge and two charges of assault . by beating. Chris Brittlestone, prosecuting, said the incident started in Walkabout . bar on February 4, where George encountered two former friends, Leah . Grant and Lizzie Westcott. George kicked one of the women and pulled their hair before pub staff separated them. The victims reported the matter to the police. George had been out with her husband Nicholas as well as Vice and his . wife Tessa, and they decided to drive to Grant’s home in Kennford, . Exeter, in the early hours of February 5. Mr Brittlestone said: 'They tried to get in and Mrs Grant, along with her husband, Chris, refused to allow them. 'Vice reached in and tried to pull Mr Grant out, biting him on the forearm. “It was a substantial contretemps.' The court was presented with a number of references praising Vice, who served in Afghanistan four times and twice in Iraq. Wounded: Vice's throat was torn open by razor-sharp flying shrapnel and his arms and legs were slashed . Vice was injured alongside five others last year during a tour with Plymouth-based 42 Commando. His throat was torn open by razor-sharp flying shrapnel and his arms and . legs were slashed. His injuries were so extensive that his heart . stopped. He was only saved when a quick-thinking comrade knelt on his throat to stop the bleeding and gave him emergency first aid. He underwent emergency surgery in Camp Bastion before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. A probation officer explained to the court that Vice could not do . community service due to the injuries he had suffered which left him . with paralysis, brain damage and deaf in one ear. He also said that he 'would not be allowed into Buckingham Palace to collect his medal' if he was to wear an electronic tag. The court heard Vice was undergoing regular physiotherapy and was expected to receive an honourable discharge next year. The probation service suggested that if Vice, received a custodial . sentence he would 'lose his military home, his position, and medal for . gallantry' which would be a 'disproportionate punishment'. As well as giving him a two-year conditional discharge, Vice was forced . to pay £150 in costs and £100 in compensation to Mr Grant. George was given a 24-week prison sentence suspended for two years. She . was ordered to pay costs of £150 and £100 in compensation to Mrs Grant.

Syrian military helicopters dropped thousands of leaflets over Damascus and its suburbs Tuesday, urging rebels to hand over their weapons or face 'inevitable death.' The leaflets appear to be part of the regime's psychological warfare against the rebels, but are highly unlikely to have any effect on fighters intent on toppling President Bashar Assad's regime. The leaflet drop came as 12 people were killed and dozens wounded when a car bomb exploded at a funeral in Damascus attended by supporters of President Assad.

For more than a month, the military has been fighting major battles against rebels in the outskirts of Damascus and its suburbs while engaged in what appears to be a stalemated fight in the north against rebels for control of Aleppo, the nation's largest city and commercial capital.

Google chief Larry Page and Apple CEO Tim Cook have been locked in behind-the-scenes talks following Apple's $1billion court victory proving Samsung did copy their smartphone technology. The two executives had a phone conversation last week, the sources said, amid speculation the search giant could be next in Apple's sights. Discussions involving lower-level officials of the two companies are also ongoing. Last Friday, a jury awarded Apple $1.05billion in damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some Samsung products, most of which use Google's Android software. Many have viewed the case as a 'proxy war' between Apple and Google. The Android software first came out on the market when Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt was serving on the Apple board. The Associated Press reported that after shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Steve Jobs vowed that Apple would resort to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies. He declared Android a 'stolen product'. While Jobs is no longer at the helm of Apple and their ensuing legal battles, his determination to kill the Android software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset. Secret talks: Google chief Larry Page, left, and Apple CEO Tim Cook are reportedly holding discussions about mobile patent disputes between the two technology giants . Page and Cook are expected to talk again in the coming weeks, though no firm date has been set, the sources said on Thursday. One of the sources told Reuters that a meeting had been scheduled for this Friday, but had been delayed for reasons that were unclear. Google was forced to issue a statement on Monday following the judge's ruling, to shareholders. It said the portions of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google. 'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office,' the statement said. Apple on Monday gave a federal judge a . list of eight Samsung Electronics Co. products it wants pulled from . shelves and banned from the U.S. market, including popular Galaxy model . smartphones. The products Apple wants out are all . smartphones: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 . T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy . Prevail. Last week a Californian court decided that Apple's . iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and . that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages . The judge has scheduled a September 20 hearing to discuss Apple's demands for the sales bans. One possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in the Android mobile software, one source said. The 'pinch-and-zoom' feature now used on most smartphones and tablets is particularly under threat following the patent infringement battle. Scorched earth: Steve Jobs was said to promise 'thermonuclear war' against Google after then-CEO Eric Schmidt (right) was on Apple's board when Google released their Android software . But it was unclear whether Page and Cook were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies, most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area, or are focused on a more limited set of issues. Competition between Google and Apple has heated up in recent years with the shift from PCs to mobile devices. The popularity of the software has . been in tandem with tit-for-tat patent infringement lawsuits slung by both sides. The . latest complaint was filed by Motorola Mobility, now a unit of Google, . against Apple at the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming some . features of Apple's devices infringe on its patents. Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last . year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had . 'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads . A previous lawsuit between the two in a Chicago court was thrown out by a federal judge, who said neither side could prove damages. Apple in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on Google's products. Apple recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software, replacing the Google product used in the iPhone, and said it would no longer offer Google's YouTube as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its iPhone. Cook took the helm at Apple a year ago, and Page stepped into the top job at Google a few months before that. The conversation between Page and Cook last week did not result in any formal agreement, but the two executives agreed to continue talking, according to one source. Google's Larry Page, who sat out several public speaking engagements earlier this summer because of an unspecified medical condition affecting his voice, has continued to run Google's business. Apple and Google declined to comment on any discussions.","Companies are keeping discussions open, a week after Apple's court victory over Samsung, in which Apple was awarded $1.05billion in patent lawsuit .

Instead, the 49-year-old and his lover and co-director Derek Arnold, 55, spent the money on a portfolio of properties, top-of-the-range cars and holidays. 'Sir Barry': Brooks, 49, claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich yet was able to play in a swimming pool while holidaying in Gran Canaria . Devious: Brooks set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts . Extravagant: Brooks was put under surveillance in 2009 and a search of his Bromley house revealed photographs of him diving around a wreck in Gran Canaria .

Brooks claimed he had to use a . wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich, . Southwark Crown Court was told.

The death of a 61-year-old Ohio woman is the first in the nation associated with a new swine flu strain, the state Department of Health said Friday. The woman, whose identity was not released, was from central Ohio's Madison County and died this week following an illness she contracted after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair. The death of a 61-year-old Ohio woman is the first in the nation associated with a new swine flu strain, the state Department of Health said Friday . The woman had underlying medical conditions, but the H3N2v influenza virus may have contributed to her death, the department said. The strain was found in U.S. pigs in 2010 and people in July 2011, and it appears to spread more easily from swine to humans than other flu viruses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. The death was among 12 new cases of the virus in the country this week, the CDC reported. Ohio saw two other cases. Wisconsin had seven, and Minnesota and Pennsylvania each had one. 'Like with seasonal flu, we have been - . and continue to be - particularly concerned about people with factors . that put them at high risk of serious complications if they get the flu' Ohio and Indiana lead the nation with infections for the year; Ohio has had 101, while Indiana has had 138, according to the CDC. Twelve people across the nation were infected last year, compared with 289 so far this year, according to the CDC. Ted Wymyslo, director of the Ohio Department of Health, said most of Ohio's cases have been mild illnesses. People from 6 months to 61 years old have been infected, and many of them have been linked to contact with hogs at fairs. Wymyslo urged at-risk groups to avoid swine exhibits and take other precautions. Those groups include young children, older residents, pregnant woman and people with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions. Visitors to the swine and sheep building at the Minnesota State Fair wash their hands after visiting the building in keeping with advice from health officials concerned about a new strain of swine flu . ''These people should absolutely not have contact with pigs or visit pig arenas at fairs this summer.' Lynn Finelli, the lead for the surveillance and outbreak response team in the CDC's influenza division, said in a statement that the agency was saddened to hear of the Ohio death. 'Like with seasonal flu, we have been - and continue to be - particularly concerned about people with factors that put them at high risk of serious complications if they get the flu,' she said. 'These people should absolutely not have contact with pigs or visit pig arenas at fairs this summer.' As with seasonal flu, the CDC recommends that people with high-risk conditions who develop flu-like symptoms contact their doctor immediately. 'Prompt antiviral treatment in a high risk person can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay or even death,' Finelli said. Symptoms of H3N2v include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue.","The woman died this week after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair .

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, the grandson of the late Red Bull creator Chaleo Yoovidhya, is suspected of knocking down Wichean Glanprasert, 45, and dragging his body down a Bangkok street in the early hours of the morning. Yoovidhya, thought to be in his late 20s, was taken in for questioning after police . allegedly traced oil streaks for several blocks to his family's gated . estate in a wealthy neighborhood Bangkok.

Toopgrajank, Bangkok's most senior police official said he took charge . of the investigation after a lower-ranking policeman initially tried to . cover up the crime by turning in a bogus suspect - the family's driver who allegedly claimed he had been behind the wheel. He told reporters: 'A policeman is dead. I can't let this stand. If I let this case get away, I'd rather quit. 'I don't care how powerful they are. If I can't get the actual man in this case, I will resign.' The story is headline news in Thailand where many are now speculating as to whether or not justice will be properly served. One comment on the popular Thai website Pantip.com read: 'Jail is only for the poor. The rich never get punished.' While a reader of the Bangkok Post suggested Vorayuth would  'receive a suspended sentence and never do any jail time.' The Yoovidhya family was ranked the fourth richest in Thailand this year by Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $5.4billion. Red .

The harrowing moment a brilliant young British Army officer lies dying after being shot by a Taliban fighter will be screened on television tomorrow night. Lieutenant Mark Evison’s mother gave permission for the deeply upsetting images, recorded on the helmet camera of one of his soldiers, to be shown as part of BBC Three’s Our War series. Killed in action: Lieutenant Mark Evison, 26, from the 1st Battalion, The Welsh Guards . The 26-year-old, who served with the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was fatally wounded during a patrol when more than 50 armed Taliban fighters surrounded his men in a 360-degree ambush. The terrifying drama and chaos of the battle is seen in graphic detail. The film shows the exhausted 7 Platoon soldiers carrying Lt Evison back to their base – a mud-walled fort - as insurgents’ bullets whistle around them. Realising time was slipping away, Gunner Steven Gadsby, then 24, lifted ‘the boss’ onto his shoulders and dashed across an exposed bridge to the safety of the base. He was later awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery. As Lt Evison lays bleeding on the battlefield, he can be heard telling his men: ‘I’m going down… I’m going down.’ Desperately fighting to keep him alive, the guardsmen reply: ‘No you’re not, sir… Stay with us, sir… Stay f****** with us.’ Their anger and increasing frustration can be heard as they struggle to get a signal on their poorly- functioning Bowman radios. The communications breakdown meant a helicopter to evacuate the severely injured officer was delayed by more than an hour. Traumatised troops describe how a better radio with a stronger signal could not be used because they did not have vital spare parts to repair the equipment in the fort, Haji Alem, in a Taliban stronghold. Scroll down for video . The BBC documentary paints a clear picture of how soldiers live on the front line . Controversial footage that includes Lt Evison's dying moments is due to be shown in BBC 3's 'Our War' Lt Evison's mother allowed the BBC to use footage from a fellow soldier's helmet camera . Hauntingly, Lt Evison foretold of the potentially-lethal consequences of kit shortages in a diary entry 18 days before his death. ‘I have a lack of radios, water, food and medical equipment,’ he wrote. ‘Injuries will be sustained which I will not be able to treat, and deaths could occur which could have been stopped. We are walking on a tightrope.’ A bullet had severed an artery in Lt Evison’s right shoulder on May 9, 2009. He was flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham but he was brain dead. His life support system was turned off on May 12. His commanding officer said Lt Evison was ‘one of the finest young officers of his generation’. His mother, Margaret Evison, 66, from Dulwich, south London, said today why she allowed the extraordinary footage to be shown. Mother Margaret Evison hopes the footage will raise awareness of equipment issues within the army . Margaret Evison, (in green), watches as her son's coffin is carried out of the Guards Chapel, London, following his funeral service . She was given it in April 2010 by the military authorities as they prepared for her son’s inquest. Mrs Evison, a clinical psychologist, said: ‘Programmes like Our War are important even if I find them very upsetting. They show the grittiness, the hands-on aspects of the war, exactly what is going on. There is still very hard fighting in Afghanistan.’ ‘I hope the public will get a sense of how humane the soldiers are. Of how decent they are. ‘I hope people will see what the soldiers are up against – out there, fighting. ‘I want any claims the Army might have for proper equipment to be supported. The more awareness the better. Every tiny bit helps.’ Describing the first time she saw the images, she said: ‘The footage somehow seemed more horrible than anything I had imagined. That patrol base just seemed more brutish… alien. ‘His platoon watched it together. They were relieved because they could see that they had done everything right – that their contribution had been almost textbook stuff.’ Mrs Evison will watch the whole programme, called The Lost Platoon, when it is aired on Monday. Lt Evison was a physically fit young man with a bright future ahead of him . Lt Evison shown puffing on what may have been a victory cigar . She said: ‘I will see it. I will force myself to see it. No, that is not incredible strength. It is just doing one’s job, what Mark would have wanted. ‘He wouldn’t have wanted me to do nothing else with my life. He would have wanted me to get on with it. ‘So I must deal with these things. And psychologists believe that the best way to deal with trauma is to deal with it – not sweep it under the carpet. ‘I stay in touch with other mother’s who have lost sons. We are all the same when it happens, all just as mad. ‘Your head knows what has happened, but your heart says he is still there, that he has just gone abroad on holiday; that when the doorbell rings, it’s him.’ Mrs Evison, who has set up the Mark Evison Foundation, offering grants to help young people develop through facing challenging activities, has become close to the soldiers of 7 Platoon. Lt Evison's diary reveals the shocking equipment issues facing the British Army . She said: ‘I have become very fond of them. When they got back from Afghanistan, they rang me up, one by one, to talk about it. ‘There has always been an understanding: Mark’s death rests heavy on them, and it rests heavy on me. ‘There has always been that shared something, the sharing of pain. ‘I have no doubt that the soldiers loved Mark, just as Mark loved the soldiers. That is a huge comfort.’ She is also unhappy with the kit shortages suffered by British troops. Mrs Evison said: ‘At the time of Mark’s death, there was bureaucratic waste, while the soldiers in the field didn’t seem to have the basic kit they needed.’ Asked whether her son’s death was ‘worth it’, Mrs Evison said: ‘I don’t know yet. That will only become clearer over the years, when we can see the fuller picture. ‘It would be lovely for me and all mother who have lost sons to see the benefit. But in war, it can’t always work out that way.’ * Our War is on BBC Three tonight (Monday) at 9pm .

Defeated: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed House of Lords . Nick Clegg said he will never sit in the House of Lords as he was mocked by other MPs over a reform cave-in. The Deputy Prime Minister told political opponents he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed House of Lords, in a humiliating cave-in. His admission came as he told the Commons about the Government's withdrawal of its Lords reform plans, which was met with mocking jeers from Labour members. He was asked by Dennis Skinner if, for all his talk of . wanting democracy in the Upper House, he would accept the title ‘Lord . Clegg’ - a question he has dodged when previously asked. However, this time he replied: 'No, I will not. I don’t think I’d be very welcome, . in the first place. I personally will not take up a place in an . unreformed House of Lords.’ While Mr Clegg's admission was mocked by Labour members, the current system favours the party considerably. The reform cave-in allows Labour to keep an Upper House filled with former comrades. Plans to make constituency boundaries fairer have also been dumped, meaning the number of MPs will not be reduced. Nick Clegg said that he hoped his plans to reform the House of Lords could be revived in the next parliament as he formally confirmed the proposals had been abandoned by the current Government. The Deputy Prime Minister has led calls for a mainly-elected second chamber, but was forced to concede defeat last month when faced with entrenched opposition from Tory MPs and Labour's refusal to back a crucial timetable for the House of Lords Reform Bill. Scroll down to see Clegg face the Commons . Little progress: Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards his goal of a reformed Lords . As MPs returned to Westminster . following the summer recess, Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been . withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards . his goal of a reformed Lords - a flagship Liberal Democrat policy. Speaking . in the House of Commons, he allowed himself a rueful smile as he told . MPs: 'I would like to make a statement on House of Lords reform... or . what’s left of it.' The formal announcement that the Bill . had been killed off was greeted with cheers by Tory backbenchers sat . behind the Deputy Prime Minister. 'I . can confirm that the Government has today withdrawn that Bill, about . which I am not as happy as members behind me are,' Mr Clegg said. He continued: 'Regrettably the coalition will not be able to deliver Lords reform during this Parliament.' But Mr Clegg said that the 'hard work' of MPs and peers on the proposals had 'inched us forward'. Status quo: Legislation to reform the House of Lords received a second reading earlier this year, but Mr Clegg was forced to admit defeat for his proposals last month . The legislation was given a second reading by MPs earlier this year, as Labour backed the principle of the reforms. But . the Bill's progress was halted as Labour sided with Tory rebels in . refusing to back a timetable necessary to prevent it being talked out. Prime . Minister David Cameron failed to reach an agreement with his backbench . rebels over the reforms and Mr Clegg was forced to concede defeat. Mr . Clegg condemned Labour’s actions, but told the Commons: 'My hope is . that we will return to this in the next parliament, emboldened by the . historic second reading vote. 'For . now, the immediate decision for the Government is how we fill the gap . in the legislative timetable and we will bring forward measures to . promote growth.' Deputy . Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg’s 'disappointment . at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber. 'It can’t be right that in the 21st century we have an unelected chamber making decisions on the law of the land,' she added. Pressure point: David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street today. Cracks in his coalition Government have widened after Tory rebels failed to support proposals for reform of the House of Lords . The fallout from Mr Clegg's humiliating defeat has widened cracks in the coalition Government. When . the Deputy Prime Minister announced the end of the proposals last . month, he claimed that the Tories had broken the coalition 'contract'. He . revealed that, in retaliation, Liberal Democrat MPs could no longer . support changes to constituency boundaries for the 2015 general . election. David Cameron denied the contract had . been broken, and said he intends to press ahead with the boundary . changes, which would reduce the size of the House of Commons from 650 to . 600 seats. Sympathy: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg's 'disappointment at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber . It is thought the changes could . deliver as many as 20 extra seats to the Tories, by equalising the size . of constituencies across the UK. Ms Harman asked Mr Clegg whether the process of boundary changes would now be stopped in its tracks as a result of Lib Dem opposition. 'Isn’t it pointless and costly to allow the Boundary Commission to carry on with its work for a further 14 months?' She asked for an early opportunity for MPs to vote on the issue, promising Labour support for Mr Clegg. Ms Harman asked: 'Will you turn your words of August 6 into action? The ball is in your court, will you assure the House that at least we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is a man not a mouse.' But Mr Clegg attacked Labour, who he blamed for the Lords legislation’s failure, giving Ms Harman '10 out of 10 for spectacular insincerity'. 'The Labour Party used to campaign against privilege and patronage,' he said. 'The Labour Party used to say it was the party of the people. 'The Labour Party used to believe that the second chamber should be abolished altogether. 'And yet when push comes to shove what did they do?' The Deputy Prime Minister continued: 'They voted for the idea of reform but not for the means to deliver it. 'They delivered lofty speeches about the need to give the people a say about how to elect the legislators in the other place, but they wouldn’t even tell us how many days they wanted for the timetable motion to make that lofty rhetoric a reality. 'I think the history books will judge the Labour Party very, very unkindly indeed.' Mr Clegg said that, faced with the opportunity to build on the work of former ministers Robin Cook and Jack Straw and be the 'friends of reform', Labour instead 'turned into miserable little party point-scoring politicians instead'.","Deputy Prime Minister tells political opponents he will never accept a peerage in an unreformed House of Lords .

Justin Forsyth, the charity’s £162,000-a-year boss, is a former adviser to Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Analysts were also sceptical about the depth of research that went into the study. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, . said: ‘This report is about the prejudices of the people who work for . this charity. 'It doesn’t tell us what really needs to be done about the . welfare system.’ Crisis: The charity believes many parents are buckling under the pressure of mounting bills and their children are seeing them argue more about money . The charity’s report, Child Poverty in . 2012, said 61 per cent of parents say they have cut back on food in the . past year, and 26 per cent say they have skipped meals. Around one in five parents, according to the survey, say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them.

Author on the family, Patricia Morgan, said: ‘I wish we were being told who these families are. ‘As it stands I can’t take this report seriously. ‘Save the Children is a charity that . depends for its income on telling us that everybody is poor.

David Kirch, a multi-millionaire whose charitable giving is legendary, has decided to cash in his immense collection of 4,000 notes and give the proceeds to the elderly. Between the late 18th century and 1921 provincial banks across the country produced their own notes. Old money: A Glastonbury & Shepton Mallet bank £5 note from the 1830s. Many people are unaware that almost every town had its own bank that issued notes to be used in the locality - but many banks often went under . Cashing in: A £5 note from Town & County of Poole Bank from the 1800's. Multi-millionaire David Kirch has decided to sell his collection of provincial Bank notes and give the estimated £1.5million proceeds to the elderly . All corners of Britain are represented in the collection that is so big it is having to be sold in a series of auctions. The paper notes were marked with the bank’s name, its logo and the amount it was worth, and they were hand signed. The collection has taken about 30 years to assemble and is being sold along with Mr Kirch’s collection of 350 Bank of England notes, which is worth about £2million. Many people are unaware that almost every town had its own bank that issued notes to be used in the locality. Big spender: An Uxbridge Old Bank £5 note from 1894. All corners of Britain are represented in the collection that is so big it is having to be sold in a series of auctions. The collection has taken about 30 years to assemble . Just like Northern Rock, however, there was often a run on these banks and they went under, leaving customers owning almost worthless cash. Mr Kirch, who lives on Jersey and made his money from property developing, has recently been diagnosed with cancer, a life-changing event which has given him a new perspective on life. He said: 'I started the collection in 1973 when I moved to Jersey and of all my collections it’s been the finest investment. 'Bank notes seem to be in fashion at the moment and a lot of people seem to have started to collect them. 'When I began collecting there were not many general collectors, but people who mainly collected the notes for specific regions. Note-worthy: A Weymouth & Dorsetshire Bank £1 note from 1825. The paper notes, popular among collectors, are marked with the bank’s name, its logo and the amount it is worth, and they were always hand-signed . 'But you have to draw the line somewhere so I didn’t collect from Scotland or Ireland, but I did include Wales. 'People . are amazed that there were such a large number of banks issuing notes . from so many towns. I collected them from auctions and from dealers, but . I didn’t buy many from the internet.

In even more money: Special Forces soldier-turned-author Andy McNab (above) is expected to make around £1million after Tesco bought an online download site he founded . The race between Britain’s supermarket giants to dominate the electronic books market intensified last night after Tesco struck a £4.5million deal with Bravo Two Zero author Andy McNab. The grocery goliath has snapped up an online download site founded by former-SAS man in its first foray into the world of e-books. The secretive Bravo Two Zero author is set to make a killing from the deal, which will net him more than £1m. Called Mobcast, the firm is an online . platform where customers can buy and download electronic books onto . mobile phones and tablet computers. Until now, Tesco has used a third party to provide its e-books under the grocer’s branding. But the fact the supermarket is buying . its own platform shows the group is stepping up its efforts in the . sphere. Mobcast comes with ready-made agreements with major publishers . and a back-catalogue of more than 130,000 titles. Competition between rival supermarkets has heated up over the summer. In June, Sainsbury’s acquired the book downloading site Anobii from HMV for just £1. The move was seen as an attempt to bolster the company’s fledgling entertainment arm. Last week, John Lewis won the exclusive rights to sell Barnes & Noble’s reading device the Nook in the UK. Books read on the Nook or Amazon’s Kindle have to be bought directly from the company that makes the reading device.

But the move will still be . seen as a challenge to Amazon, which corners the market in the UK with . around 90 per cent of all e-book sales. Tesco has made a series of recent . buy-ups in online retailing, including TV streaming service blinkbox in . 2011 and an internet radio service WE7 in June this year. The drive is fuelled by chief executive Phil Clarke’s enthusiasm for internet selling.

It's a traditional treat enjoyed by generations of children and adults alike, especially at the seaside. But the demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices. Many are also switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales. Analysts reveal that Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent. Demand for ice cream is falling - and many are switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales . Spiralling prices have led to predictions that the slide will  continue over the next five years, falling by another 7 per cent. Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007. This means the nation will be eating at least 500million fewer scoops a year. Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen. Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion. Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food  analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of  consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons. 'Together with the pressure on  consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’ Over the last two years, however, the sales of frozen yoghurt have soared 50 per cent, up from £4million to £6million. But, despite these gains, it still makes up less than 0.6 per cent of the  £1.1billion frozen treats market. Frozen yoghurt can be virtually  fat-free and, along with sorbet, is regarded as a healthy alternative  to ice cream. The boom in frozen yoghurt has been helped by the success of the Yoomoo chain. Other brands like Yeo Valley, Snogurt and Yog are also doing well.","Sales of frozen yoghurt up 50% from £4m to £6m over last two years .

When Alvin Tjosaas was a teenager, he helped his father build a vacation home in the California desert. More than 50 years later, he has been 'left to sit among the ruins of the house' after it was mistakenly ransacked by a bank twice. Wells Fargo had a warrant to foreclose on the property - but they went to the wrong home. Scroll down for video . Foreclosed: Wells Fargo wrongly sent contractors to take possessions from this house in the California desert . Trash: Workers left the house in a poor state and dumped family possessions in the yard . Back in 1961, Tjosaas built the two-bedroom house in Twentynine Palms when he was just 14-years-old. 'I put my whole life into this place, building it for my mom and dad,' Tjosaas told ABC. Now 77, the retired mason has spent much of his life in the home, and enjoyed vacations there with his wife Pat and their six children. But twice this summer subcontractors have visited the house in an attempt to foreclose, claiming the owner had defaulted on his mortgage with banking giant Wells Fargo. The Tjosaases have never had a mortgage on the home they have owned for over half a century. The subcontractors barged into the property with a foreclosure notice in hand. The notice had the address for the Tjosaas home but had the name Stephen A. Janoski on it, reported ABC. Fury: Alvin Tjosaas, 77, helped his father build the vacation home when he was a teenager . Pride: The retired mason always lavished attention on the rural getaway . After the break-in, police told Mr Tjosaas: 'Good news, we know who took it - Wells Fargo. Bad news, your stuff's all gone.' In June, the aggressive contractors apparently took three lawnmowers, three golf carts and family mementos including Mr Tjosaas' father's uniform from World War I. As well as stealing all of the family's valuables, the bank broke down doors, smashed windows and tore down walls. Patricia Tjosaas said that when she and her husband managed to reach the house, they called police who took the workers to the home they were supposed to be at, 10 acres away. 'Alvin was left to sit among the ruins of the house,' she told ABC News. But the contractors returned over Labor Day and dumped many of the family's possessions in the front yard. Family: Mr Tjosaas has warm memories of bringing his six children to the house when they were growing up . Devastation: The homeowner saw much of his life's work turn to dust when his house was ransacked . It also appeared that people had been . living there after the workers broke in - someone had left beer and . bongs lying around the house. Mr Tjosaas spoke of his devastation at seeing his beloved home torn apart because of a stupid error. 'I know every inch, every rock,' he told CBS Los Angeles. 'My mom mixed all the cement by hand.' He also reminisced about trips to the area as an adult: 'My little kids [would] come out here and their dresses were the same colour as the wildflowers.' The family tried to contact Wells Fargo, but apparently received no reply from the bank until their story started attracting media coverage. Notice: But the bank twice accidentally sent contractors to the wrong address . A spokesman for the bank said: 'We are deeply sorry for the very personal losses the Tjosaas family suffered as a result of their home being mistakenly secured and entered by an outside party hired to address a different nearby property. 'We are moving quickly to reach out to the Tjosaas family to resolve this unfortunate situation in an attempt to right this wrong.' Wells Fargo has apparently offered the couple more than $250,000 in compensation for their loss. Mr and Mrs Tjosaas and their lawyer met with the bank on Thursday but did not decide whether to accept Wells Fargo's offer. Mr Tjosaas told CBS that he had held on to one consolation throughout the foreclosure ordeal - the love of his wife. 'I'm just glad I have my sweetheart,' he said. 'We've been together a long time.'

Retired nurse Nancy Lane, 68, was infected with Hepatitis B after doctors used a dirty throat probe during heart surgery . A retired NHS nurse died after surgeons used a dirty ultrasound throat probe to examine her heart - infecting her with Hepatitis B, an inquest heard yesterday. Grandmother Nancy Lane, 68, contracted the deadly blood infection from the ultra-sound throat probe known as a 'magic eye' after it was used on another infected patient moments earlier. The magic eye probe had not been properly sterilised - and Hepatitis B was passed to Mrs Lane. The inquest ruled former health visitor - who worked for the NHS for more than 30 years - died as a result of inadequate decontamination at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Her family yesterday told how they were 'devastated' by her tragic death. A spokesman said: 'Nancy dedicated herself to the NHS, she worked for the NHS and had total trust in the people and organisation looking after her. 'We feel that she has been completely let down.' Mother-of-two Mrs Lane was making a good recovery after heart surgery and was 'living life to the full'. But she was readmitted two months after her operation when health chiefs at Morriston Hospital realised there was a risk from the probe. Mrs Lane, of Aberdare, South Wales, died of acute liver failure three months after her heart operation. Following her death a post mortem examination revealed she had contracted hepatitis B, which caused her death. Dr Bruce Ferguson, medical director for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, told the inquest Mrs Lane had received a heart valve replacement. Tragic: Mrs Lane died of acute liver failure three months after her heart surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea . He said: 'During the operation it is common practice to use a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) probe to monitor the heart. 'The probe was covered in a protective sheath while in use and insepcted and cleaned with a disinfectant wipe after the operation. 'There were no national guidelines outlining the correct decontamination process of the probes at the time of Mrs Lane’s operation in March.' Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict that Mrs Lane caught hepatitis B because of failures in decontaminating an ultra-sound probe. Ms Hunt said: 'The likely source of the virus was probably the probe that had not been cleaned enough. 'In my view the changes introduced since the death of Mrs Lane are sufficient to avoid similar incidents in the future.' The hospital apologised unreservedly to Mrs Lane’s family and friends, admitting it had not provided a high standard of care. An independent report later made 32 recommendations to improve standards at the 750-bed NHS hospital. Verdict: A coroner ruled that Mrs Lane died as a result of doctors using a probe that was not cleaned properly during her heart surgery operation at Swansea's Morriston Hospital . But Mrs Lane’s family claim that dirty and even bloody instruments were being used on patients at the hospital two months later. The spokesman said: 'We were told that the Health Board had made changes following notification of her death in June 2011. 'But in August 2011 when the Review Panel attended the hospital they identified items of equipment reported to be clean and ready for use which were visibly contaminated, often with blood. 'We accept that some changes have been implemented, but we feel that not all the issues behind hospital infections have been addressed such as poor and inadequate training. 'All Health Boards should make sure that staff training, as well as facilities in place, are fit for purpose so that staff can carry out high quality infection control, cleaning and decontamination.' Mrs Lane’s family has asked the Welsh Government to hold a public inquiry into the management of infection control at the hospital. Their solicitor Stephen Webber said: “This has been a tragic event for the Lane family and has brought to light serious issues within the NHS. 'The evidence showed that before Mrs Lane’s operation the procedures in place were inadequate, including the cleaning of the probe, training, and the culture as a whole. 'Some changes have been made, but the NHS needs to be vigilant. 'A formal review should take place in 12 months to ensure all changes have been implemented and infection control procedures are safe.'","Health visitor Nancy Lane, 68, was infected with Hepatitis B from a dirty probe during heart operation .

Robert Verhaaren was participating in the annual LoToJa competition and swerved to avoid a pothole on a . bridge over the Snake River in Wyoming, when he crashed and fell 35 feet on Saturday afternoon -- just eight miles from the finish line. The 42-year-old, who works at a private equity firm in Mesa, . Arizona, was being remembered as an 'awesome' family man by friends. Avid cyclist: Rob Verhaaren (far right) with friends at a 2009 bike race . 'It was devastating for us to lose a . member of our LoToJa family,' race spokesman Dave Bern told The Associated Press. 'Unfortunately, these things go along with bicycle racing. Cycling is . not for the risk averse.' Sheriff's . deputies said when Verhaaren swerved to miss the pothole, he crashed . into a guardrail and was catapulted over it into the river. The victim was a highly experienced cyclist who had competed in the event at least twice before, organizers said. Bern . said it was the first major accident on the bridge in the race's . history, and organizers would discuss it with Wyoming Department of . Transportation officials. A family in mourning: Rob Verhaaren with his three children Ansel, Helena and Karl (left) and Rob pictured with his wife Bridget (right) Verhaaren is survived by his wife Bridget, and three young children; Ansel, Helena and Karl, according to the Cache Valley Daily. He . and his wife were cyclist enthusiasts, as is his sister-in-law, Olympic BMX . cyclist Arielle Martin, who is married to his brother Michael. Bern said the 206-mile race, that starts in Logan, Utah, and ends in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, also was marred by serious . accidents in Idaho and Wyoming that sent two bicyclists to the hospital . and by flat tires experienced by roughly 200 cyclists early on. He says it's the first fatality in the race's 30-year history, that is billed as the longest one-day bicycle race in the country sanctioned by USA Cycling. Biking circle: Robert Verhaaren (left, in an undated photo with friends) was a highly experienced cyclist who had competed in the LoToJa race at least twice before . Verhaaren was a graduate of Brigham Young University and received his law degree from New York University School of Law. His most recent position was as Managing Director of the Universal Equity Group Funds Arizona. In addition to his successful career in finance, Verhaaren was a committed Boy Scouts troop leader. 'His whole family is awesome,' the Verhaaren's neighbor, Jay Larson, said. 'They would bend over backwards for anyone.' The family man would have celebrated his 43rd birthday next week. Race: It is the first fatality in the 30-year history of the race, which is billed as the longest one-day bicycle race in the U.S. The tragedy sent shock waves through the race community, which attracted 1,500 competitors from across the nation. 'After every race, we discuss what worked and what didn't, what do we need to change and what do we need to improve,' Bern said. 'We had less crashes this year than usual, but the ones we had were more serious.' Another cyclist was seriously injured in a crash on the descent from Strawberry Summit in southeastern Idaho, while another was severely injured in a crash near Wyoming's Alpine Junction about 45 miles from the finish line. Less than 20 miles into the race, cyclists began experiencing an unusually high number of flat tires. They were blamed on thorny weeds by some cyclists and on very small nails by others. Riders also had to deal with horses on the road and smoke from a Wyoming wildfire during the race.

Conflict: Michael Gove's Constituency Party accepted money from main shareholder of Domino's Pizza . Education Secretary Michael Gove is under fire over the return of junk food into schools while also accepting donations from shareholders in Domino’s Pizza. Mr Gove has torn up nutrition rules for school meals at the new generation of academy schools he has championed. The standards were implemented following a campaign led by TV chef Jamie Oliver, who turned his fire on the ‘Turkey Twizzlers’ served up at many schools. However, the new Academies have been . allowed by the government to set their own food standards with the . result that nutrition standards have slipped. A survey of 108 academies found more than a third – 37 – are selling at least one of the items banned from schools under local authority control, according to the investigation by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme. Crisps, sweets, fizzy drinks and even . high-calorie energy drinks are available in canteens or from vending . machines, according to the investigation. Concerned parents and teachers have also . reported an explosion in the number of take-away shops opening up . around schools and taking business away from school canteens. Some local councils have tried to stop the tactic by banning fast food chains including the likes of Domino’s pizza. One branch of the chain recently . opened directly opposite a secondary school in Brighton after winning an . appeal against the local council’s refusal to grant it planning . permission. Other local authorities have taken a . tougher line by introducing a special planning bylaw that excludes any . new takeaways from opening within 400 metres of a school. In St Helens near Liverpool, Domino’s . has tried and failed repeatedly to open near a school. It has just made . a third application for the same site. Dominating: One of the main shareholders of Domino's Pizza, whose family owns 76 branches of the company, has donated £49,541.25 to Surrey Heath Constituency Party . Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Gove’s constituency work has been supported by donations of almost £50,000 from shareholders in Domino’s. Between November 2005 and December 2011, . Mr Gove’s Surrey Heath constituency party accepted £49,541.25 from . Moonpal Singh Grewal - the largest single shareholder in Domino’s in the . UK - or companies owned by him. The businessman, whose family owns 76 Domino’s outlets,  is also chairman of Mr Gove’s constituency party. In addition, Mr Gove’s local office . accepted  £6,805 from Surinder Kandola, who is the owner of 22 Domino’s . Pizza franchises, between June 2005 and November 2006. The donations have not been denied by Mr Gove and there is no suggestion that these were hidden or in any way improper. However, Jamie Oliver, who fears his good work on school meals is at serious risk, said: ‘I think it proves that there’s been too many occasions where such an important role has been represented by someone who is seemingly lack of basic common sense. School scandal: 37 out of 108 academies surveyed by Dispatches admitted to selling at least one of the items banned from schools under local authority control, including crisps, sweets and high-calorie drinks . School dinner: Dispatches' Tazeen Ahmad investigates the truth behind what is served in today's schools . ‘You have to be very careful about who gives you money, because this is sounding very much like America now, where Domino’s actually deliver a very large percentage of the school food service. ‘So their sister company over the pond is making a lot of money out of school kids and they share lots of information - and they know where growth is.’ Labour MP, Stephen Pound, suggested the donations suggested the education secretary is not independent on the issue of children’s health and diet. He told the programme: ‘He who pays the piper calls the tune.' And if the money for Surrey Heath constituency is coming via the deep fat fryer, then how can Michael Gove possibly – possibly –be even handed about this?’ Frustrated: Jamie Oliver was devastated to see some of his hard work undone by budget cuts . Food cuts: Jamie Oliver and Dispatches presenter Tazeen Ahmad were shocked at the compromises school kitchens were forced to make as a result of budget cuts . Domino’s Pizza denied actively seeking sites near schools. It said: ‘We are a responsible retailer and have always offered to work with local authority planning officers, where there are particular concerns, for example through voluntary conditions such as closing the store to take away customers during lunch times, and at the end of the school day.’ Mr Gove has no role in deciding planning policy and cannot dictate where take-aways are opened. He said he was pleased to have the support of the Asian businessmen linked to Domino’s. In respect of Moonpal Singh, he said: ‘I am proud to have one of Britain’s most successful Asian entrepreneurs supporting my local party and contributing to public life.’ He said Mr Kandola was ‘another highly successful Asian businessman who has generated jobs and opportunities for others’. Mr Gove insisted the responsibility for food and nutrition standards lies with those in charge of the academy schools and, where schools are run by councils, the local authorities.","Surrey Heath Constituency Party accepted donations of over £50,000 from shareholders of Domino's Pizza .

Super discovery: The rare 1928 Mercedes was found rusting and covered in cobwebs . Rare find: The unrestored 1928 Mercedes S Type was unearthed after 60 years sitting in a garage . The car has been owned by the same family since the 1920s and went to a . mystery buyer for a staggering £2,801,500 - nearly double the £1.5 . million it had been tipped by Bonhams pre-sale. Auctioneer James Knight, group director of Bonhams' motoring department, . beamed with delight as he finally brought down the gavel at the Sussex . sale.

Attack: Logan Pickering, aged 12 weeks, just after being admitted to hospital with head injuries caused by his father Steven . An angry mother has hit out after her baby’s father was allowed to walk free from court despite fracturing their son’s skull when he was just 11 weeks old. There were angry scenes in court as Steven Pickering, 32, escaped a jail term for launching an attack on tiny Logan that 'could have killed him'. Now, Logan’s mum Sinead Nield, 22, has told how Pickering robbed her of a year of her baby’s life as he was taken into care as police investigated who was responsible for Logan’s injuries because Pickering would not admit what he had done. A court has heard Pickering 'momentarily lost control' and gripped, shook and threw down Logan, who will be three next month, on January 16, 2010. Pickering has now admitted assault causing grievous bodily harm. Judge Jonathan Rose, sitting at Bradford Crown Court, imposed a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, saying the only thing that kept Pickering out of jail was his low intelligence. Martin Nield, Sinead’s uncle, shouted: 'It’s a disgrace. You’ve let him walk the streets of Huddersfield. He has got away with hurting Logan.' After the case, Sinead said: 'He almost killed his own son and should have been locked up. 'I feel disappointed and let down by the system that it has taken since 2010 for this to come to court. But even now Steven hasn’t said how the injuries were caused.' Denise Breen-Lawton, prosecuting, told the court Pickering, who had a daughter by a previous relationship, did not work and was described as 'lazy' at home, doing little to look after Logan. Sinead was taking a hairdressing course at Huddersfield Technical College and on January 16 left Pickering to look after Logan on his own. Brutal: Steven Pickering with Logan just after he was born but weeks later the father turned and fractured his skull . Miss Breen-Lawton told how at lunchtime Pickering phoned 999 and paramedics arrived. Pickering said Logan was 'floppy' and 'breathing funny' but insisted nothing had happened. At first medics suspected meningitis but investigations subsequently found that Logan had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. A doctor later said Logan had been subjected to 'significant forces'. It was likely the baby had been 'held, shaken and thrown down.' Upset: Sinead Nield is furious her former partner Steven Pickering has not received a custodial sentence after pleading guilty to assault on her son . Pickering denied hurting his son but admitted to being 'a bit heavy-handed or rough' but no-one had shown him how to handle a baby. A ‘findings of fact’ hearing in June 2010 decided that Pickering had caused the injuries. Gillian Batts, for Pickering, presented a psychological report which described Pickering as 'less intellectually able than 99 percent of his peers.' Miss Batts said: 'The defendant’s limited capabilities meant he was not able to deal with Logan when he had one of his more difficult periods. 'Logan suffered with colic and I am sure those with children understand how difficult colic is. 'The defendant should really never have been left alone with the child. 'The defendant had a momentary loss of temper and caused the injuries.' Sentencing, Judge Rose said: 'A child is precious and needs to be protected and handled gently and carefully. 'They do not always do what we want. They often make noises and messes that we don’t want them to. 'You did something very bad to him when he was only a few weeks old. 'You hurt him, you shook him and threw him down and broke his skull. 'It’s an injury that could hurt him for a very long time. It could have killed him.' Pickering was also given a two-year supervision order and told he could never work with children. Sinead told after the case how she left Logan with Pickering while she returned to college for one day a week. She was called out of an exam to news that Logan had been rushed to hospital. She said: 'I have never felt so scared in all my life. I thought he was going to die.' Happy and healthy: Logan Pickering has fully recovered from his injuries . Pickering insisted he knew nothing of Logan’s injuries but a specialist decided it was 'non-accidental', meaning Sinead was only allowed supervised access to her son. 'I was confused, angry and just wanted to hold my poorly baby,' she said. 'We were asked how the injuries happened and were given the opportunity to admit to anything. I was devastated that anyone could have hurt my baby. 'Had Steven confessed at the very beginning my baby would have been returned to me.' Shocking: Members of the child's family erupted in anger when they heard the verdict at Bradford Crown Court . But Logan was placed with foster parents and Sinead had a daily 30-mile round trip to see him. She said: 'Leaving my baby was the hardest thing and our bond was destroyed. 'It was obvious he saw his foster mum and dad as his real parents and I was devastated. I missed so many of his milestones and I can never get that back. 'I was 10 years younger than Steven and never suspected he had learning difficulties, yes I knew he had problems with reading and writing but never in a million years would I have suspected he had such a low IQ. 'He was a popular lad, he liked to go out and have a laugh. There was no way I’d have left Logan in his care if I had suspected such a thing. He’d never been violent towards me. 'Now I hate him and I am appalled that he is allowed to go unpunished for what he did to his own child.' It is hoped Logan, who has started nursery, will suffer no lasting effects.","Steven Pickering admitted assaulting his child Logan but got a suspended sentence because of his 'low intelligence'

The ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox has lifted the lid on their whirlwind romance in a tell-all book, admitting for the first time how they behaved 'oddly' in the aftermath of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Italian Raffaele Solecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed last October after their convictions . were overturned due to a lack of evidence. Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found . semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. Now in his new book, Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox, Sollecito blows open the the early days of his relationship with the American that sparked a such fervid speculation over their involvement in the crime. Innocent: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead (file photo) In it, he maintains the couple's innocence but acknowledges that their sometimes 'bizarre behaviour' after Miss Kercher's death gave police reason for . suspicion. He describes how their romance . became a nightmare with the horror of Miss Kercher's death, the . misunderstandings that swept them up in the case, and their tabloid . portrayals as two suspects unrecognisable to themselves. Miss Knox . became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she . shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front . of investigators. Sollecito tells how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her. Murder charges: Raffaele Sollecito, left, and Amanda Knox, right, are pictured arriving for a hearing in Perugia's court, in 2009; in Sollecito's book, he maintains his innocence but says he and his then-girlfriend behaved oddly . The pair were filmed kissing, cuddling and stroking each other outside as the police were investigating the murder . Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion. In the hours after the gruesome . murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed . kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated. Italian authorities . later described Sollecito’s behaviour ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had . no real alibi 'except each other.' Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007 . They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep. The pair was imprisoned days after the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both would remain there for nearly four years. An appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence against them. Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence. Sollecito's book, Honor Bound, is due out September 18. The Associated Press purchased a copy Tuesday. In the book, he describes how the early days of their relationship became a nightmare: the horror of Kercher's slaying; the misunderstandings that swept them up in the case. While police investigated the crime scene, Sollecito caressed her and they kissed, unaware of the television news cameras across the street. Later at the police station she climbed in his lap and draped her arms over him, making Sollecito uneasy, he said. Anxious moments: Raffaele Sollecito waits in Perugia's Court of Appeal before hearing that he won his appeal against his murder conviction on October 3, 2011 in Italy . Testifying: Sollecito testified during a session of Knox's appeal trial in Perugia's courthouse on June 27, 2011 . Studying abroad: Knox shared a house with Kersher in Perugia, outside of Rome . Police found their behaviour 'odd' and he acknowledged they had no 'real alibi the night of November 1 except each other.' Knox is also writing a book, due out next spring. Her deal, with HarperCollins, is reportedly worth $4 million. Honor bound: Sollecito's book will be released on September 18th . The . couple were arrested several days after Kercher's death and later . convicted in proceedings that made headlines around the world. Prosecutors portrayed the case as a . drug-fuelled sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito were sentenced to 26 . years and 25 years, respectively. The . appeals court found the prosecution's theory to be unsupported by any . evidence. Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal, and Italy's highest . court will hear their arguments next March. Sollecito frequently criticizes the police for their handling of the case, reaching for a far-fetched conspiracy instead of the simpler explanation that Guede had on his own committed a burglary gone wrong. Sollecito, then finishing his undergraduate studies in computer science, writes that he met Knox at a classical music concert at the Universita per Stranieri, the University for Foreigners, on October 25, 2007 - a week before Kercher's death. He asked for her number, and she told him to come by the bar where she'd be working later that night. At the end of the shift, he writes, they took a walk, held hands and kissed. She accepted an invitation to come back to his apartment and spent the night. Soon the couple became inseparable. She began spending the nights at his apartment. They shopped for groceries together, and took a sightseeing day trip to Assisi. Capture: Knox, pictured in 2010 being escorted out of court by Italian law enforcement officials . Release: Knox, pictured right at Rome's airport, gave an emotional press conference once she got back home in Washington, left, a day after she was acquitted of murder in October 2011 . Sollecito wrote about his first night in prison, saying he wavered between 'great waves of indignation and a nagging sense of guilt.' He said that while he knew he was innocent, he was angry at himself for having a foggy memory of the night of the killing because he and Knox had smoked marijuana. When they were finally acquitted, Sollecito writes that he felt 'indescribable joy.' He remembers looking at the police, hoping to see them appear defeated, but they wouldn't look at him. He saw Knox sobbing, and they later had a private moment in the basement of the courthouse, waiting to be taken back to prison one last time. According to Sollecito, she squeezed his hand and said she couldn't wait to see her home and friends. Knox moved back to Seattle, and has since been pictured adjusting to life back in the States.  It's not clear where Sollecito is living. Moving on: Knox, pictured in March with her boyfriend James Terrano, are both living in Seattle; Knox has her own book deal, rumoured to be worth $4million . Guilty: Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, was convicted of Kercher's murder . Meredith Kercher, a British student studying abroad in Perugia, was found murdered in the flat she shared with U.S. student Amanda Knox on November 1, 2007. She, along with Knox and Sollecito were studying at the city’s University for Foreigners. In the days following the murder, Knox, her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and Perugian resident Rudy Guede were all arrested for the grisly crime. The horrific murder of the bright young woman shocked the world, and for the next four years, the world watched as Knox and Sollecito were put on trial for the murder of the 21-year-old, who suffered 43 separate knife wounds. While being questioned by the police following the murder of her flatmate, Knox was reportedly performing cartwheels in the station and sat on Sollecito’s lap during the interrogation. However, during her appeal, Knox addressed her actions, saying: ‘Everyone deals with tragedy in their own way.’ Guede, a drug dealer who was originally from the Ivory Coast, was later convicted of the murder. While Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of their charges, authorities rejected Guede's appeal after his DNA was found inside of Kersher’s body. To this day, there are many unknowns in the case, though the prosecution’s original story – that Guede broke into the cottage and tried to rape Kercher with the assistance of a drug-addled Knox and Sollecito – is deeply flawed and is now known to be far from the truth.","Italian native Raffaele Sollecito maintains his innocence in new book .

This is the terrifying moment an innocent taxi driver was bitten and punched in a frenzied, unprovoked attack by a drunken passenger. Leigh Curtis, 52, was left with cuts and . bruising, a broken nose, broken ribs and needing stitches to two . fingers, after being bitten so hard it hit the bone. His attacker, 43-year-old James Pilgrim, . was today sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison at Lewes . Crown Court for one count assault occasioning actual bodily harm and . possession of cannabis. Horrifying: Pilgrim, who was drunk at the time, appears to lean in to bite Mr Curtis who looks to be stunned . Request: Taxi driver Leigh Curtis (pictured on the left in this CCTV footage from his cab) discusses the fare with passenger James Pilgrim - who had seemed calm beforehand . Attack: Pilgrim leans over and grabs Mr Curtis as he launches the vicious assault on the taxi driver . Pain: The taxi driver struggles to restrain Pilgrim as he continues to throw punches . Mr Curtis, from Hastings in Sussex has been a taxi driver for 32 years . and was working a night shift just after midnight on July 17 this year . when he was subjected to the frenzied attack. He said: ‘He didn’t say a word throughout the whole journey, usually people do make idle chit chat.‘When we were nearing where he wanted to go he said he didn’t have any money. ‘I radioed the office and they said he was known and had used our taxis before so it would be OK. ‘I told him not to worry, that these things happen and to go into the office to pay at a later date. ‘The next thing I knew he lunged forward and was trying to bite my neck and my ear - he was pulling me backwards. Injured: Mr Curtis suffered a broken nose, cracked ribs and was bitten in the unprovoked assault. He now suffers nightmares and flashbacks of the violence and cannot bring himself to drive a taxi again . Black eye: The taxi-driver was shocked by the ferocity of the attack. He said taxi drivers often face abuse while doing their job . ‘I thought he was going to kill me, and if he had had a knife he probably would have done. ‘Then he got out the cab and head-butted me and tried to pull me through the driver’s window. ‘I thought he was on drugs, normal people don’t just fly off the handle like that.' Mr Curtis said there was nothing leading up to the attack. The assault was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the vehicle which was instrumental in the conviction of Pilgrim. During sentencing the shocking footage was played to the court and Pilgrim can be clearly seen to suddenly ‘flip’ launching a vile and foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at Mr Curtis before physically beating him. Towards the end of the clip Mr Curtis can be heard shouting ‘help me’. It has since emerged Pilgrim had been drinking with friends all day and estimates he had drunk ten pints of strong lager. Prosecuting Charmaine Wilson said: ‘The dispute centres in the taxi when he was agreed he would make a payment at a later date. Painful: Mr Curtis received deep bite marks to his fingers while fending Pilgrim off . ‘He was calm at that time until he dropped his bottle of wine getting out of the vehicle. ‘We have seen the evidence and in his statement Mr Curtis describes being punched in the face several times, headbutted several times and when he put his hands in front of his face to defend himself Pilgrim bit his fingers until they bled.’ Defending Laura Plant said Pilgrim could not bear to watch the video when being interviewed by the police and that he was on medication for depression.Mr Curtis’ firm, 247 taxis in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, have 100 vehicles and have installed CCTV at £500 a time in all of them because of previous abuse. Mr Curtis said the attack was 'serious' and that if had happened to someone young or older things could have been much worse. Jailed: James Pilgrim, 43, arrives at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for the assault. No order was made for compensation because he is on benefits . ‘People don’t realise what taxi drivers have to put up with,' he said. ‘I have been threatened countless times over the years put you just drive away and try to forget about it. ‘We aren’t trying to hurt anybody we are just doing a job but the people we deal with are largely drunk and in recent times more people are on drugs.’ The brutal assault only came to an end when the handbrake was released in the struggle causing the car to roll backwards colliding with parked vehicles. The impact caused Pilgrim to release his grip. Mr Curtis managed to restrain him and he was arrested at the scene. He still suffers flashbacks and insomnia caused by post-traumatic stress and doubts if he will ever be able to return to work in a taxi. Sentencing Judge Charles Kemp said: ‘I have seen, as you have the video footage from the CCTV in Mr Curtis’ taxi cab and chilling it is. ‘You were that night drinking with friends, you don’t normally drink such a huge quantity of alcohol, you estimate you had seven to 10 pints of strong lager. ‘You were carrying a bottle of wine and said you had no money to pay the fare. ‘He agreed reasonably you could go into the office at a later date. ‘The exchange was perfectly calm and reasonable. ‘You then dropped a bottle of wine and broke it. ‘You then launched into a vicious and repeated attack with Mr Curtis and the driver’s seat of the cab. ‘You screamed abuse at him. You punched him, head-butted him and bit his fingers. ‘You got into the back of the vehicle and went for him from behind, trying to throttle him while screaming foul and abusive language in his direction.’ He added six members of the public had called the police that night.

That's according to a major global architecture firm who have unveiled their vision  for a 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames Estuary. The London Britannia Airport, designed by architects Gensler, includes four floating runways tethered to the sea bed. Gensler says new runways could be floated in as required - allowing for future expansion to accommodate six landing strips. The mothership: An artist's impression of how the airport could look . Passengers would check in and arrive at terminals on the land. Two would be located to the north and . south of the estuary and a third central London terminal is proposed . between Canary Wharf and the Olympic Park. The Evening Standard reported today that London . Mayor Boris Johnson, who in the past backed proposals for a Thames . island airport, dubbed 'Boris Island', has seen the Gensler proposal. A spokesman for the Mayor said: 'This . will form, along with other significant submissions, an important part . of discussions going forward.' Where the proposed floating airport island would be placed, in the Thames Estuary off the coast of Kent . Heathrow Airport would close under the scheme and become a new eco-city and 'the largest urban expansion project in Europe', with housing for around 300,000 people . Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a third runway at Heathrow . The airport would be connected to London by high-speed rail. Gensler has built airports all over . the world and unveiled the plans in a bid to be considered as the . designers for any future airport project. Ian Mulcahey, project director, said: 'Because this airport is floating it could be positioned . in an optimal location after you evaluate flight paths, bird migrations . and all the rest of the issues in the estuary. There's a lot of . flexibility.' Boris Johnson was pictured doing his best to keep the Olympic spirit alive by going for an early morning run . The London Mayor was then snapped getting on his bike to go to work after performing a few stretches . Mr Mulcahey added: 'It absolutely . could be done. It's all fairly standard technology and marine . engineering is what we're good at in Britain. 'The idea of floating runways is . fairly basic stuff - we're just proposing it on a scale, perhaps, that . has never been done before. 'We're locked in a political debate . about whether to build a little runway extension [at Heathrow] or . whether we build a proper airport. 'This could be an airport for the next 100 years.' The Gensler scheme would see Heathrow . Airport close and become a new eco-city and 'the largest urban expansion . project in Europe', with housing for around 300,000 people. However, the Government has said there will be no firm decisions on UK airport expansion before the next general election. Ministers have come under intense . pressure from business to approve a third runway at Heathrow, Britain's . only international hub airport, but the issue has led to bitter in-fighting within the Tory party. Some Tories are calling for a . U-turn, with former minister Tim Yeo saying the issue was a test of . whether the Prime Minister is a 'man or a mouse'. The Chancellor George Osborne, who is in charge of election . policy for the Tories, has also opened the door for the Conservatives to complete a U-turn on the third runway issue. But Mr Johnson said it would be a 'disaster' while the MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston Zac Goldsmith warned he . would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding Britain's biggest airport. A decision on whether to support any of the recommendations in an independent . commission’s final report will be taken after 2015, new . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said last week. Mr McLoughlin said: 'This is a very difficult debate, but the reality is . that since the 1960s Britain has failed to keep pace with our . international competitors in addressing long-term aviation capacity and . connectivity needs.' He went on: 'The Government believes that maintaining the UK’s status as . a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long-term . international competitiveness. 'But the Government is also mindful of the need to take full account of . the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport . capacity.'","Plan by architects Gensler, includes four runways tethered to the sea bed .

Eurosceptic Tory MPs are to draw up a Christmas wishlist of powers they want David Cameron to bring back from Brussels, it emerged today. A dozen members of the Fresh Start group will launch a report in December demanding the Prime Minister to take back control of immigration, energy and business policy. Mr Cameron is facing growing calls to take a tougher line with Brussels to see off the electoral threat posed by the UK Independence Party. Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to take back powers from the European Union . Andrea Leadsom, a leading Tory MP elected in 2010, revealed the catalogue of rules and regulations requiring change will be wide-ranging. ‘By Christmas we will have produced a short and punchy manifesto for change which will be a shopping list of reforms across EU policy areas, including business, immigration, justice, agriculture, energy and many others,’ she said in a debate in Parliament today. The ongoing financial crisis gripping the Eurozone presented an opportunity to extract a new deal with Europe. A shake-up of the relationship was ‘absolutely essential’ she said, but dismissed claims the UK should withdraw from the EU. Tory MP Andrea Leadsom is leading calls for more powers to be brought back Brussels . ‘There is no doubt that it isn’t just . that we have the opportunity but we have the absolute need to get in . there, to make British interests very, very clear long before the next . European parliamentary elections in 2014. ‘The absolute burden is for us to define what we want that renegotiation to look like. ‘If . we do nothing because we are afraid they won’t listen to us, then we . will get nothing, and we will end up with a position where it’s either . in or out.’ Polls . have repeatedly highlighted the danger of UKIP, with as many as a . quarter of Tory voters saying they would consider backing the smaller . party at the next election. A survey by the ConservativeHome . grassroots website last month suggested 60 per cent of Tory activists . favoured an electoral pact with UKIP. Tory MP Peter Bone said today: ‘The way the Prime Minister can unite the Conservative Party on this and the way we could have a huge leap in the polls, how we get UKIP members coming back to vote Conservative, is quite simple - have a renegotiation then put it to the British people with two options: you accept the renegotiation or if you don’t accept it you come out of the EU.’ The Tory party is once again split on the issue of Europe. Mr Cameron has repeatedly argued that Britain should remain part of the EU, but many of his backbenchers disagree. Senior Tories are worried that the party will lose votes to the UK Independence Party, led by Nigel Farage, who has called for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU . David Nuttall said leaving the 27-member EU was the solution. ‘With all the problems in the eurozone it is a fruitful time to be trying to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, but I fear that if one looks at the precedent, the hope of success is not great,’ he said during the debate. If a referendum was held on the UK-EU relationship, and not on Britain withdrawing altogether, he urged voters to spoil their ballot papers, writing ‘OUT’ across the voting slip. In response, Foreign Minister Mark Simmonds said a review ordered by William Hague this year was already considering which powers, if any, could return from Brussels. Mr Simmonds said: ‘The Government has been absolutely clear that there should be no further transfer of competencies or powers from the UK to the EU over the course of this Parliament.’","Fresh Start group of Conservative backbenchers will launch their wide-ranging manifesto  in December .

"By . Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:59 EST, 16 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:39 EST, 17 September 2012 . Boris Johnson yesterday threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron by calling for tough union reforms to combat strikes. The London Mayor warned it was time to stop the ‘endless buggeration’ that disrupts public services amid fresh threats of a General Strike by union barons. His proposal raised eyebrows in Westminster – especially as he caved in to union demands for bonuses worth up to £35million to transport workers threatening to strike over the Olympics. Speaking out: Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron . last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union . reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike . But unveiling an anti-strike . blueprint, Mr Johnson has now called for strikes to be outlawed unless a . 50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote. The London Mayor also wants to ban . all-out strikes among key public service workers such as paramedics, . firemen and transport staff, forcing them to maintain a basic service, . and stop strikers intimidating workers. The proposals will be seen as further evidence of Mr Johnson’s ambition to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader. Battles: Boris Johnson has clashed repeatedly with Bob Crow, pictured, the leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and one of the last old-style militant union barons . His supporters say his proposals are . the ‘21st Century equivalent’ of the union reforms pioneered by Margaret . Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the 1980s. Mr Johnson insisted the measures would . help Mr Cameron’s drive to boost the economy and dismissed reports he . was plotting his downfall as ‘twaddle’. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We’re going through difficult economic times. ‘It [a General Strike] would be . damaging to the economy, it’s not in the interests of unions or their . members and it is unlikely to carry much support. ‘What we don’t want to see as unions . start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and . unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological burden . on people who don’t want to take strike action. There are hard-working people on London’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on. ‘There are intimidating people who . stop them getting to work, or a strike is called on the basis of a very . small proportion of the relevant workforce.’ He insisted that it was ‘not realistic’ to introduce a total ban on strikes. But he said: ‘What it does is take . away unions’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening . strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration.’ Downing Street is understood to be dismissive of Mr Johnson’s plans and wants a more ‘watered down’ version. A Number 10 insider said: ‘Most unions are a busted flush. 'If we give Boris everything he wants, it could backfire.’","The London Mayor called on Cameron to .

Suspicious: Former chief of police in Northern Ireland Sir Hugh Orde said Cregan's ability to hide for five weeks 'worrying', especially as there was a £50,000 reward . One of Britain's top police officers has condemned the 'worrying' conspiracy by a minority in Manchester who aided and protected suspected murderer Dale Cregan while he was on the run. Sir Hugh Orde said the situation mirrored what he experienced in Northern Ireland, where he ran policing for seven years, whose communities had in the past protected terrorists and criminals. A culture of fear was used to stop people with information speaking to police, no matter how high the cash rewards for information were, the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers said. Cregan, who was wanted in connection with two murders, was in hiding for five weeks in Manchester before allegedly killing officers Pc Fiona Bone and Pc Nicola Hughes yesterday. It is rumoured that he was seen drinking in pubs but this was not reported to police by people who allegedly witnessed it. And a £50,000 reward and dozens of armed raids across the city failed to uncover the wanted man. A candle and a pillow were found in a shed behind the White Hart pub in Hyde and he must have had help from people in the community to get food and drink as well as avoid detection, experts say. When asked what he thought about the Cregan's ability to hide for that long without the police being told Sir Hugh said:  'Of course it is worrying'. 'If people are terrified of an individual then I can understand why people feel that they don't want to step forward. It is something that I had to deal with day in day out in my time in Northern Ireland where fear was the key. Scroll down for video . Hideout: Dale Cregan, pictured left, was being sought by . police offering a £50,000 reward and may have been hiding out in this outhouse at the rear of the White Hart . pub in Hyde, Greater Manchester with help . Going underground: Staff at the pub discovered a pillow, blanket and candle on top of a pile of newspapers in a shed at the back of the White Hart pub . Overflowing: The disused outhouse was overflowing with newspapers when staff went to inspect it, but it appears bizarre that he could have been undetected for so long . Tragic: Pc Fiona Bone (left), 32, and Pc NIcola Hughes (right), 23, who were shot dead on a routine call . 'But you only have to look at the response of the people of Manchester to this awful event to see the majority are behind the police.' His views echo those of Sir Peter . Fahy, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, who said he was sure Cregan was protected by a 'criminal conspiracy'. 'We believe he has been protected by a criminal conspiracy to . harbour him. We are determined to find the people behind that and bring . those responsible to book,' he said. Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information about the murders of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23 and huge posters of Cregan, with his distinctive face and one eye, were plastered over the city to find him. Statement: This graffiti on a brick wall in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has the message: 'PSNI/RUC (Police Service of Northern Ireland/Royal Ulster Constabulary) unwelcome out' Protest message: This mural painting in west Belfast has the slogan: 'Collusion! It's not an illusion!' The longer it took to track him down the more police ubecame convinced he was being aided by a criminal conspiracy and 'web of intimidation' set up by criminals. The fugitive was held at Manchester Airport in June after returning on a flight from Thailand. But he was allowed home pending further inquiries. Cregan had been questioned over the murder of Mark Short, who was gunned down in a Manchester pub on May 25. By the time the police finally had him under lock and key on Tuesday, he was suspected of three more – the two policewomen and Short’s father, David, in a gun and grenade attack in August 10. Tragic: Constable Ronan Kerr was killed when an explosive device detonated under his car at in Omagh but despite a large reward his killers have not been traced . Journalist Carl Fellstrom, the author of Hoods, the story of the Nottingham-based organised crime family told the Guardian 'It is a double-edged thing,' he said. 'People are not only fearful they also don't trust the police with the information. They are not perceived to be part of the community.' Similarly in Northern Ireland over the decades, large sums of money and great pressure from police have failed to convince people to tell the authorities about the whereabouts of offenders or who they believe committed crimes. More than 30 years ago Joanne Mathers, then 29, was shot dead by an IRA gunman as she chatted to someone on a doorstep. She was collecting census forms when she was ruthlessly killed as Republicans believed the forms were being used by the British government to gather intelligence. A masked man dashed forward, snatched . the clipboard she was holding and shot her dead, before stealing all the census documents. The murderer sustained . cuts in the attack, wounds that would have been easily spotted by someone who knew him, but no one has ever been . brought to book for the heartless killing. Her husband even offered a reward of £20,000 of his own money but the murderer has never been found. Police Constable Ronan Kerr was killed by a booby-trap car bomb planted outside his home in April near Omagh by dissident republicans last year. A £50,000 reward has also failed to bring the murderers to justice. VIDEO: Sir Hugh Orde defends the operation that led to two deaths .

A Detroit man was so obsessed over toilet training that he fatally beat his 2-year-old daughter for having an accident, a prosecutor said on Wednesday in an opening statement to jurors at the man's first-degree murder trial. D'Andre Lane, 32, charged with child abuse in the Dec. 2 disappearance of Bianca Jones, whose body has never been found, has maintained his innocence insisting she was taken during a carjacking. The car was found less than an hour later, but the girl wasn't in it. Family: Bianca Jones's mother Banika Jones looks over at D'Andre Lane who's accused of abusing her two-year-old daughter, before testifying against him . Still missing: Bianca's father appeared in court on Wednesday in charges related to her disappearance last December . Beating: Prosecutors say Lane, 32, fatally beat the girl with a stick that was wrapped in a towel after she wet herself . Prosecutors now claim that Lane, who has fathered seven children with seven women, beat Bianca to death with a stick with a towel wrapped in duct tape, before disposing of her body. His admittance to police of having spanked the child for wetting herself, amplified prosecutor’s claims. 'He believed that if 2-year-olds had accidents they should be physically punished,' Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Carin Goldfarb told jurors. 'The defendant staged a carjacking to cover up the death of his baby.' Lane put the child's body in the car the next day as he was going to take an older daughter and a nephew to school, Goldfarb said. 'The defendant staged a carjacking to cover up the death of his baby,' the prosecutor said. Defense attorney Terry Johnson has said prosecutors have no evidence against Lane and their 'case is based on the argument that he spanked her.' Carjacking: Less than an hour after the father reported his car being carjacked from him last December with the child inside, police recovered the vehicle but the girl was gone . Involvement: Lane, pictured with investigators, was active in the search efforts for the girl while also speaking out for the public's help . Search efforts: Dozens of volunteers searched some of the worst areas of Detroit looking for the girl last winter, though her body has not been recovered . Johnson told the jury there was no evidence of physical harm and that while Lane may have hit the girl with a stick, it had a protective cover to prevent harm. Johnson also said Lane was distraught at the disappearance of his daughter and cooperated with police. 'They want to paint him as the embodiment of evil,' said Johnson. The defense lawyer told jurors that prosecutors are asking them to take a 'leap of faith' and convict Lane. 'I don't want you to take a leap of faith; I want you to walk through the evidence step by step,' Johnson said. Beliefs: Banika Jones is seen during her testimony while having previously told the public she believed the girl's father truly cared about Bianka and wanted her home . Defense: Lane is seen listening to his defense attorney Terry L. Johnson, who argues there being no physical evidence of the father harming the girl . Charges: Lane has been charged with first-degree child abuse and murder during a felony of the girl, which carries a mandatory punishment of life in prison . During . their search efforts last winter, D'Andre Lane had begged the public’s . help finding his daughter - a plea that inspired dozens of volunteers to . comb some of the city's roughest neighbourhoods in early December. 'Please, please don't stop looking,' he said on December 8. ‘We love her and we want her home,’ Biana's mother Banika Jones had said during their hunt. ‘Bianca, Mommy has lots and lots of gingerbread men for you when you get home.’ Asked about the girl's relationship with the father, the mother said at the time: ‘I know he probably wants to see Bianca home as much as I do ... He's never been anything but loving and committed to her.' Lane has been charged with first-degree child abuse and murder during a felony, which carries a mandatory punishment of life in prison.","D'Andre Lane, 32, is charged with child abuse in the disappearance of Bianca Jones .

After spotting the trick of the light for the first time, the 43-year-old, from Rivoli in Turin, became committed to making the three-and-a-half hour journey as often as he could.

He has now collected an impressive collection of photos of the shadowy double mountain, all taken at sunset from 3,538 metres up. On some occasions he would be thwarted by the cloud, but on others he would capture the perfect spectacle. Mr Bereto, a professional musician, originally noticed the beautiful illusion while on a camping trip in the area. 'I was setting . things up to spend the night at high altitude and getting a bit of clean . snow to melt for water,' he said.

'I've seen many shadows around the Alps, . all kinds of reflection and endless plays of light, but I've never seen . such a perfect shadow anywhere else.' Over his 25 expeditions to the summit in Piemonte - the highest peak in the Susa Valley - he has collected many photos of the magnificent view. Mr Bereto, from Rivoli, in Turin, added: 'What I love about these photos is that the phenomenon is totally natural. 'No one would be surprised to see his own shadow on the sidewalk while walking in the city. Extraordinary moment: The professional musician feels able to look at something everyday - in this case, a shadow - from an entirely different vantage point in this spot . 'Shadows are just part of our daily lives. The physical process here is the same, but applied to the immensity of a mountain. 'For me this parallel between the . ordinary and the immense leads to a sort of ""rediscovery"", making me . think about the laws that govern our lives all the time.' His two day trips - usually alone, but . sometimes with his partner - follow the same routine of watching the . sunset, followed by the stars and then the sunrise. Mr Bereto, a classical organ player, . added: 'It is absolutely quiet up there - if there is wind I hear its . sound, but apart from that only the passage of a bird breaks the . absolute silence.'

The mother of a British teenager stabbed to death on his first foreign holiday today expressed her disappointment at the 11-year sentence handed to his killer. Robert Sebbage, 18, was stabbed to death by taxi driver Stelios Morfis in a melee during a rite of passage boys' trip to the Greek island of Zante. Four of his friends were also stabbed, with two suffering serious injuries. Today Robert's family insisted the attack was senseless and they expressed their fury that the killer was cleared of murder but convicted of 'unintentional manslaughter'. Morfis also got separate two-year sentences for inflicting life-threatening bodily harm on Jordan Manson, Steven Granston, Calum Lane and Sam Champion.

But his overall 16-year sentence was reduced to 11 years, to include some concurrent sentences. After hearing the jury's verdict today on the Greek mainland, Robert's devastated mother Rhian told he she felt the sentence did not match the enormity of Morfis's crime. 'Nothing will bring him back but we . strongly believe that the sentence passed does not reflect the horrific . and senseless killing of our son,' Mrs Sebbage said. 'We take solace from the fact that Morfis was found guilty of taking our son's life and attacking four of his friends.

A teenage couple have been killed in a motorbike crash on their way to a fundraising event for an air ambulance that tried to save them. Bradley Cooper, 18, and Abbey Parker, 17, both died in a horrific collision with two tractors in North Fambridge, Essex. Bradley was riding a Yamaha, which had been a present for his 17th birthday, and his girlfriend Abbey was riding pillion. Tragic: Abbey Parker, 17, and Bradley Cooper, 18, died after their motorbike crashed into two tractors . They were both on their way to the 13th annual motorcycle run, a charity event for Essex Air Ambulance which attracts more than 5,000 bikers. An Essex Air Ambulance was called to . the scene of the crash but nothing could be done to save the young . couple who were pronounced dead at the scene. A 43-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of causing death whilst uninsured and has been bailed until next year. The families of the couple paid tribute to Abbey, who was described as 'fun, bubbly and a wonderful daughter', and Bradley, who was 'kind, considerate' and the 'most wonderful son'. The motorbike run sees thousands of bikers gather at Ford Dunton, Laindon, Essex, before travelling in convoy for 60 miles to Harwich where a charity day takes places. On their way to the event on Sunday, at around 9.30am, the couple collided with a Case International tractor and then another tractor. Dozens of flowers were laid at the scene of the crash and a Facebook group with over 6,400 supporters conveyed heartfelt messages for Bradley, who was a mechanical apprentice, and Abbey, a hairdresser. Abbey’s mother, Louise, father, Stewart and . brother Carlo Parker from Mayland, Essex, left a tribute to her saying: 'Abbey was a fun, bubbly and a wonderful daughter, . sister, niece and granddaughter. Abbey lived life to the full everyday. 'Abbey was a keen dancer from a young age, through school and into her teenage years. 'Abbey’s entire family are going to miss her more than words can describe. 'The . family wish to thank everyone for there kind words and flowers at this . difficult time and it is greatly appreciated by all.' The couple . had both been pupils at William de Ferrers School, where Abbey’s mum works as a science technician. The charity event the couple were on their way to was to raise money for Essex Air Ambulance and it was an Essex Air Ambulance that came to try and save the couple . Bradley’s . family said: 'For the short time Bradley . was with us, every single moment was a joy and every joyful moment we . had we shall cherish in our hearts forever. 'He always woke in the morning with a smile on his face and went to bed with a smile. 'He . spoke to and brought joy to everyone he met. He was a kind and . considerate friend, loyal brother, looking out for his sisters and the . most wonderful son and treasured grandson anyone could ask for. 'Never judging, only loving. Thank you for every moment of joy you have brought us all, and will still bring in our wonderful memories. 'Our love for you is a journey, starting at forever and ending at never, you wonderful, special young man. 'You are now together with your wonderful, darling Abbey, no one will ever keep you apart.' Andrew Merchant, deputy headteacher at the school they both went to, said staff and . students had been left stunned by the tragedy. He said: 'This is a terrible tragedy. They were both very well-liked and out hearts and prayers go out to both families.'

The gunman who killed PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes may have carried out the shootings because he wanted to become notorious, detectives believe. The policewomen died in a hail of bullets as they investigated a suspected burglary in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday. A grenade was also used in the attack. Police are understood to be investigating the possibility that the person responsible was seeking to become infamous as a police killer. Theory: Police are investigating whether the killer of PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) carried out the attack because he wanted to become infamous . Another suggestion is that the gunman may have planned the attack because he believed he may soon be arrested for other offences. 'One line of inquiry is that the officers were shot dead because the killer wanted to make a big name for himself,' a source told the Sun. 'If he ends up in prison, he'll be one of the top dogs.' It emerged yesterday that one of the Greater Manchester Police officers may have tried to fire a Taser at their killer moments before they were gunned down. A 50,000-volt stun gun was found on the ground at the scene and detectives are trying to establish if one of the officers had attempted to discharge it. Tribute: Greater Manchester Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy arrives to lay flowers near to the scene where PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were killed . An officer weeps at the scene where the two policewomen died after being attacked with a gun and a grenade . Investigation: Police have sealed off the scene while forensics officers attempt to recover fragments of the grenade used in the attack . The non-lethal weapon was out of its . holster, prompting speculation that one of them had grabbed it before . being killed in the gun and grenade attack. But . the gun and grenade attack happened so suddenly and quickly that . officers doubt that the pair had any chance to defend themselves. Residents reported hearing 13 gun shots before an explosion. A Taser fires barbed darts with copper cables attached which paralyse suspects for a short time. The scene remained sealed off today as forensics officers continued in their task of recovering fragments of a grenade which was used in the attack. The head of Greater Manchester Police said his officers remained at risk as he could not be sure that all explosive devices had been removed from the area. A man weeps as he lays flowers at the scene of the shooting in Hattersley, Greater Manchester . Three policewomen and a policeman lay flowers close to the scene where Pc Fiona Bone and Pc Nicola Hughes were killed . Heartbroken: The police force and the community have been devastated by the deaths of the two young policewomen, who were on duty when they died . Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said: ‘We are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades, we don’t know for certain, so we’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there.' The killings have reignited a debate over whether British police officers should be routinely armed. The brother of shot Pc David Rathband and the widower of murdered Pc Sharon Beshenivsky have both called for guns to be given to police. Darren Rathband, whose brother was blinded after being shot by gunman Raoul Moat in Newcastle-upon Tyne in July 2010, said: 'How many officers need to die before the powers realise it is the 21st century? ‘No job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict. We don’t go on jobs where people are happy to see us. Pictured: Dale Cregan is being questioned in connection with the killings of the police officers . ‘I am angry some other families have now lost a daughter, sister, mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner.' Paul Beshenivsky, whose wife was gunned down when she attended a botched burglary in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2005, said: 'I think policing, as regarding going to scenes of crimes, should be monitored better, and I think police, in honesty, should be armed, walking into situations that they’re not totally aware of. 'You can’t have armed response at every situation, but I think, as an officer being armed, walk into a situation, feeling more comfortable, walking into that situation, thinking, ""I could respond to that situation"".' The demands have been rejected by senior officers, however, and Home Secretary Theresa May agreed that police should not be routinely armed. She said: 'The Home Office have been supporting Greater Manchester Police in the work that they've been doing in relation to this case over the past week and will continue to do so. 'I'm clear that every resource that GMP needs should be made available to it and forces across the country have been giving support in the work that GMP are doing. 'I think we are clear we have a British model of policing that is one that our police very much support. 'I think that routine unarmed policing that goes on in our streets is right. I don't think this is the time to be calling for the arming of police.'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:23 EST, 21 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:23 EST, 21 September 2012 . Barack Obama was peppered with tough questions on his failures as President on Thursday night as he took part in a candidate forum. Addressing a large Latino television . audience, the president said his 'biggest failure' was an . inability to win an overhaul of the immigration system. But he took swipes at his opponent Mitt Romney, saying the Republican candidate hasn’t 'gotten around a lot' if he believes that 47 per cent of Americans consider themselves victims and entitled to government help. Scroll down for video . Sore points: Obama admitted where he had failed as President during a TV forum on Thursday, hosted by Univision news anchors Jorge Ramos, left, and Maria Elena Salinas at the University of Miami . In suggesting his GOP rival was out of touch, Obama was reacting to secretly taped remarks by Romney in which the Republican declared that the 47 per cent of voters who support Obama represent Americans who don’t pay income taxes and 'who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them'. Obama said Americans pay payroll taxes, gas taxes and state and sales taxes. He noted that those who don’t pay income taxes include workers who don’t make enough money to qualify, older Americans and students. 'When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven’t gotten around a lot,' Obama said during an interview with Spanish language channel Univision. The president later referenced the issue at a Tampa fundraiser, telling supporters he didn’t want his daughters and other young people to think 'that somehow half of the country is locked out' of pursuing success. Taking the blame: Obama admitted he had not kept his promise on immigration reform but said that it wasn't for lack of trying . 'I want everybody to be successful. Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, able or disabled, I want everybody to have a chance to succeed,' Obama said. The forum earlier in the day on the campus of the University of Miami gave Obama a rebuttal of sorts. Romney spoke on Wednesday at the Univision forum, where he said his campaign was about 'the 100 per cent in America'. Obama, who ran on a message of changing the partisan tone in Washington, said he had come to the conclusion that 'you can’t change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside'. He went on to say that what he had accomplished since taking office was due to mobilizing 'the American people to speak out'. 'So something that I’d really like to . concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant . conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on . Congress to help move some of these issues forward,' he said. All smiles: Obama reassured the largely Latino audience that he was still the right man for the top job in Washington . Romney seized on the remarks to say that Obama had surrendered in the face of a broken Washington and major challenges. 'He . said he can’t change Washington from inside. He can only change it from . outside,' Romney told supporters in Sarasota, Florida. 'I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We’ll get the job done from the inside - Republicans and Democrats will come together. He can’t do it. His slogan was ""Yes, we can."" His slogan now is ""No, I can’t.""' This is time for a new president.' The president faced tough questions on why he hadn’t accomplished comprehensive immigration reform, an important issue for Hispanic voters. Jorge Ramos, one of the moderators, put it bluntly: 'You promised that and a promise is a promise and with all due respect, you didn’t keep that promise.' Obama said he accepted responsibility but that he faced an economy 'on the verge of collapse' in his first year and blamed Republicans for abandoning support for comprehensive immigration reform. What will Michelle say? Obama pigged out on french fries during a campaign stop at OMG! Burgers in Miami on Thursday . Sneaking one: The First Lady has spent much of her time in the White House campaigning against junk food like french fries . He said there was 'the thinking that the president is somebody who is all-powerful and can get everything done'. 'What I confess I did not expect, and so I’m happy to take responsibility for being naive here, is that Republicans who had previously supported comprehensive immigration reform, my opponent in 2008 who had been a champion of it and who attended these meetings, suddenly would walk away,' he said. Asked later in the interview to name his biggest failure, Obama cited a lack of comprehensive immigration reform, but added: 'It’s not for a lack of trying or desire.' Obama’s Tampa fundraiser was attended by former Florida Governor Charlie Crist and Ronde Barber of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and included a performance by Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder. Vedder broke out a Hawaiian-made ukulele and joked: 'It’s got a little birth certificate right in there,' a reference to discredited claims that Obama was not born in the United States.

An oil painting bought at a golf club auction for £3,700 is believed to be a long lost work by famous painter JMW Turner worth up to £20million. Convinced the small painting was done by Britain’s most loved painter, art investor Jonathan Weal made sure he had the winning bid at the auction eight years ago. Now historians and scientists are backing up his claim after tests dated the oil on panel to 1805 and a handwriting expert verified the signature on the work was Turner’s. Long lost Turner: An art investor bought this oil on panel entitled . Fishing Boats In A Stiff Breeze at a golf club auction for less than . £4,000 which experts now believe is a JMW Turner painting worth up to . £20million . Art insurers Hiscox are said to have put the multi-million pound valuation on the masterpiece, entitled Fishing Boats in a Stiff Breeze. Mr Weal came across the 13in by 10in painting at the auction in Wealden, Kent in 2004 where amazingly it was even catalogued as a Turner, even though it had a reserve price of just £700 to £900. He said: ‘I eventually had to go up to £3,700, four times the estimate, so there must have been some others in the audience who suspected it was seriously valuable. Same Turner time: Scientific dating tests found that the mystery painting was from the same year Turner painted his famous masterpiece The Battle of Trafalgar, pictured . ‘I always back my judgement. ‘My . mother was an antiquarian bookseller, and she used to take me to the . Victoria and Albert Museum regularly, so I have always been interested . in art.’ Scientific tests date the painting, . inscribed on the panel along with the title, from the same year Turner . painted his famous The Battle of Trafalgar. Turner is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings. And while he is renowned for his oil paintings, Turner is also considered one of the greatest masters of British watercolour landscape painting. Britain's best: Turner, pictured in self-portrait, is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings . Turner scholar Dr Selby Whittingham . is among six experts who will present support evidence at a conference . at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London next Wednesday. Mr Weal said: ‘Turner spent a lot of time in Ramsgate and I believe . he painted it at a spot between Ramsgate and Broadstairs, funnily enough . an area where Nelson used to pick up a lot of his men to go to sea. ‘It is of great historical importance because we believe Turner gave the painting to his great friend the Reverend Trimmer, who was with him at his death and became his executor.’ Mr Weal believes that after Henry Scott Trimmer’s death the painting was sold in 1860, passing through several hands until disappearing from public view, until now. Dr Whittingham said it is unlikely to be a fake for many reasons. He said: ‘It seems unlikely to be a fake on various grounds. No one appears to have made any money out of it, so what would have been the point? ‘It is an oil painting as well, and . most of the Turner fakes have been of his watercolours. And tests on the . pigments used date it to about the right time to make it authentic. ‘This does not prove a particular artist was responsible but it helps to rule out forgeries from a later time. ‘It would be nice to know a little . bit more about the history of it. It may have been in an earlier London . sale, but I have no idea who owned it before Jonathan Weal.’ ‘It is often quite difficult to find these things out but I would say on the balance of probabilities it is a Turner.’ Six experts including Turner scholar Dr Selby Whittingham will present evidence backing up the claim at a conference at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, pictured . An 18 page report by Art Access and . Research, to be presented at the conference, says: ‘Work thus far has . not revealed any features wholly inconsistent with the hypothesis that . the painting was executed by Turner in 1805.’ Weight of evidence: Dr Whittingham said 'the balance of probabilities it is a Turner' Dr . Whittingham said there was ‘historical significance’ of a painting . listed as missing in Butlin and Joll’s 1980s study of Turner works. He said: ‘It belongs to a group of . small works which are neglected. All the concentration tends to be on . the big works exhibited at the Royal Academy. ‘Turner painted on this small scale not for exhibition but more personal reasons. ‘Turner gave the works to friends, and most have remained in private collections.’ Proving the painting’s authenticity might prove to be less straightforward, with more than one expert giving reasons to doubt it was a Turner work. Dr Whittingham said one dismissed it because it was on a panel. He said: ‘That is an absurd reason. Turner painted other things on panel. It is for others to give reasons why it’s not by Turner. The weight of the evidence is that it is. ‘It is an oil painting, which is partly what makes it interesting and rarer. Watercolours do turn up quite frequently.’ The record price for a Turner work is £29.7million when Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino was sold in 2010. Art and antiques dealer Frank Faryab recently convinced leading art authorities that he was in possession of a lost Turner which could be worth about £4million. He spent more than £2million to restore the painting, gathering scientific evidence including infrared dating, checking fingerprints and artistic tests to prove its provenance.","Art investor Jonathan Weal bought the oil on panel at an auction for £3,700 in 2004, convinced it was a long lost JMW Turner painting .

Keeping tabs: Scientology leader David Miscvage reportedly feared his former rival . Two private investigators claim David Miscavige, the leader of the Church of Scientology, paid them $12million over the course of 24 years to spy on his former rival, along with other enemies. The top-secret program gave Paul Marrick and Greg Arnold about $500,000 a year and sent them across the world in pursuit of Pat Broeker, who was briefly head of the church before being forced out, the men say. They are now suing the church after the paychecks stopped rolling in. The men claim the church violated a longstanding verbal contract to keep them employed for life. Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold say they did not confine their spying to the ousted former leader - they also spent time watching Mitch Daniels, a young executive of drug company Eli Lilly who went on to become Governor of Indiana and is a possible contender for the presidency in 2016 or 2020, according to the Dallas Morning News. Eli Lilly was the sole manufacturer of anti-depressant Prozac at the time, and the church is a vocal opponent of modern psychiatric drugs. They also spied on Marty Rathbun, one of Mr Miscavige's top lieutenants who left the church in 2004 and became an outspoken critic, and a former church spokesman who left in 2007. Both men became strong opponents of Mr Miscavige's leadership. The church claims it has never hiredthe investigators, and that they were working for attorneys. A spokesman said Mr . Miscavige had no knowledge of the work that the men did. The Church did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. Targets: Former leader Pat Broeker, left, and former top aide Marty Rathbun, right, . were both reportedly spied on by the two private investigators . The Church of Scientology was founded in . the 1950s by American science fiction author L Ron Hubbard. When he . died in 1986, a power struggle broke out between Mr Broeker and Mr Miscavige. Wing man: Tom Cruise embraces Miscavige during the opening of a Scientology church in Madrid . Mr Broeker produced a letter from . Hubbard saying he and his wife were meant to take over the church, but Mr Miscavige claimed it was a forgery. When Mr Miscavige finally . won out and became leader, Mr Broeker was forced to leave the church. In . their lawsuit Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold claim the newly-minted leader of . the Scientology church, which boasts A-list celebrity members like Tom . Cruise and John Travolta, still thought Mr Broeker was a threat. So he hired the two to watch him, follow him and dig through his trash. They even monitored his phone calls for a short time after they were able to give him a bugged phone as a gift. The lawsuit says the practice was legal at the time. During their pursuit of Mr Broeker, the men say they followed him around the world, photographing him and filming him as he went. Mr Rathbun says he personally hired the men for Mr Miscavige when he was still a trusted aide. 'I hired these guys 24 years ago. There were only four of us who knew about it. Me, Miscavige, and those two,' he told the Morning News. Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold said they reported to Mr Miscavige's underlings for nearly two and a half decades and were paid in cash every year.","Private eyes 'also spied on future governor Mitch Daniels'

A guru has gone on trial in France accused of keeping three generations of an aristocratic family under his 'mental spell' and defrauding them of their £3.6million fortune. Thierry Tilly is said to have persuaded the Védrines family that he was a Nato 'master spy', a confidante of presidents, a financial genius, and the representative of an ancient order which fights the forces of evil. The 48-year-old, from Oxford, is accused of . using brainwashing techniques and violence to convince them that they were in mortal . danger from a cabal of freemasons, a European secret society and . paedophiles. Thierry Tilly, 48, is on trial in France accused of keeping three generations of an aristocratic family under his 'mental spell' Prosecutors have called Tilly, who told 11 members of the family that he could protect them, the 'Leonardo da Vinci of mental manipulation'. If convicted, Mr Tilly could face a 10-year prison term and €750,000 (£600,000) fine. Jacques Gonzalez, 65, his alleged accomplice, could face a five-year sentence. The court in Bordeaux heard that Mr Tilly used his 'superior intelligence' to ingratiate himself with the family. His alleged victims included Guillemette de Védrines, who died in 2010 aged 97, her three children Philippe, Ghislaine and Charles-Henri, the two brothers' wives, Brigitte and Christine, and five adult grandchildren. It is alleged Mr Tilly's first victim was Ghislaine de Védrines, 66, whom he met as an employee of her Paris secretarial college in 1999 . After barely registering the 'uncharismatic' man for the first year, she gradually found herself drawn to him, and introduced him to relations. Outside court: Jean Marchand (leff), his wife Ghislaine and his son Francois (back centre), are alleged victims of the ""guru"" Thierry Tilly . The family claims he brainwashed them into believing they were the lost descendants of an ancient society called 'The Balance of the World', and locked themselves into the family chateau in Monflanquin 100 miles east of Bordeaux. For five years, they barely left the castle, terrified they would be killed. Mr Tilly allegedly claimed they were protected by a global network of secretive grandees, whose head, Mr Gonzalez, was a cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain. They were allegedly persuaded to part with property, savings and jewellery worth €4.5million (£3.6million), which were funnelled into a Canadian 'charity' that Mr Tilly claimed was set up to pay their 'protectors'. 'He kidnapped us by … turning us against one another.' Ghislaine Marchand . As scrutiny intensified in France, Mr Tilly allegedly convinced most of the family to decamp to Oxford, where they often failed to pay rent and were taken to court. Anyone who resisted was allegedly punished severely. Christine de Védrines, 62, says she was locked in a room for several months, deprived of food and beaten. She says he insisted she knew the number of a bank account that would lead to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar. When Ghislaine's husband, Jean Marchand, a journalist, denounced Mr Tilly as a charlatan, his wife and two children branded him an 'agent of evil'. Mr Marchand alerted the authorities who refused to act because there were no legal complaints from the rest of the family. Mr Tilly was finally arrested in Switzerland in 2009 following a complaint by Christine, who escaped after confiding in her employer in Oxford. When Mr Gonzalez was arrested in 2010, police found a BMW 645 with €86,000 in the boot, as well as expensive watches, bottles of fine wine and an 'opulent wardrobe'. On the first day of a trial which is expected to last two weeks, Mr . Tilly appeared smiling, wearing a black polo-neck jumper and glasses. Mr Tilly told the court he was a descendant of the Habsburgs and once almost played football for Marseille. He denies the charge of 'sequestering with the aim of committing an offence, voluntary violence with premeditation against a vulnerable person and abuse of weakness of a person under psychological submission'. Mr Gonzalez denies complicity in the charges. The trial continues. Outside the court, Mrs Marchand said that he was a 'liar and . con-man'. 'He kidnapped us by … turning us against one another,' she . said.","Thierry Tilly is accused of defrauding 11 members of the Védrines family .

David Cameron’s pledge to spend billions more on foreign aid has come in for a withering attack from a sacked minister – who said he did not know a single rank-and-file Conservative who backed it. Gerald Howarth, a defence minister until the reshuffle, urged the Prime Minister to scrap the ‘arbitrary’ target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013, and said it was only being imposed to mollify Lib Dems. He said it was time to ‘reorder the priorities’ and divert the money saved into the defence budget, warning that savage cuts to spending on the Armed Forces were having a dangerous effect on Britain’s influence in the world. The aid budget is set to rise by 32.6 per cent between 2011/12 and 2014/15, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, while the budget for the Ministry of Defence is set for a 19.5 per cent cut. Mr Howarth’s scathing criticism came as Mr Cameron made a speech to the United Nations in New York in which he promised that Britain would stick to its pledge, calling it ‘morally right’. The Prime Minister said: ‘To those who are sceptical, I would say it is not only a moral obligation that the better-off countries have to tackle poverty in our world … but it’s also in our interests that we build a more prosperous world.’ Globally, Britain is ranked sixth in terms of aid spending as a percentage of national income, far ahead of other G8 nations such as France, Germany and the US. The only countries meeting the 0.7 per cent target are Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Britain is on 0.56 per cent at present, but plans to meet the target next year. This will see the aid budget increase from £7billion at the last election to £12billion – costing each household more than £300 a year. Britain contributes some of this to a European development aid budget which spends half its funds on middle and higher income nations. Former defence minister Gerald Howarth (left) urged the Prime Minister to scrap the target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013, saying it was only being imposed to mollify Lib Dems. It has previously handed £1.8million to Barbados to build the PomMarine hotel, where youngsters will be trained in hospitality management. Mr Howarth said: ‘Most people in this country will think that 0.7 per cent is a somewhat arbitrary figure, and certainly I have not yet met a Conservative outside the immediate confines of the Government who believes that it’s right to ring-fence overseas aid and to cut our Armed Forces.’ He told the Daily Mail that while he did not want to scrap overseas aid, he took issue with the level of spending at a time of defence cuts. ‘I haven’t met any rank-and-file Conservative who thinks this is the right order of priorities,’ he said. ‘The target is consistent with the strategy before the election which was to woo Liberal waverers. I said that was mistaken politically from the outset. ‘It is a matter of major concern to most Conservatives that we are continuing to increase our aid spending up to this entirely arbitrary limit, at the same time as a large number of countries … have refused to sign up.’ Mr Howarth, MP for Aldershot, said . Britain had ‘given leadership’ on international aid, but the . increasingly dangerous world means it was now time to ‘reorder the . priorities’. Mr Cameron gives a speech to the United Nations in New York in which he promised that Britain would stick to its aid pledge, calling it 'morally right' Mr Howarth told the BBC that cutting defence would affect Britain’s influence in the world. He said: ‘If you are able to carry a big stick, you can speak softly. And we have certainly had to trim our stick. ‘I believe that countries round the world do look to us and say: “Are you a serious player?”.’ Lord Lawson, the former Tory Chancellor, also laid into Mr Cameron’s 0.7 per cent target. ‘It is plucked from a United Nations sponsored arrangement in 1970,’ he told Newsnight. ‘It had no rhyme or reason. Most countries now don’t bother about it at all.’ But Therese Coffey, a ministerial aide in the Department for Business, attacked Mr Howarth’s comments on Twitter. She wrote: ‘[He] needs to meet a few more Conservative MPs. Show of hands at pre-Budget backbench meeting was overwhelming for aid.’","PM aiming to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013 .

A Government forensic scientist has cast doubt on the theory that British businessman Neil Heywood was poisoned by cyanide . A top Chinese government forensic scientist has questioned the official cause of death of murdered British businessman Neil Heywood. Wang Xuemei said the conclusion reached by Chinese authorities that Mr Heywood, 41, died from cyanide poisoning lacks sufficient evidence. The statement by Mr Wang, who is with the government's top prosecutors' office, casts doubt on the official version of a scandal that reached into the upper levels of the Communist Party. Wang Xuemei, an official at the Supreme . People's Procuratorate, wrote in a blogpost on Wednesday night: 'I feel . very pained, upset and scared that our court believed the theory . [Heywood] was poisoned with cyanide.' Mr Heywood's murder in Chongqing last year is at the centre of the issue, which has seen Chinese politician Bo Xilai ousted from the leadership. Mr . Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence last month . after confessing to murdering Mr Heywood over a business dispute by . pouring cyanide into his mouth. Earlier this week, the Chinese former . police chief who sparked the scandal when he disclosed the murder, was . jailed for 15 years. Wang Lijuan was convicted of defection, abuse of power, and other crimes after visiting the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in February. He had revealed that Mr Heywood, who was found dead in November, had been murdered and that the wife of his boss was involved. Mr Bo was chief of the Communist Party in the south-western city of Chongqing. He was sacked in February having once been considered a strong contender for a top position. Mr Heywood's death in a hotel was initially ruled an accident and put down to alcohol abuse, although friends insisted he was not a heavy drinker. China's former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai has seen his career crumble after his wife Gu Kailai was found guilty of the murder of Neil Heywood . Wang is the first female forensic scientist to work for the country's highest level prosecution body. Her comments come despite heavy censorship of the case online and little coverage in the Chinese media beyond reproductions of reports from state news agency Xinhua. Wang queried why none of the normal symptoms of cyanide poisoning were cited in the accounts that emerged from Gu's trial or that of former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun. An unofficial account of her trial attributed to a person in the court said Gu's defence team had questioned the scientific evidence used against her. Her legal team reportedly said Wang Lijun took two blood samples yet found no traces of poison, while a third sample that he took – tested only four months later – found low levels of a toxin, apparently insufficient to kill. Chongqing municipality ex-police chief Wang Lijun (right) was jailed for 15 years on Monday . Wang Lijun's trial is also said to have heard a recording the police chief made secretly of Gu confessing to him the day after Heywood's death, though no details were given. In her blog post Wang Xuemei also suggested that the former police chief could have manipulated Gu. She wrote: 'In other words, Wang Lijun could easily have used Gu to do whatever he wanted to do. 'Who would benefit from Neil Heywood's death?' 'I don't care how long the blog is up there. I just want to tell people I feel humiliated. 'I think Chinese criminal doctors are not such idiots. I have done my duty and fulfilled my historical responsibility.'","Wang Xuemei said the conclusion that Mr Heywood died from cyanide poisoning .

A grandmother took to the roof of her bungalow to protest against her own daughter cutting off her electricity supply in the house they both share. Catherine Beesley, 60, launched the rooftop demonstration with her husband - complete with placards - in the latest development of an ongoing dispute between the two women. Mrs Beesely co-owns a £300,000 pounds bungalow with daughter Sue Martin in a leafy suburb of Bournemouth, Dorset. Rooftop protest: Catherine Beesley and her husband Richard launched a demonstration - with placards - after their electricity was cut off . Dispute: Mrs Beesley's daughter Sue Martin talks with police about the protest in front of the house they both share . Protest: The couple are demonstrating in a bid to Mrs Beesley's daughter to restore the power . However, the inside of the four-bedroom home was split in two so they could live separately after the mother and daughter had a falling out. Mrs Beesley lives with husband Richard in the self-contained converted loft of the property while Mrs Martin shares the downstairs section with her two children. However, when they returned from a recent holiday, the Beesleys claimed the electricity had been cut off from their partitioned section of the bungalow due to unpaid bills. The couple say are currently living by candlelight and being given food handouts by a next-door neighbour. Mrs Beesley, who spent 25 years working for the NHS as an administrative worker, has now taken to the roof in a bid to get her estranged daughter to restore the power. Wearing fluorescent waterproofs, she spends her days waving placards at bemused neighbours along the suburban street in Redhill, Bournemouth, Dorset. Without heating: Mrs Beesley and her husband Richard say they are so cold they have to wear coats . Mrs Beesley lights candles inside her loft conversion apartment and cooks with a gas-powered camping stove . One banner reads ‘daughter denies mother electric’ and another states ‘paid 4 it, own it, denied it.’ Mrs Beesley, who still volunteers at Bournemouth Hospital, claims she has given her daughter a cheque to cover a recent electricity bill but it was never cashed. She said: 'This all started a few years ago after I sold two thirds of my bungalow to Sue and her former partner. 'It was fine for a while, I babysat the children and we all got on very well. 'But we had a falling out a couple of years ago and I haven’t spoken to Sue for months. It has broken my heart. The electricity has been off for about three weeks now. 'It's so cold in the loft, we have to wear our coats all the time' Grandmother Catherine Beesley . 'We’ve got to the point where I had to do something. It is so cold in the loft that we have to wear coats all the time and have no hot water at all. 'For food we rely on instant soup that my neighbour helps me make by giving me flasks of hot water, or sometimes we use a portable gas stove. 'I started protesting on the garage roof on Tuesday because it’s not fair, and I’m staying up here until the electricity is turned back on. 'I own as much of the property as she does and it’s not right that I am not allowed access to it and that I am deprived of electricity.' Mr Beesley, a 63-year-old retired gas engineer, added: 'I think the whole situation is incredibly silly and I can’t believe it has come to this. 'There is no logic or reasoning behind any of it and I just can’t see why we can’t all live in peace.' Domestic dispute: Following a row several years ago, Mrs Beesley no longer speaks to her daughter and lives in a loft conversion above the house they both share . Hostilities: Mr and Mrs Beesley in their loft conversion. He described the dispute as having no logic or reasoning . Mrs Martin, who works at the same hospital as her mother as an assistant in the X-ray department, said because they aren’t talking to one another they are unable to resolve the issue between them. The 42-year-old said: 'When my mother returned from holiday I enquired through her solicitor about how they planned to pay the bills. 'I heard nothing back from the lawyer, so the day before they came back I got an electrician to stop the power supply to the attic. 'I can’t afford to pay for them and for my family and I would have reactivated it as soon as I heard from her solicitor, which I didn’t. 'We haven’t spoken in such a long time it wasn’t the case that we could have resolved it face to face. 'She gave me 120 pounds to cover the water bill but I wasn’t going to cash it in as I only need 30.'

Iran's hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has joined a chorus of Islamist nations that have condemned an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. The Islamist regime also had some tough talk in the face of a possible attack from Israel over its long-disputed nuclear programme. When asked about the series of protests sparked by the film in the Muslim world, Ahmadinejad called the protests ‘ugly,’ but slammed the video itself as an 'abuse of freedom.' Scroll down for video . Tough talk: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has condemned the anti-Muslim film that has sparked outrage across the Muslim world . CNN's Piers Morgan sat down with Ahmadinejad in New York this week after the Iranian president arrived for the UN General Assembly this week. He told Morgan: 'Fundamentally, first of all, any action that is provocative, offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people, we condemn.' He added: 'Likewise, we condemn any type of extremism. Of course, what took place was ugly. Offending the Holy Prophet is quite ugly. This has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech. 'This is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom, and in many places it is a crime. It shouldn't take place and I do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy,' said Ahmadinejad. Fury: Iranian Islamists burn a U.S. flag during a recent protest in front of the U.S. interest section within the Swiss embassy in Tehran, Iran . In an original English version and another dubbed into Egyptian Arabic, Mohammed is branded a child molester, a fraud and a madman, and he's shown him having sex and calling for massacres. People involved in the film, an amateurish 13-minute clip of which was posted on YouTube, have said it was made by a 55-year-old California man, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. Nakoula has not returned to his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos since leaving voluntarily to be interviewed by federal authorities. His family has since gone into hiding. Aflame: The U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is seen in flames during a protest by an armed group said to have been protesting a film being produced in the United States . During the one-on-one on CNN, which will air on Monday night, Ahmadinjad also discussed the possibility of a military conflict with Israel. He told Morgan: 'Any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself. But my question is this: Why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical, ancient country, such as Iran. A great country, such as Iran, based on an excuse of his own fabrication?' But an Iranian general took a more aggressive stance on a possible attack from Israel, promising that the Islamist regime’s army could wipe out Israel in a day, according to PressTV. Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the deputy commander of the regime's elite Revolutionary Guards force, told an Iranian television station: 'A regime [with a frontier] that in some spots is only 24 kilometers wide could have its back broken by one of our infantry battalions in 24 hours.'

David Cameron found himself at odds with schoolfriend Charlie Brooks yesterday over extraordinary claims that he snubbed a call from Barack Obama to carry on a game of tennis. Mr Brooks, a member of the so-called ‘Chipping Norton set’, caused turmoil at Number Ten by suggesting the Prime Minister had been too involved in a match at his country residence, Chequers, to speak to the President. Mr Cameron flatly rejected the claims, insisting he and Mr Brooks had played tennis only once at Chequers and official logs showed no calls from Mr Obama at any time that weekend. On the back foot: The PM playing an exhibition shot earlier this year. But did he really tell Obama to call back just so he could finish a set? Downing Street said that officials always scheduled calls between the Prime Minister and the President in advance, with the White House giving 15 minutes’ notice even when Mr Obama woke Mr Cameron up in the middle of the night to tell him Osama Bin Laden had been assassinated. The episode is particularly sensitive since relations between Mr Cameron and the racehorse trainer husband of former News International boss Rebekah Brooks, have been in the deep freeze since the couple were arrested and charged over the phone hacking scandal. Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks is an old friend of David Cameron's from their time as pupils at Eton . Mr Brooks, who was at Eton with the Prime Minister, said in an interview with the Racing Post that the pair were ‘pretty good friends’. He went on: ‘I played tennis with him at Chequers one day. I won the first set easily, then he won the second set, and then someone came up to him and said, “Er ... Mr Obama is on the phone for you, Prime Minister”. ‘He said, “I think we’ve got time for a third set – tell Mr Obama I’ll ring him back.” He obviously thought he had me on the ropes, and I beat him two sets to one.’ Mr Brooks said that despite the hacking scandal, he hoped he would remain friends with Mr Cameron – who he said was known as the ‘fat, noisy one’ at Eton. ‘We can’t see each other now, of course, but I’m sure that will pass.’ A senior Downing Street source said: ‘We are baffled. Charlie Brooks has been to Chequers on three occasions and there are simply no calls from President Obama logged around that time. ‘It is not the case that the President rings up on the off chance that the Prime Minister is free. Calls are always scheduled by officials, even when there is an international emergency. There is an agenda and the Prime Minister prepares for the call. There has obviously been some misunderstanding because this account cannot be true.’ Another source said the one tennis match between Mr Cameron and Mr Brooks at Chequers was on a Saturday morning in August 2010. ‘Obama would have had to be calling in the middle of the night US time.’ Mr Cameron’s links with Mr and Mrs Brooks came under scrutiny this year when it emerged that the Metropolitan Police had lent the ex-newspaper executive a retired police horse. He was forced to admit he might have ridden the horse with Mr Brooks. Claims about David Cameron's tennis playing emerged today whole the Prime Minister was on a trade visit to Brazil. He arrived in Sao Paulo with a large entourage of 40 business men and women . Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride suggested aides might pretend Mr Obama was calling to give Mr Cameron an excuse to get out of a potentially boring meeting or social encounter. ‘We used to put blank post-it notes into GB. If he wanted to carry on a meeting, he’d ignore them. If not, he’d say, “Netanyahu? Now?”.’ Tony Blair’s biographer John Rentoul said he remembered Mr Blair doing something similar at a leaving party at Number Ten for his political secretary Phil Wilson, now MP for Sedgefield. He said: ‘The Prime Minister was giving a generous speech when someone put a head round the door to say that the White House was on the line. “I’ve always wanted to do this for you, Phil,” said Blair. “Tell them I will call them back”.’","Horse trainer Brooks says his old schoolfriend refused to take a call from the US President because he had just pulled level in a tennis match at Chequers .

Tragic: Hairdresser Veronica Galbraith, 37, was left devastated after being unable to cope with teenage son Andre's behavioural problems . A doting single mother is thought to have jumped to her death from a motorway bridge after being forced to put her autistic child into care, an inquest was told. Hairdresser Veronica Galbraith, 37, was left devastated after being unable to cope with teenage son Andre's behavioural problems. Miss Galbraith had also been cruelly taunted by neighbours who said: 'You have had your child taken off you, we have still got ours,' the inquest was told.Miss Galbraith was found dead on the M61 underneath a bridge near her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, last June. It is believed she fell or jumped into the path of several lorries travelling along the carriageway. She died from multiple injuries. She had tried to kill herself by overdosing on tablets twice before, the inquest was told. The hearing in Bolton heard how the single mother had been a talented badminton and volleyball player at school before giving birth to Andre in 1997. She had later split up with his father and moved into her family home in Bury Crescent, Walkden. Miss Galbraith's mother Martha said in a statement: 'Andre had autism and was expelled from school. He smashed up the house and Veronica could not cope and put him in care. 'She was then having a lot of trouble from her next door neighbours who would play loud music. When she would go round to the house she would be threatened. She started saying she was hearing things and we knew she was not well. She started getting help.' Miss Galbraith's boyfriend John Walls said: 'Andre had behavioural problems and was taken into care in May 2010. When Andre went into care I stayed with Veronica to help her.  Veronica went to see him but he was still a bit annoyed and he didn’t want to see anyone and he was still getting into trouble. Gruesome: Miss Galbraith was found dead on the M61 underneath a bridge near her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, last June . Injuries: It is believed Miss Galbraith fell or jumped into the path of several lorries travelling along the carriageway and died from multiple injuries . 'There were quite a lot of arguments and problems with the neighbours. They were always playing loud music and she couldn’t sleep.' Miss Galbraith's moved into a home for vulnerable women last April but she attempted suicide twice and was said to be 'crying all the time' after her brother died suddenly. Mr Walls added: 'When her brother died she had a breakdown, she started talking about death saying she had cancer and was going to die. She did say that she did not want to live anymore and I said to think about Andre because he needed her and think of her mother. She did not say or give any specific reason why. Sorrow: Miss Galbraith's boyfriend John Walls, who was at the Bolton inquest, said the 37-year-old had talked about 'jumping off a bridge' which he had dismissed it as 'silly talk' 'She was frustrated that she could not have Andre at home and that she could not control his behaviour, her world was upside down. I think that was the start of the problems, she started to drink heavily and became depressed.' He added: 'In the past when she was ill she did mention, ""I feel like going to the bridge. I feel like jumping off a bridge"". I just thought it was silly talk.There was no texts, letters or nothing.' Recording an open verdict, Bolton Deputy Coroner, Alan Walsh said: 'Veronica had had the problem of coping with the behaviour of an autistic child and that would have been distressing and hard for her due to his behaviour. 'He was in the care of the local authority and she maintained contact and saw him at least once a week. Clearly she still cares for him as his mother. 'She was distressed that he was in care and distressed about the death of her father and then subsequently the death of her brother and her sister being ill. In addition she was concerned for her mother and there is reference from the mental health service that Veronica believed her mother and sister may die which would be an additional worry to the deaths she had already had to cope with.' He added: 'How she got onto the motorway cannot be certain. She could have got to the carriage way by jumping, falling, walking down the steps onto the hard shoulder and walking into the road.'","Veronica Galbraith's teenage son Andre had behavioural problems .

Schirmer, of Pennsylvania, has now been charged with the murder of both his wives . A former pastor facing trial for his second wife's murder has now been charged in the death of his first wife after a grand jury concluded that he killed both women with blunt objects. Arthur Burton 'A.B.' Schirmer, 63, was charged with homicide in the death of Jewel Schirmer, his wife of more than 30 years, Lebanon County District Attorney David Arnold announced today. Schirmer's attorney said his client, the former pastor of Reeders United Methodist Church in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania, denies involvement in either of his wives' deaths. Jewel Schirmer, 50, died at Hershey Medical Center of a traumatic brain injury from an alleged fall down a flight of stairs. Schirmer said he came home on April 23, . 1999, to find Jewel lying at the bottom of some steps and bleeding from . the head. She died the next day. Police . and prosecutors reopened the probe after her husband came under . investigation in the 2008 death of his second wife, Betty, in the Pocono . Mountains. Schirmer was . charged two years ago with killing Betty and staging a car accident to . cover it up. He's scheduled to stand trial in that case in January. In the death of his second wife, he said he was driving Betty to Pocono . Medical Center on July 15, 2008, when she awoke complaining of jaw pain . and she had removed her seat belt to get comfortable. He claimed a deer ran into the road and he swerved to avoid it, crashing . into the guide rail and causing Betty to hit her head against the . windshield . Police later said the damage to the . car was too minor to have caused an injury that produced as much blood . as paramedics found in the car. Questions: Schirmer's first wife Jewel (left) died in 1999 after an alleged fall down the stairs while Betty died in a car crash which the disgraced pastor allegedly staged two years ago . In cuffs: Schirmer denies having anything to do with either of his wives' deaths. He is due to stand trial in January . A Lebanon County grand jury cited medical testimony that revealed Schirmer used blunt objects to kill both his wives. 'We . find it particularly disturbing and difficult to believe that both of . A.B. Schirmer's wives could have suffered such horrific injuries by . accident. 'To the contrary, . we believe probable cause exists to believe that neither woman died . from an accident,' said the grand jury's report, released on Friday. Arnold declined to speculate on a . motive, but the grand jury report indicates that Schirmer was unfaithful . to Jewel throughout their marriage, carrying on affairs with women in . the church. The grand jury also said the Schirmers had financial difficulties. Hypocrite: Schirmer cheated on his first wife Jewel throughout their marriage, police claimed, with women in his congregation at Reeders United Methodist Church in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania . 'I'm happy. I've been waiting 13 years for this day to come. It's time for justice,' said Jewel's brother, John Behney, appearing at a news conference with DA Arnold. Schirmer's attorney, James Swetz, said his client will be vindicated. 'Our belief, and what we intend to show in both of these incidents, is that the initial reports were correct, that the Monroe County death was an accident and in Lebanon County, there was evidence of heart attack' preceding her fall, Swetz said. Vindicated: DA Dave Arnold, right, announced that Schirmer had been charged in the 1999 death of his first wife.

Two out of three Labour voters want to ditch party leader Ed Miliband in favour of his brother David, a poll revealed last night. The news comes as Mr Miliband today tries to regain Labour’s economic credibility at the party’s annual conference after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls vowed to review every item of public expenditure if Labour wins the next election. But the new poll showed that just one in four voters believes Mr Miliband is the right man to revive economic prospects, that 67 per cent of all voters think his party ‘chose the wrong brother’, and that 65 per cent of Labour voters say David Miliband would do a better job. Compared: 65 per cent of Labour voters say David Miliband (left) would do a better job than his brother Ed Miliband (right), who is the Labour party's leader . Ed Miliband’s unpopularity threatens to overshadow Labour’s economic relaunch, which is designed to show that the party is serious about tackling Britain’s debts. Mr Balls said yesterday: ‘The public want to know that we are going to be ruthless and disciplined in how we go about public spending. ‘It is quite right, and the public I think would expect this, to have a proper zero-based spending review where we say we have to justify every penny and make sure we are spending in the right way.’ But he said Labour would not reveal the  review results until a year after taking power and would protect budgets in areas such as health and development. As Tory officials revealed they will personally target Mr Miliband in the run up to the election, David Cameron said: ‘What Labour are basically saying is, “Elect us to government and then we will have a spending review”.’ The Prime Minister added: ‘It’s the most unbelievably irresponsible thing. They have learnt absolutely nothing over these last few years. They have opposed every single cut. They are effectively saying, “We messed up the economy, we got you into debt, let us back into power and we will think about it”. It is an absurd notion.’ Brotherly love: Former foreign secretary David Miliband (right) is embraced by his brother, party leader Ed Miliband (left), in Manchester in September 2010 . The Populus poll of 2,036 voters, commissioned by the Tories, supports this, with 64 per cent agreeing that ‘Labour’s only idea for the economy is more borrowing and more spending, which is one of the ways we got into this mess in the first place’. Ed Miliband’s mobile phone was taken away by his aides after it emerged he had exchanged private text messages with Vince Cable. The Labour leader admitted what happened after he was challenged over his conversations with the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary. Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner and former London mayor Ken Livingstone are reported to have quizzed him during a recent pre-conference meeting of the party’s ruling NEC. Mr Miliband responded by saying his mobile had been taken away over the summer and replaced by another whose number is known only to a select few. Some 63 per cent agree that ‘Labour just oppose everything the Government is doing to deal with the deficit and turn the country around, but never put forward any policies of their own’. But Mr Miliband will today describe the downturn as an ‘economic emergency’ that will only be tackled by the sort of national effort that took place in the years after the Second World War. At Labour’s conference in Manchester, he will say: ‘For millions of families, the prospects feel bleaker now than for 50 years, since the Second World War. ‘And we will need the same spirit to overcome this crisis as Britain showed then and in our gravest moments through history: The same spirit, the same determination, the same sense of national mission. ‘Whoever wins the next election will be faced with a huge deficit. We will not be able to reverse all the cuts.’ His side: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured yesterday in Brazil, said Labour are stating: 'Elect us to government and then we will have a spending review' But he will spell out plans to prioritise public spending that favours the less well-off, saying: ‘We will take decisions about priorities like putting jobs ahead of pay rises. Don’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same. Because our decisions will be different. We would always put the interests of millions of working people ahead of tax cuts for millionaires.’ 'Don’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same. Because our decisions will be different' Ed Miliband (will say today) But 73 per cent of people, including almost half of Labour voters (46 per cent) said he ‘just doesn’t have what it takes to be prime minister’. More than six in ten floating voters said they would be more likely to back Labour if it ditched him in favour of a ‘stronger’ leader. Only 17 per cent of voters see Mr Miliband as a natural leader and just 18 per cent consider him to be charismatic. A senior Tory source said: ‘These findings show Ed Miliband faces serious questions over his leadership. He has a lot of work to do to persuade people he has got what it takes to be prime minister.’","Ed is trying to regain Labour's economic credibility .

They range from the mystery of dark matter, which makes up 73% of everything but has never been identified, to questions over why our Sun is so hot. Formulated by the prestigious journal Science, have all been raised by the leading scientists in their field, each of whom also wrote an essay on the topic. Most scientists agree that around three-quarters of the universe is missing - in the form of dark matter and dark energy, neither of which we have ever directly detected. This 3D 'map' of dark matter is basically a guess . An image of the sun taken by Nasa's orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory - but scientists still don't understand why the sun's corona is so hot . However, is some cases even the scientists admit some mysteries are unlikely to ever be solved. ‘Each mystery is sure to be solved largely through astronomical . observations—if it is solved: In at least one case, experts aren't sure . that a seemingly simple question will ever be answered,’ Robert Coontz . of the journal explained. The biggest mystery is that of dark matter, which scientists admit may never be solved. ‘Part of the mystery is that we have no clue whether we will be able to . ﬁnd an answer,’ says Simon White, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck . Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany . Huge parts of the history of the universe remain a complete mystery to us: For a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why . Dark Energy, which appears to make up 73% of everything that exists, and still it can’t be seen, or even measured. The energy is 'needed' to balance out the mathematics of the universe, but may not ever be able to be detected. Dark Matter, which is closely linked to Dark Energy, is the term used to . describe the ‘glue’ which holds everything in the universe together. However, Adrian Cho, who wrote Science’s essay on the subject, believes . that unlike dark energy, scientists stand a reasonably good chance of . one day actually detecting a particle of the stuff. Where are the missing baryons? Baryons are particles that make unormal  matter, but for some reason when adding up dark energy, dark . matter and then leaving the rest to baryons, researchers can’t come up . with a number that equals 100% - hence the mystery . Why do stars explode? Many of the processes of star formation and solar system formation are known - but researchers admit they still don’t really . understand what goes on in a star when it explodes, forming what is . known as a supernova. What re-ionized the universe? For a few hundred thousand years after the . Big Bang, electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why. What is the source of the most energetic cosmic rays? We’re bombarded . with them every day, yet researchers can’t agree on where they come . from. Our atmosphere shields us from most of the rays. Why is our solar system so odd? Did our solar system form the way it . did by following logical steps, or was it all just chaos and chance? Nobody really knows. Why is the sun's corona so hot? Those that study the sun still really don’t know. The corona is the furthest layer from the sun's core, but it's still incredibly hot - and the reasons for this strange 'layering' of our nearest star are still a mystery.","Eight mysteries chosen by Science magazine .

Met Office spokeswoman Helen Roberts said: 'We will see a real change between today and tomorrow. 'Tomorrow could be some quite persistent and heavy rain.' She said the Met Office had issued a yellow warning in the north west of the country ahead of further anticipated downpours. 'Because of what happened last week any more rain could cause some problems,' she said.

'Our books, in the most part, appeal to automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts. 'They are probably oriented to a male audience and I am not sure that Fifty Shades is the kind of thing they would enjoy, but that phenomenon is impacting general publishing budget.'

Google CEO Larry Page; The European Union's antitrust chief gave Google a 'last chance' of a few weeks to avoid formal charges for manipulating search results to promote Google services . Google has been given one month to change its advertising rules otherwise it will face court action in the EU. The giant Internet search-engine firm has been ordered by EU competition regulators to make the changes by July 2 to end ‘abuses’ of its market dominance. The company, which says it anticipates complaints of this kind due to its size and reach, risks being fined billions of pounds if it fails to comply with the orders. The search engine, which has more than 80 per cent of the global market share, is accused of promoting its own products and effectively locking out rival advertisers. The EU complaints add to similar concerns in the US and South Korea, where the company is also being investigated for allegedly abusing its near-monopoly position as an Internet search engine. A Google spokesperson told the . Telegraph: 'We operate in over 100 countries around the world, and the . Internet is disruptive by its nature. 'It's understandable that our . business should attract scrutiny and sometimes complaints in a few of . these countries. We are always happy to answer questions authorities may . have about our business.' The European Commission has written to the US giant highlighting four areas where ‘Google business practices may be considered as abuses of dominance’. If Google's solutions are not satisfactory, the EC will begin a formal investigation, which could lead to it imposing huge fines and its own measures. The announcement heralds the most significant transatlantic anti-competition row since Brussels went to war with Microsoft a decade ago. It will also embarrass the Tory Party which has forged close links with Google, as revealed by the Daily Mail last week. Research revealed that ministers, including David Cameron, had met executives an average of once a month since the election. Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has written to Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt demanding action. He said Google favours its own products in search results and ‘copies’ content from rivals without permission. It also stifles competitors with advertising deals with other websites and restricts them from moving their online campaigns to rival search engines, he added. The review of Google’s business practices started in 2010 after complaints from rivals. The commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of revenue, which could amount to billions of pounds. Google has agreed to look into the EC’s concerns, though it disputed its conclusions. A spokesman said competition on the web has increased ‘dramatically’ and the company faces ‘tremendous’ pressures. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched a similar investigation into claims of anti-competitive practices by Google. Complaints: Google is under EU spotlight over its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones . Even if Google, the world's most popular search engine, offers concessions, it will still be under the EU spotlight after fresh complaints about its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones. If remedies were offered by Google within the coming weeks, the antitrust investigation could be brought to a close. ‘I believe that these fast-moving markets would particularly benefit from a quick resolution of the competition issues identified. Restoring competition swiftly to the benefit of users at an early stage is always better than lengthy proceedings,’ Almunia told a news briefing. ‘Google has repeatedly expressed to me its willingness to discuss any concerns that the Commission might have without having to engage in adversarial proceedings. 'This is why today I'm giving Google an opportunity to offer remedies to address concerns that we have identified,’ he said. Almunia said he had sent a letter to Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, with a deadline for a response. ‘In this letter, I offer Google the possibility to come up in a matter of weeks with first proposals of remedies to address each of these points,’ he said. The European Commission launched an investigation into Google in November 2010 after competitors, including Microsoft, accused the company of manipulating search results to promote its own advertising services while demoting those of rivals . Competitors complain that Google's search results unfairly prioritise its own advertising services. Google controls nearly 44% of the global internet advertising market. The Trade Commission is also looking into allegations that Google distorts its search results to steer people to its related businesses, like Google Places. The agency recently hired a big name litigator, Beth Wilkinson, to lead its probe. The Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams. The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe. The FTC is expected to come to a decision this summer on whether Google broke the law. Google is also the leader in U.S. searches, at 66 percent, according to comScore. Almunia is offering Google a last chance before issuing formal charges, said David Wood, a lawyer for lobbying group ICOMP, whose members include Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online mapping company Hotmaps, all three complainants in the EU case. ‘This is effectively the Commission demanding remedies. Failing that there will be a statement of objections,’ he said. If Google can come up with remedies that the Commission finds acceptable following a market test, the Commission could then end the 18-month-long investigation without fining the company, Almunia said. The Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams. The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe. Almunia said other investigations into Google unrelated to the antitrust issue would continue. ‘We continue the investigations on other issues, on other complaints we received recently, for instance all those complaints referring to Android or some complaints referring for instance to the way travel agencies are dealt by the Google search engine,’ he said. He declined to provide details on the Android investigation. Android-equipped smartphones compete with Apple's iPhone and other systems. The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global revenue for breaching EU rules and has in the past handed down multimillion-euro fines to Microsoft and Intel, among others. In Washington, two lawmakers who specialize in antitrust urged Google to reach a settlement with European regulators. Senators Herb Kohl and Mike Lee, who are respectively the Democratic chairman and top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said they were ‘hopeful that Google would be a willing partner with the EU's Competition Commissioner. ‘We continue to urge the FTC to investigate (Google) and to ensure a competitive search market where consumers can fairly pick the winners and losers in our online economy,’ the lawmakers said. A Google spokesperson said: 'We've only just started to look through the Commission’s arguments. 'We disagree with the conclusions but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have. 'Competition on the web has increased dramatically in the last 2 years since the Commission started looking at this and the competitive pressures Google faces are tremendous. Innovation online has never been greater.'","EU can fine Google up to 10% of global revenue .

Ed Miliband’s new policy guru today spent more than 45 minutes railing against queue-jumping, the demise of the milkman and people who have adverts tattooed on their foreheads as he warned the Labour party there are some ‘public goods’ money cannot buy. In a speech-cum-seminar hailed as ‘brilliant’ by the Labour leader, Harvard professor Michael Sandel asked delegates if they had ever tried to hire a friend, buy a best man’s speech for a wedding or pay a child to write thank you notes. Blairite commentator Dan Hodges tweeted: ‘An afternoon with Michael Sandel is the most self-indulgent thing I've ever seen at a major party conference.’ 'Self-indulgent': Harvard professor Michael Sandel told the Labour conference there was more to life than what money could buy . During the main event on the opening day of the Labour conference in Manchester, the US political philosopher also questioned the morality of paying someone for sex, to donate a kidney or to persuade them to go on a diet. Mr Sandel also appeared to suggest it was wrong for wealthy parents to send their children to private schools. But after attacking the worst excesses of capitalism, it was announced Mr Sandel was available to sell signed copies of his new book, What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets. Mr Miliband seemed hugely impressed, slapping Mr Sandel on the back at the end of his performance, and telling him: ‘We have never had anything like that before. Brilliant. Brilliant.’ Money can't buy friends: Labour leader Ed Miliband hailed Mr Sandel's speech as 'brilliant' In a rambling lecture, Mr Sandel prowled the stage and challenged Labour delegates in the sparsely-attended conference hall to wrestle with big moral questions. ‘In more and more domains of life it is possible to pay extra and jump the queue,’ he complained. ‘Increasingly it is possible now to hire someone to stand in a queue for you. This is a familiar practice for rock concerts, theatre, sporting events.’ He also pointed to the phenomenon of people who had the names of companies tattooed on their forehead as walking billboards, only for the firms to go bust. ‘A market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale,’ he said. Mr Sandel complained that there was now nothing which was not for sale, including people's foreheads which were bought up as advertising space by internet firms . In Iraq and Afghanistan there were more paid military contractors on the ground than there were US military troops. ‘This doesn’t happen because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies. It just happened.’ But he insisted: ‘There are still today some things that money cannot buy. One such thing is friendship. ‘If you don’t have as many friends as you would like it might occur to you to try to buy some. ‘But you would quickly realise it might not work. Why not? Somehow the money that would buy the friend would dissolve the good you are feeling. ‘A hired friend is not the same as a real one.’ He then turned to wedding speeches, and websites which help people to write a toast by supplying information about the happy couple. Mr Sandel denounced the idea: ‘The financial transaction to some degree erodes the expression.’ In a debate on the impact of supermarkets squeezing out small shops and farmers, one delegate said she paid for a milkman even though it cost more . Despite the economic pressures on most hard-pressed families, he even appeared to encourage them to spend more on their weekly shopping to sustain their local grocer. ‘Some worry that supermarkets dominate high streets in towns across Britain, what will become of the small local shops, the local grocer? ‘Will they be crowded out? Will big box stores decimate the high street trade? What about suppliers, farmers who are squeezed in the prices they get for their milk by big supermarket chains?’ Mr Sandel said it was important that people from different walks of life 'bump up against each other' One delegate was applauded after saying she got her milk delivered by a milkman, even though it was more expensive. After a brief discussion on the merits of banning advertising for children, which took in promotional campaigns for climbing trees and sugary breakfast cereal, Mr Sandel then questioned whether it was acceptable to use public money to persuade people to stop smoking, lose weight or taking their medication. ‘When should you use questionable motives to get people to do good things?’ He went on: ‘If someone is willing to pay for sex or to buy a kidney and a consenting adult is willing to sell, the only question standard economics is willing to ask is: how much? ‘It has drained our public discourse of moral and civil energy and contributed to the technocratic politics.' He said wealthy people and those on modest means coming to lead increasingly separate lives. ‘We live and work and shop and play in different places, our children go to different schools. ‘This is not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfactory way to live even for those of us who may end up on the top. ‘Democracy doesn't require perfect equality but it does require that citizens share a common life. ‘It is important that people from different walks of life bump up against each other. ‘Do you want a society where everything is up for sale or are there certain moral and civil goods that markets don’t offer and money cannot buy?’","Harvard professor Michael Sandel asks Labour conference: 'Is it wrong to pay a child to write thank you notes?'

City officials in San Francisco are to ban local government agencies from buying new Apple computers after the tech giant pulled out of a green certification scheme. Apple last week announced it is withdrawing from a rating system used by governments and universities to assess how environmentally-friendly computers are. The EPEAT - Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool - scheme identifies which electronic devices have the most impact on the environment. An Apple logo adorns the side of San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center For The Arts for the March launch of the iPad 3. City officials are to ban employees from buying new Apple computers after the tech giant pulled out of the EPEAT scheme . The city of San Francisco has now responded by announcing it will no longer be buying Apple Mac devices for its 28,000 employees as it only purchase computers listed on the EPEAT registry. The move is designed to encourage Apple to reconsider its decision to leave the scheme. Jon Walton, San Francisco's chief information officer, said: 'San Francisco has reached out to Apple and is hopeful that a solution to this challenge can be found in the future.' It is an embarrassing situation for the computer giant -  its headquarters are based just 40miles south of San Francisco in Cupertino and all its product launches take place in the northern California city, which is also home to many Apple staff. An Apple spokesman revealed the company has no plans to backtrack on its decision, but did not reveal why it had pulled out in the first place. Kristin Huguet said: 'Apple takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products meet the strictest energy efficiency standards backed by the U.S. government. 'We also lead the industry by reporting each product's greenhouse gas emissions on our website, and Apple products are superior in other important environmental areas not measured by EPEAT, such as removal of toxic materials.' Taking a stand: The move by San Francisco City Hall (pictured) is designed to encourage Apple to reconsider its decision to leave the scheme . San Francisco officials spent a relatively meagre $45,579 (£29,293) on Apple products in 2010 - a tiny amount when compared to the tech firm's $65billion (£42billion) earnings that year. The new ban does not apply to Apple's iPad or iPhone as the products do not fall under the EPEAT scheme's remit. Ninety-five per cent of electronic devices bought by government agencies in the U.S.  must be certified under the EPEAT registry. A spokesman for EPEAT said last week: 'We regret that Apple will no longer be registering its products in EPEAT. We hope that they will decide to do so again at some point in future.' Apple's decision could result in an updated environmental measurement system, as EPEAT is several years old.","Apple announces it is withdrawing from a rating system used by governments and universities to assess how environmentally-friendly computers are .

The space agency Nasa has put multi-billion observatories into orbit to study the stars - but its latest space telesope may be a little more budget-friendly. Nasa scientist Maxim Markevitch and his team aim to build an X-Ray telescope based on rolls of plastic tape - inspired, Markevitch says, by Scotch tape. ‘I remember looking at a roll of Scotch tape and thinking, 'was it possible to use the same design for capturing hard X-rays,' said Markevitch. ‘I talked with a few people, and to my surprise, they didn't see any principal reasons why it couldn't be done.’ Stuck together with Sellotape? Maxim Markevitch claims that a telescope made of sticky tape could be a viable new way to look for X-Rays from the distant galaxy . Markevitch and a team of X-ray optics . experts at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, have begun . investigating the feasibility of fashioning a low-cost mirror from . plastic tape and tightly rolling it like the sticky adhesive commonly . found in most homes and offices. ‘Maxim's Scotch tape idea is in an . early stage,’ Zhang said. ‘In the next year, we will know whether it has . a chance of working.’ If it does, it could prove . ‘game-changing for hard X-ray astronomy,’ Markevitch said. ‘It could . significantly reduce the cost of building large mirrors, bringing within . reach the possibility of building a mirror with 10 to 30 times greater . effective area than current X-ray telescopes.’ With funding from NASA's Center Innovation Fund, the team now is pursuing Markevitch's ‘early-stage’ idea and has already begun testing candidate materials that could be fashioned into a rolled mirror capable of collecting X-rays — in itself a challenging proposition. To capture these ever-elusive photons, the mirrors must be curved and nested inside a cylindrical optical assembly. The rounded geometry allows the high-energy light to graze their surfaces, much like a stone skimming the surface of a pond. X-Ray universe: Over the past few decades, NASA has launched several X-ray observatories sensitive to lower-energy ¿soft X-rays,¿ including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which took this picture . ¿I remember looking at a roll of Scotch tape and thinking, 'was it possible to use the same design for capturing hard X-rays,' said Markevitch . Over the past few decades, NASA has launched several X-ray observatories sensitive to lower-energy ‘soft X-rays,’ including the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They discovered and imaged the faint, diffuse X-ray signal from a variety of astrophysical sources dominated by thermal emission, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Other missions, like NASA's Swift satellite, were sensitive to higher-energy gamma rays, but they lacked imaging capabilities. ‘There remains a large and totally unexplored discovery space of faint, diffuse nonthermal astrophysical objects emitting at high X-ray energies,’ Markevitch said. One class of objects waiting to be better understood is cosmic rays — highly energetic subatomic particles generated in deep space — that reside in galaxy clusters and other large-scale structure in the universe. Scientists believe that cosmic rays and the magnetic fields between galaxy clusters can alter the physics within galaxy clusters. A better understanding of these physics could reveal more about the birth and evolution of the cosmos, Markevitch said. To study cosmic rays, however, observatories would have to be tuned to hard X-rays. Although NASA's recently launched Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and Japan's New X-ray Telescope, also known as Astro-H, are sensitive to hard X-rays, Markevitch said they only ‘will graze the surface of this discovery space. ’Because the signal is so faint, only an imaging X-ray telescope with a collecting area 30 times larger than that of NuSTAR, working with current and future radio telescopes, could do the job, Markevitch said. ‘However, to our knowledge, nothing of the kind is planned or even proposed in the U.S. or elsewhere because of the cost something like this presents,’ he said. The only solution then is developing a new technology that would dramatically reduce the cost of building X-ray optics and increase the size of the light-collecting area. ‘If we can build a mirror that's big enough, this might be the way to go,’ he said.","New X-Ray telescope built from rolls of plastic tape .

An ancient skull unearthed in Laos has reset the clock of human migration to southern Asia back 20,000 years. The skull, found in a cave in the Annamite mountains, has been dated to between 46,000 and 63,000 years old - and appears to be the remains of an anatomically modern human being. The discovery suggests that the first modern humans to leave Africa spread around the world much earlier than was previously thought. Skull from the mists of time: The researchers studied the fragments, including recognisable teeth and cranium, which date to 63,000 years ago . Laos, with a population of just under seven million, is bordered by Burma and China to the north, Vietnam to the east, Thailand to the west and Cambodia to the south. Lead scientist Dr Laura Shackelford, from the University of Illinois in the US, said: 'It's a particularly old modern human fossil and it's also a particularly old modern human for that region. 'There are other modern human fossils in China or in island south-east Asia that may be around the same age, but they either are not well dated or they do not show definitively modern human features. 'Given its age, fossils in this vicinity could be direct ancestors of the first migrants to Australia. 'This skull is very well dated and shows very conclusive modern human features.' The fossil, discovered in 2009, is described today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Shackelford said it showed that early modern humans migrating out of Africa did not simply follow the coast to the islands of south-east Asia and Australia, as some experts believe. They also travelled northwards into very different types of terrain. The River Mekong in Luang Prabang, Laos: A human skull found in the Annamite Mountains appears to be the earliest 'modern' skull discovered . Experts believe the ancestors of people alive today either evolved in Africa and then colonised the world, or evolved in different locations across the globe. Most support the 'out-of-Africa' theory. 'This find supports the 'out-of-Africa' theory of modern human origins rather than a multi-regionalism model,' said Dr Shackelford. She added that the find supported genetic studies suggesting that modern humans occupied the region at least 60,000 years ago. Geochronologist Kira Westaway, from the Macquarie University in Sydney, who helped study the skull, said: 'We're looking at fully modern people with no archaic traits at all - that's what's so exciting.' Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang which existed from the 14th to the 18th century when it split into three separate kingdoms.","Skull found in cave in Annamite mountains, Laos, dates from 46,000 and 63,000 years ago .

HIV under an EM microscope: A cure for AIDS has got a step closer after scientists found that a common cancer drug can purge the disease as it lies dormant in the body . A cure for AIDS has got a step closer after scientists found that a common cancer drug can purge the disease as it lies dormant in the body. Current treatments are effective at reducing levels of the disease in the bloodstream - but a drug that can 'knock out' the disease when it lies dormant is thought to be key to a cure. Tests on eight HIV-positive men found that the drug was highly effective in 'unmasking' the hidden reservoirs in the body - which the researchers say is a vital step towards eradicating HIV from the body. ‘This work provides compelling evidence . for a new strategy to directly attack and eradicate latent HIV . infection,’ said David Margolis at the University of North Carolina at . Chapel Hill. ‘Long-term, widespread use of . antiretrovirals has personal and public health consequences, including . side effects, financial costs, and community resistance,’ said Margolis, . who led the study. ‘We must seek other ways to end the epidemic, and . this research provides new hope for a strategy to eradicate HIV . completely from the body.’ The existence of persistent . reservoirs of dormant HIV in the immune system that are not attacked by . anti-AIDS drugs is believed to be a major reason why infection reemerges . once patients stop taking their medication. The disruption and clearance of these reservoirs is critical to finding a cure for AIDS. Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have published pioneering research showing that a drug used to treat certain types of lymphoma was able to dislodge hidden virus in patients receiving treatment for HIV. Researchers at UNC, working in collaboration with scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health, National Cancer Institute, Merck, and the University of California at San Diego, undertook a series of experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the drug vorinostat, a deacetylase inhibitor that is used to treat some types of lymphoma, to activate and disrupt the dormant virus. Initially, laboratory experiments measuring active HIV levels in CD4+ T cells, which are specialized white blood cells that the virus uses to replicate, showed that vorinostat unmasked the hidden virus in these cells. Subsequently, vorinostat was administered to eight HIV-infected men who were medically stable on antiretroviral therapy and the levels of active HIV virus were measured and compared to the levels prior to administration. Those patients receiving vorinostat showed an average 4.5-fold increase in the levels of HIV RNA in CD4+ T cells, evidence that the virus was being unmasked. This is the first published study to show the potential for deacetylase inhibitors to attack latency within dormant virus pools in a translational clinical study. Targeting latency is the first step on a path that may lead to a cure.","Vorinostat 'unmasks' reservoirs of disease in patients .

The U.S. military's first hybrid airship took off on its maiden voyage last week, hovering above New Jersey in a successful test flight. The Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV), a hybrid blimp that has been in development for years, took off on August 7 - and stayed in flight for about 90 minutes. The vehicle is largely based on the Sky Cat, an advanced airship design refined over decades by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd (HAV). Airtime: The LEMV hovered in the sky above Lakehurst, New Jersey, for about 90 minutes on August 7 . While it gets its lift from the . lighter-than-air helium, multiple engines on board sustain flight and . allow it to move while gathering information from the ground. The helium-filled aircraft was conceived by a team of British and U.S. engineers with the goal of benefitting troops on the ground with valuable surveillance information. Based at Cardington in Bedfordshire, HAV is a specialist in hybrid air vehicles, which fly using a combination of aerostatic and aerodynamic lift. The team at Hybrid Air Vehicles has re-examined the basic principles behind Lighter-Than-Air Science and applied modern technology and materials to this 100 year old concept. The construction of the LEMV was a joint project between HAV and US defence firm Northrop Grummon. The radical reimagining of an airship has four propulsion units, and can be piloted into remote areas. 'Some ten years ago we built a 50 foot prototype and at some stage demonstrated this to a delegation of the US Department of Defence,' said HAV's  Business Development Director Hardy Giesler. 'They were impressed and a few years later released a request for a long endurance surveillance vehicle, the requirements of which we are able to meet. 'Since surveillance programmes consist of multiple parts (vehicle as platform, a selection of sensors to provide the data and an ongoing service provision to manage & maintain the vehicle, as well as turn data into intelligence) we decided to team with Northrop Grumman.' The design can land on almost any surface - even snow capped mountains. The major new aircraft was built in just over 24 months since contract signature. Giesler told MailOnline that 80 per cent of the total cost of the vehicle was sourced in the UK. 'That is something Hybrid Air Vehicles is very proud of,' he added. The LEMV, which looks like a football but is as large as a football field, isn't your grandfather's military airship. The aircraft boasts a ton of high-tech gear to compliment the massive helium filled blimp, including sensors to beam information to troops on the ground, and to move heavy equipment. The airship is based on a design that could eventually be used around the world as a freight and passenger . It also has endurance, and can stay afloat above a battlefield or insurgent hotspot for up to 21 days - at a fraction of the cost of other military options. In a statement, the U.S. Army said the LEMV 'is intended to be used to conduct long-term intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or ISR, and persistent stare-type missions, and can also be used as a communications relay.' Developed by: Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and Northrop Grummon . Top altitude: About 22,000 feet . Flight sustainability: Up to 21 days . Speed: About 92 miles per hour . The LEMV, which took off from New Jersey’s Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst base, was piloted for the test flight, but has the ability to function as an unmanned vehicle. It can float at an altitude of about 22,000 feet, and can travel at about 92 mph. The LEMV’s strong skin - a blend of Vectran, Kevlar and Mylar - can endure a reasonable amount of small arms fire from enemies on the ground. The construction of the LEMV was a joint project by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and U.S. defence firm Northrop Grummon. Lakehurst, where the LEMV took flight, is no stranger to airships. The base is also the site where the Hindenburg crashed in 1937. The Army says it will conduct more flights after the craft undergoes an inspection. Historic: Lakehurst, where the LEMV took flight, is no stranger to airships.

Huge magnetic tornadoes over 1,000 miles wide are heating the layer above the surface of the sun to millions of degrees centigrade. The scientists hope that the magnetic . tornadoes, which channel heat from the sun into a searing layer above . its surface, could form the basis of clean reactors on Earth. The super tornadoes - which are thousands of times larger and more powerful than their earthly counterparts and have a magnetic skeleton - spin at speeds of more than 6,000 mph at temperatures in millions of centigrade in the Sun's atmosphere. The discovery could help explain why the 'atmosphere' around the sun is hotter than its surface - a puzzle that has mystified scientists. Telescope images form a tower showing how 'solar tornadoes' work: The super tornadoes spin at speeds of more than 6,000 mph at temperatures in millions of centigrade in the Sun's atmosphere . A Swedish radio telescope captures a 'cross section' of one of the swirling, 1000-mile-wide structures . They are more than 1,000 miles wide – hundreds of miles longer than the total distance between Land's End to John O'Groats. It is estimated that there are as many as 11,000 of these swirling events above the Sun's surface at any time. Sheffield researchers say the solar tornadoes carry the energy from the energy reservoir below the Sun's surface, called the convection zone, to the outer atmosphere in the form of magnetic waves. Professor Robertus Erdélyi of the University of Sheffield, said: ‘If we understand how nature heats up magnetised plasmas, like in the tornadoes observed in the Sun, one day we may be able to use this process to develop the necessary technology and build devices on Earth that produce free, clean, green energy. 'Because of our collaborative research it looks an essential leap forward is made towards unveiling the secrets about a great and exciting problem in plasma-astrophysics and we are getting closer and closer to find a solution. ‘We report here the discovery of ubiquitous magnetic solar tornadoes and their signature in the hottest areas of the Sun's atmosphere where the temperature is a few millions of degree kelvin, about thousands of kilometres from the Sun's surface. This is a major step in the field.’ Sheffield researchers say the solar tornadoes carry the energy from the energy reservoir below the Sun's surface, called the convection zone, to the outer atmosphere in the form of magnetic waves . The tornadoes could help unravel the mystery of why the area above the sun's surface is hotter than the surface itself . The space tornadoes are very magnetic and they operate in plasma. Plasma is the forth known state of matter, beside solid, liquid and gas and makes around 99 per cent of the known matter of the Universe. The tornados act in a similar way to water does if you take the plug out of a full bath. Professor Robertus Erdélyi said: ‘One of the major problems in modern astrophysics is why the atmosphere of a star, like our own Sun, is considerably hotter than its surface? Imagine, that you climb a mountain, e.g. a hill in the Scottish highlands, and it becomes hotter as you go higher and higher. Many scientists are researching how to ‘heat’ the atmosphere above the surface of the Sun, or any other star. ‘It is understood that the energy originates from below the Sun's surface, but how this massive amount of energy travels up to the solar atmosphere surrounding it is a mystery. 'We believe we have found evidence in the form of rotating magnetic structures - solar tornadoes - that channel the necessary energy in the form of magnetic waves to heat the magnetised solar plasma. It is hoped that the process could be replicated here on Earth one day to energise plasma in tokamak that are believed to be a future device to produce completely clean energy.’ Scientists viewed the solar tornadoes in the outer atmosphere of the Sun, stretching thousands of miles from the giant star's surface by using both satellite and ground-based telescopes. They then created 3D-layered seqence of images of the tornadoes and simulated their evolution with state-of-the-art numerical codes using the magnetic imprints detected by their high-resolution, cutting-edge telescopes.","Find key to mystery of why atmosphere above sun is hotter than its surface .

Last week, Samsung was beaten in the courts by Apple, and told to pay $1billion to its arch-rival after jurors agreed the tech giant had copied the iPhone design. But Samsung is now ready to fight back, unveiling a raft of new products for Android and Windows 8 yesterday that cannot be charged with Apple's criticism that Samsung is not innovating. First up is a brand new tablet that aims to give the iPad a run for its money, boasting a 10.1-inch screen, the latest version of Android, and a design style that keeps away from Apple's iconic look. Apple's complaint that Samsung should innovate more seems to have worked - with Samsung's tablet boasting a re-invention of the stylus. What was originally a bulky accessory for early pre-iPhone smartphones is now a slinky pen with a fine tip, that can be used to write naturally on the tablet's surface, giving Samsung a distinctive edge in the market. Time to take on the iPad: Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet - an Android-running tablet that has received warm reviews . However the true innovating device at Samsung's launch event at the IFA conference in Berlin was the Samsung . Galaxy Camera, in many ways a traditional high-end point-and-shooter . taking 16-mexapixel images through a 21x . optical zoom lens. But turn the WiFi-enabled camera around, and the user is presented with a . 4.8"" screen running Android - allowing you to install apps, play games, watch movies, instantly . upload images to Facebook, or perhaps install . the Instagram app to convert your images into old-timey . snapshots. As you have the full gamut of Android . apps to play with, you could edit your images on the fly, install . programs like LapseIt to create time-lapse images, or use Samsung's . in-house apps like Movie Wizard to edit your videos. Or - when there are no decent snaps to . take - you could simply play games such as Angry Birds, read e-books and . magazine, watch films, or use Google Maps to find your next . destination. The camera-phone, reborn: Samsung fights back with innovative products, such as the Samsung Galaxy Camera, which debuted in Berlin yesterday . The Samsung Galaxy Camera looks like a true camera from the front, but is effectively a phone when you look at the back . Return of the camera-phone: The large screen helps provide a good preview of your images . It's not the first of the new breed of 'camera-phone' - Nikon announced a similar device two weeks ago, but Samsung's pedigree in mobile is likely to establish this as a credible new type of device. Games, maps, apps and web: Flip it over and you have the full Android experience . Robert King, UK vice president of consumer electronics, said: 'In this new era of visual communication the Samsung’s Galaxy Camera marks a breakthrough in convergence technology, combining the leading edge design of our Galaxy mobile products with high performance photographic capability.' While the phone also has a SIM card slot . to allow you to upload images on the go, there are no signs yet that . Samsung is adding phone-functionality to this camera just yet. If the Galaxy Camera is attempting to break the boundaries between phone and camera, the Galaxy Note 2 is breaking similar ground between phone and tablet. The Note 2 is effectively the big brother to this year's flagship Samsung S3 phone, bringing with it a quad-core phone running the latest version of Android, which for the first time brings Google's software up to the same silky smoothness of Apple's iPhone. But that's almost besides the point, for the first thing you will notice about the Note is its screen - a pocket-stretching 5.5"" screen which, once held, makes every other phone feel miniature by comparison. It's big, it's bold and it can be both a phone and a tablet at the same time: The Samsung Galaxy Note II has been launched . The phone that thinks it's a tablet: Samsung Vice President presents the new Galaxy Note II in Berlin . Bigger than your usual: The Samsung Note II is the big brother to the S3, and the successor to last year's Note . Last year's original Note was a surprise success, selling 10 million units for a device which will not be to everyone's taste. The high-definition 16:9 screen is complemented by the S-Pen - a digital stylus allowing you to scribble away on the phone-screen like it was a notepad. In the pre-iPhone days, many . smartphones came with a stylus, but Samsung has redeveloped the . technology, replacing the old blocky stub of a tip with a pen-like thin . tip which helps create a natural writing feeling. The extra-large screen also enables . the luxury of running multiple apps at the same time on the Note 2, . similar to how you can have multiple windows open at the same time on a . PC. For instance you can browse the web while having a pop-up video playing running a movie or TV program at the same time. The Note 2 will be released in October and available in white and 'titanium blue'. Samsung also launched a new range . called 'Ativ' - devices which are based on the upcoming Windows 8 and . Windows Phone 8 platforms. Samsung has dipped its toe before into Windows software, delivering the Windows Phone 7 Focus phone last year, before concentrating on its Android offering. This time, it unveiled the Ativ S, a 1.5GHz dual-core processor with a 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display, all ready to go when Windows Phone 8 is officially launched later this year. The Windows 8 family: Samsung also launched a new smartphone, a tablet PC and a 'smart PC' The Samsung ATIV S smartphone was unveiled yesterday . Windows Phone has had a good reception from critics, but has had slow sales, not helped by a much-delayed launch which helped Android and Apple take the lion's share of the market. Still, with the Windows 8 desktop system launching this year, this will probably bring renewed attention to the mobile offering. Co-existing with the phone are two . breeds of laptop/tablet combinations, both running the new operating . system, which has been optimised for touch operations. The . 11.6-inch Samsung Ativ Smart PC, and the higher-specced Ativ Smart PC Pro, both run on Windows 8, powered by Intel. Each features a detachable keyboard-docking system that allows . users to easily switch between a clamshell notebook PC and a tablet PC . form factor.

Seattle-based Amazon launched the $199 tablet last November. It was the first Kindle with a color screen and the ability to run third-party applications, placing it in competition with Apple Inc.'s iPad, at half the price of the cheapest iPad. Amazon doesn't say how many Fires it has sold, but says it captured 22 percent of U.S. tablet sales over nine months. That would make it the second-most popular tablet, after the iPad. Based on iPad sales reported by Apple, Fire sales can be estimated at somewhere around 5 million units. Sales: Amazon doesn't say how many Fires it has sold, but says it captured 22 percent of U.S. tablet sales over nine months. That would make it the second-most popular tablet, after the iPad . Separately, ABI Research said today that sales of dedicated e-readers, like the non-Fire, black-and-white Kindles, peaked last year. It expects worldwide sales of e-readers at 11 million in 2012, down from 15 million in 2011. The research firm expects tablets to outsell e-readers nine to one this year, despite costing four or five time as much. Still, e-readers won't go away completely, ABI analyst Joshua Flood said. 'We believe there will always be a niche market for the dedicated reading device for voracious readers, business travelers, and educational segments, particularly ones that are low-priced,' Flood said. Amazon could update the rest of its Kindle line at next week's event, too. The current models were launched a year ago. In the intervening time, competitor Barnes & Noble Inc. has launched a Nook e-reader with a built-in screen illuminator for reading in the dark. Amazon itself was the main outlet for the Kindle Fire. However, Staples stores recently sold it for $179.","The internet retailer has a major press conference scheduled for next Thursday in Santa Monica .

The FBI has hit back at a hacktivist groups claims that it stole personal identification data on millions of Apple device owners from an FBI agent's laptop. FBI officials said the bureau never asked for and never possessed the database that the group, which calls itself AntiSec, is posting on a website. The group has released a link to a database of more than 1 million unique identification numbers for Apple devices, which could include iPhones and iPads. Have claim to have obtained more than 12 million ID codes Apple uses to identify its gadgets, along with user names and password. The FBI was today facing major questions over why it held the data. AntiSec had claimed the data is just a piece of the more than 12 million unique identification numbers and personal information on the device owners that it got from a laptop used by an FBI agent. However, today the FBI denied that it ever had that information. 'The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs (unique device IDs) was exposed,' an FBI spokesperson told CNN. 'At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.' Officials there said they could not verify the validity of the data that AntiSec released. Federal officials also warned that computer users should be careful when clicking on such links because they sometimes may contain malware that can infect computers. Joe Stewart, a security researcher with Atlanta-based Dell SecureWorks, said, however, that he tested the link and did not find any connection to malware. Apple also said it had not given the information to the FBI. 'The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization, Apple spokesperson Natalie Kerris told AllThingsD. Apple assigns unique device identification numbers (UDIDs) - a string of numbers and letters - to all of its devices. The numbers let iTunes and application developers know which device is running which apps. As an example, the numbers allow game developers to keep track of users' high scores. Besides the identification numbers, the information posted by AntiSec has the name that a person chooses to name their device and a description of whether the device is an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. If linked with other information such as a name or address, the numbers could be used as a way to get at other more sensitive data. But knowing the number doesn't enable the FBI to track or eavesdrop on people. In its posting, AntiSec said it got the file by hacking into the laptop of an agent who was on one of the bureau's cyber action teams. And it said part of the file's name on the laptop was ""NCFTA,"" referring to the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance. The NCFTA is a nonprofit group made up of experts from the public and private sectors to share information on cyber threats. In the Internet post, it said the FBI was ""using your device info for a tracking people project."" A group known as Anonymous and its offshoot Lulz Security have been linked to a number of high profile computer attacks and crimes, including many that were meant to embarrass governments, federal agencies and corporate giants. They have been connected to attacks that took data from FBI partner organization InfraGard and they've jammed websites of the CIA and the Public Broadcasting Service. Earlier this year, FBI agents arrested several hackers tied to the group, and in the process revealed that LulzSec's reputed leader, known as Sabu, was an FBI informant. Law enforcement officials said that linking the Apple data theft to an FBI agent may have been done, in part, as retribution for the arrests. The move comes as Apple is believed to be putting the finishing touches to a launch event for a new version of its iPhone . The Antisec group has made the files freely available online. 'There you have 1,000,001 Apple Devices UDIDs linking to their users and their APNS tokens,' it said. 'The original file contained around 12,000,000 devices. we decided a million would be enough to release. 'We trimmed out other personal data as, full names, cell numbers, addresses, zipcodes, etc. 'Not all devices have the same amount of personal data linked, some devices contained lot of info, others no more than zipcodes or almost anything. 'We left those main columns we consider enough to help a significant amount of users to look if their devices are listed there or not. the DevTokens are included for those mobile hackers who could figure out some use from the dataset.' The group also defended its decision to release the data. 'well we have learnt it seems quite clear nobody pays attention if you just come and say 'hey, FBI is using your device details and info. 'So without even being sure if the current choice will guarantee that peoplewill pay attention to this.'","Antisec group claimed to have over 12 million IDs taken from an FBI laptop .

The walking dead are everywhere. It's no surprise, then, that many modern-day zombie offerings lack that killer suspense...after all, we've all seen it all and played it all before, right? Wrong. Because that's where ZombiU comes in - a revolutionary first-person horror game built from the ground up to take full advantage of the Wii U's GamePad. London is plagued with zombies and survivors are few and far between. Your job is to stay alive for as long as possible. Dead good: the zombies are smart and will attack in packs if you're too noisy . And thanks to the GamePad controls, staying alive has never felt, well, more alive. It acts as a number of things. First and foremost it's your satchel. With a click of a button the game zooms out from first person and you use GamePad's screen to equip / use items. This works brilliantly as it forces you to take your eyes away from the main TV screen - giving you a sense of vulnerability never before experienced in games of this nature. Of course, zombies can still attack you while you check your supplies. The controller also acts as a lock pick and an infrared scanner. With the scanner, you can use the GamePad to scope out a room - any objects of interest appearing highlighted. What's scary is that if there is a ghost in the room (yes, there are ghosts, too) your scanner reading goes all fuzzy. One boss battle was so scary, in fact, that I had to stop playing - much to one of the developer's amusement. Another cool touch is that when you die, your character turns into a zombie and you take control of another survivor. If you run into your old character - you can kill it and get back all your ammo. This feature is set to play a big part in the game's online multiplayer component. Graphically, it's not a huge step up from current gen. There's a silkiness to the visuals that both Xbox and PS3 don't have, but textures and lighting seem very similar indeed. Barren land: You'll have to survive London, like you've never seen it before . Zombies look fantastic and charge at you unpredictably. They all look different, too. Which makes a change from the 'I just killed that guy...again! Why won't you die!' feeling so often associated with so many games of the genre. They're also very clever (for the undead, anyway). They will scramble over desks and burst through doors to get at you. Plus, their behaviour will be directly influenced by how you approach combat. Go in all-guns-blazing and it will attract more zombies to your location. With that in mind, there are some points where you'll just want to use melee weapons - an axe - for example, to take them down with minimum of noise. With games like this, there's always going to be a controversial twist. ZombiU's 'shock factor' is that one of the levels reportedly sees you killing the undead inside Buckingham Palace. So, is it looking like the title worth buying a Wii U for? A dead cert.

Amazon has introduced two new Fire tablets and a Kindle with built in light so owners can finally read in the dark. Boss Jeff Bezos unveiled the devices at an event in Santa Monica, claiming the firm 'loved to pioneer'. The retail giant has set its sight firmly on Apple with the the Fire tablets. One has a 7inch screen, the same as the much rumoured iPad mini, while a new Fire HD has an 8.9inch screen. The costliest, 4G-ready version will go for $499 in the US, while a Wi-Fi version is £159 ($299) in both the UK and US. The Kindle Fire HD, an 8.9inch screen tablet Amazon hopes will take on the iPad . The cheapest, 7-inch version of the Fire, which launched in November and . is now the No. 2-selling tablet in the United States, behind Apple's . iPad, will sell for $159. However, the firm did not say if the tablets we be made available internationally. Bezos on Thursday stressed that Amazon saw the Kindle family of . e-readers and tablets as a service, with hardware a critical element of . its digital content business. Amazon is competing with Apple, Google Inc and other technology . companies for a foothold in the booming mobile-device market, because . these devices are fast becoming the preferred tool to access consumer . media over the Internet. As the world's largest Internet retailer, it is . essential for Amazon to have a major presence in this new sector. Amazon is willing to make little or no money selling cheap tablets and . e-readers because it wants to get the devices into as many hands as . possible, then sell higher-margin digital content, such as e-books, . video, games, apps and music, to a more connected and engaged customer . base. However, it is believed the gadgets will show users adverts every time they are used. The company also showed off a ""paperwhite"" e-reader with a much sharper screen and longer battery life. Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Amazon, holds the new Kindle Fire HD . Boss Jeff Bezos said 'We love to invent, we love to pioneer. 'We even love going down alleys that turnout to be blind alleys - but every once in a while those alleys turn into broad avenues.' The firm first revealed the Kindle paperwhite, which has a new lighted screen. Bezos told the crowd the display they wanted didn’t exist, so they spent four years developing it. 'People are going to love the light so much they’ll leave it on all the time,' he said. The firm also revealed a new Kindle Fire HD tablet, which features a 8.9-inch 1920x1200, 254ppi display. It has a laminated touch sensor for better visuals and 25% less glare. The tablet is powered by an OMAP 4470 processor from Texas Instruments, which Amazon says outperforms the Tegra 3. The Kindle Fire HD also includes stereo speakers, an upgrade over the Kindle Fire's mono speaker. It also has an 'x-ray' feature which lets people find out an actor's name simply by tapping on them on screen, and multiple user accounts so children can easily use it without ruining their parent's setting. The Fire will be an effort to take a larger share of a tablet computer market dominated by Apple's iPad. It could help Amazon boost sales of digital goods such as e-books and movies. The event came a day after Nokia Corp. and Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility division announced five new smartphones between them. The two from Nokia will be the company's first to run the next version of Windows. Consumer electronics makers are trying to generate interest in their products now, before Apple announces a new iPhone and possibly a mini iPad next week. 'Kindle Fire HD is the world’s most-advanced 7” tablet, with a stunning customised HD display, the fastest Wi-Fi, exclusive Dolby audio, powerful processor and graphics engine, 11 hours of battery life, and 16 GB of storage for all your HD content,' said Bezos . 'Not only does Kindle Fire HD feature the most advanced hardware, it’s also a service. 'When combined with our enormous content ecosystem, unmatched cross-platform interoperability, and standard-setting customer service, we hope people will agree that Kindle Fire HD is the best 7” tablet available anywhere, at any price.

But it seems the Top Gear presenter is running out of human victims – and is now making enemies in the world of birds. After he appeared on BBC TV’s nature-watching programme Countryfile last Sunday, to an audience of 6.8million, a police wildlife officer reported him for allegedly interfering with barn owls. Probe: The Countryfile episode followed Chris Packham and Jeremy Clarkson as the pair discussed barn owls at his Oxfordshire home . Spotted: A barn owl flew from the barn in the farm building of Clarkson's home as the duo approached . According to Josh Marshall, a scene in which Clarkson and Countryfile presenter Chris Packham approached the owls’ nesting box appeared to be in breach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act – and irresponsibly encouraged millions of viewers to commit a similar offence. PC Marshall first took to Twitter with his claim that the pair should have got a licence for filming and disturbing the nest, then contacted the BBC. He went on to tell the government agency Natural England, along with the Barn Owl Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. And Thames Valley police yesterday confirmed they were ‘investigating a report of a reckless disturbance of birds’. The alleged offence carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. A BBC spokesman insisted that Countryfile had behaved correctly. But research of Clarkson’s history suggests he might have form in the barn owl molestation department. Ten years ago he apologised on Top Gear for ‘joking’ that he would kick one of the birds to death for fun. An owl flies away on the show.

Thames Valley police yesterday confirmed they were 'investigating a report of a reckless disturbance of birds' Police are looking into a viewer complaint that Countryfile disturbed the barn owls, which are protected under special DEFRA licences . And three years ago he boasted that by hooting his Range Rover’s horn he managed to ‘scare a family of barn owls you would normally need a night vision lens and a night without sleep to see’. His latest brush with birdlife came when he welcomed Packham to the Oxfordshire farm he bought in 2009.As he showed the Countryfile presenter around the farm, as part of a programme to promote a nature photography competition, he led him to a nesting box in a derelict building and showed him some of the food pellets ejected by owls. ‘I want to get more butterflies and many many many more birds,’ said Clarkson. ‘I’ve got some owl boxes that might have barn owls in them.’ As they drew close to the box, two of the magnificent birds were apparently startled into emerging and flying off. Minutes after the programme was aired, Devon and Cornwall wildlife and countryside officer PC Marshall tweeted: ‘Did Clarkson and Packham have the appropriate licence to approach that barn owl nest on Countryfile tonight??’ He added: ‘Irresponsible to show that behaviour without warning people watching that you need appropriate licences, without is an offence.’ Online on his personal blog, PC Marshall, a keen birdwatcher and former soldier currently spending his holiday thwarting songbird trappers in Cyprus, added: ‘Jeremy Clarkson, Chris Packham and the film crew knowingly approached a barn owl nest site causing the birds to leave the nest. They stayed around and filmed the site.’ The BBC spokesman said: ‘Countryfile took expert advice before approaching the barn and we do not believe there was a breach of wildlife law. No one from the team entered the barn while the birds were there or approached the nest directly. Countryfile would never knowingly do anything that has a detrimental impact on wildlife. ‘Viewers are encouraged to take their photos responsibly and there is guidance about how to do that on the programme website.’ Packham – who is president of the Hawk & Owl Trust – said: ‘I’ve been doing this kind of work for years and I’m confident there was no disturbance of the barn owls.’ Surprisingly, PC Marshall himself had managed to cause offence when he briefly appeared on Countryfile the previous week. He seemed to suggest pigeon fanciers were responsible for the persecution of peregrine falcons, although he later blamed the way the programme was edited. The Top Gear presenter's sprawling Oxfordshire home was the setting on Sunday night for the BBC Countryfile programme .","Disturbing nesting barn owls against special licences laid down by DEFRA .

New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan has previously claimed to have eaten as many as 12 tacos in one sitting. These days, it's more like one. The New York Jets coach and vocal diarrhetic has never hid that he underwent weight-loss surgery in March 2010. Normally happy to talk - and talk - about anything, Ryan was tight-lipped about the details of the procedure for more than two years. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Rex Ryan knew he had to do something when he weighed in at 348 pounds in 2009, left. Ryan, pictured right in an interview this week, has lost more than 106 pounds . He wanted to reach the milestone of shedding 100 pounds before he opened his notorious mouth. From a peak of 348 pounds, Ryan is now down to about 243 pounds, which is less than each of the players on his defensive line - and even quarterback Tim Tebow. Even Jets fans sometimes don't recognize the new, slim Rex. 'I feel good because I know l look better than I did,' he said Thursday, before quickly adding in typical fashion, 'which is not saying much.' Fired up: Ryan says that now, even loyal Jets fans sometimes don't recognize the new, much slimmer Rex . On the sidelines: Ryan, who's been coaching the Jets since 2009, is perhaps known best for his verbal outbursts . Ryan added: 'But it wasn't about that for me. I've been married for 25 years. I wasn't looking for the young girlfriend or whoever. ... I wanted to be healthier and live a long, healthy life.' At the height of his coaching career, he was also hitting a high on the scales, weighing in at 348 pounds just before the Jets faced the Indianapolis Colts in the 2009 AFC championship. He said the number left him 'mortified,' and he even checked behind him to see if a fellow coach was playing a trick on him, putting additional pressure on the scale while he stood on it. Couple: Ryan has been married to his wife Michelle since 1987. They have two children . Ryan said: 'There was nobody there. It was just me. I was shocked. I thought I was about 300 to maybe 310.' He had tried all sorts of diets in the past, losing lots of weight only to gain it all back - and more. Ryan decided to have Lap-Band surgery after hearing the success stories of former players Jamie Dukes and Tony Siragusa. The device makes him feel full after eating, say, that one taco, forcing him to practice portion control. Ryan acknowledged he didn't necessarily eat much healthier - just less. 'If I want pizza, instead of eating a whole pizza like I used to, I'll eat a slice of pizza, if even that,' he said. The device can be adjusted, so Ryan had it loosened a bit when he and his wife recently went to Paris for their 25th anniversary so he could fully sample the French cuisine. After the surgery, his weight loss had started to plateau when he started exercising, which melted away many more pounds. Ryan was at about 290 during last season. At his heaviest, working out was just too hard on his joints. Now walking an hour on the treadmill feels like nothing, and he's thinking of running for the first time in two decades. His goal is to drop another 20 pounds or so. Ryan has gone from a 48- to a 38-inch waist, so he's had to replace all his clothes except for his socks. His blood pressure and cholesterol have plummeted. Without being asked, Ryan volunteers that he's getting paid to serve as a spokesman for Lap-Band. Quarterbacks: As it has been for the last several months, the big story with the Jets this season is the team's recent high-profile acquisition - Tim Tebow - and starter Mark Sanchez . 'My message is: Do I believe in it? There's no question, 100 per cent,' he said. So much so that he convinced his twin brother, Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, to get the surgery too. Rob has lost about 60 pounds. Ryan's attitude often seemed inseparable from his girth, but he insists he's the same old Rex - just healthier. The Jets' full training camp opens in Cortland, New York, next Thursday. As it has been for the last several months, the big story with the Jets this season is the team’s recent high-profile acquisition - Tim Tebow - and star quarterback Mark Sanchez.

It was an age of American optimism and New York was the inspiring centrepiece of a nation thought to have a boundless potential for future creativity and economic growth. So it is perhaps not surprising that the mayor had such high hopes for his city when he predicted in 1962 what it would be like today. Among his forecasts for 2012, Robert F Wagner Jr believed New Yorkers would be driving rocket-powered cars and speed through the metropolis on Monorails. Hopeful forecast: A copy of New York Times magazine article in 1962 in which the then mayor, Robert F Wagner, optimistically predicting what the city would be like for its people in 2012 . And he hoped the era would see an end to the social and racial divisions that had allowed many districts to be exclusively populated by one class or ethnic group. Writing in New York Times Magazine, Mr Wagner, who served as mayor between 1954 and 1965, also predicted that New Yorkers could all enjoy free access to university. Mayor Robert F Wagner, New York Times 1962 . Instead, all neighbourhoods would be completely mixed and the majority of the city’s residents owned their own comfortable and affordable homes. Of course, the reality has turned out to be somewhat different. Those few New Yorkers who drive still expect to spend hours stuck in gridlock and the traditional Subway trains remain the main form of mass transit. Neighbourhoods have become more racially mixed, especially in Manhattan, but there are still some enclaves with only minimal diversity. And, rather than increasing affordability, the city has become one where only the wealthiest have enough money to buy an apartment in its core borough. Only 30 per cent of homes in New York City are owned by their occupiers as prices have soared well above inflation. Vision of modernity: Mr Wagner thought people may travel in vertically-soaring helicopters to their homes and offices in New York's even taller skyscrapers, right, that would incorporate more air and green space inside . As for free tuition, the one institution that offered free courses – City University of New York – was forced to scrap this policy in 1975 due to fiscal crisis at City Hall. In real terms, the cost of higher education has more than doubled since Mr Wagner, a Democrat, served as mayor. Yet many of his words also contain more than a grain of truth of the modern reality and some predictions are surprisingly prescient. ‘Starting from this point, we may safely say that in 2012 New York City will be a  city where all races and nations meet and mingle - a city of many cultures, each of which will be respected and prized,' he wrote 29 years before his death in 1991. ‘As for slums, they will be just a memory of a rot that afflicted the city long ago. Optimist: Robert F Wagner Jr served as New York City mayor between 1954 and 1965. He died in 1991 . ‘We may fervently hope that racial discrimination will be ply a legend, referred to as an illustrations of a past shame and injustice based on widespread public ignorance and prejudice. There will be a series of cultural enclaves, but no racial, national, or even economic segregation. ‘There will still be a Harlem, a Yorkville, a Chelsea, a Riverdale, a Williamsburg, a Lower East Side, a Greenwich Village - but they will be open neighbourhoods of people who will live there and not because there is no place else for them to live.’ This prediction, although wildly optimistic, was at least correct to assume racially segregation in these neighbourhoods would no longer be quite so racially segregated. The Lower East side has perhaps changed the most – from a packed ghetto for Jewish and eastern European families to a bohemian centre favoured by young professionals. And he was not wrong when he wrote that ‘the charm and character of neighbourhoods will be foremost among the values to be preserved. ‘The emphasis will be on “difference” rather than conformity.’ Although economic division remains rife and nowhere better illustrates this than the housing market, where many residents who characterised neighbourhoods have been priced out. In 1962, Mr Wagner predicted: ‘Many if not most apartments will be owned by the people living in them. ‘Rental housing will be generally for the very young, for newcomers and for transients. ‘To a greater and greater extent, housing will be built to promote the values of individual, family and community life rather than laid out with the sole object of renting  or selling to a particular economic group or class.’ The former mayor also believed that free facilities such as schools and museums would ‘have so multiplied that the most concentrated community in the world may also be the most cultured, the most creative, and the most varied - a free and open community of free minds and free spirits. Reflection: A futuristic image made by Eric Joyner in the 1960s may well serve what Mr Wagner had in mind . ‘All parts of the city’s great great  free-tuition university, including a full range of graduate and professional schools, will have come of age.’ Yet the vast majority of museums now charge entrance fees in excess of $10 and without a scholarship, few students can hope to get a university degree without also being saddled with thousands of dollars worth of debt. Mr Wagner also fervently believed New York’s skyline would continue to soar. ‘Within this great complex of people and their enterprises, apartment and office buildings will rise even higher than they do today, but they will not occupy the ground space. ‘There will be more sunlight, grass and greenery. Skyscrapers and towers will be interlaced with light and air – as vital to the building plan as stone glass and steel. ‘Small parks and squares will balance skyscrapers.’ Yet, few new skyscrapers have been built and – due to the tragic destruction of the World Trade Center by terrorists – its tallest tower remains the 1,250ft-high Empire State Building, which was completed in 1931. One area in which he was reasonably perceptive was the city’s population, which he predicted would remain around the eight million mark. However, he suggested that the number of people living in the tri-state metropolitan area could rise to up to 50million. Same buildings, much higher rent: Mr Wagner's prediction that former slums like those in the Lower East Side, above, would no longer exist were partly realised. The area is no longer an ethnic ghetto, although few poorer families can afford to live in the 'bohemian' district which has become popular with young professionals . Instead around 18million reside in the conurbation which spreads into the states of New Jersey and Connecticut as well as New York. Yet Mr Wagner was staggeringly wrong when he predicted the state of today’s transportation. ‘By 2012, New York will have at least partially resolved the earlier paradox whereby man, the earthbound creature, had learned to fly through the air at a speed faster than sound but was unable to move through the city at a pace faster than a snail’s. ‘The partial solution will have come from the expanded use of modernised mass transportation and the diversion of the major flow of vehicular traffic into expressways and tunnels. ‘Many New Yorkers may well be travelling from suburb to city, from river to river, and from one borough to another, by rocket-powered vehicles and monorails, or by huge vertical rising helicopters.’ At the very least, such skewed predictions should at least give us hope that some some of today’s more dire forecasts are never realised. But whether we finally get to drive rocket-powered cars or afford that penthouse in Midtown Manhattan remains to be seen.","As well as super-fast transport, Mayor Robert F Wagner believed era would see end to racial and social division .

A 223-year-old diary of one of the founders of Royal Worcester porcelain reveals how he stole the secrets for the world famous brand - by spying on French potters. The remarkable log was kept by John Flight, who ran the factory with his brother Joseph during the late 18th Century. He kept the journals, handwritten in a tiny, elaborate script, from at least 1785 until his untimely death aged just 25 in 1791. Revelation: The diary written by John Flight, who ran Royal Worcester, details when he went to France during the French revolution and stole the blueprints for manufacturing porcelain . During that time, the factory was beset by a number of technical issues as it tried to keep up with competition from the Far East and Europe. But its fortunes changed after Flight travelled to Europe to learn the secrets of his company’s competitors. The extracts were written in 1789 when he snuck into France to spy on the porcelain makers at the start of the French Revolution a year after the company was granted a Royal warrant. In the passages, young John Flight writes of his apprehension about travelling abroad to learn more about porcelain manufacture, but he also records much of the goings-on in the Worcester-based factory. In one passage, dated October 1789, he wrote of his research on the continent. He wrote: 'I go on buying bodys (sic) and glazes to get a tollerable (sic) insight into the manufactory but I much want to do more in this myself. 'I must continue by some method to do it.' In another, he agonises over an impending trip to France. Artefact:  Jessica Devereux, of Royal Worcester Porcelain, holds the diary revealing what was a trade secret . He wrote: 'I am fearfull (sic) of leaving the family, that makes me not know what is best about going to France. 'I have hinted to my brother for him to go but hardly think that would do.' The diary was recently retrieved from the archives at Worcester Porcelain Museum, where it had previously been seen only by curators and scholars. It was purchased and restored by the museum with the aid of an Art Fund grant before being put on public display for the first time. Amanda Savidge (corr), director of the museum, said that the diary was a significant item in the brand’s history. She said: 'It’s an absolutely fantastic handwritten diary dating from 1785 until 1791. Morning glory: Part of Lord Nelson's colourful breakfast set made by Royal Worcester in 1804, a year before the naval hero's death at Trafalgar . 'Most of what we know about the factory during that time has come from the diary. 'It was during the French Revolution so it would have been a very dangerous time to be travelling but because of that it’s a fascinating document which you can use to piece together English and European history of the time. 'It gives a new insight behind the history involved with the name. 'It’s just great to be showing these pages for the first time - we hope it will encourage people to take a real interest in the history of the brand.' Royal Worcester was established in 1751 and was granted a Royal Warrant in 1789 by King George III. The factory held a Royal Warrant for every subsequent year until it went into administration in 2008. The book has gone display to the public for the first time at the Antiques for Everyone Fair at the NEC in Birmingham.","Diary busts two-century-old secret of how Royal Worcester made its wares .

A church which was handed £67,000 in a will is facing bankruptcy after it emerged the cash was intended for a different church of the same name. Parishioners at Holy Trinity Church in Milton Regis, Kent, thought their prayers were answered when they were apparently bequeathed the cash from a generous well-wisher. Clergymen spent £6,000 repairing the roof and invested the rest in a year-long investment bond. Error: Parishioners at Holy Trinity Church in . Milton Regis, Kent, (pictured) have been wrongly bequeathed £67,000 from a well-wisher and they spent £6,000 repairing the church roof - but the money isn't theirs . Mistake: All the money was supposed to go to the Holy Trinity Church in Sittingbourne, (pictured) which is . just 1.4 miles down the road from the other church but £61,000 has been invested in a year long bond . But it has now emerged that the money was actually meant for Holy Trinity Church in Sittingbourne, which is just 1.4 miles down the road. Now lawyers have requested the money back which could send the church in Milton Regis into bankruptcy. Parochial church council member Keith Nevols said: 'The bottom line is that the church might go bankrupt because the money given each month doesn’t match the outgoings. 'Bankruptcy may be a bit extreme but without the money we will be in great difficulty.'

Ann Fagg, 72, a congregation member of the church, which is one of the . three oldest in Kent, said that she thought some form of compensation . should be paid to the church from the solicitors. She said: 'It was a big mistake from the solicitors concerned and I think that there should be some compensation in it. 'It . is a big mistake to happen, but that’s only my opinion.

Riot police and activists clashed on the streets of Spain today as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  warned that his country could not carry on funding itself for long. The clashes, in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo, were part of an ongoing protest against the eviction of residents from their homes. More than one million Spanish people are facing crippling mortgage debt. Turbulence: Riot police and activists clashed on the streets of Spain today as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned his country could not carry on funding itself for long . Clash: Protesters (pictured) in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo are angry about the eviction of residents from their homes . The riot police were called in to forcibly evict activists from the ‘Stop Deshaucios’ (Stop Evictions) social movement, who had set up in a building where an Ecuadorian family was facing eviction. They tried to blockade the building and threw buckets of water from upstairs windows in a bid to prevent the entry of police into the building. Many of the protesters were arrested and others injured as police tried to fight their way into the building. Meanwhile, Mr Rajoy revealed his intention to ask other European Union leaders at a summit starting tomorrow to use existing options to stabilise financial markets. Speaking . in parliament before a meeting of European heads in Brussels tomorrow and Friday, Mr Rajoy warned Spain would not be able continue financing itself . at current yields for a long time. Warning: Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the country would not be able continue financing itself for a long time . Protest: Activists from the 'Stop Deshaucios' (Stop Evictions) social movement throw buckets of water to stop police entering a building during a forced eviction in Oviedo, northern Spain . Referring to policy options already available such as the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond-buying programme and long-term funding tenders (LTROs), Mr Rajoy said: 'I will propose measures to stabilise financial markets, using the instruments at our disposal right now. 'The . most urgent issue is the one of financing. 'We can't keep funding . ourselves for a long time at the prices we're currently funding . ourselves.' Forceful: Spanish riot police restrain a member of the 'Stop Deshaucios' (Stop Evictions) social movement, with one officer using his knee to keep his head down . With Spain and the rest of the Eurozone's 'big four', struggling to narrow their differences over how to tackle the bloc's worsening debt crisis, Mr Rajoy said he would fight to secure aid for the country's banks directly and without enhanced creditor status from Europe's rescue funds. Speaking in parliament ahead of the two-day meeting of European leaders starting on Thursday in Brussels, Mr Rajoy said Spain would not be able continue financing itself at current yields for long. Twin three-year tenders offered by the ECB in December and February released more than one trillion euros into the financial system and were credited with staving off the worst effects of the debt crisis late last year and early in 2012. But the ECB has given no indications that it is planning to offer further LTROs or revive the dormant bond-buy programme - instead putting the onus on the region's governments to come up with a concerted response to the crisis. Mindful of the need to minimise the political stigma associated with a bailout after agreeing to a bank sector rescue worth up to €100 billion (£80 billion), Mr Rajoy said he would keep working for a direct recapitalisation of Spain's debt-scarred lenders with European funds. That would cut the vicious circle between indebted sovereign borrowers and weak banks. Crisis: Madrid is under intense pressure from nervous debt markets to tame one of the highest funding gaps in the Eurozone . Mr Rajoy said Spain would continue to press to remove the preferred creditor status of Europe's permanent rescue fund, the ESM, thereby avoiding further increases of the country's debt pile and reassuring other investors they would not drop down the repayments queue. 'I will keep working to obtain a direct recapitalisation of banks and to make sure the European aid doesn’t override the rights of other holders of public debt,' Mr Rajoy said. On that score, he may win support at the summit from Germany, the EU's biggest economy and paymaster, which appears ready to budge on using the rescue funds more flexibly to help banks and reassure investors spooked by the increased risk of facing writedowns on government bonds. Spain’s banks were crippled by a 2008 property crash. The Spanish government is under intense pressure from nervous debt markets to tame one of the highest funding gaps in the Eurozone and, to garner support within the bloc for its policy preferences, will be keen to show new austerity measures to European leaders at the summit. Summit: (From left to right) German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy French President Francois Hollande and President of the Council of Ministers of Italy Mario Monti, at a meeting in Rome on June 22 . Madrid said yesterday it was considering raising consumer, energy and property taxes to control a public deficit that may have already exceeded one of its budgeted ceilings for the full year. 'The most urgent issue is the one of financing. We can’t keep funding ourselves for a long time at the prices we’re currently (paying),' Mr Rajoy said today. Madrid’s short-term borrowing costs nearly tripled from a month ago at an auction yesterday, while demand shrank as investors continue to seek ever higher premiums to hold Spanish debt. It was revealed today that Spain’s 10-year debt yields are flat at 6.84 per cent, still uncomfortably close to the seven per cent level that triggered full-scale bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.","Mariano Rajoy says his country is in need of financial solution to its economic strife ahead of latest meeting of Eurozone leaders in Brussels .

A millionaire ex-solicitor was jailed yesterday for running a lucrative brothel empire. John Burrows, who moved into the sex industry after being struck off for forging a dying client’s will, also faces losing his £900,000 home. The 64-year-old owned a purported gentlemen’s club behind an anonymous-looking facade and claimed he made his money from cleaning drains and tackling vermin infestations. The truth was revealed when Burrows made an allegation of blackmail, and policemen who visited the premises to interview him were mistaken for customers. They were introduced to scantily-clad women who offered them sex for £50 an hour. Burrows was arrested and appeared at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court where a suspended sentence imposed for running the same brothel in 2009 was activated, and he was jailed for 18 months. The father of three, branded ‘a horrible creature’ by detectives, was also ordered to pay back £750,000 derived from crime, forcing him to put his ostentatious five-bedroom barn conversion on the market. The house, near the Lancashire beauty spot of Chipping, features a 6ft model of the Statue of Liberty in  the hall. Burrows was working as a solicitor in 1995 when he altered the will of Leslie Barnes as the ex-butcher was dying in hospital so that he received £2,000. Money-making: Police became aware that Burrows was still running the brothel only when he made an allegation of blackmail in 2010 and invited officers to interview him on the premises. (Hairdressing salon in photo unconnected to case) He was trapped when it emerged that the manufacturer of the paper on which he forged the will had changed its watermark for the first time in 100 years. It also emerged that he had defrauded the law firm where he worked by falsifying cheques, and in 2000 he was jailed for four and a half years. Burrows was struck off by the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Panel in 2002 for ‘unbefitting conduct’. His subsequent venture, World Famous Babes, first came to the attention of the authorities in 1997.

Planners refused permission for the ‘health club’ in Swinton, Greater Manchester, to expand because neighbours complained of ‘obscene sounds and screams’ and clients’ expensive cars – Mercedes, Porsches and BMWs – parked in front of their houses. Police raided the building in 2007 and found two clients engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes. Financial records revealed that Burrows had been pocketing £20 out of each prostitute’s £50 hourly fee. He was given a ten-month suspended prison sentence in 2009 and ordered to repay £750,000 in criminal assets or face jail. Investigators say the money has yet to be repaid. Police became aware that Burrows was still running the brothel only when he made an allegation of blackmail in 2010 and invited officers to interview him on the premises. They were greeted at the door by a woman who, mistaking them for clients, introduced them to two prostitutes, Philip Dobson, prosecuting, told the court. Burrows admitted running the brothel and another in Bury. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of contempt of court for breaching a restraining order relating to the disposal of his assets. Neighbours said they had no idea the wealthy businessman had made his money from prostitution. ‘John was quite ostentatious and showy, he liked to splash his cash around, going to nice restaurants, holding parties for his staff,’ said one.

Google Chief Executive Larry Page was back in the office on Monday after being absent from the company's biggest public events for weeks. Page was taking meetings at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said. Schmidt spoke to reporters at the annual Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on Thursday. He would not go into details but said the CEO was 'doing much better', adding that Page ran his meeting on Monday. 'He is talking, but talking softly,' Schmidt said. Page has stayed out of the public eye since last month, when he was a no-show at an annual shareholders' meeting after having 'lost his voice,' Schmidt explained at the time. Page, who apart from being CEO is also one of the company's largest shareholders, is also expected to skip the company's post-earnings conference call next week. His prolonged absence has raised questions about the health of the 39-year-old Google co-founder and the mystery condition affecting his voice. He reassured employees about his health in June but little light was shed on the condition affecting his voice that side-lined him from high-profile events. In an email Page told colleagues that there was 'nothing seriously wrong with me,' according to a source who had seen an internal staff memo. The 39-year-old Google co-founder sat out his company's annual shareholders' meeting because he had 'lost his voice,' according to Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who informed attendees of the news at the start of the event. The condition also caused Page to miss Google's annual developer conference as well as its quarterly results announcement.

Online . pre-sales on Google Play and select retailers' websites such as Office . Depot's have commenced, with the first tablets expected to arrive next . week. Demand 'was immense in the first week,' Schmidt said, without giving details. Page's . absence also raises questions about his condition, and the company's . obligation to disclose issues of concern to shareholders. Mystery: Page's lengthy absence has been put down to him having 'lost his voice' but few details have been released . Corporate governance experts say . Google has met minimal disclosure requirements but will face increasing . pressure while Page remains out of sight. On Friday, Google's shares rose 1.1 per cent to $571.48, lifted along with the rest of the Nasdaq. 'It . gets them over the first disclosure hurdle, that is they've alerted . shareholders to the fact he's going to have this health effect,' said . James Post, a professor of management at Boston University who . specializes in corporate governance issues. 'The tough questions still lie ahead, and there will be continued pressure to keep answering those tough questions.'

'With the concerns over Steve Jobs, . people are quick to jump to a conclusion that may not be the right . conclusion to jump to,' said Needham & company analyst Kerry Rice.

'We have no specific reason to think there is anything more to Larry's condition, but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the 2Q call, which is likely still a few weeks away,' Anmuth wrote to clients at the time. 'This could raise some questions among investors.' Simon Best, a head and neck surgery specialist at the Johns Hopkins Voice Center, said most cases where a doctor might order a patient to rest their voice involved either a vocal cord haemorrhage, or throat surgery of some sort. 'We actually very rarely put people on complete voice rest where they are not cleared to talk or allowed to talk,' West said.

A New Zealand Olympic barbecue party turned to panic when two gas canisters exploded, forcing more than 300 guests to flee for their lives. The Antipodean sports fans had gathered to watch their compatriots compete in the evening athletics session last night in the garden of the country's pop-up hospitality house in King's Cross. But just as chefs began handing out burgers and sausages at around 7.20pm, partygoers noticed blue flames beginning to engulf the fuel cylinders used to fire the grill. The alarm was sounded and guests scattered into the street screaming. Scroll down for video. Panic: The Antipodean sports fans had gathered to watch their compatriots compete in the Games' evening session last night in the garden of the country's hospitality house in King's Cross . Minutes later the blast tore through the garden with such force that the barbecue roof was blown into the air. Brook Johnstone, 55, from Port Waikato, said: 'I looked around and the gas bottle had a little flame around it. 'The cook was trying to put it out and the flame just got bigger so I just said ‘Let’s get out of here’. 'We got inside and everyone was evacuated.' Fear: But as chefs began handing out burgers and sausages at around 7.20pm, partygoers noticed blue flames beginning to engulf the fuel cylinders used to fire the grill . Alarm: Minutes later the blast tore through the garden with such force that the barbecue roof was blown into the air . Mr Johnstone, who is in London on holiday, said the canister exploded with such force that it blew the roof off the barbecue area. New Zealander and Leeds University student Sonia Holland, who is also working as a volunteer Games Maker at the Olympics, said she was not aware of any athletes in attendance. The 19-year-old, from Napier, said: 'I literally just got my food and there was a big kerfuffle around the barbecue area. Danger: A plume of black smoke filled the air and could be seen for miles across London . Evacuation: Ambulance crews arrived but fortunately nobody was hurt . 'Everyone was pushed inside but then people were telling us to get out of the building. 'They got everyone out of the building as fast as they could. I was out within two minutes.' She said when she looked back at the building she could see fire and smoke coming from the garden. Shortly after the fire, Kiwi House tweeted: 'We've had a rather large fire engulf the outdoor bbq area. Everyone is ok. We're closed till further notice. More updates as they happen.' Fortunately no one was hurt after all guests were evacuated safely. Compatriots: The guests had gathered to watch their compatriots compete, including Stacey Michelsen, left, in the Women's Field Hockey Semifinal match against the Netherlands and Sarah Walker, right, in the BMX competition . Despite their Olympic home from home being closed until further notice, some New Zealanders were able to make light of the situation. One witness told 3 News: 'My . girlfriend came in and she was like, ""Move out of the way, move out of . the way, there's a gas bottle on fire!"" And I was like, ""Well, I need to . get me card, and I want to get some sauce for my pie.""' On Twitter 'Ross' joked: 'Not to be outdone by Aus gold . medal count NZ house has decided to step in and show the world how to . BBQ Kiwi style!' James Elliott added: 'The . instruction as I recall it was to always blow on the pie not blow up the . pie. #kiwihouse.' Ten firefighters attended and a cordon was put around the building in case another gas cylinder exploded. Richard Welch, station manager of Poplar fire station, said: 'People in the vicinity reported hearing an explosion, which was due to two gas cylinders exploding before firefighters arrived on the scene. 'Crews have now brought the blaze under control and are cooling a further two gas cylinders down to make them safe. 'Around 300 people were evacuated from nearby buildings and as a precaution we’ve set up a temporary safety cordon of around 50 metres. 'Fortunately it doesn’t look as though anyone was injured.'

Mr Seerveld spoke with MailOnline about the honour of being named BuzzFeed’s ‘sexiest exterminator. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily accurate,’ he said, laughing, ‘but I’ll take what I can get.’ His business, he explained, is all about handling wildlife humanely, he explained, and not so much about exterminating pests. ‘It’s me and two guys in Orlando, both better looking than me,’ he said. Among the dangerous things he’s caught are alligators, rattlesnakes, armadillos and other more common creatures like raccoons, bats, and rats. Double trouble: Here, he poses with two young raccoons, flashing a toothy smile . Going batty: It is clear that the wildlife lover does not fear any of the animals with which he deals .

A word to the wise? ‘Never try to handle wildlife – leave it alone, particularly snakes.  If anyone does have a wildlife problem, hire the right person, and no one who uses poison, because it’s inhumane and doesn’t solve the problem.’ He said he married a wonderful woman this January.

Comedian Stephen Colbert got in some trouble with Wikipedia after he instructed his loyal fans to make unnecessary edits to the pages of Mitt Romney's possible vice presidential candidates in an effort to sway their viability. In response, Wikipedia took the unusual step of locking the pages of the majority of Romney's short list, meaning that only experienced Wikipedia users had the ability to alter the information. The internet kerfuffle came after political bloggers noted the trend that the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees could be used to gauge how likely it is that said candidate will be Romney's choice. Rebel rouser: Stephen Colbert urged his viewers to make as many edits as they could to sway the vote . Watching his every move: Political analysts are dying to know who Mitt Romney- seen here headed to New York on Wednesday- will pick for his vice presidential running mate . An article on the site Tech President . examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the . announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential . election: shortly before Sarah Palin and Joe Biden were revealed as . their respective parties' vice presidential nominees, there was a major . spike in the edits to their pages. Political blogs picked up on the idea, . read into the virtual tea leaves, which lead to Colbert encouraging his . viewers to take the race into their own hands. New York Magazine reports that the comedian told his viewers to 'make . as many edits as possible to your favorite VP contender' and spent time . during Tuesday night's show with a bit about him editing former . Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's page. A short while later, Wikipedia locked . the pages of Pawlenty, Senator Rob Portman, Congressman Paul Ryan, . Senator Marco Rubio, Governor Bobby Jindal, Governor Chris Christie and . General David Petraeus, all of whom have been at the top of many . speculative lists. Politico blogger Dylan Byers said that . while he initially endorsed the validity of theory about the Wikipedia . edits guiding post, further inspection proved that a number of the edits . were done by the same sources, not all of which were substantive. Colbert's shout out was inevitably going to drive up that traffic even . further. By blocking the pages to new users, . Wikipedia still left a way for people who they consider 'experienced' to . make their contributions to the open sourced encyclopedia. Frontrunner: Seen here with Mitt Romney on Tuesday, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (right) had the most edits on her Wikipedia page out of all of the potential VP candidates . Anyone who reaches the status of an . 'autoconfirmed user'- which means they have had an account on the site . for at least four days and made more than 10 edits- they will have the . ability to make changes on the protected pages again. Even Wikipedia admits that this system . still allows for a large number of contributors, many of whom may have . an ulterior motive. 'Although the precise requirements for . autoconfirmed status vary according to circumstances, most English Wiki . user accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least . 10 edits are considered autoconfirmed,' they say on their access levels . page. Trailing behind: Marco Rubio had 100 edits on Tuesday (left), Rob Portman had 81 (center) and Paul Ryan had 57 (right) putting them all behind Ayotte but the system of analysis is also flawed . The correlation between the number of . edits and a possible announcement was first noticed in 2008 as members . of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the . hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by . Americans hoping to learn more about the candidates. For instance, Sarah Palin's page had . 68 edits the day before her nomination was announced, while other . prospects- which, at the time, included Romney himself- had far fewer . changes on that fateful day. Additionally, there is the ever-important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation. When Palin was added to the ticket, . she was essentially unknown to all Americans outside of Alaska where she . was part-way through her first term. As a result, it comes as no . surprise that John McCain's campaign staff wanted to add a significant . amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of . the electorate. Trendsetters: The system of looking through Wikipedia edits for clues came with Sarah Palin's selection in 2008 (above) but she also was less well-known than all of Romney's current candidates . The same cannot be said for Rubio, . Portman or Ayotte, all of whom have been under the political microscope . for the past few months in wake of their connections to Romney. While the edit tally may not prove to . be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot, the Romney . campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which . will deliver the news first once it breaks. Another tried-and-tested method would be to follow the money. Politico reported Tuesday that Portman . is expected to rake in over $500,000 for the Romney ticket from two . Ohio fundraisers this week, which would be a positive argument in favor . of his candidacy. At the same time, Florida-based . Republican Hispanic coordinator Ana Navarro Tweeted an anonymous tip . that the Romney’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential . partner will be in St. Petersburg, foreshadowing that the candidate is . likely from the Sunshine State, (meaning Rubio). It is likely that such rumor-mongering . will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal . announcement won’t come until after the Olympics finish in order to make . the best use of the inevitable media attention.","In the days leading up to public announcements, vice presidential candidate's Wikipedia pages are frequently updated by campaign staffers .

Tesco bosses were left red-faced yesterday after they mistakenly advertised an £85 bicycle for £1 - and were predictably deluged with orders. The store unintentionally posted a picture of a men's six-gear Terrain Brecon hybrid bike on its website at a huge 99 per cent discount. As news spread of the deal, customers rushed to snap up the bargain, causing the site to crash. Huge bargain: Tesco Direct advertised a six-gear Terrain Brecon men's hybrid bike for just £1 instead of £84.99 - a 99 per cent discount . Many even tried to buy in bulk, hoping to sell on the discounted £84.99 bicycle and make a profit. The subject quickly started trending on Twitter, with many calling it the best deal ever. The too-good-to-be-true deal offered the brand new 17kg steel bike with 24-inch wheels for the price of a lottery ticket. Excited customer Sian Bradley said: 'Looking for a cheap mountain bike - Tesco direct selling them for one pound.' Another, Rupert Murray, said: 'Tesco’s website has crashed after they advertised one pound bikes. I tried to buy 50 and was rejected.' IT glitch: The supermarket giant is known for its cut-price deals - but this one was sadly too good to be true . Bargain hunters website HotUKDeals the price was being hailed the ‘best deal ever.’ One member, Sambrat, said: 'Ordered one and splashed out on next day delivery - lol.' Another, 5reds, added: 'Just ordered 99 to sell on eBay lol.' Unfortunately for those who believed it . to be a genuine offer, Tesco soon pointed out the price had been a . mistake and refused to honour the advertised deal. Today a spokesman apologised to those who had been affected, blaming the mistake on an IT glitch. 'We apologise sincerely to affected customers for any inconvenience caused,' he said. 'Unfortunately this was an IT error, which has now been corrected.' Not much of a bargain: . Tesco in Bridlington, East . Yorkshire, was selling a bottle of water for 25p or two for 70p earlier this week . The item remained listed on Tesco Direct until late yesterday, but the usual ‘Add to basket’ option was replaced with a . message reading, ‘there are currently no sellers for this product.’ It is not the first time the supermarket giant has caused a stampede with an unplanned bargain. Last year the store caused a sensation . when a pricing error saw Terry’s Chocolate Orange sold for just 29p - . down from £2.75. Hundreds rushed to their local branch to buy trolleys full of the discounted confectionery. One shopper was even reported to have purchased 192 of the chocolates - saving a staggering £471. But the supermarket's miscalculated deals are not always so enticing. Just two days ago, a branch in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, advertised a bottle of Harrogate Spa Spring Water at 25p, or two for 70p - more than double the price of just one.","Last year, the store sold Terry’s Chocolate Orange for just 29p - .

The civil war has now been raging for 18 months and nearly 20,000 people have been killed - most of them civilians. Today, U.N. human rights investigators accused Syrian government forces and allied shabbiha militia of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and torture. The rebels have also committed war crimes but these 'did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale' of those carried out by the army and security forces, they said. 'The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that government forces and the shabbiha had committed the crimes against humanity of murder and of torture, war crimes and gross violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including unlawful killing, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, sexual violence, indiscriminate attack, pillaging and destruction of property,' said the 102-page report by the independent investigators led by Paulo Pinheiro.

Speaking to the newspaper, he pointed out that the topless bar scandal was only part of the reason he quit his role on July 18. His swift exit also came after his colleague, Rep.

Wingard, who had also been on the Palm Springs trip, allegedly plied Samantha Berrier, then 20, with alcohol and forced her into an unwanted sexual relationship. Scandal: The resignation came after deputy leader Matt Wingard, pictured, was accused of sexual misconduct by a former aide. There were rumours Wingard would go public about the topless bar . Accuser: Samantha Berrier, then 20, said Wingard gave her alcohol and forced her into a sexual relationship . Wingard has denied giving her alcohol . while she was underage and claims that they had a short consensual relationship while she . worked for him in 2009. Cameron told Wingard that if he did not . step down and pull out of the bid, Cameron would have to make a public . demand that he do so, The Oregonian reported. After Wingard stepped down, Cameron said he heard rumours the snubbed colleague was going to go public about his visit to a topless bar. He said the Wingard scandal coupled with 'family and business pressures' that demanded his attention led to his resignation. He was replaced by Rep. Andy Olson of Albany. Cameron took the Palm Springs trip with Wingard, House co-Speaker Bruce Hanna and Reps . Tim Freeman, Vic Gilliam, Patrick Sheehan and Matt Wand. All bar Wingard and Sheehan are married. Several of the men told The Oregnian it was merely 'a personal . vacation with friends'. Caught: The seven Republicans went to the topless bar during a trip to Palm Springs in January (file picture) The men stayed at a $1 million four-bedroom, four-bath home house owned by Gilliam and his wife. They had dinner together before heading to the bar featuring topless dancers, although they have refused to reveal who came up with the bright idea. Hanna said their visit to the bar was no one's business - although he admitted he did regret it. 'Asking me a question like that would be . like me asking you what you wore as swimwear or not on your last . vacation and how that affected your ability to do your job,' he told The Oregonian. There is no indication that state or campaign money was involved on the holiday. Just a few months later, Cameron learned about the relationship between Wingard and Berrier after the young woman 'poured her heart out' to Rachel Lucas, from the Washington County Republicans. Rocked: The embarrassing details surfaced as the Republicans attempt to win a majority in the House . Lucas emailed Cameron who called her the next day. The allegations became public a month later and Wingard stepped down as deputy leader. After Cameron told him to step down and Wingard pulled his name from the ballot, Cameron said he heard rumours Wingard was threatening to tell about the men's trip to the topless bar. Wingard did not comment on the claims. The embarrassing details surface as the Republicans are attempting to win a majority in the House, taking back control, which has been evenly split over the past two years. Cameron had been in the seat since 2005, and had been leader since January 2011. Despite his resignation, Cameron is continuing with his bid for a fifth term in District 19, which covers part of South Salem, Aumsville and Turner.","Oregon's House Republican leader Kevin Cameron stepped down in July .

A wife who suspected her husband of having an affair armed herself with a baseball bat to attack the mother in their children's school playground. Mother-of-six Kelly Mochan, 31, turned the school run into chaos when she went hunting for fellow parent Katie Vincent with the metal bat. Furious Mochan stormed into Pyle Junior School at the end of the day looking for Miss Vincent, 31, who she believed was sleeping with her husband. Chaos in the playground: Grandmother Tonia Vincent (right) who was hit over the head with a baseball bat by Kelly Mochan (left) while she was picking up her grandchildren from their school in Pyle . But when she realised Miss Vincent's mother was picking up them up after school, she attacked her instead and cracked the grandmother's skull with the bat. Cardiff Crown Court was told grandmother Tonia Vincent was smashed on the head with the bat while terrified children and parents looked on during the playground battle in Pyle, near Bridgend, Wales. After Mochan was given a 12-month . community order, the victim told The Sun newspaper that it is . 'unbelievable' she was not sent to prison. Prosecutor Mike Hammett explained to the court: 'She told the gran: ""I’ll get your f***ing daughter"" as she was going through the car park. 'There was an exchange of words and she said she was going to kill Katie for what she had done. 'Nonsense': Katie Vincent (pictured) says Mochan's accusations were ridiculous . 'Mrs Vincent reminded her there were children present and she took a baseball bat from her car, raised it and hit her on the head. 'There was struggle, they both fell to the ground and the teaching assistants intervened. 'The grandmother was then taken to hospital with swelling and bleeding from her head.' Mochan, who walked away with the community order after admitting causing actual bodily harm, had some of her six children with at the time of the attack. She claimed she kept the bat in the car for her children to play with and had taken it out as a warning. Katie Vincent, a mother of two, denied she was having an affair with Mochan’s husband Stuart. She said: 'It was all untrue nonsense. She had threatened me earlier in the local supermarket and the police were called. 'I’ve been too afraid to pick the kids up from school. I’m just so glad the summer holidays have started.' After the case, Tonia, 53, said: 'I thought I was going to die in the school playground in front of my own grandchildren. 'She was screaming and yelling, and her language was atrocious. She kept saying she was going to kill Katie. 'She walked over to her car and . started getting something silver out of the boot. I didn’t know what it . was at first - but then I saw it was a baseball bat. 'Her face was so angry it was distorted. Then she swung at me out of the blue and I felt it crack against my skull. 'I could feel warm blood trickling down my head. The doctors told me I had a very lucky escape. 'She was a lunatic. A mother of six . should be ashamed of herself for behaving like that. I just hope she . gets treatment for her anger - she needs it badly.' School ground spat: The mother stormed the playground and swung for the grandmother. She has now patched up our marriage . Cardiff Crown Court heard how she had since left the village and is living in Port Talbot, near Swansea, with her husband. The pair have now patched up their marriage and are making a new start. Judge David Wynn Morgan warned her: 'The school gate is not the place for the airing of opinions and grievances about your husband’s extra-marital activities. 'You are a mother of a large number of children and a very good mother to all those children.

Former Eastenders actor Jody Latham will face a trial by jury over claims he grew a £15,000 cannabis farm. The 30-year-old actor, who played evil pimp Rob Grayson in the BBC soap, and his girlfriend Sarah Melia, 31, were charged with cultivating cannabis after 24 plants were found behind a false wall inside a garage at his house in Bacup, Lancs. During a hearing at Burnley Magistrates Court today the case was moved to Burnley Crown Court, where the pair will face trial in October. Both Latham and Melia face up to 14 years in jail if convicted. Accused: Actor Jody Latham, 30, flanked by his girlfriend Sarah Melia, 31, and their solicitor . Police were acting on a tip when they swooped on the . property in May last year and uncovered the secret stash of drugs. Judge and jury: The couple are accused of cultivating cannabis worth £15,000 and will be tried at crown court . In court today neither Latham nor Melia entered a plea and both stood with their arms crossed in the dock as the charge was put to them. Defence lawyer Ben Leech told the court Latham and Melia disputed details of the charged levelled against them. He said: 'There are a number of things that will be challenged. The yield is not accepted and the value is not accepted.' The case was then adjourned until October 10. The actor’s career took off at the age of 12 when his talent was spotted during performances at Burley Youth Theatre. Latham then found fame playing Phillip ‘Lip’ Gallagher in Channel 4 drama Shameless from 2004 to 2008, before landing the role of Grayson in EastEnders last year.

A former Nasa computer specialist, who claims he was sacked due to his belief that God created the universe, is due in court today. David Coppedge, who worked as a 'team lead' at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in California, is suing the agency after claiming he was discriminated against after talking about 'intelligent design' and handing out DVDs on the theory at work. Intelligent design is the belief that a higher power must have had a . hand in creation because life is too complex to have developed through . evolution alone. Dismissed: David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against when he was fired from his post on the Cassini Mission last year . Coppedge lost his team lead title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the Cassini mission, which explored Saturn. In the lawsuit, Coppedge said he . believes other things led to his demotion, including his support . for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to . heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a . 'Christmas party.' Coppedge's attorney, William Becker, . contends his client was singled out by his bosses because they perceived . his belief in intelligent design to be religious. Coppedge had a . reputation around JPL as an evangelical Christian, and interactions with . co-workers led some to label him as a Christian conservative, Becker . said. 'David . had this reputation for being a Christian, for being a practising one. He did not go around evangelising or proselytising. But if he found out . that someone was a Christian he would say, ""Oh that's interesting, what . denomination are you?""' Becker said. Lawsuit: David Coppedge worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons before being demoted in 2009 and sacked last year . 'He's not apologising for who he is. He's an evangelical Christian.' In an emailed statement, JPL dismissed Mr Coppedge's claims. In . court papers, lawyers for the California Institute of Technology, which . manages JPL for NASA, said Coppedge received a written warning . because his co-workers complained of harassment. They also said Coppedge lost his 'team lead' status because of ongoing conflicts with others. Caltech . lawyers contend Mr Coppedge was one of two Cassini technicians and . among 246 JPL employees let go last year due to planned budget cuts. The case has generated interest among supporters of intelligent design. The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian civil rights group, and the . Discovery Institute, a proponent of intelligent design, are both . supporting Coppedge's case. NASA: The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars and sent probes to outer planets . 'There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from . Darwin and we've seen that for several years,' said John West, . associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the . Seattle-based Discovery Institute. 'This is free speech, freedom of . conscience 101.' Meanwhile, the National Center for Science Education, which rejects intelligent . design as thinly veiled creationism, is also watching the case and has . posted all the legal filings on its website. 'It . would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly . straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this . tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters,' said Josh . Rosenau, NCSE's programmes and policy director. 'It looks like a pretty straightforward case. The mission that he was working on was winding down and he was laid off.' At its heart this is a straightforward discrimination . case, said Eugene Volokh, a professor of First Amendment law at the . University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. Space agency: David Coppedge began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003 . 'The . question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was . wasting people's time and bothering them in ways that would have led him . to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether . he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs,' said Mr . Volokh. 'If he can show that, then he's got a good case.' Mr . Coppedge, who began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was . hired in 2003, is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a . website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of . intelligent design. His father authored an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group. He is also a board member for . Illustra Media, a company that produces video documentaries examining . the scientific evidence for intelligent design. The company produces the . videos that Mr Coppedge was handing out to co-workers, said Becker. His main duties . at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical . problems for the mission. In 2000, he was named 'team lead', serving as a . liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before . being demoted in 2009. He . sued in April 2010 alleging religious discrimination, retaliation and . harassment and amended his suit to include wrongful termination after . losing his job last year. Coppedge is seeking attorney's fees and costs, damages for wrongful . termination and a statement from the judge that his rights were . violated, said Becker.

Legal action: Natalie Creane was left with a life-threatening brain condition after a TV panel fell on her head in a five-star hotel four years ago . The British newlywed left with a life-threatening brain condition after a TV panel fell on her head in a five-star hotel has spoken for the first time about her four-year ordeal. Natalie Creane, 33, said she cannot be left alone after the incident in the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi left her suffering epileptic seizures and a traumatic brain injury. She said: 'I do not live a normal life and I never will.' As she can only walk and talk with great difficulty, Mrs Creane took a week to articulate the trauma of the past four years. During that time she has been locked in a battle for compensation with the Emirates Palace hotel. She suffered a string of debilitating injuries when a TV panel in her hotel room, which she says was not fixed properly to the top of a wardrobe, fell on her head in July 2008. Since then she has endured epileptic seizures, post-traumatic brain injury and is on constant medication. The hotel where she had been celebrating her engagement refutes her claims and used pictures of her wedding from her Facebook page in court to show she was living a normal life. But former human resources director Mrs Creane said the devastating toll on her and her family had left them in anything but a normal state. She added: 'I lost my career, my quality of life, my independence, my peace of mind. My body feels like it should be on someone far beyond my years and our entire family is traumatised beyond belief.' She described her eventual wedding to her husband Trevor, 42, which had to be postponed three times and was finally held in the summer of 2009. 'Doing things that to people who do . not know us may seem normal does not change what has happened to us - the . pain, the suffering, the trauma, everything we have gone through,' she . said. Ordeal: Since sustaining her injuries four years ago, Mrs Creane has endured epileptic seizures, post-traumatic brain injury and is on constant medication . 'The day I tried on . my wedding dress, I had to be held up by two people and my mum. I was . too weak to stand and I had so much pain in my hands and arms from all . the canulas and needles as I had just been discharged from hospital in . the UK. 'By the time we finally did get married, I had completely forgotten what the dress looked like.' Mrs Creane added that, on her big day, she had to hide bald patches where her hair had fallen out with hair extensions. She said: 'I wanted to look like a healthy, normal person after I had looked so ill for so long. 'Although . I was exhausted, drugged up and had a bad headache for most of the day, . I was so happy to finally be able to marry the man who had loved me, . taken care of me, sat with me in hospital after hospital and whom I . loved more than anything in the world. 'Every . normal thing they try and use against me that I have been able to do . since the accident has taken so much strength and determination and has . not been normal at all. It has been under so many medications and so . much pain and trauma. 'Even on my better days, I do not live a normal life and I never will.' Plush: The Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where the TV panel fell on Mrs Creane . Five-star luxury: A typical bedroom at The Emirates Palace Hotel . Mrs . Creane said her 'better days' were still far worse than any bad day she . had experienced before the incident, adding she tried to remain upbeat. 'I . tried to do whatever I could to live my life the best I could with a . smile on my face, knowing it could always be worse,' she said. But she admitted she is terrified of what the future might bring and cannot sleep at night. Mrs . Creane has been in a medically-induced coma five times and collapsed on . a number of occasions, breaking bones and once nearly drowning in the . bath during a seizure when she slipped underwater. Her mother Angie . Smith pulled her out just in time. She . has been admitted to intensive care more than 20 times and on each . occasion, her mother and father Derick have flown from their home in . Essex to be by her side at the Dubai home she has shared with Trevor . since they moved to the United Arab Emirates nine years ago. She . cannot be left alone and is often too weak to perform the simplest of . tasks. Her husband said: 'She is unsteady, listless and not with it 100 . per cent all of the time.' Her family took a week to transcribe her description of her ordeal, the first time she has spoken about her suffering. They . posted it on a Facebook campaign page they started called Justice For . Natalie, where they are garnering support for their £3.5million . compensation claim to pay for her medical bills. Natalie Creane had just got engaged to husband Trevor and was celebrating in Abu Dhabi when the piece of wood fell on her in 2008 . In . a statement, they said it had taken a week and many tears to write down . what she had said: 'Some of you may not know but Nat has her own . language called Nat speak. 'It . is a special language she texts or writes when she is unwell or is on . certain medications so it took me rather some time to make [this] make . any sense - but the words are all hers.' Her father added: 'Our family has been to hell and back and it is only getting worse. 'All we want is to see Nat happy and . healthy and while we realise she will never be the same, we know that by . getting the best treatment she can have a better quality of life and so . can her husband.' The online campaign now has nearly . 13,000 supporters. The Creanes are preparing to go back to Abu Dhabi . Higher Civil Claims Court in September for the next round in the battle . against Emirates Palace hotel. The tourist attraction - where rooms . cost up to £8,000 a night and cappuccinos are served with flakes of real . gold leaf - has denied responsibility. It . stated her injuries were 'a figment of the claimant's imagination', . adding as the TV panel weighed 2.2kg, it could not have inflicted the . trauma she described. The . hotel has claimed the wardrobe could have been tampered with, disputed . medical records and in a statement to the court said: 'We have presented . evidence showing she has continued with her lifestyle as normal.'

The White House has said that President Barack Obama will not jettison Vice-President Joe Biden and replace him with Hillary Clinton as his 2012 running mate. Republicans such as Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin had suggested Biden be replaced by Clinton after the furore over Biden’s comments to an audience containing many blacks that Republicans intended to ‘put y’all back in chains’. Asked whether Biden would definitely . be on the ticket, Jay Carney, White House spokesman, said: ‘Yes.  And . that was settled a long, long time ago. ‘And while I appreciate, I have great . admiration for and respect for and a long relationship with Senator . John McCain, but one place I would not go for advice on . Vice-Presidential running mates is to Senator McCain.’ Lost your appetite, Joe? President Obama and his VP had lunch today following Biden's inflammatory comments to a black audience earlier this week . Obama had a White House meeting with . Biden followed by a joint meeting between the two men and Clinton. The . President and Vice-President then had lunch together, during which . recent campaign events were discussed. Ahead of the meeting the Obama camp said the President would be 'talking to him a . whole lot about the campaign'. The Vice-President’s lunch with the . President is a regularly scheduled event but you can be sure that Biden was expecting to be taken to the woodshed by Obama, who was forced to . defend his hapless veep in interviews with People magazine and . Entertainment Tonight. He . told People: 'Joe Biden has been an outstanding vice president. He is . passionate about what's happening in middle-class families. So I will be . talking to him a whole lot about the campaign generally.' Breaking the ice? Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was set to meet with Obama and Biden before their lunch today . He told Entertainment Tonight that Biden's 'phrasing is a distraction' - a clear sign of his dismay about his Vice-President's loose lips. 'What Joe Biden was talking about again is an example of a substantive argument - a substantive issue, that the American people should be concerned about — and his phrasing is a distraction from what is at stake.' He added: 'In no sense was he trying to connote something other than that.' When a president is forced to explain what his veep was 'trying to connote', you know things between them are unlikely to be all warm and fuzzy. Right at the start of his presidency, Obama made clear that he did not appreciate Biden's garrulous jocularity. When Biden joked about Chief Justice John Roberts's mistake in administering the inauguration oath of office, a stony-faced Obama was distinctly unamused. Obama held a meeting with Biden at 10.15 this morning followed by a session in which they were joined by Hillary Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State. President and veep are then due to have lunch together at 12.30pm. Speculation that this could be a sign . that Clinton will replace Biden on the 2012 ticket is highly unlikely to . be anything beyond mischief-making and excessive optimism among . Republicans. Although, Obama . still has until the convention in Charlotte to change his running mate, . to ditch Biden at this point would be such a sign of panic and . desperation that the president would in all likelihood plummet in the . polls. Clinton, who could . well be the Democratic front runner in 2016 whether Obama is re-elected . or not, would be highly unlikely to want to take Biden's spot. If an Obama-Clinton ticket lost, the . former First Lady would be in a worse position than she is now to secure . the 2016 nomination. Even . if the ticket won and she became veep - often a strong position from . which to win the White House - her association with Obama could be a . political millstone by in four years’ time.

"By . Toby Harnden . PUBLISHED: . 00:57 EST, 17 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 17 August 2012 . Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, has admitted that he sought millions of dollars in federal government economic stimulus cash after twice denying he had done so. The embarrassing reversal was the first major campaign trail mistake made by the Wisconsin congressman and came as a new poll showed that he had put his home state into play for Mitt Romney, who is now leading President Barack Obama there. Ryan said that he had forgotten that his office had sent letters, which were signed by him, to the US Energy and Labour departments asking for money from the stimulus programme on behalf of two Wisconsin companies. 'They should have been handled differently, and I take responsibility for that,' Ryan said in a written statement released after an Ohio TV interview on Thursday in which he had once again denied requesting stimulus funds. Backtracking: Paul Ryan went back on his statement that he did not ask the federal government for stimulus cash, after a letter revealed that he did indeed ask for grant money in 2009 . The denial in an interview with Cincinnati's WCPO-TV contradicted letters he wrote in 2009 to Steven Chu , Energy Secretary, and Hilda Solis, Labour Secretary. Federal records show that one of the two companies, the non-profit Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation, later raked in $20.3million from the Energy Department to help homes and businesses improve energy efficiency. According to the Boston Globe, Ryan also told Boston's WBZ Radio two years ago that he 'did not ask for stimulus money' in response to a question about the recovery program. Request: Ryan said in letters to Energy Secretary Steven Chu that stimulus cash would help his state create thousands of new jobs . New audio has surfaced of Ryan telling the station that he 'did not ask for stimulus money' in response to a caller's question about the recovery program. Ryan said: 'I'm not one who votes for something and then writes to the government to ask them to send us money.' The exchange was first reported Thursday by The Boston Globe. But a year earlier in his request to Chu for funds for the Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corp., Ryan said the stimulus cash would help his state create thousands of new jobs, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The apparent contradiction underscores Ryan's conflicts with his larger federal budget proposal as the House Budget Committee chairman. That plan would slash Energy Department programs aimed at creating green jobs and calls for 'getting Washington out of the business of picking winners and losers in the economy - and that includes our energy sector.' Ryan's actions in Congress have been drawing fresh scrutiny since he was named last weekend as Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's running mate. The vice presidential contender is not alone among Republicans who criticized the stimulus plan only to seek money later. Georgia's Republican senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, for example, blasted the bill as a bloated government giveaway yet asked then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates to steer $50million in stimulus money to a constituent's bio-energy project. Like-minded: Mitt Romney, pictured Thursday in Greer, South Carolina, and Ryan both believe that the stimulus did not create private sector jobs . Ryan's views are also consistent with Romney's long-held position that the stimulus was a flawed idea that did not create private sector jobs. 'That stimulus didn't work,' Romney said at an Ohio speech in June. 'That stimulus didn't put more private-sector people to work.' Yet in Ryan's letter to the Labor Department in October 2009, he backed the Energy Center of Wisconsin's grant application for stimulus money 'to develop an industry-driven training and placement agenda that intends to place 1,000 workers in green jobs.' Economy questions: Ryan and Romney both agree that President Obama's stimulus plan 'did nothing to stimulate the economy' The company did not win the Labor Department grant, federal records show. Despite the letter, Ryan echoed Romney's position on Thursday. 'Regardless, it's clear that the Obama stimulus did nothing to stimulate the economy, and now the president is asking to do it all over again,' he said.","Ryan says his office asked the federal government for stimulus grant money after twice saying he did not ask for the funds .

Girlfriend Joanne Davies told the inquest how business management student Max kissed her goodbye on the morning of his death. She said: 'The last time I saw him he was rushing around the house before his exam, like a typical boy. 'I was forcing breakfast down him. He gave me a kiss and said goodbye but it wasn’t a lingering kiss like it was the last time. 'I had made him lunch. He was going to come back for it and I was waiting for him. 'The exam hall was three quarters of a mile from where he died. He had no reason to be there.' 'The only time we spent apart was when I was working.' In a note he wrote just before he jumped he told his family and girlfriend they had nothing to do with his death. But the reason why Mr Witkowski jumped out of the Cardiff Business School remains a mystery. The inquest heard his exams had gone well in the weeks leading up to his death and he had no personal problems anyone knew of. In the note he said: 'Not the fault of parents, Lee (sister) or Joe (girlfriend) I promise, sorry.' Mr Witkowski, of Guildford, Surrey, was in his second year of a business management degree at Cardiff University when he died last May. He was described as a 'calm and mellow' person who 'thought everything through'. Mr Witkowski jumped from Cardiff Business School university building on the morning he was supposed to be in an exam. He was found unconscious on the road beneath the building. Cardiff coroner Mary Hassel said the reason for Mr Witkowski’s death remained a mystery. She said: 'The picture I have is of someone who wasn’t just not depressed but was happy. 'He was doing fine in his exams and was in a relationship and looking forward to going on holiday. 'On the day of his death Max was on his own and seen pacing around the revision room and then, although no one saw him leave the window, he must have jumped. 'But I have to be sure of the evidence. 'It is a very unusual in my experience for their not to be at least one piece of evidence that the deceased was considering taking their own life. 'There simply isn’t any shred of evidence anywhere.' Ms Hassel said a psychotic episode could be responsible for Mr Witkowski’s mysterious death. She said: 'Sometimes people in Max’s age group will have an epsiode for the first time in their lives and that can be the first sign that something may be wrong.

A young woman has spoken of the pain of not being able to remember the first 17 years of her life after a car crash wiped out her memory. Christina Corp, 25, lost memories of birthdays, Christmas, boyfriends and even her first kiss after the accident which left her with serious head and brain . injuries. In a 13-week coma, her family were told she would . die four times, but she defied doctors to survive. Tragically, Miss Corp's friend Vicky Waters was killed when the Ford Fiesta collided with a coach of schoolchildren on the A32, a winding road from Fareham to Alton. Miss Corp, 25, from Stubbington, Hampshire said: . 'It is upsetting to lose all those . childhood memories but I have lots of things to look forward to and I am . still alive which is a blessing. 'I know everyone's faces, their telephone numbers, how I know them but I had forgotten every single experience we had together. 'I cannot remember any birthdays or Christmases I have had. The family holiday memories or even my first kiss which is horrible. 'I have also lost memories of boyfriends and roles in school plays. Anything that happened in the first 17 years of my life is gone.' The impact of the crash affected one side of her face, with nerve endings, one eye and her jaw damaged. Miss Corp's parents Jackie and Danny kept a vigil by her bedside during her recovery in 2004. 'At that stage she wasn’t responding to pins in her fingers and toes, and we were told she had such brain damage that the only thing she’d ever be able to do is breathe for herself,' said Mrs Corp to the Portsmouth Anglican. Scene of smash: Her parents were told four times it was likely she would die after the horrific crash on the A32, a winding road from Fareham to Alton . Amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories. It is usually caused by disease or head injury, but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously. The memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person's past or just portions of it. In most cases, it is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours. But in severe cases, it can last months or even years. There are several different types of amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness. Usually, the affected person cannot remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all, but their memories of the distant past are intact, and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes. Retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year, before the patient starts to remember things. But in some cases where the trauma to the head has been severe, memory may never be recovered. 'We were told she’d be unlikely to . ever leave hospital. One consultant even said there was a point when . they might be asking to withdraw treatment. 'But . the prayer really worked. She didn’t get a serious infection, she . didn’t get bedsores, and she started to kick her legs around. We’d been . told she’d never come out of the coma, so that was exciting.' When Miss Corp eventually awoke she could remember loved ones, but could not recall the experiences they had together. She added: 'I woke up and could not remember what I had done with my family but remember them as people. It was very terrifying. 'I . went back to old holiday destinations to see if I could remember . anything but apart from some deja-vu I could not remember anything. Miss Corp knows that she got an A* for her English literature and language GCSEs. 'I still have trouble remember things now which is part of the after affects of my brain injuries. I can remember things but I will have some short-term memory loss now and again.' A talented musician and writer Miss Corp now helps other families whose loved ones are in comas, reassuring them to never give up hope. Miss Corp said: 'When I woke up they said I would never walk or talk. I would just breathe and be a permanent vegetable. They were a bit wrong. 'My mum and dad had faith in me and because of that faith that got me out of my coma I believe. 'I want to show people just how much a brain injured person can do. 'I had to relearn to walk and talk and do everything again. It was like being a newborn baby It is amazing I had pulled through and I am proud of myself.' The charity shop worker who will never get the memories back, also runs a music group for disabled people to help them on their road to recovery.","Christina Corp, 25, suffered serious head and brain injuries when a car she was in collided with a bus - her friend was killed .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 23:34 EST, 19 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:16 EST, 20 August 2012 . The wife of a fallen Chinese politician who confessed to killing her lover, British businessman Neil Heywood, has today avoided execution. A Chinese court sentenced Gu Kailai, wife of ousted politician Bo Xilai, to death with a two-year reprieve for murdering a British businessman, two witnesses to the closed-door hearing said. The sentence means that Gu is likely to face life imprisonment - which would in effect mean her serving about 14 years in jail - provided she does not commit offences in the next two years. Scroll down to watch the sentencing . In the dock: Gu Kailai, the wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai, was sentenced today over the killing of Neil Heywood . He Zhengsheng, a lawyer for Mr Heywood, said Gu Kailai was given the suspended death sentence by the court in Hefei. Afterwards, a court spokesman said Gu’ s sentence had been reduced . because the judges believed Mr Heywood had ‘used threatening words’. The . court also found Gu’s actions reflected a ‘psychological impairment’ but did not elaborate. Zhang Xiaojun, an aide to the Bo household, was jailed for nine years for acting as an accomplice to the poisoning of Heywood. State broadcaster CCTV showed a calm-looking Gu wearing a black suit, hands folded in front of her, peering straight ahead in the packed courtroom as she accepted the verdict. No foreign reporters were allowed in. Gu said: 'I think the verdict is just. It fully reflects the court's special respect toward the law, reality and life.' During the trial last week, Gu admitted to poisoning the businessman in November, and alleged that a business dispute between them led him to threaten her son, Bo Guagua, according to state media. She confessed to luring her former lover to a hotel . room where she got him drunk and then laced his drink with cyanide. The . alleged motive behind 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s grisly death was . revealed at the murder trial of Mrs Gu, dubbed the Jackie Kennedy of China. Facing trial: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court . No contest: During the trial Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison . The court room in Hefei, Anhui province was packed with people listening to hear the fate of the murderer. She avoided the death penalty . Her lawyer even argued that affable Mr Heywood, a father of two young . children, ‘should bear some responsibility’ for his own murder. Mrs Gu appeared in court two weeks ago alongside her co-accused – family . bodyguard Zhang Xiajun, 33, who is alleged to have prepared the poison – . where they both entered pleas but they did not contest the murder charge against them. The court heard the Jaguar-driving . Englishman had fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ with Mrs Gu’s party-loving . son Bo Guagua, 24, whom Mr Heywood had once mentored to secure a place . at his alma mater, Harrow School. A police officer stands guard outside Hefei Intermediate People's Court today. TV cameras were set up outside awaiting the sentencing of Gu Kailai . Keeping watch: In heightened security conditions, to police officers stand behind tape in bushes close to the court ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble . Mr Bo, known for a love of champagne . and shisha parties while studying at Oxford University, was allegedly . told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be . destroyed,’ the judges heard, according to a reliable source who was in . the courtroom. Under threat: An undated photo of businessman Neil Heywood who was murdered in November last year . During the trial, the court heard how Mr Heywood and his murderer had an affair which ended in assassins attempting to kill him. Bodyguard Michael Wright, who protected Neil Haywood . during his affair with Gu, told the court how . he fought off three Chinese assassins in an attempt on the old . Harrovian’s life. Michael Wright and his team were . protecting the couple during the time they shared a flat in Bournemouth . and revealed that the exposure of the affair led to a serious threat to . Neil Heywood's life when three men tried to break into their home. His interview comes the days after . Gu Kailai appeared in court in China accused of killing Neil Heywood after he made a threatening . demand for £13million from her playboy son. Mr Wright said the team were surprised . by three Chinese henchmen under orders to kill Mr Heywood after a spy, . posing as a cook, has exposed the affair in 2001. He said the three men attempted to break into the flat using martial arts but were fought off and fled. Mr Wright said that despite the . attempt on his life Mr Haywood and Mrs Gu became increasingly relaxed . about their affair and would enjoy romantic dates at local restaurants. 'We respect the court's decision,' He Zhengsheng, a lawyer for the Heywood family, told reporters. He and another witness to the hearing, . which was barred to all but a few journalists from official Chinese . media, revealed the verdict outside the courtroom. They both also said Zhang Xiaojun, an . aide to the Bo household, was sentenced to nine years in prison for . acting as an accomplice to the poisoning of Heywood. Political scandal: Gu Zailai, left, with her husband - former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai. The murder case is one of China's biggest political scandals . Implicated: The official allegation against Gu suggests Heywood might have been making threats against her son Bo Guagua, 24 . Gu's sentencing could be a prelude to . formal punishment of Bo Xilai, a brashly ambitious politician under . investigation for alleged violations of party discipline - an accusation . that covers corruption, abuse of power and other misdeeds. After the party leadership decides on those allegations, Bo Xilai could also face criminal charges related to the murder case. Bo's hopes for securing a spot in . China's next top leadership unravelled after his former police chief, . Wang Lijun, fled to a U.S. consulate in early February for about 24 . hours and exposed the murder allegations. Bo, the son of a revolutionary, ran . the southwestern city of Chongqing where Heywood was killed. Bo was seen . as competing for a place in the Politburo Standing Committee, the body . at the pinnacle of power in China, at a once-in-a-decade leadership . transition later this year. His downfall has stirred more division . than that of any other leader for over two decades. To leftist . supporters, Bo was a charismatic rallying figure for efforts to reimpose . party control over dizzying, unequal market-led growth. But he made powerful enemies among those who saw him as an opportunist who wanted to impose his policies on the country. Bo was sacked as Chongqing boss in . March and Gu was publicly accused of the murder in April, when Bo was . suspended from the Politburo, a 25-member elite council that ranks below . the Standing Committee. He has yet to be expelled from that council. Four Chinese policemen have also . admitted to charges that they sought to protect Gu from investigation - a . development that could also prove dangerous for Bo. Police sources in Chongqing have said . Bo tried to shut down the investigation into his wife after being told . she was a suspect. Bo has not been seen in public since March, when he . gave a combative defence of his policies and family at a news conference . during China's annual parliament session. The murder trial comes at a sensitive time in China with a handover soon of power to younger leaders. Looking far plumper in the dock than before she was arrested, there was speculation yesterday that the world was watching Gu Kailai’s ‘body double’ rather than the woman herself. Micro-bloggers believe the government used a stand-in for Gu at the trial because her appearance has changed so radically since she has been in custody. She has put on weight, when most prisoners in Chinese jails shed pounds. Some are blaming her puffy appearance on the medication used to treat her ‘mental state’, though few are convinced. Controversy: Looking far plumper in the dock, left, than before she was arrested, right, there was speculation yesterday that the world was watching Gu Kailai’s ‘body double’ rather than the woman herself . The Financial Times quoted two security experts ‘familiar with facial recognition software’, who said the person shown in state television footage of the courtroom was not Gu. If true, the real Gu could have done a deal with Communist Party chiefs and be spending her time under house arrest in far comfier surroundings than a jail. Though it may seem far-fetched, the use of a body double by the rich and powerful in China is well documented by the media. In May 2009, wealthy 20-year-old Hu Bin killed a pedestrian when drag-racing through the city streets of Hangzhou. In court, Hu is believed to have hired a body double to serve his three-year sentence. The same year, a hospital president who caused a deadly traffic accident hired an employee's father to ‘confess’ and serve as his stand-in. In another case, after hitting and killing a motorcyclist, a man driving without a licence hired a substitute for £5,000. Meanwhile, the owner of a demolition company that illegally demolished a home earlier this year hired a destitute man and promised him £20 for each day his ‘body double’ spent in jail. The practice is so common that there is even a term for it - ding zui. Ding means ‘substitute’ and zui means ‘crime’, in other words, ‘substitute criminal’.

A Heathrow worker drove his baggage cart into the side of the plane causing over £1 million of damage after forgetting how big his vehicle was. Terrified passengers had to be evacuated from the stricken airliner after the costly collision which knocked one of the crew off her feet as she stood in the cockpit just minutes before the Airbus 321 was due to take off. Engineers later found the vehicle had 'sliced through' the aircraft's tail - just inches from its fuel line, Uxbridge Magistrates' Court heard. The Scandinavian Airlines plane was out of service for 138 days as extensive repairs were needed after the collision (file picture) The cost of fixing the Scandinavian Airways plane is estimated to have been up to £1.2m - but high loader driver Dennis Jackson, 60, was yesterday fined just £250 over the incident after magistrates heard he had forgotten which vehicle he was driving. The jet's 175 passengers were boarding on the jetway at around 10.15am on June 12 this year when the accident happened at Terminal 3. Amanda McCabe, prosecuting, said the aircraft shook violently during the crash, while another member of ground crew feared the impact 'would cause a fire.' She said: 'The damage was very clear - it had sliced through the rear of the aircraft, causing extensive damage. 'The fuel line was very close to where it had impacted, and there were passengers and crew on the aircraft - it was preparing to move away from the stand. 'This collision was due to the defendant not following instructions contained within the Heathrow Airport Operational Safety Instructions.' After being evacuated, the plane remained out of action for 13 days while repair crews brought it back to working order. The plane's rear access door remained jammed shut and later had to be hammered open because its metal locks had been bent. High loaders are used by ground crew to move luggage around airports, and can be raised to meet the height of a plane's hold. Accident: The collision took place at Heathrow Airport, Britain's largest (file picture) Bethan Charnley, defending, said Jackson was responsible for an 'expensive accident' after forgetting he was driving the largest type of the vehicle. The high loader in question had earlier that day been used to lift a car into an aircraft's hold, she said. 'This wasn't needed any more, and he was asked to take that back,' she said. 'Unfortunately the difference in size led to the accident occurring - Mr Jackson is used to driving the regular-sized one. 'He misjudged the distance and failed to take into account the width and height. 'His misjudgement was something that lasted a matter of moments, he wasn't going fast, wasn't taking any shortcuts or acting in a risky manner. 'He is extremely sorry that this accident occurred. He has been devastated by this. If he could go back and have that moment again he certainly would be careful.' Ms Charnley added Jackson had an 'exemplary record' since being hired by contractor Dnata in January 2006. The lawyer said guidelines issued by airport owner BAA recommended that cones were laid out clearly marking which areas were safe to drive in, but these had not been followed. After the crash, Jackson was fined one week's wages and handed a final written warning, but his employers were said to be awaiting the outcome of today's case before deciding whether to take further action. Handing the driver a £150 fine and ordering him to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge, chair of the bench Marilyn Levene said he had made a 'genuine mistake.' His driving licence cannot be endorsed with penalty points because the incident, which breaches Heathrow Airport byelaws, did not take place on a public road. 'We do feel very sorry that this happened to you,' said Mrs Levene. 'We do accept this was a momentary lapse in concentration after, clearly, a very good career.' Jackson, of Ashford, Middlesex, admitted driving without due care and attention in breach of section 5(1)(b) of the Heathrow Airport - London Byelaws 1996. Following his guilty plea, the prosecution offered no evidence on a separate charge under the same byelaws of driving in a way likely to cause danger or nuisance.","Driver ordered to pay £250 in fines and costs for £1.2m accident .

Occurrences of full-frontal nudity on prime-time, network television have soared by an incredible 6,300 per cent in the last year. There were a total of 64 cases of people . going au naturel on the five major networks - CBS, NBC, FOX, ABC, and . the CW - in the 2011-12 season. That figure stands in remarkable contrast to the single instance of full-frontal nudity the year before. In the Buff: This shot from the May 29, 2012 episode of Cougar Town contributed to the shocking rise - 6,300 per cent - in cases of full front nudity on network television during the 2011-'12 primetime season . The slow trend from Buck Rogers to 'buck naked' began in the '90s with shows like NYPD Blue, but has become old-hat for current titles like The Office, Two and a Half Men, The Bachelor, and Don't Trust the B ---- in Apartment 23, all cited in The Parents Television Council (PTC) study. In all, the analysis recorded 76 incidents of 'full nudity' on 37 shows during the 2011-12 prime-time network lineup. During the prior season, or from 2010-11, PTC notched just 15 instances on 14 shows. That's a 407 per cent jump over the course of a single year, alone. The study, which tracked TV shows . from September 1 to May 31, drew the distinction between full nudity . and full-frontal nudity. The networks used . various techniques to blur character's sex organs from the audience's . view, the study showed. The numbers exclude any animated . nudity or suggested full nudity in which a person is assumed to be nude . on the top, but a portion of their body is blocked by a . conveniently-placed table or sofa, for instance. Calling HR!: Among the biggest offenders was NBC's hit show, The Office, which often showed characters baring it all, as was the case in this January episode . The study recorded a 2700% jump in the use of blurring or pixilation to cover body parts - as is the case in the scene from The Office - in 2011-'12 compared to the prior year, when networks did so only two times . In all, the study cited 76 incidents of 'full nudity' on 37 shows, like The Bachelor, pictured above, in 2011-'12. On the last season, or during 2010-'11, the Parents Television Council notched . just 15 instances on 14 shows . Network Nudity: The study, which cited this scene from a January episode of the show Suburgatory, focused on the prime-time lineups of the five major networks, or NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and the CW. However, the study did include scenes in which individuals are completely unclothed and only the sexual organ is blocked from the viewer. The study focused on prime-time, broadcast television, including network specials, but excluding news and sports. Surprisingly, the study stated that almost 70 per cent of the scenes showing full nudity during the 2011–12 study period were on shows that aired before 9pm and as early as 7pm. In comparison, a half of the full nudity scenes recorded aired after 9pm the previous year. Of the five major networks, NBC actors most often appeared in the buff, with the study recording 37 occurrences of its characters going nude during the 2011-'12 prime-time season. Second was ABC with 24 recorded instances, while CBS came in third with eight cases of full nudity. Fox and the CW brought up the rear, so to speak, with three and four instances, respectively.

The parliamentary head of Angela Merkel's party has warned that crisis-wracked Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' ahead of talks this week between the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due . to visit Berlin on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French . President Francois Hollande the next day. According to Greek media, Samaras . will discuss extending a deadline for Greece to make budget cuts in return for its next slice of aid . while stopping short of making a formal request. Warning: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, right, is expected to discuss extending the deadline for Greece to make budget cuts. But German MP Volker Kauder, left, says Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' The Financial Times reported today that Samaras would ask for two more years to make the demanded cuts. But Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, told Der Spiegel weekly: 'The Greeks have to stick to what they have promised. There is no room for manoeuvre, either in terms of time or substance. 'That would be yet another agreement broken. That's exactly what led us to this crisis.' Greece's debt stands at more than 300 . billion euros ($372 billion), and its economy is struggling through a . fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. In an interview published today, Samaras insisted . that Athens doesn't want more money from creditors, but made clear it . would like more time to enact reforms and spending cuts. He vehemently rejected the suggestion . that it might be better for Greece to leave the 17-nation euro and . bring back its former currency, the drachma. Showdown: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due to visit Berlin for talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel, right, on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French President Francois Hollande, left, the next day . That, he told Germany's mass-circulation Bild daily, would result in 'a catastrophe for Greece' and economic collapse. Samaras pledged before coming to . power to seek a two-year extension to the deadline for implementing . unpopular cuts demanded in exchange for two massive international aid . packages worth 240 billion euros that are keeping Greece afloat. But delays in implementing reforms . and austerity measures have fueled impatience in Germany - the largest . single contributor to the bailouts - and other eurozone countries. German officials and lawmakers have . made clear they're in no mood to grant significant concessions, and . speculation has grown that Greece will have to leave the euro. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the eurozone finance ministers' meetings, was due in Athens today. 'Let me be very clear: we are not asking for extra money,' Samaras was quoted as telling Bild. 'We stand by our commitments and the . implementation of all requirements. But we must encourage growth, . because that reduces the financing gaps. 'All we want is a little ""air to . breathe"" to get the economy going and increase state income,' Samaras . added, without specifying any timeframe. 'More time does not automatically mean more money.' Asked whether Greece needs a second . debt writedown following one carried through earlier this year, Samaras . replied: 'that has never been discussed.' Some German politicians have talked . openly in recent weeks about the possibility of Greece leaving the euro, . and the vice chancellor, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, has said . that the idea of a Greek exit has 'lost its horror.' Difficult times: Greece's debt stands at more than 300 billion euros, and its economy is struggling through a fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. This picture shows a view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon in Athens . But Athens insists the country must . remain in the euro - something which opinion polls have shown the vast . majority of Greeks want. Asked by Bild whether a return to the . drachma would be better, Samaras replied that 'the consequences would . be a catastrophe for Greece.' 'It would mean at least five more . years of recession and push unemployment above 40 percent,' he was . quoted as saying. 'A nightmare for Greece: economic collapse, social . unrest and an unprecedented crisis of democracy.' Auditors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- known as the Troika -- will release a report in mid-September on Greece's progress towards achieving the required austerity. According to Der Spiegel, this report will call for Athens to slash 14 billion euros ($17 billion) from its budget over the next two years, 2.5 billion euros more than originally demanded. Der Spiegel said the extra cuts were needed because planned privatisations were not shaping up to be as lucrative as hoped and tax revenues were falling short of forecasts as Greece struggles through its fifth year of recession. Kauder reiterated that Europe should strive to keep Greece in the eurozone, but stressed that the Troika report would be the basis for further decisions. 'We should do everything to stick together. When the first difficulties appear, you don't throw the children out of the house. I am going to wait to see what the Troika says,' Kauder said.","Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due .

The pit bull that was shot in the head by a New York City police officer on a crowded street two weeks ago is making swift recovery, according to officials. The dog named Star was gunned down in the East Village after it lunged at police officers trying to approach the animal’s homeless owner, Lech Stankiewicz, who was apparently having a seizure. The wounded pup was taken to the Manhattan Care Center, where it has been receiving veterinary care since the August 13 incident. Road to recovery: Star the pit bull pictured napping while recovering from a gunshot wound to the head it suffered after lunging at an NYPD officer . According to a New York City Animal Care and Control spokesman, Good Samaritans donated money through the Special Treatment and Recovery Fund (STAR)  set up for the dog to cover its medical expenses, which so far have reached nearly $10,000. The . spokesperson said that most of the dog’s injuries were contained inside its . mouth. Star is expected to undergo surgery this week, and it is likely . that doctors will have to remove one of the pup’s eyes. Since the dog’s owner had failed to reclaim Star by the 8pm deadline last Friday, ACC was given legal ownership of the pooch. Once . Star is released from the animal hospital, the ACC expects to hand over . the pit bull to the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals. Bad news: Officials said the pooch is expected to undergo a surgery and will likely lose an eye due to its injury . The New York Daily News reported that it was not Star’s first encounter with police. On .

Mental health nurse Michael Miller was banned from working after allegations of maintaining an inappropriate relationship with a patient emerged . A  vile nurse who snuggled up to watch a film with a patient and quipped ‘Sadistic rape and Terry’s Chocolate Orange, what could be better?’ has been banned for a year. Michael Miller told the vulnerable woman he wanted to molest her, bombarded her with letters and e-mails and arranged to meet her outside work. He has now been sacked from his job at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. During one liaison he asked, ‘What do you think are my chances of getting a s***?' Miller insisted the allegations against him were fabricated. But a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found a string of charges against him proved and suspended him from the nursing register for 12 months. Chairman Linda Read said: ‘By pursuing an inappropriate relationship with Miss A, Mr Miller demonstrated an abuse of trust.’ She added: ‘We find most alarming the fact that Mr Miller refers to himself as the party who is vulnerable to that risk. ‘Mr Miller has continued to demonstrate a disregard for Miss A’s welfare. Miller first met the woman, referred to in the hearing as Miss A, when she was referred to Weald Mental Health Centre in Crawley, West Sussex, after falling victim to a sex attack. She received treatment between 2006 and 2008. In that time she had one to one sessions with Miller and would talk about her personal problems and her feelings towards being raped. When she told him she DJed at a local over-30s club he arranged to attend a gig once her therapy was over. It was at this show, in April 2009, he asked about ‘getting a shag’. Later Miller - who texted, e-mailed and wrote a letter to Miss A - arranged to spend an evening at Miss A’s house. There they watched a film together. ‘The film was known by both parties to have a rape scene in it and Miss A  left the room when it came on,’ said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC. Weald Day Hospital was based in Crawley Hospital, though it was run by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . ‘When she returned back into the room with chocolate in her hand he said, “Sadistic rape and Terry’s Chocolate Orange, what could be better?”.’ He then said to her: ‘I keep thinking about trying to molest you but I am scared you will break my jaw?’ Later, he added: ‘Whenever I think about trying to touch you one of the cats keeps getting in the way’. Miss A was so upset she sent Miller an email telling him she wanted to stop seeing him. He was found guilty of having an inappropriate relationship with Miss A, making comments of a sexual nature towards her, and making inappropriate comments towards her having knowledge of her history of being abused. The relationship was said to have occurred between April 2009 and January 2010. Miller was cleared of plying Miss A with alcohol, making racist comments and dishonestly informing his supervisor that he did not meet Miss A at her house. A spokesperson for Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said, 'We dismissed Miller when these allegations came to light and reported the case to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 'We never tolerate behaviour that crosses professional boundaries and we always take action in this way to safeguard the people who use our services.'","Nurse Michael Miller wanted to 'molest' woman .

A 19-year-old woman was arrested after allegedly stealing a three-day-old infant after she bought $16 scrubs across the street from a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hospital then posted as a nurse took the child from his mother's arms as she sat in her hospital room. Breona Moore smiled broadly for TV cameras and blamed her mother, father and boyfriend for the alleged kidnapping as she was led away in handcuffs on Thursday afternoon. The disappearance of Bryce Coleman for five hours Thursday set off a frantic search by police and the staff at Magee-Womens Hospital. He was found safe when police discovered Moore hiding in a stair well in an office building near the hospital. Safe: Bryce Coleman was found safe five hours after he was stolen from his mother in the hospital . Surrounded: Breona Moore, 19, seemed unrepentant as she was led away by police after her arrest . Perp walk: Breona Moore, 19, of McKeesport, is led into police headquarters for questioning . Booked: Moore was arraigned today on charges she kidnapped the 3-day-old infant . Authorities say Moore walked into a uniform shop across the street from the hospital Thursday morning and purchased a black nurse scrub top with the hospital's logo on it. The top was priced at $17.99, but she claimed she worked at the hospital and received a 10 percent discount. Her final price for the nurse's uniform -- $16.19, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Now disguised as a nurse, Moore walked into the hospital and wandered, before finding Rhonda King, 27, in her hospital room with Bryce. 'She said she was taking the baby to get a checkup, that she would bring the baby right back,' Thelma Broughton, Bryce's grandmother, told the Post-Gazette. Ms King willingly handed over the infant, believing Moore was a nurse.  'But she never came back,' Ms Broughton said. Bryce is Ms King's fifth child. Authorities said Moore walked around the hospital with the child for 15 to 30 minutes before cutting off the infant's radio monitor tag and walking out the door with him. Recovered: Three-day-old Bryce Coleman is carried to an ambulance by a Pittsburgh Police Officer and was later returned to his mother . When Bryce was not returned to Ms King, she called hospital staff, who realize the infant had been taken. Police found the child after Moore's family called detectives and said they feared she may have taken the child.  Moore's parents said she claimed that she was pregnant and became enraged when no one believed her. Police believe she might have stolen the child to prove to them that she was pregnant. She hinted at this as she leered at cameras and said: 'It's a lot when you lose a child' and added 'it wasn't just me. Mom, it's all your fault ... and, Dad, yours too,' she told reported as she grinned. Online court records don't list an attorney for Moore, who was arraigned by video from the Allegheny County Jail on charges she kidnapped little Bryce Coleman on Thursday. She remained jailed unable to post $250,000 bond and was ordered to undergo a mental evaluation by a city court judge. Where was he: Police searched vehicles at Magee-Womens Hospital during a lockdown of the hospital after a baby was kidnapped . Reinforced: Pittsburgh police line the front of the Life Uniform Shop on Forbes Avenue in Oakland, where the alleged kidnapper was hiding . Police Cmdr. Thomas Stangrecki said Moore quickly became a suspect after the baby's kidnapping early Thursday afternoon. That's because Moore's family contacted police after hearing media reports to say Moore had told them and made Facebook posts that she was pregnant. Moore's build apparently made her claims at least somewhat credible, as a criminal complaint lists her at 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, but Stangrecki said her family doubted the claims enough to call police as soon as they heard of the kidnapping. According to a criminal complaint, Moore told police after her arrest that 'she had convinced people that she was pregnant and told people she had just had a baby.' Moore had claimed to have a C-section on Monday and that the baby would be released on Thursday because he was sick and needed additional care. Moore had posted the message, 'Ooh My I Just Wanna Give Him So Much Love' on Facebook after previously posting pictures of herself, supposedly pregnant, as well as ultrasound images in recent months. UPMC officials said in a statement that they're cooperating with police and 'will be reviewing this event to see what improvements could be made in our security procedures.' Moore, wearing hospital scrubs she bought from a store nearby, entered the hospital Thursday and was seen loitering by one employee who noticed she didn't have an identification badge and asked Moore whether she was coming on duty or just leaving. Moore told that employee she was getting off duty, the police complaint said. Family grief: Charmaine King, 54, bottom, the grandmother of a Bryce Coleman, is consoled by her niece, Quevonna Oaks, 22, outside of the hospital before Bryce was found safe . When another employee saw Moore near the baby's mother's room, Moore pretended to be the sister of the baby's mother, Rhonda King, and that she was waiting to drive her sister home. After the other employee left, however, Moore followed a discharge nurse into King's room and appeared to the baby's family to be a nurse's aide. The discharge nurse removed the security wristbands from King and the baby, who were preparing to leave the hospital, then left. That's when, police said, 'Moore approached King and took the baby from King and told her that one more physical test needed to be conducted on the baby and that she would return Bryce right away.' Instead, Moore went to a secluded area of the hospital and put the baby in a red zippered cloth handbag and left the hospital. Police later learned that Moore left the area outside the hospital quickly when she heard police sirens, and police quickly learned Moore had entered a downtown building with the baby, though police haven't said how they learned that. Moore was found hiding in a closet with the baby and arrested. Moore has been charged with kidnapping, concealing the whereabouts of a child, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, interference with custody of a child, reckless endangerment and falsely impersonating a nurse.","Breona Moore allegedly stole newborn Bryce Coleman .

French police investigating the suspected murder of a British expatriate by her French lover have made a DNA breakthrough. Patricia Wilson, 58, mysteriously vanished from her cottage in the picturesque village of Vabre-Tizac, near Toulouse, last month. French police launched a murder investigation after bloodstains were found in the cottage and a  car belonging to Ms Wilson’s gardener, Jean-Louis Cayrou, 50. Missing: Frenchman Jean-Louis Cayrou has been accused of killing Patricia Wilson after she ended their relationship . He was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been detained in a top-security prison. This weekend, detectives confirmed that the blood found in Cayrou’s Renault saloon was from the body of Ms Wilson. The forensic evidence supports prosecutors’ claims that Ms Wilson was killed by Cayrou in her house. He is believed to have transported the . body in his car and buried or dumped it in one of the many forests and . lakes that surround the £250,000 cottage in South-West France. The pair had a relationship that Ms . Wilson ended a few weeks ago, prompting Cayrou to allegedly . unsuccessfully try to strangle her. Suspect: An ID photo of Jean-Louis Cayrou taken in 1990 . He is then thought to have planned . her murder, waiting for her in bushes as she returned from a trip home . to England on August 17. Now, detectives hope the DNA tests . will ‘persuade’ Cayrou to lead them to Ms Wilson’s corpse, which police . search teams have been  unable to find. Cayrou has vehemently denied any involvement in the crime since his arrest a week ago. He is believed to have told prosecutors that the blood in his car was from animals that he hunted. Deputy prosecutor Patrick Desjardins, . who is leading the murder inquiry, said: ‘The DNA of the victim has been . identified in some tested blood samples, which means we can confirm all . of the allegations already levelled at Mr Cayrou, and which has already . led to his indictment.’ The DNA was found in ‘items in the car’ rather than on the vehicle itself, said Mr Desjardins. Police involved in the case have speculated that Cayrou may have used ‘gardening equipment’ to carry out the alleged murder. Cayrou has been charged with murder, with his trial expected late next year at the earliest. Ms Wilson, a former advertising . executive from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, moved to the . beautiful, isolated village of Vabre-Tizac five years ago with her . long-term partner Donald Marcus, 54. However, the couple’s relationship . became strained and they  separated after Mr Marcus returned to England . for an operation last November. Isolated: The cottage in Vabre Tizac, north-east of Toulouse, where the murder allegedly took place . Suspicious find: Police launched a murder inquiry after spotting blood inside the property .

Many of today's acting heavyweights launched their careers as child stars - but little Elvis O'Connor's star quality was spotted before he was even born. The now 11-month old was snapped up by an acting agency after talent spotters were shown a scan of him in his mother's womb. Now Elvis has had his first taste of life in the spotlight after appearing in the ITV drama Mrs Biggs, playing the child of the infamous great train robber Ronnie Biggs. Early potential: This 3D scan of Elvis O'Connor in the womb was all it took for a talent agency to snap him up . Elvis' parents Andy, 34, and Shelley, 35, from Oldham, Manchester, sent a 3D scan of their son to Scream Management Agency while Shelley, an air hostess was still expecting him. Star quality: Elvis plays the child of train robber Ronnie Biggs in the ITV drama Mrs Biggs, which stars Sheridan Smith, pictured left . Clearly impressed with what they saw, talent spotters at the agency immediately put Elvis on their books. The baby boy is following in the footsteps of his big sister Alana, 5, who is also on the books at the casting agency. Mr O'Connor said: 'Elvis' sister Alana is already with the casting agency and when we found out we were expecting Elvis we sent them over a scan. 'They said they could tell he was going to look like his sister and that they would like to put him on their books. 'He was pretty much cast for Mrs Biggs before he was even born,' he added. Baby Elvis was just six months old when he filmed the scenes for Mrs Biggs, which stars actress Sheridan Smith in the title role. And it seems that - despite still being in nappies - Elvis is already the consummate professional on set. 'Everyone loved him on set and he was really well behaved,' said Mr O'Connor, a construction worker. Big sister Alana has already had several acting roles. Jess Bell, of Scream Management, said: 'Both Elvis and Alana are very talented.' ITV's Mrs Biggs tells the story of the notorious train robber from the perspective of his wife, Charmian. The five-part drama chronicles the life of Charmian - played by Gavin and Stacey actress Sheridan Smith - from her first meeting with Ronnie as a teenager, to the devastating consequences of the Great Train Robbery in 1963.

The small blaze is understood to have been in a room at the House of Commons end of the building in the early hours of this morning. Sources said there was no significant damage but areas were being cordoned off because of the potential danger from toxic substances such as asbestos. Blaze: Areas of the Houses of Parliament were closed off this morning after a fire . Areas including the Commons chamber were off-limits to members of the public as a result. It came days after it was warned The Houses of Parliament could close for up to five years under plans to carry out a £3billion taxpayer-funded refurbishment. MPs would be forced to relocate to a replica chamber if the plans to overhaul the Grade I listed building go ahead. It would be the first time that the Commons and Lords has been left empty since the Second World War. Commons officials have warned that the historic building is suffering from chronic subsidence, electrical problems, fire risks, plumbing leaks and is full of asbestos. Even the boilers, dating from before the Second World War, are said to be 'ready to blow'. The worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of Tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground car park. These have caused Big Ben's bell tower to tilt 18 in from the vertical – enough for tourists to start noticing. Cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the Palace. The problem is so severe that MPs are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £500million for the Exchequer. The House of Commons commission, chaired by Speaker John Bercow has asked a group of MPs, peers and officials to report on options to save the building. They include building a new parliament, temporarily evacuating for refurbishment or continuing with decades of limited repairs during the summer holidays. The £3billion would not be spent until the next parliament, which begins in 2015. Between 1940-41, both Houses of Parliament were convened at Church House, Westminster, due to fears of bombing. They were hit 14 times by German air raids.","Areas close to the Commons chamber have been cordoned off .

The United States came second in the 2012 Web Index, new research measuring technological access to the web, availability of online content and the social impact of the Internet. Sweden topped the list, with the UK coming in third. Six of the countries listed in the top 10 ranking were European. The study, spearheaded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee -- the English computer scientist credited with inventing the world wide web in 1989, is considered a ground-breaking look not only at the technology of the web but also measuring how well a country is allowing its citizens to share information online and ultimately impact society. World wide web: Sweden was number on the list, with the U.S. at #2 and the UK third . Commissioned by the World Wide Web Foundation, the index looked at 61 developed and developing nations, offering the 'first multidimensional measure of the Web's growth, utility and impact.' With its number one spot, Sweden was found to have the greatest infrastructure to allow citizens to connect to the Internet (with a score of 96.76). The United States on the other hand was at the top in allowing full access to web content but the availability of the web remained out of reach to some citizens, below its Scandinavian counterpart. 'The U.S. has a lower percentage of households with personal computers than a raft of countries, including Canada, Ireland, Japan and Norway,' according to the study. Ground-breaking: The study has been praised as the 'first multidimensional measure of the Web's growth, utility and impact' The U.S. was also found to be sluggish in terms of internet speed and 'offers slower bandwidth per Internet user than a range of countries, most notably Iceland, Sweden and Singapore.'

Parents should take responsibility for stopping their children seeing internet pornography,  the new Culture Secretary said yesterday. Maria Miller said the Government was considering calls to make internet companies block access to online pornography. But the Conservative MP insisted that parents had the ‘first and foremost’ responsibility for monitoring their children’s use of the internet. Parental responsibility: New Culture Secretary Maria Miller has said the responsibility for stopping children looking at internet pornography lies 'first and foremost' with their parents . Mrs Miller added that the Government could play a role in advising parents on how to block damaging material on home computers. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an . automatic block on online porn unless over-18s specifically ask their . internet service providers to let them see such material, following . strict age verification. On Thursday, a petition signed by . 115,000 – including 140 MPs – was handed in to Downing Street, demanding . that internet service providers block online porn. A Government consultation on controls for online porn has now ended after receiving 2,000 responses. It also looked at measures to protect . children from other potentially harmful websites such as those which . promote suicide, anorexia, gambling, self-harm and violence. In an interview Mrs Miller, a mother . of three, said: ‘I think responsibility is very strongly with parents to . make sure that they really understand how their children are using the . internet . . . to make sure they are safe.’ She added: ‘I think probably the . awareness of those sorts of pieces of software you can buy or indeed . what you can do is not as high as it needs to be.’ Last week the Archbishop of York . warned of the ‘immeasurable misery and heartache’ caused by pornographic . sites, which make boys see girls as ‘sex objects’. Dr John Sentamu demanded  that . ministers ‘put children first’ by standing up to wealthy and powerful . internet companies  which are opposing moves to protect youngsters. Making a stand: The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said online porn websites caused 'immeasurable misery and heartache' Internet firms make millions from adverts for pornographic websites. Mrs Miller, who is also the . Government’s equalities minister, said she sympathised with parents . worried about what children were seeing online. ‘I’ve got three children and they all . use the internet and I am as concerned as any parent about making sure . my children are safe using the web,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy to keep up to  date with your kids’ intake of  these things.’ Her comments come as the number of . children calling ChildLine after seeing hardcore pornography has soared . by 34 per cent in a year, with girls reporting feeling pressured to copy . violent sexual behaviour. The NSPCC and ChildLine have backed . the Mail’s campaign after seeing a large increase in the number of phone . calls from children who had encountered hardcore material online.

Leading neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield has warned that images of . extreme pornography can cause long-term harm to children’s brains. The Oxford University professor said . the developing brain was  ‘vulnerable’ and that children needed to be . protected from premature sexualisation.

Career women who have a ‘compulsion’ to juggle a demanding job with being a domestic goddess are putting a strain on their marriages, according to an agony aunt. Denise Robertson believes some women put too much pressure on themselves to deliver at home and in the office and are reluctant to share the household chores with men. Miss Robertson, 78, the agony aunt on ITV’s This Morning, says that although careers have made women more independent and financially secure, and have freed them from some unbearable marriages, the result is that their world is more stressful. Domestic goddess: Agony aunt Miss Robertson says women working and being a domestic goddess can put a strain on their marriage . ‘Careers have given women independence, but gone is the tranquil world my mother knew,’ she writes in an article for the Radio Times. ‘In most two-career homes, it is women who still bear most of the domestic responsibility. ‘And not always because the man is lazy – there is an in-built compulsion in some women to remain domestic goddesses while holding down a demanding job.’ She describes how she grew up with very happily married parents and says that although they encountered many problems including business failure and the death of a child, her parents’ love for one another ‘sustained them’. She reveals how each morning as her father left for work ‘they would cling together in the hall, as if he were going to another continent’. She adds: ‘My sister and I would jeer from the stairs and call out “Hollywood” but we liked it all the same.’ Miss Robertson says modern couples can leave a marriage with greater ease if it is not working. But many are also guilty of being unwilling to work as hard to keep their marriages strong. She writes: ‘Why do so many marriages break down? ‘If I am right in thinking marriages in previous generations endured because the woman, in particular, had no means of escape, it was inevitable that women’s hard-won economic independence would make them unwilling to stay in an arrangement that had become unbearable. ‘Men, too, have been liberated from feeling they must stay because they are the sole breadwinner. Perhaps marriage breaks down more often today because we don’t work hard enough to keep it together. ‘Leaving simply because you can is defeatist and if our new independence makes us less likely to see marriage as a life-long commitment, that is sad.’ Career driven: Agony aunt says although careers have made women more independent, their world has become more stressful . Miss Robertson, who has been married three times and widowed twice, also criticises the trend for co-habiting, writing: ‘What I don’t understand is the present reluctance to commit to marriage while entering into the much greater commitment of parenthood. “I don’t feel we need this bit of paper,” they tell me. ‘But a marriage ceremony is much, much more than a bit of paper. A wedding lets you tell the world, ‘‘We belong together’’.’ The full interview with Denise Robertson is in this week’s Radio Times.","While careers have made women more independent, their world is more stressful, says Denise Robertson ."

Dangerous: Andrew Van Horne, nicknamed 'Heineken' because of his love of lager, mowed down two party-goers in his friend's car after being thrown out of the event . A driver was jailed for 10 years today for deliberately mowing down two people with a car as revenge for being thrown out of a Christmas party. Andrew Van Horne, nicknamed 'Heineken' because of his love of lager, used a friend's VW Bora as a weapon and drove so fast that he left one of his victims crippled for life. Van Horne, 41, carried out the dangerous manoeuvre after 'losing face' when he was ejected from the party following a row over a spilt drink. As guests were helping clean up outside the house at the end of the party, Van Horne began revving the car and drove towards three of them. Carl Rock, 47, a painter and decorator, broke both legs as the car pinned him against the lounge wall of the house. He has been told he may lose one or both of his legs because his injuries were so severe, and he may need a wheelchair. Another party guest, Claudine Henry, was also hit by the car but escaped with only cuts and bruises after Mr Rock managed to push her out of the way as the vehicle ploughed into him. Van Horne's intended target, the party's host Owen Irving, avoided the car, but the crash caused damage to the house costing £15,000 to repair. Manchester Crown Court heard today that the incident happened after a party in the Moss Side area of the city which was attended by up to 30 people on Boxing Day last year. During the party, an argument broke out after Van Horne, who had been drinking, accidentally spilt a drink over Mr Irving. Barrie Darby, prosecuting, told the court that Van Horne suddenly produced a knife and was thrown out but Mr Irving later spotted him lurking across the road in front of his car. As the party ended Mr Irving, Mr Rock and Ms Henry were tidying up outside when they heard a revving of a car and saw Van Horne driving at them. Sentencing: Van Horne was jailed for 10 years by a judge at Manchester Crown Court after being convicted at a previous hearing of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted wounding with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mr Darby said: 'The vehicle hit Rock, Henry and narrowly missed Irving. 'The vehicle then hit the house causing the front wall of the property to rupture and causes a hole in the wall of the house.' Van Horne, a father of two, managed to drive away before dumping the vehicle. He was traced after the registered owner of the car said he had lent it to him. Mr Darby said Mr Rock spent over two months in hospital but due to the severe nature of his injuries it was 'unlikely' that Mr Rock would ever walk normally again. In mitigation, defence counsel Mr Chudi Grant: 'This was not a pre-meditated assault, there was a short background to this where matters progressed, he has not gone out looking for trouble.' But Judge Michael Henshell, sentencing, told Van Horne: 'You were clearly in a bad mood after you were asked to leave the party. 'You clearly lost your temper and you went to a car which was parked on the opposite side of the house. 'There were a number of people outside tidying outside the property. They had nothing whatsoever to do with what had happened inside. 'You drove the car across the road and performed a U turn, aiming towards Mr Irving who was outside the house in between two vehicles. 'He was just out of the way and you collided with a van and between the van and the car Mr Rock was there. 'Damage to the front of the house is evidence of the force of the impact.' The judge said that Mr Rock, a father of three, would never return to work, needed crutches and may even require a wheelchair. 'His life has been affected in the most dramatic manner all because of your driving,' the judge continued. 'You used the car as a weapon to drive across the road towards people in that short space of time while intending to cause harm to Mr Irving. 'I’m sure you realise you could have killed someone. You were in a foul temper when seeking revenge or retaliation on Mr Irving.' Van Horne was convicted at a previous hearing of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted wounding with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In addition to his prison sentence, he was banned from driving for eight years. Outside court, Detective Constable Ian Wrench, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Van Horne left an absolute trail of devastation behind him that night - all over a spilt drink. 'Clearly his ego is so fragile that he could not take being ejected from a party and responded in the only way he could think of with shocking and totally unnecessary violence. 'His damaged pride resulted in one man suffering truly horrific and life-changing injuries.'","Andrew Van Horne, 41, drove at guests after being thrown out of a party in Manchester on Boxing Day last year .

On trial: Karen Cosford, 47, allegedly wrote saucy love notes to a convicted rapist she had a relationship with . A nurse at a high security prison accused of having a sexual relationship with an inmate allegedly wrote love letters to the prisoner. Karen Cosford, 47, told the court that she had been forced to write the letter addressed to convicted rapist Brian McBride, which included a promise of ‘the most sensual and close sex you have ever had’. The unsigned letter was discovered as officers searched for contraband when concerns were raised about McBride’s unsupervised access to areas on the healthcare wing at high security Wakefield Prison, where he was an inpatient. Allegedly written by Mrs Cosford, 47, the letter includes some very graphic expressions such as: ‘When I think of you inside me it brings a smile to my heart’ and ‘I will rag you around’. The letter was read out to the jury at Leeds Crown Court today where Cosford stands charged with misconduct in a public office over the alleged sexual relationship with McBride and supplying him with a mobile phone. Carolyn Falloon, 50, Jacqueline Flynn, 46, and David Sunderland, 49, who all worked on the wing, are also standing trial charged with one or both of the following offences - failing to notify prison authorities about the sexual relationship between Cosford and McBride, and failing to tell them McBride had a mobile phone. The note, recited to the jury by Prosecutor Richard Wright, read: ‘Right, I’m finding it difficult to write this note. I know how you feel but don’t know how to say it. ‘I realise it took us a long time to get it together and I have given you some terrible times in that period but we have come though it together and much stronger. ‘I didn’t realise how much I do miss you until I went on holiday. I could not get you out of my head and heart, everything I did you were at the forefront of my mind.

The federal air marshall who sheltered George Zimmerman for six-weeks after he shot Trayvon Martin appeared on Dr. Phil last night to say that his friend would be dead unless he had killed the Florida teenager. Mark Osterman, 44, a former Seminole County deputy who now lives in Lake Mary, appeared on the nationally syndicated television show and said that the Martin would have continued to ram his friends head against the floor and that Zimmerman's 'believes he would not be alive today', if he had not fired his own gun at the 17-year-old. On the program to plug their new book, 'Defending our Friend: The Most Hated Man in America', Osterman and his wife Sondra denied that Zimmerman, 28, was a 'Rambo' type of vigilante and claimed that he was 'heartbroken and devastated' over the killing. Scroll Down for Video . George Zimmerman's best friend Mark Osterman has appeared on Dr. Phil to defend him from accusations that he was a racist and murdered 17-year-old Trayvon Martin . Caring for Zimmerman at their Lake Mary home while a $10,000 bounty was put on his head by the New Black Panthers following the February 26th shooting, Mark and Sandra Osterman claimed that their friend acted in self-defence and would have died had Martin continued to slam his head against the ground. 'The injuries that he had to his head could not be sustained for any period of time without either becoming unconscious or dying,' said the husband and wife to Dr. Phil. Mark Osterman and his wife Sondra appear on Dr. Phil McGraw's show to defend George Zimmerman, their friend of six-years against accusations of murder . Mark Osterman (right) and his wife were confronted with Trayvon's step-mother, Alicia Stanley (left) who became extremely emotional as she spoke of Trayvon's death . The couple told Dr. Phil that they had known Zimmerman for six-years and described him as a 'nice, loving, sweet guy.' 'I am 100 percent convinced that he is completely innocent, that he stood his ground, that he was entitled to do so,' said Mark Osterman. The Ostermans added that it is a fact that Martin caused Zimmerman a concussion and would not have survived the assault if he hadn't shot Martin in the chest with his own weapon. 'There is no upside to this,' said Osterman. 'From what George told me, he believes he would not be alive today if he had not done that. 'According to what he told me, there was no time to think.' Trayvon Martin is an undated picture (left) was shot dead by George Zimmerman after buying Skittles (right) from his local convenience store on the evening of February 26th . George Zimmerman, a Florida Neighbourhood Watch volunteer is currently free on $1 million bail while he awaits trial for the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman has repeatedly said he killed the Miami Gardens teenager in self-defence. Mark Osterman is the first person that Zimmerman's wife Shellie called for help on February 26th following the shooting and Osterman went to the scene, accompanied Zimmerman to police interviews and took in the couple for six weeks as the case exploded into a national story. Osterman has already been interviewed by the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement on April 26th and most of what he repeated on television has been released prior to Zimmerman's trial. The federal air marshall has told agents that he taught Zimmerman how to shoot and that they even picked out the gun that killed Trayvon and went to the local gun range together around once a month. Together: Mr Osterman (centre left) is seen leaving the Seminole County Jail with George Zimmerman on July 6. Mark Osterman has said that his friend George . Zimmerman (centre) stayed at his home in Lake Mary for six weeks during . the height of the public outcry about the Trayvon Martin case . He vehemently denied that his friend profiled Trayvon as the prosecution claim and that he was a bigot. 'Is he a racist?' said Dr. Phil. 'Absolutely not,' replied Osterman. 'Is he a cowboy vigilante?' said Dr. Phil. 'Absolutely not,' said Osterman. The former police officers friendship with Zimmerman is controversial because many believe that he has coached Zimmerman on what to tell police. Indeed, the lead Stanford police investigator has said that Zimmerman's account of the shooting has sounded like it is scripted, which has led many to believe that Osterman has been behind his friends carefully constructed defence. Mark and Sondra Osterman told Dr. Phil that they are writing the book to raise funds for Zimmerman's defence. However, Zimmerman's legal team took to Twitter to put distance between themselves and the Ostermans. 'Osterman's book and TV spot, although well-intentioned, are ill-timed and done without input and NOT approved by the defence.' Mark Osterman and his wife Sondra attended George Zimmerman's wedding and Mark Osterman taught Zimmerman how to fire a gun properly . Safe house: This is the Osterman home in Lake Mary, Florida where Zimmerman stayed for six weeks . In addition to the Osterman's Trayvon's step-mother, Alicia Stanley made an emotional appearance on the television show. 'You sit her like you were proud: 'I picked that gun out.' she said to the Osterman's fighting through tears. Support: Osterman accompanied Zimmerman to every police interrogation about the Martin shooting . 'Why would you want people to know that? I know he's your friend, but that don't mean he's not a liar.' Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon because the unamrmed teen attacked him and during the assault tried to take his gun from him. Interviews released after the April round of interviews Osterman completed with the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement reveal his concerns for his life. ‘Zimmerman is frustrated with the new Black Panther party and is very scared of them,' said Osterman to the FBi and FDLE. ‘Zimmerman is very concerned with all the negative reaction from the press and others and wants more evidence released to show what really happened.’ Mr Osterman’s dubious employment history is also included in the notes. During his time as a deputy at the Seminole County sheriff's office, he was pressured to quit after he and another officer were fooled into working as security guards for a con man. The man, named Juan Diaz, approached Mr Osterman and another officer saying he was a second baseman for the New York Yankees and asked them to work as his body guard while going to strip clubs and bars in Florida. Mr Osterman resigned in 1998 after an administrative panel suggest he be fired because they did not get the bureaucratic approval to work an off-duty security shift. Since 2001, he has worked for the Department of Homeland Security as an air marshal, and on Facebook he describes his job as involving ‘lots of shooting and traveling’.","Mark Osterman and his wife Sondra appeared on the nationally syndicated show to defend George Zimmerman and explain the situation surrounding Trayvon Martin's death .

Car valeter Dale Lidster, 23, was arrested after being captured on CCTV hurling a balled up chip paper at his pal at the end of a night out last September. He denied the offence but was found guilty of littering at Skegness Magistrates' Court. The 23-year-old was fined £300 and ordered to pay £250 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Speaking after the case Lidster, from Horncastle in Lincolnshire, claimed the fine was 'ridiculous' and insisted the chip wrapper had been picked up straight away. 'I can't believe what has happened,' he said. 'Almost £600, it must be the most expensive bag of chips in the country.' The 23-year-old said he was struggling to see the funny side of his cheap late-night snack eventually costing him hundreds of pounds. 'It's not funny, not when you have to find £600 and when you haven't done anything wrong in the first place,' he said. Lidster said he intended to appeal against the decision.

A group of 75 Florida elementary school kids accompanied by teachers and parents arrived at the Pembroke Pines Walmart on Tuesday to perform ‘God Bless America’ in tribute to the September 11 victims, only to be turned away at the door. Officials at Coconut Palm Elementary School in Miramar said they had arranged in advance for the young chorus members, ages seven to 10, to stage the patriotic tribute, but a representative of the big-box store refused to honor the agreement, forcing the children to sing in the parking lot. But it was not the end of their troubles. After the group performed the song under a nearby flag that was at half-staff, police arrived on the scene in response to a report about a 'flash mob situation.' Ousted: A group of 75 children dressed in red, white and blue from a Florida elementary school performed 'God Bless America' under a flag in a Walmart parking lot after being booted out of the store . Mean-spirited: School officials said managers at the Pembroke Pines Walmart refused to let the kids sing at the store despite an earlier agreement . On Wednesday evening, a Walmart spokesperson issued an apology on behalf of the store at the center of the controversy, according to News Channel 5. 'We regret this happened and apologize to the students, parents and the school for this experience,' said the spokeswoman Kayla Whaling. 'Unfortunately, this was a situation of miscommunication, and it should have been handled differently. 'We're also inviting the kids back to the store to help honor the victims and fallen heroes.' The musical homage had been arranged with the Walmart management as part of the elementary school's 'I Will' campaign which encourages people to perform public service on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Principal Terri Thelmas said the patriotic routine was designed as a flash mob that was meant not only to honor the fallen, but also to raise the spirits of Walmart shoppers on this somber occasion. Do-gooders: The musical tribute to the victims of 9/11 was part of the Coconut Palm Elementary's 'I Will' campaign which encourages people to perform a public service . Damage control: After facing public criticism, Walmart issued an apology to the kids and a spokesperson said the chorus will be invited back to perform at the store . Thelmas explained that she contacted the store last week and was referred to a manager named Frank, who signed off on the performance at the store. However, when the children and staff arrived on Tuesday night, Frank was not there, and another manager turned them away after calling the chorus 'a liability.' Disappointed: Fourth-grader Adrianna DiSciascio, nine, said she and other children were crying after being ejected from the store without explanation . Being ousted from the store brought many children to tears as they had practiced hard for the big night. 'The wind was taken out of everybody's sails — from the parents to the teachers to the kids,' said Michael DiSciascio, whose nine-year-old daughter, Adrianna, was part of the chorus. 'We just wanted to honor the people who lost their lives and lost their families, but they just didn't know what was going on, so they just told us to leave,' Adrianna DiSciascio told NBC6. Despite their disappointment, the children regrouped in the Walmart parking lot and performed the song, which lasted a little over a minute. As the kids and parents were heading back to their cars, an officer arrived on the scene after receiving a complaint, but in the end, no action was taken as it was decided that the 'flash mob' was not a police matter. Some outraged parents took to social media sites, posting recordings of the musical tribute and taking the store to task for turning away young children who wanted to do something special to mark the tragic anniversary. The Walmart spokeswoman said the store plans to contact the school and arrange for the chorus to come back.","Seventy-five children from Coconut Palm Elementary School came to the Pembroke Pines Walmart to sing 'God Bless America'

The company has signed a four-year deal to show Aviva Premiership games from the 2013-14 season, one of the biggest broadcast agreements in the history of club rugby. But the announcement came as the company confirmed it will introduce a raft of inflation-busting price hikes next year.

Lucrative: Danny Care (right) and Manu Samoa Tuilagi (centre) do battle during this year's Aviva Premiership final between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers. BT has agreed to pay £152million to screen rugby matches . The rugby deal, which current rights-holders BSkyB and ESPN are thought to have considered overpriced, comes three months after BT forked out £738million to show 38 Premier League football matches per season. BT is expected to sign further agreements for the right to broadcast additional sports later this year in an attempt to attract subscribers from rivals BSkyB and Virgin Media. Marc Watson, chief executive of television service BT Vision, said: 'BT is serious about sport and this deal means we will be offering the very best rugby action alongside some of the mostthrilling football matches from the Premier League. 'That is a winning combination and one that will appeal to fans of both sports.' The agreement covers exclusive live broadcast rights to up to 69 rugby matches per season. Mark McCafferty, chief executive of Premiership Rugby, said: 'This is a game-changing agreement and will deliver a service that I know our club supporters will enjoy.' BT shares on the FTSE 100 Index rose by 2 per cent following the announcement, as BSkyB shares dipped by just under 1 per cent. But while investors in BT may have reason for optimism, customers face having to pay more for phone calls, broadband and TV packages.

Some services will see prices rise by 25 per cent - almost 10 times the rate of inflation, which currently stands at 2.6 per cent. BT's most popular phone calls plan - the Unlimited Anytime Plan - will cost £5.15 a month from January, a 5.1 per cent increase on the current monthly charge of £4.90. This package includes all landline calls, including those to 0845 and 0870 numbers, but does not include calls to mobiles. Customers without an inclusive package for calls will also be hit, as both daytime and evening rates will be raised. Daytime local and national calls will rise from 7.95p to 8.41p per minute and the cost of evening calls will go up from 1.05p to 1.11p per minute. Line rental will cost more from January, with prices increasing by 5.82 per cent. Most households have no choice but to pay this charge in order to receive broadband, even when their internet access is provided by another company. Customers who pay line rental charges by direct debit will see the price rise by 85p a month, from £14.60 to £15.45. Users who pay by cash or cheque face monthly line rental bills of £17.45. Price hikes: Daytime and evening rates for calls will rise for BT customers, and line rental for broadband will also become more expensive . The steepest price rises come for BT’s 728,000 Vision customers, who pay for TV channels. The monthly charge for the Vision Essentials plan - BT's cheapest TV deal - will rise by 25 per cent from £4 to £5. Sports channels will also be more expensive with some Vision packages seeing an increase of £2.70 a month. Total Broadband and Broadband Anywhere packages are to become about 5.8 per cent more expensive, although other 'bundled' packages are unaffected. BT has pledged to freeze 'key costs' after January until 2014. But this does not include all charges, and the company is to increase some of its early termination fees.

The Coalition was in turmoil last night over the future of onshore wind power, as furious Liberal Democrats demanded the new Tory energy minister is stripped of responsibility for renewable energy. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey reacted with consternation after John Hayes, a sceptic on wind farms, told the Daily Mail that Britain has had ‘enough’ of turbines ‘peppered’ across the country. David Cameron effectively backed his minister – who he told to ‘deliver a win for our people’ on wind power when he was appointed last month – telling MPs it was time for a debate about the future of the technology. Anger: Ed Davey, left, reacted with consternation yesterday after John Hayes told the Daily Mail that he had 'had enough' of wind farms . ‘We have got a big pipeline of onshore and offshore wind projects coming through,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We are committed to those, but frankly all parties are going to have to have a debate about what happens once those targets are met.’ Backing: David Cameron effectively put his support behind the minister by saying that it was time for a debate about the future of the technology . But Mr Davey, who had attempted to ban Mr Hayes from making his remarks public, insisted the minister could not make Government policy. Lib Dem sources said they now wanted renewable energy removed from his portfolio. Mr Hayes said it seemed ‘extraordinary’ that turbines had been erected across Britain with little or no regard for the views of local people. He added: ‘We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities.’ His remarks delighted the Tory benches, where 150 MPs have urged the Government to take a more sceptical stance over onshore wind power. Mr Hayes had been due to expand on his remarks in a speech to a renewable energy conference in Scotland, but did not do so following a furious intervention from Mr Davey. ‘John Hayes might wish that he has the final say on energy policy and that he’s in a single-party government – but he doesn’t and he’s not,’ said one source close to Mr Davey. ‘He seemed to be mapping out Tory plans for their election manifesto but he was not speaking for the Government. He did not deliver the speech because he was told it was not acceptable.’ Other sources said Mr Davey had told Downing Street that Mr Hayes should now be stripped of all responsibility for green energy. A senior Tory source, however, said Mr Cameron was backing  his minister. Conservative business minister Michael Fallon also supported Mr Hayes, insisting local communities should have the right to decide whether they accept wind farms. ‘We’re not saying we absolutely have to have 4,000 onshore wind farms by a particular date. These things have to be determined locally,’ he said. The Department of Energy and Climate Change conceded that taking into account the number of onshore wind farms already built, those under construction and those in the pipeline, we will have enough to meet targets for 2020. But the Lib Dems insist it is wrong to say no more turbines will be constructed once the target is reached. Controversial: Wind turbines have caused a split between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats . Mr Davey said: ‘There has been no change to Government policy on renewable energy, as collectively agreed by the Coalition cabinet. ‘Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we’ve been able to cut the subsidy.’ Trade body Renewable UK’s deputy chief executive, Maf Smith, said: ‘As the wind industry meets in Glasgow to celebrate the success of this industry, it comes as some surprise that the new minister has said one thing to us and another to the press. ‘We are on the eve of the publication of the energy bill, with huge investment decisions to be made that will lead to tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade. ‘If we are to see these jobs and investment realised confidence must be retained and that means consistency.’ But a No 10 spokesman said Mr Hayes’s views were compatible with policy. He said the Government would meet its obligations to generate 15 per cent of energy from renewable resources by 2020 with windfarms ‘already in the pipeline’ – those with planning permission or awaiting approval. A senior Government source said because of that, Mr Cameron could change the mix of energy sources, potentially capping windfarms before 2017. ‘The call for evidence includes a line that we will look at the cost of the technology,’ he said. ‘That could let you change the subsidies for wind power.’ Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said the row demonstrated Britain had a ‘shambles of a Tory-led government which can’t even agree with itself’. ‘Onshore wind is the most developed and cheapest source of clean energy,’ she said.","PM says it was time for a debate about future of technology .

'They are simply being overrun and when you consider the Spanish slug will happily make a meal out of a dead rabbit as much as out of dog muck you can see why they are so successful,' he said. 'We have already seen when these slugs move into an area the native slugs vanish almost immediately. They can wipe out whole crops and prevent them growing there again.' Heavy rain and warm spells in Britain at the start of the summer provided the giant olive green pest with ideal breeding conditions. Slimy: The invasive slugs can reach up to 15cm long and feed on dead rabbits . At the time B&Q reported a 74 per cent increase in sales of slug pellets in its stores, amid sightings of the powerful invasive species in back gardens as far west as Wales and upland in the West Country. In parts of the U.S. hybrid slugs have even posed a threat to drivers, as they leave behind huge slimy patches when they are squashed on roads.

With 1,600 stores across the UK, its name has become a familiar sight on almost every High Street. But bakery chain Greggs is poised to expand even further afield - by supplying sausage rolls to British soldiers serving abroad. The company is to start sending frozen savoury items to a British military base in Guterslöh, Germany, in a trial designed to give troops a 'taste of home'. Home comforts: British troops dine at a Naafi outlet at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Sausage rolls made by bakery chain Greggs may soon be on the menu . If successful, the concept could be rolled out to serve more than 32,000 British soldiers across the globe. Under the deal with Armed Forces caterer Naafi, Greggs will supply a range of seven frozen savoury items - including sausage rolls, steak bakes, chilli bakes and sausage and bean melts - to Guterslöh for 12 weeks. The products will be baked throughout the day by Greggs-trained Naafi personnel and displayed on a Greggs-branded counter. They will cost as much as they do in Britain. Naafi's chief executive, Reg Curtis, said the deal was 'not about nutrition'. Coming soon: Frozen sausage rolls will be sent to a British military base in Germany to give soldiers a 'taste of home' 'A soldier can eat three healthy three-course meals a day for less than €5 (£4) in the army,' he told the Times. 'This is about giving the common soldier a taste of home.' The Guterslöh Naafi, which caters for 2,300 servicemen, was chosen for the trial because it serves 'a large number of single men', whom Mr Curtis believes will prefer the savoury goods to German foods. Greggs claimed that its products had come top in a survey which asked armed forces personnel what items they most missed from home. The Newcastle-based company's chief executive, Ken McKeikan, a Royal Navy veteran of the Falklands War, said he hoped the trial would pave the way to a global Naafi deal. Naafi outlets serve 32,500 troops across Afghanistan, Brunei, Germany, Gibraltar and the Falklands. Expansion: Bakery chain Greggs has 1,600 stores across the UK and hopes to begin serving food to 32,500 British troops worldwide . Manned by civilians, many of whom are dependants of service personnel, they offer home comforts such as British bread, British milk, British fish & chips, and British beer. Mr McKeikan said: 'It's great to hear that Greggs was the most requested brand that troops missed from home and we are really pleased to be making our savouries accessible to our troops in Germany, and, depending on the success of the trial, more widely available for our armed forces personnel around the world.' The trial is another triumph for Greggs, coming less than four months after it claimed victory in a battle with the Treasury over Chancellor George Osborne's planned 'pasty tax'. Mr Osborne announced in March that hot snacks would be subject to 20 per cent VAT, but the decision was overturned in May after a much-publicised campaign led by the bakery chain.

The shuttle landed at Ellington Field in Houston for the night before it will continue the cross-country trek on Thursday.

An 'incompetent' learner driver left a trail of destruction outside a school after crashing into three cars and a bollard as she rushed to a chemist. Diabetic Kaneez Butt-Zeeshan drove alone to pick up medication when she had low blood sugar, even though she was unqualified to do so. Bristol Crown Court heard that, after smashing into a car, she panicked and reversed into it again before slamming into a parked car, torpedoing a moving van and finally destroying a bollard. Dangerous: Diabetic Kaneez Butt-Zeeshan ride of destruction began outside Victoria Park Junior School on Atlas Road in Bristol when she drove into a car twice . The non-English speaker was arrested and gave police a prepared statement in which she conceded she drove off in panic as her first victim got out of his car. She admitted making a series of wrong judgements and was truly sorry. The mother-of-two, aged 25, from Bristol pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance. Judge Michael Longman told her: 'You simply shouldn’t have been driving that car at all. 'You are an incompetent driver, you haven’t got a full driving licence. 'The result is you were not insured to drive that car and you appear to have been in a hurry, for whatever reason.' The judge recognised it was a short distance of significant damage in which, luckily, no-one was hurt. He handed Butt-Zeeshan a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Panic: After ramming a parked car, she then sped to the top of the road and careered around the corner into Raymend Road . She was told to observe a 16-week tagged curfew in which she must stay at home from 8pm and 6am. She was also banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to take an extended driving test. Butt-Zeeshan was also told to pay £250 prosecution costs, instead of the brunt falling on public funds. Robert Reid, prosecuting, said it was 4.30pm when, just as parents were collecting youngsters from Victoria Park Junior School, Butt-Zeeshan was on Atlas Road heading to the chemist in her red Nissan Micra. Mr Reid said: 'Matters started off in Atlas Road when the defendant reversed into the front of a black Clio. 'The driver got out and indicated that he wanted to exchange details. 'She reversed a second time into the black Clio.' Out of control: Driving at high speed to the junction of Raymend Road and St. John's Lane she torpedoed a white van before reversing into - and destroying - a bollard . Map shows Mrs Butt-Zeeshan's route of destruction. The red line indicates her route and the cars each of her crashes . The court heard Butt-Zeeshan stopped . at the side of the road, followed by the Clio, but she then reversed . into a Seat car and continued to drive up Atlas Road. Mr Reid said: 'Witnesses said she was traveling excessively fast. 'She turned right down Raymend Road to the junction with St John’s Lane. That resulted in her car being embedded in the white van.' Butt-Zeeshan attempted to reverse away but was initially unsuccessful. Having freed her car from the tangle she reversed back, flattening a bollard at the corner of the road. Mr Reid said: 'Her husband came and there was a confrontation between various parties. 'One witness reported the headmaster of the school being directed by police to usher children away from the scene.' In her prepared statement to police, the learner driver conceded her catalogue of errors and wrote: 'I will not drive alone until I have the correct documents.' Butt-Zeeshan sobbed as Catherine Spedding, defending, said: 'There was the first collision and she panicked. 'She was in a difficult state. She had gone to the chemist to collect her medication. Her blood sugar was low at the time.' Miss Spedding said her client took insulin as well as tablets for diabetes, which was picked up during her pregnancy five years ago. Miss Spedding told the court: 'She was having treatment. She went to the chemist for medication. She was driving on a provisional licence, taking driving lessons. 'She foolishly decided to leave home and drive the car. She accepts she has done wrong and this is a salutary lesson for her.'","Diabetic Kaneez Butt-Zeeshan, from Bristol, drove alone .

Traffic backs up on Skillman Avenue near the Queensboro Bridge, New York, on Thursday . The MTA re-opened parts of two lines, the M and 7 trains, which go from Queens into Manhattan. In addition, limited Amtrak service resumed. Subway service was again free today, though there was still no service below 34th Street. In addition, Long Island Railroad trains were running very limited hourly service on four lines, including the Port Jefferson branch, Ronkonkoma branch, and Babylon branch. The roads and byways of New York were eerily empty as fuel reserves dwindled, though some two million barrels are expected to be distributed to gas stations around the tri-state area as quickly as possible. Commuters were also seen forming long lines along Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street as they waited for buses . Though the MTA did not charge bus fare, without the subway service, commuters found packed buses and long lines and delays along their commutes . Yellow cabs were few and far between as they ran out of petrol and were forced to curb their cars. In lieu of subways, buses ran along the subway lines, in addition to those running their routes.

Taliban target: Prince Harry walks the asphalt by an Apache helicopter at Camp Bastion, Helmand . Prince Harry will continue his deployment to Afghanistan despite the Taliban assault on the camp where he is based. The attack came at the start of a weekend of bloodshed in the warzone. Five British soldiers were injured and two US Marines killed when 15 insurgents armed with AK47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades stormed the allies’ supposedly impregnable fortress Camp Bastion. The 28-year-old prince, serving as a co-pilot gunner in the Army’s Apache helicopters, was a mile and a half from the firefight on Friday night. He was taken by SAS bodyguards to a secure location in the 20-square-mile base. The prince – known as Captain Harry Wales in the Army – was ordered to wear body armour and carry a loaded gun while the three-hour battle raged against Taliban fighters dressed in stolen American uniforms. The attack happened during a bloody 72 hours of escalating violence across Afghanistan in which coalition troops were killed by their supposed local allies: . During Friday’s attack on Camp Bastion, all but one of the Taliban raiders were killed, but not before they destroyed six US Harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations. It has prompted a major review of security to find out how the insurgents managed to penetrate the heavily-fortified base. The Taliban claimed the attack targeted Prince Harry, who arrived in Afghanistan with 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, 11 days ago. They also said the assault was revenge for a US-made film that insults the prophet Mohammed. But a senior Army source said the attack appeared to have been planned for weeks – before it was known that Harry was going to war. ‘They are linking the attack with Captain Wales’s presence for propaganda,’ he said. ‘They are deluded. ‘After saying this attack was mounted in reaction to the video on Islam, it is entirely predictable that the Taliban have changed their tune to say it was aimed at Captain Wales.’ Ushered to safety: When the attack on the base . began, Prince Harry was ordered to don body armour, load his weapon and was taken to a safe place by SAS bodyguards . Military chiefs refused to withdraw Harry from the warzone, insisting his presence did not increase the risk to himself or his comrades. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The deployment of Captain Wales has been long planned and the threat to him and others around him thoroughly assessed.’ Major Charles Heyman, a former infantry officer and editor of The Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, warned against ‘playing into the hands of the Taliban’. He said: ‘On balance it is a difficult equation but I think he should be kept there. If we take him away the Taliban will crow that they have just scored a major victory. ‘It would affect the morale of the troops on the ground if Prince Harry was taken out just because there was a threat.’ On deployment: The 28-year-old royal arrived in Afghanistan with 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, 11 days ago. Military chiefs have insisted his presence does not increase the risk to his comrades . Pilot: Harry is trained to fly Apache helicopters, some of the most deadly aircraft in Afghanistan . Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘I do not believe that Harry’s presence in Afghanistan increases the threat to our troops. ‘Obviously if they did succeed in getting him it would be a major coup for them, but even that risk is worth taking for the benefit of having a member of the Royal family fighting with our soldiers. ‘His presence there boosts morale of our men and shows that we as a nation are unafraid.’ Meanwhile, two soldiers from the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment were lured to their death by a traitor Afghan policeman, it has emerged. The uniformed man pretended to be injured at a checkpoint in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand on Saturday. But as the patrol approached him, he shot and killed them. He was killed in return fire. The number of Nato soldiers killed in so-called ‘green on blue’ attacks stands at more than 50 for this year alone, including nine British soldiers – about a quarter of the UK’s dead since January. It also emerged that an Afghan police officer shot and killed four American troops at a remote checkpoint in the south of the country yesterday. The killings followed the death of Lance Corporal Duane Groom, of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who was killed in Nahr-e Saraj on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb. The 32-year-old, from Fiji, was described as an ‘outstanding soldier in every respect’. In another blow for the Coalition, Afghan officials claimed a Nato airstrike killed eight women and girls as young as ten as they gathered firewood before dawn in the eastern province of Laghman. Nato initially said 45 insurgents and no civilians were killed in the attack, but a spokesman later said it was investigating the allegations. By . Ian Drury . Darkness had fallen on Camp Bastion and Prince Harry was relaxing with fellow Apache helicopter pilots. Some were reading, others chatting. All were enjoying their ‘down-time’ amid the hectic schedule of flying missions against the Taliban. Suddenly the peace of the Afghan night was shattered as a terrifying message boomed from the tannoys dotted around the military fortress. ‘Bastion is under ground attack,’ a voice repeated, calmly but urgently. Troops were ordered into what the military calls ‘lockdown’ – a carefully rehearsed plan to deal with emergencies. With a member of the Royal family in their midst, other contingencies also kicked into action. Like his colleagues, Captain Harry Wales donned body armour and a helmet and picked up a loaded firearm. But he was then quickly escorted by a team of specially-assigned SAS bodyguards to a secure location in the camp. His fellow Apache pilots and other specialist crews were also kept in lockdown in safe areas, although without the SAS bodyguards. Military chiefs have drawn up detailed plans on how to respond to keep the 28-year-old officer safe in the event of attack. It is understood that on this occasion, however, it was not necessary to trigger the absolute worst-case-scenario procedure. A source at Camp Bastion said: ‘There was no messing about. Harry was taken straight to the safe place as soon as the alarm went off. He was ready for a fight and would have taken on the Taliban but he had to follow the plan. ‘If anything happened to him it would have been a disaster.’ Base: Camp Bastion is the British headquarters in Helmand province (file photo) Security: An armoured vehicle patrols on the periphery of Camp Bastion, where insurgents where able to blow a hole in the wall before launching an attack on British and U.S. forces . Even though Harry and the Apache crews were a mile and a half from the attack, they could hear the rattle of machine gun fire, exploding rocket-propelled grenades and the crump of mortars. A few minutes earlier, shortly after 10pm local time on Friday, insurgents had launched the raid on Camp Bastion, the  sprawling and supposedly impregnable desert headquarters in Helmand Province. Disguised in stolen US military uniforms and armed with AK47 automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 15 Taliban split into three teams for the attack. It is believed one insurgent detonated a suicide vest, blowing a 5ft hole in the 30ft-high perimeter fence that rings the camp. This allowed the rest of the enemy fighters to stream into the 20-square-mile fortress, which includes Camp Leatherneck, home to the US Army, and Camp Shorabak, the main Afghan National Army base in Helmand. The raiders evaded surveillance and attacked the south-east of the camp, where the US Marines have their air base. Described as ‘well equipped, trained and rehearsed’, the enemy began attacking US warplanes and helicopters. Prize target: Fifteen insurgents, working in three teams of five, managed to destroy six US AV-8B Harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations. All but one died in the attack . When challenged, the insurgents shot dead two US Marines. As the alarm spread, 50 troops from 5 RAF Force Protection Wing (51 Squadron RAF), the RAF Regiment, sped to the battle in light armoured vehicles. The gun battle continued for three hours. Six US AV-8B Harrier jump jets and three refuelling stations were destroyed. By the time the firefight ended, around 1am local time on Saturday, 14 insurgents lay dead. One survived and was taken to the hospital for treatment and then into custody. Five British troops were injured, with some understood to have been wounded when a gunman  triggered his suicide vest.","Helicopter pilot prince was ushered to safe place by SAS bodyguards .

CCTV images show a callous killer putting out his wheelie bin for collection - with his next-door neighbour’s body stuffed inside. James Jepson, 25, strangled Steven Rourke with a washing line after taking exception to the victim - who has special needs - trying to give him a hug. Afterwards he dumped the body headfirst into his black wheelie bin along with his household waste before going off drinking and socialising with friends. Scroll down for video . A CCTV picture shows killer James Jepson putting out the wheelie bin containing Steven Rourke's body out for collection shortly before 7am two days after the murder . Around four hours later the murderer appears to have changed his mind and moves the wheelie bin to behind his house - with nobody else aware of what was inside . Two days later a camera captures him calmly putting the bin out in front of his home, as if for collection, shortly before 7am. But hours later he appears to change his mind and moves the bin away from the public eye to his back garden. It was later discovered dumped on a disused railway line near a copse by two boys who looked inside. They moved carpet underlay to reveal the sole of a foot, and found Steven’s petrol-soaked body. Jepson from Hindley, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after being convicted of murder at Liverpool Crown Court. The court was told Steven, who had learning difficulties, had to be heavily supported in the community by carers and support workers who paid daily visits to his home. Although described by neighbours as ‘polite and harmless’ he would sometimes make inappropriate remarks to complete strangers and try and cuddle them. The killing occurred on March 22 after Jepson who lived next door to Steven had been snorting cocaine. James Jepson, 25, left, flew into a rage and killed Steven Rourke, right, when the 26-year-old tried to hug him . It is believed he bumped into the victim outside his back door. Steven asked for a cigarette but the pair had a huge row after Jepson claimed the victim ‘come onto him.’ Jepson strangled Steven with the blue length of washing line before hiding the corpse in a wheelie bin and heading off to a party. He was later seen pulling the bin around the area before it was abandoned. Over that weekend, a number of people passed the bin and even looked inside to investigate, but because of the carpet underlay no concerns were raised. Tests showed Steven was throttled with a blue washing line which was tightly wrapped round his neck four times and had a double knot at the front. Jepson’s girlfriend Rauridh Earley, a 20-year old barmaid, told the jury how her boyfriend would have rages because of the death of his father in 2011. The week before the killing she discovered she was pregnant and although Jepson wanted her to keep it he agreed with her that she was too young and on March 22 - the day of the murder - she began taking medication to terminate the pregnancy. Scenes of crimes officers at the scene in Hindley, near Wigan, where Steven Rourke was found dead inside the bin . The young man's body was discovered on March 28, six days after he was strangled to death . Officers guard the scene following the discovery by two boys, after dozens of other people had walked passed the bin unaware of what was inside . After the killing Miss Earley met up with Jepson when he burst into tears and admitted: ‘I think I have killed somebody. I have done something stupid, I have killed somebody.’ She told him to give himself up to police but before they parted he asked for a kiss and a cuddle. She broke down in tears as she said: ‘I knew it would be the last time I would see him so I couldn’t do it.’ Jepson later claimed he ‘blacked’ out when Steven tried to hug him and woke up to find the victim lying on the floor. But in a statement the victim’s mother Christine Rourke said: ‘I feel like my son’s dignity was taken away after being put out in the bin like rubbish. ‘He was loving and caring person who was vulnerable and tormented by mental health issues which makes it harder to understand how someone could harm and kill such a gentle young man.’ ‘He was always happy to help others. He was well known in the area, where he was well liked as Steven never saw any bad in anyone. At 26 years-old Steven was taken from us far too young.’ Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Jepson: ‘You utterly disrespected Steven’s body by putting it in the wheelie bin as if, as his mother said, putting out rubbish and you then covered it with carpet cut-offs. ‘Your conduct was a gross over-reaction not least because you knew enough of Steven Rourke’s character to know that although he may have been a nuisance he was basically harmless.’ VIDEO: CCTV of murderer casually taking bin out with BODY inside .","James Jepson, 25, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years for the murder of Steven Rourke, 26, who has special needs .

"By KATHARINE BARNEY . PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 21 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 21 September 2012 . For years celebrities, politicians and the general Joe Public have enjoyed a gentle dip in the ponds of Hampstead Heath, sometimes clothed and sometimes not. But now some of them may be taking a rethink - or at least considering wearing a bathing costume - as they have attracted a some rather unwelcome swimming companions. A . breed of giant crayfish have appeared and are taking a keen interest in . the swimmers, with an apparent penchant for the Men's Pond, where many . of the visitors swim naked. Relaxing: Swimmers may be unaware that they might be joined be unwelcome guests in the pond . Visitors: the red swap crayfish is know for being aggressive . The recent reports of the rather painful encounters have caused authorities to issue a new warning, advising swimmers to avoid entering the water in the nude. Regulars at the North London park include judges, senior civil servants and local actors, artists and writers. Along with the well-to-do locals, . Margaret Rutherford, best known for playing Miss Marple used the Ladies' Pond in the 1950s and actress Katharine Hepburn was a regular in the . 1960s, but chose to don a swimming costume. Boxers Frank Bruno and John Conteh have both used the Men's Pond to prepare for fights and more recently Gary Oldman used it as a location for 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Although the red swamp crayfish, . which are known for their aggressive behaviour and long claws, were . first spotted 20 years ago, they have been multiplying so fast that around 5,000 of the nippers are in the ponds. Chairman of the Hampstead Heath Anglers Association said one member had caught 180 of the crayfish in just one hour. Cheeky: The giant crayfish have are multiplying so fast that 5,000 are said to be colonising the ponds . He said: 'They just breed and breed and breed. They eat all the fish in the ponds and there is nothing we can do to stop them. They are destroying the wildlife.' But the bathers may be rather more worried about the physical impact of the invasion. One swimmer, Peter McCafferty, 43, said: 'I've had a couple of nips on my toes in the past few months, usually when I stop for a rest and tread water. But some people have been nipped in altogether more sensitive places, which doesn’t bear thinking about.' A fellow swimmer said he had also experienced a crayfish's wrath after being nipped on the bottom. 'I suppose I was lucky really - if the crayfish had decided to attack from the other side I would have been in a lot more pain,' he said. 'From now on I’m wearing my trunks.' Regular: Margaret Rutherford, best known for playing Miss Marple may not have been happy to be joined by crayfish . Glamorous: Katharine Hepburn was a regular at the Ladies Pond in the 1960s but chose to wear a costume . A spokesman for the City of London Corporation, which runs the heath said: 'We don't know how [the crayfish] got there, but a likely explanation is that they were dumped in the ponds. now that they are here, we would recommend that swimmers keep their distance to avoid getting a pinch. We would also advise people to wear clothes.' The heath has three areas open to bathers - the Men's Pond, Ladies' Pond and Mixed Pond. The crayfish are not the fist species to invade the ponds, which have been open to bathers since the 19th century. As well as contended with the odd angry duck, swimmers have become used to a colony of parakeets who have also made the heath their home, possibly after having arrived after escaping from the set of John Huston's 1951 film 'The African Queen' which was shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Unsuspecting: Naked bathers in the Hampstead Heath ponds may be in for a nasty and little nippy surprise . Watch out: Those going for a dip in the Men's Pond may be best advised to wear swimming trunks . Crayfish are significantly smaller, freshwater cousins of the lobster. The red swamp variety, also known . as the Louisiana crawfish is native to the US and Mexico, but was first . noticed in Hampstead Heath ponds in 1991. The species are able to grow quickly, being able to tolerate dry spells of up to four months, and can reach sizes of 12 cm long. In northern Europe, the populations are self maintaining but not expanding, while in southern Europe, the red swamp crayfish is multiplying and actively colonising new territory, at the expense of the native crayfish. Individuals are reported to be able . to cross many miles of relatively dry ground, especially in wet . seasons, although the aquarium trade and anglers may have hastened the . spread in some areas. Louisiana crayfish are usually . boiled in a large pot with heavy seasoning and other items such as . potatoes, corn on the cob, onions, garlic, and sausage, known as a . 'crayfish boil'.","Red swamp crayfish have been multiplying so fast that around 5,000 of the nippers are in the ponds.

A shopper has claimed more than £8,600 worth of free goods through a loophole in a supermarket’s money back scheme. The 34-year-old cashed in on Asda’s promise to refund the difference in cost if customers bought items cheaper from a rival. But its computer system grossly undervalued products at other supermarkets, allowing canny shoppers to claim money-off vouchers worth up to £40 after every trip to the store. Shoppers have hit Asda for potentially hundreds of thousands of pounds of vouchers by exploiting a glitch . Under the Asda Price Guarantee, . customers enter their receipt details into a website and print off . coupons if the goods cost less at a comparative shop elsewhere. As well . as the refund, they claim a bonus of ten per cent. Capped: Asda Price Guarantee vouchers will no longer exceed £15 . Shoppers were supposed to be limited to a maximum of ten vouchers of any value worth a total of £100 a month. But they could circumvent this by using a different computer and email address to generate more coupons. The customer, who lives in Hampshire, . claimed to have bought £8,670 worth of groceries in just four weeks with . the coupons. The man, who did not wish to be named, said he was . stockpiling goods in his attic, even selling some on. ‘I am making anything from £5 to £600 a . day,’ he said. ‘My attic is full of a stockpile of stuff. If you can . get something for near enough free then you might as well do it. ‘There are trigger items such as rice . pudding, hair gel and cereal. I will buy them all for £40 then get a . voucher for £37 so effectively I get them for free. ‘I go back to the store three hours . later and do it all again. I sell a few of the items so I’m making a . profit, but generally I stockpile the products for the family.’ The system used for the scheme is operated by the price comparison website MySupermarket on behalf of Asda. Asda limits customers to ten vouchers . a month and those ten vouchers cannot exceed £100. But savvy shoppers have found a way to exploit the system. They have found that using a new email address with each voucher request and entering made-up addresses with random postcodes, they can avoid the cap on vouchers. Shoppers on consumer site . moneysavingexpert.com have pooled receipts which identify products . triggering higher value money-off vouchers. Retail magazine The Grocer highlighted . the ruse in a trial where the system mistakenly calculated Asda’s . rivals to be much cheaper on certain products. It correctly identified that Asda’s . basket of goods cost £25.30 but calculated that Waitrose’s identical . items cost only £8.57 instead of £30.87. This led to a voucher for . £17.59 when none should have been issued as the Waitrose goods cost . more. An Asda spokesman said: ‘A very small . number of our savviest customers have been able to beat the system and . claim a few, larger than normal vouchers.’ The supermarket chain has now capped the coupons to £15 per shop up to a total of £100 a month. Huddle: A notice from Asda was posted on the Moneysavingexpert forum detailing the changes . Asda's problems are with always calculating the correct amount for customers' money-off vouchers. Tesco had a similar experience to Asda with money-off vouchers last year. The supermarket had to change their voucher offer after shoppers exploited a promotion. Their changes included a cap to the value in which customers could redeem in vouchers, requiring shoppers to use a Clubcard and also implementing unique barcodes. Tesco called in the police as it suspected its vouchers were being obtained fraudulently. In one case, Thames Valley Police arrested a shopper in Tesco's Milton Keynes store who was charged with fraud and the case set for Crown Court. However, the CPS withdrew the case when the police were unable to produce a vital exhibit. A spokesperson for the police said: ‘Thames Valley Police was unable to provide the vouchers in question in relation to this case and therefore it was deemed that there was insufficient evidence to proceed.’ It has been making school boy errors, but as often happens with technology there has been no easy fix. The supermarket promises to be 10 per cent cheaper than rivals Morrisons, Sainsburys, Tesco and Waitrose on a comparable basket of shopping. Customers enter their Asda till receipt into the Asda Price Guarantee website which compares Asda prices to competitors and issues a money-off voucher for the difference plus 10 per cent if Asda is more expensive. But Asda's software has been doing the opposite to what the supermarket intends. Instead of reflecting the generally held view that Asda is the cheapest of the big supermarkets, thus delivering a few low value vouchers by comparing its prices to more expensive rivals, it has been giving customers buying a basket of certain items, vouchers of £30, £40 and more. As lists of what products to buy to cash-in have become available on the internet, the supermarket has stemmed its losses by capping vouchers at £15.00 while it tries to correct its maths. The software running the Asda Price Guarantee is provided by Isreali-based price comparison website mysupermarket.co.uk. It collects prices for Asda stores, connecting directly with the Walmart web service located in the USA that collects data from all Walmart operations around the globe, including Asda in the UK. For Asda online, it collects prices off Asda's website overnight along with all the prices that appear on websites for Sainsburys, Tesco and Waitrose. Tesco has 400 regional sets of price data so each of these variations is collected overnight and price comparisons are accurate to where you live. Morrisons does not make its prices available online so these are collected twice a week in-store. As in life what can go wrong does go wrong. The simplest of variations can set off an incorrect calculation for a customer's money off voucher. Supermarkets discontinue hundreds of lines and use an accounting practice of reducing prices to a few pence to cover the last few bits of stock left somewhere on  a top shelf. mysupermarket captures these 1p and 2p prices as it captures all prices. Juicy: A Tesco out-of-stock price of 3p captured for three weeks on mysupermarket for Don Simon orange juice meant that Asda gave customers buying it for £1 a money-off voucher for 98p. A Tesco out-of-stock price of 3p captured for three weeks on mysupermarket for Don Simon orange juice meant that Asda gave customers buying it for £1 a money-off voucher for 94p, so it was 10 per cent cheaper than Tesco even though Don Simon was not actually available in Tesco for 3p. James Foord, VP Business Development for mysupermarket said: ‘We have an agreed policy with Asda that if a product is out-of-stock at any of the retailers for a period of more than 7 days then it comes off the system and therefore the comparison. ‘This of course means that on rare occasions these low priced products might exist on the system for a few days or less enabling the more observant shoppers to take advantage and work the system.’ Asda has taken action to separate its own accounting 1p type prices into a separate file so they cannot be picked up on mysupermarket. A spokesperson said: ‘To ensure compliance with our own strict procedures, we have appointed an independent audit team to monitor the prices displayed on our website, with the authority to remove content if they uncover any pricing errors.’ The current glitch that Asda has been unable to resolve for four weeks understates the price of a few products that the supermarket's competitors have on 3-for-2 offer. Mr Ford said the level of interest being generated online by the glitch was good publicity for the supermarket. ‘The thousands of messages on forums is a PR coup for Asda,’ he said. Mr Foord said there was no question the software company would refund Asda for the cost of errors. ‘This of course is an irrelevant question since it is not us that is setting the prices.  In addition, the APG system is wholly owned and operated by Asda.’","Asda Price Guarantee scheme offers vouchers to customers if supermarket competitors prove to be cheaper .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:06 EST, 20 September 2012 . A former Deutsche Bank vice president says she was fired after suing last year alleging a sexist culture resulted in her being demoted for taking maternity leave. Kelley Voelker filed a second lawsuit on Wednesday, this time for retaliation after she lost her job earlier this month. The new suit is added on top of her gender bias claim filed last September in US District Court in Manhattan. Mother: Kelley Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010 . A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously and are currently reviewing the complaint.' In her complaint, Ms Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010. Upon her return, she said, Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job. The bank retracted the demotion after her lawyers complained, she said. The lawsuit states: 'Plaintiff was retaliated against and ultimately 'mommy-tracked' for her decision to take maternity leave.' However, 'It is not surprising that such discriminatory treatment is permitted when the company tolerates managers to use (derogatory terms), as well as allowing supervisors to entertain clients at strip clubs and make open remarks about pregnancy,' the lawsuit states. The lawsuit states that the company . 'fosters an atmosphere where it seems appropriate to derail the careers . of hardworking mothers like Ms Voelker while promoting the chauvinist . ideals' it is said to hold. Glass ceiling? Ms Voelker states in the lawsuit Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job . This month -- one year after the first lawsuit -- she was laid off as part of a 'reduction in force.' She said she was the only person in her 500-strong unit to be let go by the bank. 'I worked extremely hard and, as a working mom, I sacrificed so much. I just wanted to be treated equally and no different than my male colleagues,' Ms Voelker told ABC News. According to the filings, Ms Voelker is seeking . compensatory and punitive damages, among other remedies. Ms Voelker . said she also filed a discrimination case with the Equal Employment . Opportunity Commission. Like . many other lawsuits alleging gender bias on Wall Street, the complaint . also provides illustrations of alleged 'hostile and degrading' conduct . by bank employees to women. In one instance, at a 2009 meeting where Ms Voelker questioned a decision by a supervisor, her boss said: 'I'd watch your step - she's pregnant,' the complaint said. The law firm Thompson Wigdor represents Ms Voelker. That firm also represents Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel maid who accused former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a civil lawsuit of attempting to rape her. Criminal sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc last November settled a lawsuit, also filed by Thompson Wigdor, by a former vice president who said the bank unlawfully fired her while she was on maternity leave. Last month, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan dismissed an EEOC lawsuit accusing financial news company Bloomberg LP of a pattern of discrimination against pregnant women and mothers returning from maternity leave, even if there were cases of individual bias. Bloomberg said that lawsuit lacked merit.","Plaintiff says she was 'mommy-tracked' by bank .

Banned: Fitness instructor Cori Withell was told she could not hold her yoga class at a Catholic church as it was a Hindu religious activity . She meant her yoga classes to be a calming and relaxing experience for all those concerned. Instead, Cori Withell has ended up flustered and frustrated after a priest banned her from his church hall because her lessons are ‘not compatible’ with the Catholic faith. The 37-year-old instructor was told by Father John Chandler that yoga is a Hindu religious activity and therefore not in keeping with his rules on promoting Catholic activities. The ban is not Catholic church policy and decisions are left to the discretion of individual priests. Miss Withell said staff at St Edmund’s Church in Southampton accepted the booking two months ago and she paid £180. But with just ten days to go before the start of the classes she was called and told that yoga was from another religion so she could not have the hall. A separate pilates class she had booked was also cancelled. She said: 'I had never heard about any religious issue with yoga before but I have looked into it since and found that some other religions feel that when people meditate it could let the devil inside them. 'But there was never any meditation in my class – it was just exercises. 'As a nation we have an obesity . epidemic. I was trying to bring some exercise to the community and . coming across blocks like this is frustrating. 'I . tried to explain to the church that my yoga classes were not religious . at all and I even offered to come and demonstrate the class. 'It is about calmness and relaxation.' Paid up: Cori spent £180 to book the hall, but with just ten days to go she was told she could not use it . Father Chandler said the church was . 'misled' by Miss Withell's booking because he claimed that, at first, . the hall was booked for pilates and then he found out it was also for . spiritual yoga. He said: . 'Yoga is a Hindu spiritual exercise. Being a Catholic church we have to . promote the gospel and that's what we use our premises for. 'We . did say that yoga could not take place. It’s the fact that it's a . different religious practice going on in a Catholic church. Religious: Father John Chandler, left, said the lesson, advertised by this flyer, right, was not in keeping with his rules on promoting Catholic activities . Welcome: A spokesman for the diocese said in 17 years it was the first time he had commented on a yoga ban . 'We are not saying that yoga is bad or wrong.' Yoga enthusiasts criticised Father Chandler’s stance as 'ignorant' and even urged the priest to try a session. Pierre .

Mr Lee, who had his right leg amputated below the knee after a bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2008, was told by information desk staff that there would be no issues with any of the rides as he arrived at the Staffordshire theme park. But as he tried to board the ride, he was refused entry, leaving him baffled, saying he had ridden the Air at least eight times before, once when he was unable to walk and was still in a wheelchair. Adding insult to injury, when he and his wife Dawn sought a refund on the £45 ticket, they were refused. Mr Lee, from Newark, Nottinghamshire said: ‘I love Alton Towers. 'If something had changed since my last visit, there were many opportunities for them to say so - the internet, on the back of the tickets, at the information desk, or the signs by the ride. ‘They kept throwing health and safety at me. 'I explained to them that I was a soldier and understood health and safety but also that I had ridden Air many times in the past without a problem. ‘I told them how I lost my leg and how I had faced far greater challenges than a rollercoaster, but they were having none of it. ‘Are they saying Alton Towers is off-limits to guys who lose limbs in combat? ‘It's a smack in the face after the euphoria of the Paralympics.’ Ridden before: Mr Lee was refused entry to the Air rollercoaster, pictured, at the theme park but says he has been on it before, even when he was unable to walk and in a wheelchair . Mr Lee said the experience was ‘embarrassing and degrading’ and he and his wife, Dawn, left the park after only an hour. He said: ‘I want an apology and a refund and most of all for the rules to be published so other people don't pay their money to be disappointed.’ A spokesman for Alton Towers said if Mr Lee contacted Alton Towers directly, they would consider refunding his ticket. The spokesman said: ‘We are sorry if . there has been a misunderstanding in the communication of our policies . relating to guests with amputations. ‘It is never our intention to embarrass any of our guests and we can understand Mr Lee's distress.

'Degrading': Mr Lee said he was told as he arrived at the theme park that there would be no issues with the rides, left him beside a sign for disabled patrons. He said he faced 'far greater challenges' since his injury which happened while he was on duty in Afghanistan, right . ‘We are proud to welcome visitors who have a disability, together with their helpers or companions, and we aim to encourage everyone to enjoy as many of our facilities as possible, regardless of ability or disability. ‘Our policy relating to guests with disabilities has been developed to take into account their specific needs, as well as the general health and safety regulations relating to a business such as ours. ‘From time to time the ride . manufacturers will review their guidelines regarding operating policies . and this is the case with our flying rollercoaster Air. ‘This . has a very specialised restraint system that incorporates an . over-the-shoulder harness and two lower braces that lock around the . ankle. 'Not fully contained': The rollercoaster has a 'specialised restraint system' which meant patrons with foot or leg amputations would not be fully contained, an Alton Towers spokesman said . ‘Unfortunately, therefore, guests with leg or foot amputations would not be fully contained in this type of system making it uncomfortable for them to ride. ‘All of our rides have ride safety notices but in some cases it is more appropriate to ask guests with disabilities to speak to a ride host to determine whether or not they can ride; this is the approach we have taken with Air.’ Mr Lee had his right leg amputated below the knee after he was injured in Helmand Province while serving with the 2nd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment in 2008. He sustained the injury after his vehicle was caught up in an explosion while on patrol. He lay in a minefield for two hours and, despite horrific injuries, refused medical help until it was declared completely safe to reach him.
