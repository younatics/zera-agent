"Prince Charles is to demand a total overhaul of the honours system when he becomes king in the belief gongs are handed out for the wrong reasons . Prince Charles will demand a total overhaul of the honours system when he becomes king. The heir to the throne believes gongs are handed out ‘to the wrong people for the wrong reasons’. He is said to want to scrap honours such as the CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Modern and egalitarian awards would be brought in instead, possibly in smaller numbers. ‘Why should people still be invested with an order of a defunct British empire?’ one member of the prince’s inner circle told the Mail. Charles, who stood in for the Queen at an investiture yesterday, also thinks the honours ceremonies should be a celebration. A figure close to him said a party would be more suitable, adding: ‘It’s a shame that after receiving an honour at the palace, recipients have to leave. How much more appropriate it would be for the occasion to be marked by a party.’ The startling insight into the thinking of a prince often accused of meddling in national affairs was among many offered by aides who have spoken to the Mail for a remarkable series, beginning today. A major biography is also being published which claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne. In a previously unpublished interview with the author, the prince says he is determined to fix the ‘battered’ world. ‘I only take on the most difficult challenges. Because I want to raise aspirations and create hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation,’ he says. Catherine Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, was given unprecedented access to the prince, as well as his closest friends and advisers at Clarence House, for the first semi-authorised biography in years. She describes Charles as a man ‘set to reshape the monarchy in his own image’ and one who ‘will never be remote and silent like his own mother’. Miss Mayer’s book also: . A biography to be published next month claims the Prince of Wales wants to reshape not only the monarchy, but the country itself when he accedes to the throne . Even though its text is largely complimentary, the timing of the book is not ideal for Charles and his team. Next month the Supreme Court will rule on whether 27 ‘black spider memos’ written by the prince to ministers airing his views on issues of national importance should be published. Senior aides are resigned to the fact that Charles is likely to lose his decade-long battle to keep the notes secret and are preparing themselves for the fallout. The court ruling will be followed by a BBC documentary shedding light on the ‘War of the Wales’ and efforts by the prince’s staff to undermine Diana. The new biography offers a different view, sensationally referring to Diana’s attempts to ‘spread word about her husband’s derelictions’. It says: ‘His camp fought back, but without the same skills and hampered by a principal who could never match Diana’s lustre or her bloodlust.’ One member of his inner circle told the Mail: ‘Does he meddle? Yes, sometimes. Is he misguided on occasions? Possibly. But does he do it for the best of reasons? Absolutely. He is a very good man and what he does comes from a good place.’ The book by Catherine Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, examines Princess Diana’s ‘bloodlust’ for revenge against Charles and Camilla (pictured together in 2002)","When king, Prince Charles will demand an overhaul of the honours system .

"Alarming evidence has revealed that Brazilian city dwellers  are regularly dining on endangered animals. Scientists warn the taste for bushmeat in urban environments poses a particular threat to Amazonian wildlife. They say that the voracious appetite for jungle-dwelling creatures is two-fold: The high level of poverty makes the animals attractive because they are free, while at the other end of society creatures, such as the yellow-spotted river turtle, are treated as delicacies. Warning: Graphic content . Research has uncovered alarming evidence of people frequently dining on yellow spotted river turtles and rare fish such as semaprochilodus, in Brazilian cities. Here a yellow-footed tortoise is seen tied up . Experts from Lancaster University and Brazil interviewed households in two Brazilian ‘prefrontier’ cities – those that are surrounded by more than 90 per cent of their original forest cover. They found that virtually all urban households in the cities of Borba and Novo Aripuanã consumed jungle wildlife for food. Almost all of the 153 households – 99 per cent – eat fish found in the forests at least once a month, while 79 per cent eat bushmeat made up of both mammals and birds. This graph shows wildlife consumption by Amazonian households, combined with conservation threat status of animals. The horizontal bars show the percentage of households that have eaten each species in the last 12 months, while the black dots indicate IUCN threat status for animals and white dots, threat status for fish . Experts believe that the voracious appetite for jungle-dwelling creatures is driven by the fact they are free, and many people are living in poverty, while others eat unusual meat such as lowland tapir (pictured) for reasons of ‘prestige' Experts from Lancaster University and Brazil interviewed households in two Brazilian ‘prefrontier’ cities – those that are surrounded by more than 90 per cent of their original forest cover. They found that virtually all urban households in the cities of Borba and Novo Aripuanã (marked on the map) consumed wildlife for food . The study found that bushmeat was eaten at least once a month by 44 per cent of urban households in the Amazonian cities of Borba and Novo Aripuanã. A total of almost 79 per cent of 153 households surveyed said they have eaten bushmeat in the last 12 months. Urban households reported consuming 15 species of mammals, 12 species of birds, 62 fish and seven types of reptiles. Among them are endangered, vulnerable and threatened creatures such as lowland tapir, peacock bass and yellow spotted river turtles. Nearly half of the households surveyed – 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises, with 28 per cent feasting on crocodile-like caimans. Some of the species being eaten are classed as endangered, vulnerable and threatened. These include the white-lipped peccary – a type of forest pig – which despite being ‘near threatened’,was eaten by 19 per cent of those surveyed. Some 15 per cent of people living in the Amazonian cities have eaten ‘vulnerable’ lowland tapir and 22 per cent of households have feasted on equally vulnerable yellow-spotted river turtles. ‘The high percentage of families that had recently eaten the yellow-spotted river turtle was probably the most surprising,’ study leader Dr Luke Parry, told MailOnline. Some 15 per cent of people living in the Amazonian cities have eaten ‘vulnerable’ lowland tapir (stock image) and 22 per cent of households have feasted on equally vulnerable yellow-spotted river turtles . This graph shows municipalities in the Amazon classified by forest remaining (coloured bars) and urban poverty (black markers). The black circles show half a Brazilian salary per capital (BRA$8.50 or $3.65/day) extreme poverty - white circles - equal to a quarter minim salary per capita (BRA$4.25 or $1.82/day) and United Nations extreme poverty - triangles - at $1.25/day . Some of the wildlife species being eaten are classed as endangered, vulnerable and threatened, such as the white-lipped peccary (stock image) – a type of forest pig – which despite being ‘near threatened’, has been eaten by 19 per cent of people in the past 12 months . ‘I was very surprised to find that such a high proportion of urban households consume bushmeat.’ Rare fish including arapaima, tambaqui, dourada and filhote have also ended up on between 15 and 29 per cent of dinner plates, with the vulnerable peacock bass proving a catch for 59 per cent of households. Experts think that programmes to start a trend away from bushmeat as a source of protein to luxury food could save creatures like woolly monkeys (pictured) It was previously assumed that there is low urban demand for bushmeat, but the study, published in the journal Conservation Letters, claims this is incorrect. Dr Parry said: ‘The rapid urbanisation of forested wilderness in the Amazon could threaten biodiversity if expanding cities drive demand for wildlife as food. ‘There are around 73 cities such as those we studied, occupying around 1.86 million square km2 of forest. ‘Previously it was thought that city dwellers did not consume much wildlife but we found that was not the case. In fact, nearly every household did. ‘People were hunting, fishing and consuming wildlife for a number of different reasons, for some bushmeat was the most affordable protein source they could access, for others it was a question of preference for eating particular “prestige” species.’ He explained that large turtles can cost £100 each, and that tambaqui fish can fetch a similar amount among Brazil’s growing upper class. ‘Both these species are eaten because they are traditional regional delicacies,’ he said. He believes that programmes to start a long-term trend away from bushmeat as a means to protein to luxury food, could help the situation, but not solve it completely. ‘We need to find ways of alleviating poverty and supplying poor city-dwellers with affordable alternatives to eating wildlife so that in the long term wildlife ceases to be an economical source of protein for the poor,’ Dr Parry said. ‘Innovative environmental governance could limit wildlife consumption to only harvest-tolerant species.’ Nearly half of the households surveyed – 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises, with 28 per cent feasting on caimans (a stock image is shown)","Yellow-spotted river turtles are among the threatened species being eaten .

"No charges: George Zimmerman (pictured in his latest mug shot) will not face formal charges stemming from his January 9 arrest . George Zimmerman won't face criminal charges after he was arrested earlier this month for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend. Prosecutors say that after accusing Zimmerman of domestic violence on January 9, the woman hired a lawyer and recanted her story. State Attorney Phil Archer told the Orlando Sentinel that he had no choice but to close his criminal investigation against Zimmerman without filing charges. He was arrested at his home  in Lake Mary, Florida, and spent 14 hours in jail before posting $5,000 bail. This is the third time that Zimmerman has been cuffed by police since he was acquitted of the February 2012 murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. All three times, prosecutors declined to press charges because his alleged victims, all current or former lovers, withdrew their stories. The Seminole County Sheriff's Office says the 31-year-old Zimmerman was arrested for aggravated assault three weeks ago after his girlfriend told police that he threw a wine bottle at her during an argument. The woman didn't call 911 - but was instead pulled over during a routine traffic stop about 11pm on January 9 and told police about the alleged attack. Officers went to Zimmerman's house, which is owned by his parents, and arrested him on felony aggravated assault charges. The state attorney on Friday said police had probable cause to arrest Zimmerman at the time, even prosecutors they did not have evidence to pursue charges. Accusations: Ex-wife Shellie Zimmerman (left) and ex-girlfriend Samantha Scheibe (right) have both claimed and then retracted accusations that George Zimmerman was violent toward them . History of trouble: Zimmerman's mug shots are seen for: a 2005 arrest for shoving a police officer at a party (left);  the June 2013 arrest for the murder of Trayvon Martin (center); and the November 2013 arrest for domestic assault against his then-girlfriend . Following Zimmerman's arrest, the alleged victim refused to meet with prosecutors and 'made it clear she did not want to proceed,' the Sentinel reports. The woman's name was not released. Following his initial court hearing, Zimmerman was ordered to surrender all of his firearms and stay out of Volusia County, where the woman lives. A judge also ordered him to hand over anything that the woman had left at his house so it could be returned to her. Zimmerman made national headlines when he shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon while working as a neighborhood watch volunteer. He claimed he shot the unarmed black teen in self defense after he was attacked. The initial decision by police not to arrest Zimmerman caused fury in the black community and led to protests across the country. Zimmerman was infamously acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin . Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder and went into hiding. He was acquitted of all charges in July 2013 following a lengthy trial. In November 2013, Zimmerman was arrested following a fight at estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman's home in which she claimed that he threatened her and her father with a gun, punched her father in the face and then smashed the iPad she used to record the incident. Zimmerman was handcuffed, detained and questioned by police by not arrested. Shellie Zimmerman, who has since divorced George, later withdrew her story. When video of the alleged attack could not be recovered from the broken iPad, prosecutors declined to press charges. Then in September 2013, he was arrested after his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe accused him of pointing a gun at her face and smashing a table at the home they shared. She later recanted the allegations and asked a court to lift the protective order so that they two could be together again. Last September, he was also accused of a road rage attack in which he allegedly told another driver: 'Do you know who I am? I'll f***ing kill you!' The driver declined to press charges.","Zimmerman's girlfriend hired a lawyer and recanted her story after telling police he threw a wine bottle at her during a January 9 argument .

"Defense attorneys for Vanderbilt rapist Brandon Vandenburg are fighting to have his conviction overturned after it emerged that one of the jurors failed to disclose they had been a victim of rape. Fletcher Long is filing a motion to have the verdict thrown out after learning that one of the jurors who convicted Vandenburg on Tuesday was sexually assaulted 20 years ago, WTVF reported. The jury in Nashville, Tennessee convicted Vandenburg, 21, and his former Vanderbilt football teammate Cory Batey, 21, of gang-raping an unconscious student in a dorm room in June 2013. Long said he wants to know if the juror lied during the selection process. 'It would've been useful to know this information in a case that had some of the same types of scenarios and allegations to which [the juror] had been a victim,' Long told WTVF on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Overturned? An attorney for convicted rapist Brandon Vandenburg (left) is arguing there should be a mistrial because one of his jurors was a rape victim. He was found guilty with Cory Batey (right) on Tuesday . Attorney: Vandenburg's lawyer Fletcher Long says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection . 'It's incredible they didn't think that information was warranted. It could cause a mistrial, it could cost the entire case.' But an attorney for the state, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, told the station that he does not think the situation will warrant a mistrial. The issue will be discussed at the men's sentencing hearing on March 6, when they face between 15 and 60 years in prison. Batey was found guilty of four counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of attempted aggravated rape on Tuesday. Vandenburg was found guilty of the same charges, as well as one count each unlawful photography and tampering with evidence. It took the jurors just three hours to convict the men. On Thursday, three of the jurors spoke out to that they made their decisions early on in the case after seeing cell phone footage of the attack. 'As soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with,' Todd Easter told ABC News. Easy decision: Jurors (from left), Dr Deirdre Young, Todd Easter and Dr. Corbi Milligan said they knew they had to convict Vandenburg and Batey when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack . 'What we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred.' Another juror, Dr. Deirde Young, said watching the footage - which showed Vandenburg egging on Batey and two other men as the woman lay unconscious - made her feel 'awful.' 'I asked myself, ""how could they do this to that young lady?""' Young added. 'There can't be enough explanation to me. I don't know, I think they need to do some real soul searching. I've never experienced anything like these young men.' They said the case was extremely emotional for them, and they all 'crumbled' when they retired to the jury room, Young said. In the trial, the victim had testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room. After dragging her to his dorm room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said. The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her. Shock: Vandenburg  shook his head after the verdict was announced while Batey did not look impressed . Heartbroken: Vandenburg's parents embrace one another after the guilty verdict was announced on Tuesday . 'It wasn't just about sexual gratification and fun, it was about degrading her, humiliating her,' Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman said in his closing arguments on Tuesday. Throughout the trial, the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture, where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol. 'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. 'The hard work of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and victims' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible. 'I want to especially thank detective Jason Mayo, Sgt. Mike Shreeve, Detective Chad Gish, Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman, Assistant District Attorneys Jan Norman and Roger Moore and victims' advocates Wanda Swan, Lt. Rochelle Barrios and Teresa Shearon. You are my heroes and I am so proud of and grateful for each of you. 'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. 'Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.' But Thurman said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial. 'The culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules don't apply to them, that's the real culture you saw here,' he told the court on Tuesday. 'Their mindset that they could get away with anything. 'The rules don't apply to us'.' Defense attorneys had also argued that Batey had consumed too much alcohol to be in control of his actions, while Vandenburg had not actually penetrated the woman because he was unable to. But the jury's mind was made up. As the verdict was announced, Batey sat emotionless as the jury read their verdict, while Vandenburg shook his head and rolled his eyes, in compete disbelief over the jury's decision. Vandenburg's father could be heard crying out as the guilty charges were read against his son according to WSMV. The victim was also in the courtroom for the verdict, and began crying as the two men were declared guilty on all counts. A statement from the victim was read afterwards to the courtroom, in which she said; 'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. 'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.' 'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case . Vanderbilt released a statement as well in which Vice Chancellor Beth Fortune said; 'Our heart goes out to the victim. Her testimony was forceful and brave. She has received our care and support.' She then added; 'The safety and security of our students is Vanderbilt's top priority. Sexual violence will never be tolerated. Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished.' Both men were immediately taken in following the verdict to await sentencing. Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have also been charged in the incident but a trial date for their case has not yet been announced. Aggravated rape is punishable by 15 to 80 years in jail, while aggravated sexual battery is punishable by 8 to 30 years in jail. Vandenburg also faces up to 6 years for the unlawful photography charge and 15 years for tampering with evidence.

"Brock Allen Turner, 19, is accused of raping an unconscious woman near fraternity housing . The former Stanford University swim star charged with raping an unconscious woman has admitted to fondling her, but denies rape. Brock Allen Turner, 19, told police he met the woman at a party at the Kappa Alpha House and they were kissing outside. He said he took off the woman's underwear, penetrated her with his hands and touched her breasts, but never took off his pants. According to Turner, the woman appeared to be enjoying herself as she rubbed his back. He added that his 'intentions were not to try and rape the girl without her consent' but to '""hook up"" with a girl,' the report said. The alleged victim gave a statement saying she drank four whiskey shots two hours before arriving at the Kappa Alpha party on January 17. She then 'blacked out' 30 minutes later after two shots of vodka and stepping outside with her sister, her statement continues. Turner was detained on January 18 after allegedly being spotted by two cyclists then trying to flee. The pair managed to tackle him while a third man called the police, Santa Clara County prosecutors say. After his arrest he was released on $150,000 bail. The Ohio-born teenager has been charged with five counts of sexual assault, including rape of an unconscious woman, rape of an intoxicated woman and two charges of sexual assault with a foreign object. The alleged victim was not enrolled at Stanford and was visiting the campus for a party, according to the district attorney's office . 'She was lying on the ground unconscious, not moving,' said Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci of the alleged victim. 'She's recovering,' Kianerci added. The woman was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries. If convicted Turner, who raced in the London 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, could face up to 10 years in prison. He voluntarily withdrew from the university yesterday, Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin told the LA Times. Turner is also no longer practicing with his swim team. Turner last swam for the university in a January 10 meet against Pacific, finishing third in the 1,000-yard freestyle and second in the 200-yard backstroke. Heavy.com reports that Turner, originally from Ohio, swam for the Dayton Raiders before being recruited for Stanford and was a three-time All-American high school swimmer at Oakwood High School.

Some accomplishments include breaking the Ohio record for fastest time by a male 18 and under in the 800-meter freestyle, winning high school state titles in the 200 and 500 freestyle, and making the U.S. Junior National team. Stanford isn't letting Turner's athletic excellence obfuscate his alleged criminal behavior. 'This is something that the University takes very seriously, and the University took immediate action,' said Lapin to The Stanford Daily. The former first year student is not allowed to re-register for classes and is barred from setting foot on campus, according to Lapin. The alleged attack took place near some student housing and the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, but there is no indication the fraternity is involved in the investigation, she said. The alleged attack took place on Stanford University's campus in Santa Clara County . Turner is expected to appear in court to enter a plea on Monday. SFGate reports that Stanford is among the Universities criticized for having relaxed policies on sexual assault. A law professor at the university, Michele Landis Dauber, has urged the school to make serious changes in their policies towards sexual assault. Only four of the 175 reported sexual assaults at Stanford between 1997 and 2009 were properly investigated. Dauber has called the statistics 'appalling.' Dauber said that despite some improvement by the school in investigating sexual assault cases and acting for welcoming to victims, there is still room for improvement. The school commended the cyclists who stepped in to save the alleged rape victim. 'Several students, both graduates and undergraduates, were upstanders in this situation,' Catherine Criswell, the University's Title IX Coordinator, told the Stanford News Report. 'They made the courageous decision to intervene and provide assistance. That is exactly the type of leadership and caring we attempt to cultivate in our community, and we commend those students on their courage and quick response.'","Brock Allen Turner, 19, says he removed the woman's underwear, penetrated her with his hands and touched her breasts but denies rape .

"A northeast Ohio couple have told police that a burglar broke in and made himself at home before ransacking the property. The intruder seemed to be in no hurry because he or she took time to feed their dog bologna, make a pot of coffee and smoke some cigarettes. Richard Nisely and his wife from Newton Falls told WKBN-TV they were picked up by police on an outstanding warrant earlier this week. A northeast Ohio couple said an intruder made themselves comfortable when they broke into their home - eating bologna and drinking some coffee before stealing some of their belongings . They secured the apartment when they left, but when the pair returned, the property had been trashed. Prescription drugs were stolen, along with a video game console, a DVD player and dozens of movies. WFMJ-TV reports police determined that someone pried open a side door and that, as the police report put it, the intruder 'was comfortable while they were there.'

"For most men, turning a pot-belly into a rippling six-pack is the stuff of dreams. But Julius Kieser, 34, turned it into a reality - transforming his physique in a mere eight weeks. The father-of-five, from Mooloolaba, Australia, who had padded out thanks to a lack of exercise underwent the dramatic transformation. Scroll down for video . The transformation of Julius from paunchy (left: WEEK ONE) to chiseled (right: WEEK SEVEN) is incredible . Julius said he never used to consider what he ate, using his busy lifestyle to justify 'treating' himself (left, before), but now each meal is considered for its nutritional value (right, with his wife Sharny, 34) Like many working people, Julius said his lifestyle saw weight gain creep up on him. Although he used to be a personal trainer, and still writes books on fitness, he works mainly as a shadow writer, which sees him spending most of his day sitting at a desk. 'I used to be in denial about how sloppy I had become,' he admits. 'Once I started taking photos, I realised how much I had been lying and hiding from myself. I felt like I was not man enough to be the father of five children.' 'Worst of all, I knew what to do. As a fitness author, who made a living telling people how to stay in shape, one would expect me to treat my body like a temple. But I didn't, I just drowned myself in excuses and denial. And of course a lot of food.' A tough financial start to 2014 saw Julius spend more time at work, at the cost of his health. Left: WEEK TWO of Julius's self designed fitness programme, and right, WEEK THREE . 'I was stressed and needed to work, I didn't even think about what I ate, I just ate what I could. I barely saw my kids, I just worked and worked, substituting sleep with food.' 'Because I lived 'in the moment' and every day I felt I 'deserved' to have a variety of treats and junk food.' When his father died unexpectedly in June, Julius found himself rethinking his priorities. 'At the funeral I saw my brother, who works much longer, harder hours than me, and he had abs. Breakfast: Porridge with milk and honey . Lunch: Whole loaf of bread with chicken and mayo or cheese and avocado . Dinner: Take away meal . Snacks: Crackers with cheese, toast . Breakfast: Egg white and banana smoothie . Lunch: Can of tuna with tomato and onion . Second Lunch: White fish with lots of steamed vegetables . Dinner: 400g rump steak . 'While I was stuffing my gob with cupcakes, I watched him eat salad. I realised then that I didn't have to choose between health and work. I could fit both in.' Working out everyday for 30 minutes, Julius, decided to work exercise into his family life, rather than trying to fit it in around it. 'I created a program for myself using periodised strength and conditioning that would allow me to use my kids as resistance, so that I could play with them and get exercise in. Kids make great kettlebell replacements, and even better personal trainers because they won't ever stop asking for ""one more rep"".' WEEK FOUR (left) of the transformation sees a marked increase in definition, while WEEK FIVE (right) a clear size difference can be seen in the width of Julius's torso . He also totally transformed his diet, eating purely for nutrition rather than comfort. 'Every meal is accounted for and calculated in advance, so I don't have any way to cheat. I created a web app that calculated what my calories and macros needed to be in order to get to my body fat goal. Once I had calculated it, I designed a meal plan for the day that I stuck to every single day,' he explains. In less than eight weeks, Julius dropped his body fat from an unhealthy 20 per cent to less than 8 per cent, and had the abs to show for it. WEEK SIX: Daily workouts and a strict diet plan have seen Julius totally change his physique . As soon as he got home, Julius set about fixing his diet, using proven mathematical formulas for fat loss. It wasn't until he combined the nutrition with fast, effective workouts in the back yard that he started to see dramatic results. Speaking about his new transformed body, Julius says: 'Now, I feel empowered, I have conquered my inner glutton. 'The weight loss was secondary. I had become far more efficient at work, and as a result of the good food, became a lot kinder with the kids, who I would involve with my exercising. They deserved fun from me, not work related anger.' Julius and wife Sharney with their children Josh, 18, Alexis, 4, Danté, 3, Emmett, 2, and Hugo, 7 months . He is so enthusiastic about his methods that he has now created the FITdad program to help other working fathers to 'get lean, without killing their kids.' 'Fitdad is part how-to and part documentary. I wanted to show dads exactly how to do it. But I also wanted them to see the suffering and hard work that goes with losing weight. 'It's not all sunshine and roses, but if I can do it, any dad can.'","With five children - four under age five- Julius has a hectic life .
Admits this and work stress led to him 'treating himself' with food .
Decided to tackle weight gain and devised own workout plan and diet .

"A 20-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack during cosmetic surgery on Friday morning had her procedure completed by doctors before she was rushed to hospital. The woman was undergoing surgery at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney yesterday when she fell unconscious and went into cardiac arrest, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The woman was stabilised by the anaesthetist as doctors went on to finish up the procedure as part of the clinic's 'strict protocol', managing director David Segal told Daily Mail Australia. She was then taken to hospital in a serious condition but is now in full recovery. A woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, was undergoing a cosmetic procedure at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney on Friday morning when she fell unconscious . Yesterday morning paramedics responded at about 10.15am to reports the woman had suffered cardiac arrest, had fallen unconscious and wasn't breathing. Staff at the clinic reportedly performed CPR on the woman and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived. She was taken to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition but is now stable, a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said. Mr Segal said the new patient was believed to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic. He would not reveal the procedure the woman was undergoing due to patient confidentiality but said the incident occurred halfway through surgery. 'The onsite anaesthetist was able to revert her back to normal, stabilise her and the surgery was able to be completed,' Mr Segal told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was part of our strict protocol as we did not want to send her to hospital with gaping wounds.' Managing director of The Cosmetic Institute, David Segal, said the woman was believed to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic . The clinic advertises a number of cosmetic procedures including breast implants, liposuction, labiaplasty and eyelid rejuvenation . Mr Segal said his staff had following protocol to call an ambulance 'as quickly as possible'. 'We've performed well over 10,000 procedures, and... with any type of procedure that you undergo, there are always going to be risks associated with it,' he said. According to the clinic's Facebook page, the woman is in 'good spirits and grateful for the excellent care she received from The TCI team'. 'We have also been informed from Westmead that our patient has made a full recovery,' it reads. The incident was described as an 'unforeseen event that occurred, unrelated to the surgery itself'. The clinic advertises a number of cosmetic procedures including breast implants, liposuction, labiaplasty and eyelid rejuvenation.","Woman was undergoing a procedure at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney on Friday morning .

"A deep-sea treasure hunter who vanished during a court fight over his $50 million haul of gold bars and coins eluded capture by hiding in a two-room hotel suite under a fake name, paying for everything in cash and keeping a low-profile, authorities said Thursday. When Tommy Thompson and his longtime companion did leave the Florida hotel room, usually alone and her more than him, they would use a combination of buses, taxis and walking around to shake anyone who might be tailing them. 'That's all part of the whole tradecraft — trying to fly under the radar of law enforcement,' said Barry Golden of the U.S. Marshals Service in Miami. Scroll down for video . Arrests: Fugitive Tommy Thompson, left, and his long-time companion Alison Antekeier, right, were taken into custody in Florida on Tuesday, two years after he failed to attend a court hearing . Caught: In this November 1989 file photo, Tommy Thompson holds a $50 pioneer gold piece retrieved from the wreck of the gold ship Central America. Thompson, wanted for more than 2 years was arrested in Florida . Thompson, 62, was wanted after he failed to appear in an Ohio courtroom in 2012 in a lawsuit about the gold he brought up in 1988 from a 19th-century shipwreck. Two investors who had funded Thompson's dream to find the shipwreck sued, as did some of his crew members, who said they also had been cheated out of their share. Found: Gold bars and coins from the S.S. Central America were discovered by Thompson. He reportedly recovered three tons of coins and bars from the wreck . Thompson and his companion, Alison Anteiker, were arrested Tuesday in West Boca Raton and Thompson on Thursday appeared in federal court for a preliminary hearing. They are being held without bond — she on a civil contempt charge, he on a criminal contempt charge. He hasn't been charged with a crime over his handling of proceeds from the gold. For more than two years, U.S. marshals in Ohio and Florida worked to track down Thompson. They did meticulous research, splashed his face on electronic billboards and ran down hundreds of tips from the public. They believed Thompson was highly intelligent and had been planning to disappear for some time. On Sept. 12, 2008, he was arrested at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station, carrying nine identification cards — eight of which police said were fake, according to an incident report. He was charged with possession of drugs without a prescription with the intent to sell, holding a fake ID, false personation and resisting an officer without violence. Court records show prosecutors later dropped all the counts, but it's not immediately clear why. After his disappearance four years later, authorities found more evidence at a Vero Beach mansion he rented between 2006 and 2012, paying the monthly $3,000 rent with cash and putting the utilities in the landlord's name. Among the clues: A book called 'How to Live Your Life Invisible' describing how to get by on a cash-only basis; bank wraps for $10,000; metal pipes that authorities believed were used to store money underground; and 12 active cellphones, each used for specific attorneys or family members. Search: Billboards displayed wanted posters for the fugitives before they were found on Tuesday. Thompson had been on the lam for two years, accused of cheating investors out of their share of $50 million in gold bars . 'Thompson was smart — perhaps one of the smartest fugitives ever sought by the U.S. Marshals, along with almost limitless resources and approximately a 10-year head start,' U.S. Marshal Michael Tobin said in a statement. But there was a trail. Based on an unspecified lead developed by Ohio agents in December, Florida authorities started focusing on Anteiker. On Tuesday, agents spotted Anteiker after fanning out over an area of Palm Beach County, Golden said. They tailed her for the next seven hours, watching her use buses and taxis to get to various destinations, an obvious attempt to lose anyone, Golden said. Eventually, Anteiker unknowingly led agents to a Hilton Hotel in suburban Boca Raton area surrounded by golf courses, country clubs and gated communities. Authorities believe Thompson and Anteiker were living there for up to two years. The room was under one of three fake names being used by Anteiker. Based on statements from hotel staff, they believe Anteiker left the hotel room much more often than Thompson. Wrecked: The U.S. Mail ship S.S. Central America sank after sailing into a hurricane in September 1857. 425 people were killed and thousands of pounds of gold sank with it to the bottom of the ocean . Much of the haul Thompson discovered was sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million. The 161 investors who paid Thompson $12.7 million to find the ship said they never saw returns from the sale. During the brief court hearing Thursday, a shackled and bearded Thompson suggested a willingness to fight extradition to Ohio, where he grew up and was based before he moved to Florida in the mid-2000s. Thompson told U.S. Magistrate Dave Lee Brannon he has 'been very ill for a number of years' with a type of encephalitis, an overactive immune system and allergies that would be exacerbated if he is taken north. His friends have previously told The Associated Press that he contracted some type of autoimmune disease from a mosquito in South America and that warm, humid climates help his condition. Thompson said he had not yet hired an attorney. He was ordered back into custody, and another hearing was set for Wednesday. In 1988, Thompson made history when he found the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, which sank in a hurricane about 200 miles off the South Carolina coast in September 1857. Four hundred and twenty-five people drowned and thousands of pounds of California gold were lost, contributing to an economic panic. Ted Thomas, a cousin who attended the court hearing, said Thompson was driven to the treasure hunt by his love of science and technology and unattainable feats, but that it ultimately ruined his life. 'If he had to do it all over again, he wouldn't do it,' Thomas said. 'You don't throw away your life for something that's yellow and weighs a lot.'","Tommy Thompson hired scientists and engineers to dive for gold in sunken historic ship .

"Qatar has become the biggest shareholder in British Airways in a deal which has raised fears over security. The gas-rich Middle Eastern state has bought a £1.15billion slice of IAG, which owns BA and Iberia. Critics pointed out that Qatar stands accused of having links with terrorist organisations including Hamas, Islamic State and Al Qaeda. They say that allowing it part-ownership of Britain’s national carrier raises clear security issues. Scroll down for video . Qatar has become the biggest shareholder in British Airways after buying a £1.15billion slice of IAG, which owns BA and Iberia . The nearly 10 per cent stake has been bought by Qatar Airways, which is owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and the deal makes it the single biggest shareholder of the airline group. It is claimed the deal will strengthen BA’s transatlantic networks, while IAG wants to bolster its ties with Middle East and Asian airline networks. BA is only the latest of Qatar’s controversial British acquisitions – others include Harrods and the Shard skyscraper – and the move has reignited concerns about its growing role in UK companies. Qatar already owns a 20 per cent stake in Heathrow and Qatar Airways’ boss Akbar Al-Baker sits on the airport’s board. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, welcomed Qatar as a 'long-term supportive shareholder' Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, welcomed Qatar as a ‘long-term supportive shareholder’ and said it plans to ‘work more closely together and further IAG’s ambitions as the leading global airline group’. But Baroness Cox, a cross-bench peer and founder of the charity Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust, said: ‘Companies that accept investment or agree to work with Qatar should consider very carefully its human rights record and whether they are supporting a regime that is incompatible with British values.’ Political campaigner Alexander Craig, a former leader of the Christian Peoples Alliance, said: ‘Airlines in general and BA in particular are hugely strategic assets and important targets for terrorists. ‘What are we doing selling our national airline to a country that is widely accused of funding terrorism and that clearly does not share either our values or interests?’ Qatar insists it does not support terrorist organisations and has acted to block the funding of such groups by its citizens. It is also a member of the United States-led military coalition against IS.","Qatar has bought a £1.15billion share of IAG that owns BA and Iberia .

"Meet the man who has made it his life mission to rub shoulders with the stars, setting out on a two-decade hunt to meet 5,000 celebrities. Jeremiah Oresky's hobby has become so costly that he has even had to take out a second job in order to continue towards his goal. However, his hard work appears to be paying off and in the last year alone the 34-year-old has met more than 500 celebs including Bradley Cooper, Daniel Radcliffe, Martin Freeman and Emma Stone. Jeremiah Oresky has spent two decades tracking down celebrities for selfies, he is pictured here with Will.i.am in May 2014 being dubbed the celebrity hunter . Jeremiah travels the country meeting celebrities both on the street and at conventions. Pictured here with actor Bradley Cooper in November 2014 . Over his 20 years of celebrity hunting, Jeremiah has met between 5,000 and 6,000 stars - so many in fact he can't put a specific number on them. Jeremiah from Baltimore, Maryland, started his celebrity quest in 1994 when he met actor John De Lancie from Star Trek: The Next Generation - and became obsessed with spotting his next A lister. 'I started getting autographs at Star Trek conventions in 1994 and only started getting photos with them in 2005.' Last year alone the 34-year-old met 500 celebrities. Pictured here with Gwen Steffani in May 2013 . He now spends around £5,000 each year funding his habit. Pictured here with Piers Morgan in April 2013 . Jeremiah says that at the end of the day the celebs he meets 'are just people with very cool jobs'. Pictured here with Seth Rogan in September 2013 . Now he spends up to £5,000 ($8,000) each year travelling across the US to add to his selfie collection - working two jobs to bankroll his Hollywood hobby. Despite having met a plethora of famous faces Jeremiah claims that he still gets star struck when he meets them in person, but says he tries to keep his cool. 'I'm usually excited when I see certain stars but I try to act as calm and normal as possible. Jeremiah is so dedicated to his project that he has even taken on a second job to fund his hobby. Pictured here with Vanessa Hudgens in May 2014 . Jeremiah says that he does still get star struck when he meets celebrities. Pictured here with Will Smith in December 20123 . Jeremiah is estimated to have met between 5,000-6,000 celebrities, so many in fact that he has lost count. Pictured here with Mark Ronson in November 2014 . Jeremiah does not remain impartial when it comes to celebs and admits to having favourites. Pictured here with Keanu Reeves in September 2014 . 'At the end of the day they are just people with very cool jobs.' When it comes to picking favourites Jeremiah does not remain impartial with one particular man sticking in his memory. 'Two of the nicest celebrities include Robin Williams and Chris Pratt. 'Robin Williams was one of the nicest guys you would ever have wanted to meet. He always made time for fans and his body of work speaks for itself.' The celeb enthusiast says that Robin Williams and Chris Pratt were some of the friendlier celebs. Pictured here with Daniel Radcliffe in July 2014 . Jeremiah says he has received a frostier reception from Jennifer Lawrence and Sean Penn. Pictured here with David Schwimmer in May 2013 . Jeremiah says he has no plans of quitting his hobby with the ultimate goal being to meet Johnny Depp. Pictured here with Sarah Jessica Parker -date unknown . Jeremiah has met a variety of celebrities including actors, singers and television presenters. Pictured here with Jon Hamm in March 2013 . As well as having his favourites Jeremiah admits that he has met some colder characters over the course of his celeb conquest. 'Some of the least friendly include Jennifer Lawrence, Sean Penn and Edward Norton.' Along with the great amount of patience and research that is required in his hobby it also proves to be very costly. 'The most expensive aspect of meeting celebrities aside from travel is attending autograph conventions where certain celebrities charge for photos and autographs. As well as bumping into celebs on the street Jeremiah has been known to pay for autographs off 'rarer' stars. Pictured here with Emma Stone in May 2014 . Jeremiah says that he tries to remain as calm as possible when meeting famous faces. Pictured here with Chis O'Dowd in May 2013 .

Jeremiah has been building up his collection of selfies since 1994. Pictured here with Steve Carrell in September 2014 . Ben Affleck puts an arm around his fan in May 2013 . 'I'm not against paying if it's for a rare name that I probably wouldn't have the opportunity to meet on the street and it's always nice to have a guarantee. 'Of course I always meet celebrities on the street because most celebrities don't do conventions and this is the only way to meet them.' Although he has had to take on a second job in retail on top of his day job for the American government to pay for his hobby, Jeremiah says he has no intention of slowing down soon. 'I'll probably never stop completely but it is possible that I could tone it down a bit if I ever settle down and have a family. 'I still want to meet Johnny Depp so I won't quit before I do.' In order to bump into celebrities Jeremiah spends a lot of time waiting around in the cold. Pictured here with Jake Gyllenhall in January 2015 .

"A rogue travel agent who duped holidaymakers out of tens of thousands of pounds by selling tickets for non-existent flights has been ordered to repay just £1. Dean Oliver, who is serving a three-year sentence behind bars, avoided a hefty sum of restitution after he pleaded poverty and an investigation found that he has no assets or cash to forfeit. Birmingham Crown Court heard the 46-year-old conman lived a ‘criminal lifestyle’ which involved ripping off customers with false promises of cheap flights and is believed to have netted him more than £100,000. Dean Oliver is believed to have netted £100,000 in a holiday scam that sold non-existent plane tickets . But Mr Oliver, from Manchester, had blown all of the cash and there was no realistic prospect of recovering any assets or funds, said prosecutor Ben Mills. As a result the Crown asked for a confiscation order of just £1 even though his victims each lost hundreds or thousands of pounds when they booked dream holidays or trips to visit family or attend weddings. Mr Oliver, who was pictured grinning following a Birmingham Crown Court appearance last year, was jailed for three years last September after a jury found him guilty at trial last July. An investigation found that Dean Oliver had blown all of the cash and there were no assets to seize . The Jamaican could have to serve just a single extra day at the end of his sentence if he fails to cough up the £1 by March 17. Mr Oliver was convicted of 19 charges of fraud and two of using a false instrument, covering a total of £25,993. But an investigation found another £103,649 of unexplained deposits in his accounts. The scheming crook promised cheap flights from his Smethwick-based travel firm and then from Digbeth, but he left 19 holidaymakers in the lurch between 2011 and 2012. Mr Oliver was convicted of 19 charges of fraud and two of using a false instrument, covering £25,993 . He set up a frequent flyers' club which aimed to attract seven million members, and he was arrested after a mob descended on his Digbeth office. Judge Richard Bond delivered a scathing address when he sentenced Mr Oliver last year, saying the scheme was ‘at best comical’ and ‘at worst’ involved ‘bare-faced lies’. He said: ‘You have an easy charm about you, I saw that demonstrated when you gave evidence to the jury, a kind smile which you used to gain the confidence of your victims. An investigation found another £103,649 of unexplained deposits in Dean Oliver's accounts . ‘I don't accept for one moment you believed this business model would succeed. I form the view you are a confidence trickster, taking money from customers knowing full well you wouldn't provide them with tickets. ‘They were all decent, hardworking people who used your services because of promises you made them. They were easy targets because they wanted tickets to visit family or important occasions such as weddings.’ ‘They are decent, loyal people, words that cannot be used to describe yourself.’","Dean Oliver ripped off customers with false promises of cheap flights .

Plastic surgeon Dr. Justin West told KTLA 5 health problems arise because there are many risks associated with these procedures. 'The big danger is silicone getting into the blood stream, and ultimately ending up in the lungs, the brain or the heart and ultimately causing death,' West said. Antonio Viramontes from the LGBT Center Orange County said that transgender women are being injected with silicone, airplane fuel and even dog urine  by people with no medical training. 'People are injecting a lot of unusual things into their bodies in order to achieve this higher standard of beauty,' he said.","The victim attended the party at an unknown location in California .

"Tempted to up sticks to escape the British climate? Then take a glance across the Channel, where a tumbling euro and plunging property prices mean it’s now more affordable than ever to pick up your own French chateau. The prices of some fairytale French mansions have halved since 2007, with some as cheap as £270,000 - the average cost of a British home. One French estate agency this week reported that it had 136 rambling piles for sale, each costing £500,000 or less. So if you’re dreaming of joining the lucky few whose homes boast vast rooms, gables, turrets, towers and moats, here are ten of the most affordable piles on the market in La Belle France. Maison Saint-James . Saint-James, Normandy . The Spec: 3,000 sq ft; 11 bedrooms; third of an acre . A restored chateau, it was built on the foundations of a 200-year-old house which was destroyed by Allied bombing during the war. Until recently it was used as holiday accommodation and remains in good condition. West-facing, it’s great for sunsets, and is located less than 20 miles from the fabled Mont St Michel Abbey, one of the most visited cultural sites in France. Saint-James is a charming village where William the Conqueror built a fort in 1067 and spent happy days with his wife, Matilda of Flanders, and some of their nine children. A separate guest studio, located nearby in the grounds of the maison could be rented out. AGENT: French Entrée, www.frenchentree.com . Jardin de Cure . Totes, Normandy . The Spec: 4,500 sq ft; 13 bedrooms; five acres . Set in a beautiful park with ancient chestnut trees and a walled cottage garden, this 19th century stately home has been in the same family for the past 50 years and boasts oak parquet floors and high ceilings with ornate plasterwork in many of the reception rooms. The property comes with a large outbuilding at the park entrance, which could be sold as a separate home, and is just a stroll from the village, while Normandy’s beautiful beaches are just 30 minutes’ drive away. Much admired by villagers, the chateau was previously owned by the Mayor, but has since belonged to a French grandmother who raised her family there and feels it’s too big for her to manage. AGENT: Leggett Prestige www.leggettprestige.com . Chateau Sable Sur Sarthe . Mayenne, Loire . The Spec: 4,305 sq ft; 11 bedrooms; seven acres . Listed as a historic monument, this early 17th century chateau comes with its own moat and sweeping driveway. At this price, a full renovation is required, but there is a wealth of original features to work with, from limestone fireplaces to 19th century tiles, not to mention the vast 516 sq ft dining room. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure www.groupe-mercure.com . Manoir Puy de Dome . Vall ee de la Sioule, Auvergne . The Spec: 2,475 sq ft; seven bedrooms; three quarters of an acre . This traditional chateau dates back to 1830, the year in which the conservative government of Charles X was overthrown by Louis Philippe I in what became known as the July Revolution. There are high ceilings, marble fireplaces and a beautiful stone staircase to give you a sense of grand living. With a library, orangery, music room and four generously proportioned bathrooms, this has real Downton Abbey appeal. Outside there are two garages and a stable. The large walled courtyard garden has potential to be turned into a rather grand Versailles style affair, complete with fountains and topiary. AGENT: Proprieties de France www.proprietiesdefrance.com . Chateau Giat, £318,466 . Auvergne . The Spec: Nine bedrooms and four bathrooms set in 0.7 acres of land . This beautiful chateau is reached via a gravelled drive through wrought iron gates to give it that Brideshead feel. To the rear is a beautiful lawned garden with a swimming pool, while despite the privacy afforded by the walled garden the property lies close to a pretty market town. AGENT: Leggett Immoblier www.frenchestateagents.com . Chateau de Niort . Niort: Poitou-Charentes . The Spec: 3,443 sq ft; seven bedrooms; half an acre. Built in 1880 but fully renovated, this rather splendid home is being run as a b&b, with plenty of future bookings. Should you choose to take over the business, you don’t even have to see much of your guests, as they have a separate guest lounge and two bedrooms in one wing. Not a vast amount of land, but the gardens are pretty and the chateau is less than a mile from the nearest small town. AGENT: Prestige property www.prestigeproperty.co.uk . Chateau Figeac . Figeac, La Lot . The Spec: 7,319 sq ft; six bedrooms; two-and-a-half acres of tree-lined grounds . If you like history then this is the place for you, as it’s a patchwork affair with 12th century foundations and two wings built in the 17th and 19th century respectively. The 17th century tower has a 376 sq ft salon complete with balcony, should you wish to host a string quartet to entertain your guests. Fully restored aside from one tower, there is, alas, no central heating for those chilly winter nights, although there are fireplaces aplenty. The pretty grounds have small outbuildings which also have potential for development. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure . Manoir Rethel . Champagne, Ardenne . The Spec: 5,274 sq ft; three bedrooms; 4.7 acres. A fortress built in 1659, the castle has been given listed status as its four ancient towers, in the shape of waterdrops, were deemed so unusual. The roof has been fully restored, but if you’re dismayed by the lowly number of bedrooms, a third of the house remains unrenovated, so you could always create more. The living room has a vast fireplace and separate salon. It’s also just 30 minutes from Epernay, heart of the champagne region of Reims. AGENT: Groupe Mercure . Chateau Picardie . Abbeville, Picardie . The Spec: 5,274 sq ft; nine bedrooms; ten acres . Built in 1850, this beautiful 19th century chateau has remained in the same family ever since — that’s 165 years. It retains all its original features, from wood floors to marble fireplaces, but requires a bit of TLC. Outside, the gardens/woodland are filled with ancient oak and beech trees once used as hideouts by German soldiers during the war. A Chaussee Brunehaut, the French name for an ancient Roman road through the region and said to have been used by Julius Caesar, passes nearby the chateau, which lies 12 miles from the historic town of Abbeville. The fact that it’s only 80 miles from Calais makes it a plausible weekend getaway destination. AGENT: Leggett Prestige . Chateau Allier . Allier, Auvergne . The Spec: 6,458 sq ft; seven bedrooms; 14 acres . This 19th century chateau has the fairytale factor, with Disney-style turrets. The ground floor features a 300 sq ft south-facing terrace with stunning views over the Puy mountains. It’s habitable and retains a lot of traditional features, from parquet floor to carved woodwork. A sweeping set of steps from the front door lead to your land, comprising beautiful meadows and woods bordering a river. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure .","French house prices have halved since 2007 and some mansions are now cheaper than the average UK home .
For £276,000 you could have an 11-bed former guest house in Normandy set in three quarters of an acre of land .

"Call it one small step for man, one giant leap for canine kind. A NASA astronaut's official portrait has become an internet sensation after he managed to sneak his two dogs into the frame. Leland Melvin is seen beaming as his two beloved pets, Jake and Scout, snuggle up to him. Scroll down for video . Astro-dogs: Engineer and astronaut Leland Melvin snuck his two pooches, Jake and Scout, into his official NASA photo shoot . The photo shows Melvin, 50, clad in a spacesuit with a dog on either side. The animals were clearly excited to be in the spotlight, or maybe they were just hoping to catch a ride to space. After fans of the snap started tweeting at Melvin, he shared a bonus photo from when the dogs 'were behaving' during the shoot . After stumbling across the joyful snap, reporter Adam Aton shared it with his followers and tweeted it out to Melvin's handle @Astro_flow. The twitterverse quickly proclaimed Melvin  their new favorite astronaut. 'I stopped a meeting today so we could pass this around in awe. So amazing!' tweeted another. 'You are my favorite astronaut. I'm almost 30 years old. I'm not ashamed of what i am. Thanks for all you do!', wrote one poster. And Melvin made sure to get it on the fun, sharing another photo from when his dogs 'were behaving' during the photo shoot. The portrait has since been retweeted over 2,000 times. But Twitter's newest star is only a blip on Melvin's long and varied list of accomplishments. Melvin's first job wasn't in the galaxy but on the football field. He was chosen by the Detroit Lions in the 1986 NFL Draft as a wide receiver, but was released from the team after pulling his hamstring during training camp. A recovered Melvin tried his luck that next spring with the Dallas Cowboys but pulled his hamstring a second time. Since his professional football career was over it was time for his back-up. Space. Missouri reporter Adam Aton stumbled across the photo and tweeted it to Melvin and his followers. It has since been retweeted over 2,000 times . But Melvin (posing here with Barack and Michelle Obama) is more than just a Twitter superstar. He is currently the co-chair of a White House Education Task Force to help develop the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education plan . The one-time NFL draft pick, pictured here with Elmo at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, also became the head of NASA Education after he was medically disqualified from returning to space . Melvin began working at NASA in 1989 and was selected as an astronaut in 1998. He flew two missions on the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2008 and 2009. He logged almost 10 million miles in space, with 374 orbits around the earth. But Melvin's astronaut career came to a sudden halt when he went deaf during a training exercise that required him to perform spacewalks under 25 feet of water. Melvin confirmed to users on Twitter that he snuck his dogs into the photo shoot. But Jake and Scout are no strangers to the spotlight - they were once featured in a 2010 episode of The Dog Whisperer . After Melvin's portrait went viral tweeters were quick to proclaim he was their new favorite astronaut . Although emergency surgery resulted in partial recovery of his hearing, he was medically disqualified from flying into space. But just like with his NFL career, the roadblock didn't stop Melvin. The engineer is now the head of NASA Education and is the co-chair of a White House Education Task Force to help develop the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education plan. Melvin has traveled to schools across the country to promote STEM subjects to students and teachers alike .

"These beautiful pictures of Christmas prayers and glowing nativity scenes hide a much darker reality. Hundreds of Iraqi Christians, who now occupy these makeshift tents in Erbil, were forced to abandon their homes to escape the wrath of Islamic State fighters. They are safe from immediate danger in this camp built around the Mazar Mar Eillia Catholic Church in Ankawa. But dropping temperatures pose a serious threat to those who hurriedly left their homes without their possessions or winter clothes. Eerie: A beautifully decorated Christmas tree and nativity scene provide a centre-piece for the sadness around them . Pray: The children who inhabit this camp, built around a Catholic Church in Erbil, wish simply to return home . Innocence lost: This make-shift existence has become their reality - where they live and where they play . Safe: They are safe from immediate danger on the grounds of the Mazar Mar Eillia Catholic Church, but dropping temperatures in the camp pose a new threat . Christmas spirit: But they've refused to let danger - imminent or otherwise - dampen their festive spirit . Life goes on: Nor have they let it hinder their education. Their lessons continue in a make-shift tent on the Church grounds . Christmas prayers: At night, they gather with their families around a candle-lit shrine in their new home . Sacrifice: Almost a million of them (internally displaced Iraqis) will celebrate Christmas in these temporary camps . Temporary home: And nearly half of those will be spending the winter period in the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq . Saturated: Over 250,000 Syrian refugees had already settled in the autonomous region when Islamic State began advancing further into Iraq in June . Keeping the faith: It has massively strained the resources in the autonomous region which is, for now, safe from ISIS . New wave: But with the fighting set to continue, it could be a matter of time before the population reaches breaking point . Over 250,000 Syrian refugees had already settled in the autonomous Kurdish region in Northern Iraq when Islamic State extremist began to advance further into Iraq in June. Since then, another one and a half million displaced refugees have flocked to the area. Purpose-built camps have been built for many but the sheer number of evacuees means thousands of families have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little or no warmth, and no realistic prospect of returning home. Over three million Iraqi people have been displaced from their homes and nearly two million of them have relocated inside the country, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Their movement is almost entirely a result of the fighting taking place between the Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters against Islamic State extremists. Reality: Iraqi refugees have to queue to receive their food parcels from St Joseph's Catherdral on the outskirts of Ankawa . Hungry: The men, women and children who travel to this food distribution centre are completely reliant on the aid organisations supplying it . Queuing: Hundreds of them will wait their turn until they can finally pick up the food their families need to survive . Survival: They'll haul their food parcels back to their refugee camp in Erbil to continue their day-to-day existence . New life: These food parcels are vital in keeping these families alive but the dropping temperatures pose another serious threat . It's thought that almost half of all internally displaced Iraqi's have fled to towns in Kurdistan, which is putting huge pressure on the region. The United Nations announced the situation there as a level-three emergency - their highest classification of a humanitarian crisis. Nations around the world have expressed their commitment to help the refugee crisis in Iraq and Syria. On Tuesday,the United Nations refugee agency reported that 28 nations have pledged to take in more than 100,000 people who've been uprooted by civil war in Syria. Entertainment: They hurriedly fled from their homes to avoid capture, or worse, at the hands of Islamic State. Some pass the time through music . Lunch time: Others prepare meals for their families as they would have done back in their homes . Family portrait: Others seem happy enough to be together, despite the desperate situation they find themselves in . Accommodation: Purpose-built camps were built for thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting in Iraq and Syria . Quick fix: But the sheer number of evacuees means thousands have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little to no warmth . Prayer: What's worse is there is no realistic prospect of them ever returning home . The United States are currently considering applications to resettle 9,000 of them. As it stands, only around 300 refugees have been housed in the country. The humanitarian organisation, Samaritan's Purse, airlifted tens of thousands of gift packages to camps like this in Erbil on Wednesday. People from the United States, Canada and UK combined to fill 60,000 shoe-boxes with small gifts and 'uplifting messages', according to the Christian Post. Of the two million people displaced within Iraq, nearly half have fled to safety in Kurdistan, putting huge pressure on the region’s resources, which has led the United Nations to designate the situation as a level-three emergency, the highest classification of a humanitarian crisis.","Hundreds of displaced Iraqis, forced to evacuate their towns, will celebrate Christmas in this refugee camp in Erbil .

"Campaigning: The Prime Minister on a tour of Exeter Science Park in Devon yesterday . Two senior Conservatives tipped as potential successors to David Cameron have broken ranks to insist Britain should not fear an exit from the EU. London Mayor Boris Johnson insisted a British exit – or ‘Brexit’ – ‘wouldn’t be disastrous’, while Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, a rising Tory star, said it was ‘not something anyone should be frightened of’. A Conservative pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be central to the party’s pitch ahead of May’s general election. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Javid have backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. However, they went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. In an interview with Time magazine, Mr Johnson said: ‘I think Brexit is possible... [Britain] would very rapidly come to an alternative arrangement that protected our basic trading interests. 'I must be clear. I think there would be a pretty testy, scratchy period... [but] it wouldn’t be disastrous.’ The London Mayor, who is bidding to return to Westminster at the election, also declared himself ‘definitely’ a social liberal. Dismissing the concerns of some Right-wing Tory MPs over Mr Cameron’s decision to legalise gay marriage, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t see what the fuss is about.’ Mr Javid, a protege of Chancellor George Osborne, said on the question of Britain’s EU membership: ‘My faith is in the British people. If they decide that, taking into account the renegotiation, they want to continue that relationship with the EU, of course that’s something everyone would accept. ‘But if they decide to end that relationship then that is not something anyone should be frightened of.’ The Culture Secretary told political magazine The House there were ‘some significant changes we rightly want to see in our relationship with the EU’. ‘That’s the whole point of having the negotiation followed by a referendum. I think the in/out referendum is the exact thing that concentrates the minds of your European partners. ‘If you haven’t got that then why would they seriously consider anything you want to change? And when that referendum takes place, clearly whether we are in or out is rightly a decision for the British people. It’s something the British people have wanted a say on for many years.’ Looking for an exit? Boris Johnson broke ranks to say pulling out of the EU would not be disastrous . He also suggested Tory MPs should be free to campaign on either side of the debate. ‘We’ve already seen in this Parliament, in all parties, that when it comes to issues that are really important to people… MPs ultimately, they have a relationship with their constituents and they will decide which way it is they want to campaign,’ Mr Javid said. ‘But this is something the Conservative Party is united on: we must get a renegotiation and we must put that to the British people in a referendum.’ Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the British people deserve to have their say and should be respected . As well as underlining his pledge to hold an EU referendum, Mr Cameron is expected to detail Tory plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise to establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings. The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights. Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke, a staunch Europhile, said an EU referendum could bring about the collapse of the United Kingdom. He told The Irish Times: ‘It is only just dawning on people that if we have a referendum [on the EU] and the English vote to leave and the Scots vote to stay, then I think that that will be the end of the UK. I don’t want to see the end of the UK.’ His comments came as a survey revealed that more voters now believe the UK’s closest ties should be with the EU (30 per cent) than with the US (25 per cent). It is the first time Europe has come out on top since the survey by respected international think-tank Chatham House was first conducted in 2010.","London mayor and the Culture Secretary Sajid Javid both broke ranks .

"A California  builder has transformed part of his home into a fantasy feline adventure land. Peter Cohen, co-founder of Trillium Enterprises, lives in a 3000-square-foot cat castle in Santa Barbara, and has built 150 feet of catwalks, spiral staircases, tunnels, perches and all manner of cool kitty accessories to accommodate his cat companions. Mr Cohen, who grew up as a dog-lover, turned into a cat fan after he purchased the Goleta, California house in 1988. Scroll down for video . Feline fantasy: Peter Cohen started Trillium Enterprises and used his construction prowess to build his house to his cat's liking . On the catwalk: Mr Cohen estimates that he spent between $40,000 and $50,000 on the cat shelves, of which there are more than 150 feet . The property came with two outdoor cats. However, one cat was killed and the other badly injured after both were hit by cars, so he and his partner decided to adopt a new cat from the local shelter to keep the injured pet company. From that point, they just kept adopting cats, a couple more every few years. He has added a floor to what used to be a 1600-square-foot house and now shares his four-bedroom home with Cheesecake, Charlie, Nutter, Butter, Crumple, Rumple, Cookie, Poppyseed, Mary, Secret, Wasabi, Kiro, Coffee Bean and Donut . The cat lover and his partner Manuel Flores currently only adopt from shelters and try to take cats other people do not want, most often black cats and cats with bent tails. Cat-man: Although he grew up a dog lover, Mr Cohen inherited two cats in 1988 when he bought his house . Mr Cohen, his partner Manuel Flores, and their roommate Hiro Furumoto live with 14 cats, though they have had as many as 18 . Mr Cohen first began installing catwalks in his house in 1995 and has added to his creations over the years . They have had as many as 18 but currently have 14 feline housemates - having lost four cats this year to age and disease. They also have a human housemate - Hiro Furumoto. The pussycat pad started out with the installation of catwalks in 1995 after Mr Cohen was inspired by Bob Walker's book The Cat's House, according to Zeezoey. He admits he has spent between $40,000 and $50,000 on the catwalks alone. No expense was spared for his feline friends - even though the alterations could technically have been done cheaper. 'At a certain point there was not turning back. It was like, this is their house and we're living here with them' Mr Flores told Houzz TV. Mr Flores, Mr Furumoto and Mr Cohen try to find one-on-one time to spend with the cats, who are rarely all in the same room together. Additionally, some prefer to be left alone. The humans of the house say that they also appreciate the catwalks as a form of architectural beauty . The house was originally 1600-square-feet, but Mr Cohen has made improvements including a second story and ventilated litter rooms . But Mr Cohen says he gets enjoyment from his cat-clogged house beyond just feline companionship. He says: 'The catwalks are for the cats but they're also for me. They're architecturally interesting to me in the colors and we always try to do something interesting with the shapes.' Mr Cohen says he has received numerous calls about how best to design catwalks. The builder was unsure whether his pets would use the catwalks when he first built them, but now the animals can be heard scampering around on the ledges at odd hours of the night. 'Our house was built for us AND our cats. The catwalks are fun for the cats, giving them lots of places to explore, hang out, etc,' he said. The cats are particularly interested in a koi pond that Mr Cohen built, though they have never eaten one of the fish. Soothing music also plays in the house almost all the time, according to Catster. The humans of the house are assisted in picking up cat fur by five Roomba automatic vacuum cleaners . Soothing music plays nearly all the time at Mr Cohen's house, which also features a koi pond for the lucky cats . The home builder's construction experience helped him make his house practical as well. 'I am a general contractor and wanted to create an environment that was good for both cats and humans. The fact that the litter boxes are in ventilated closets helps keep odors out of the house,' he said. The humans are aided in picking up the cats fur by five Roomba automatic vacuums. But the animal-lover isn't done purrfecting his house yet. 'We always have new catwalks on the drawing boards and will add them as time/money allow,' Mr Cohen said. He added said that despite the abundance of stimulating objects and rooms in his house, his cats still love to climb inside old boxes.","House builder Peter Cohen takes care of 14 cats in Goleta, California home .

"Former Royal Navy Officer has been jailed for 14 years for a series of sex attacks on children which led to him be being labelled 'one of the nastiest paedophiles' police had ever dealth with . A Royal Navy officer described as one of 'nastiest' paedophiles police have ever dealt with has been jailed for sexually assaulting two young children. Former Chief Petty Officer Geoffrey Rooney of Plymouth, Devon, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for a series of horrific sex crimes against children. The mother of  two of his victims has today told of the misery his sickening crimes have caused. Rooney, 39, was once well-respected in the Navy and had postings to Whitehall in 2009 and 2010 which saw him work alongside come of Britain's top commanders. But between late 2013 and early 2014 he carried out a series of sex attacks on children, some of which he  photographed on his mobile phone. Rooney was tracked down after a woman called police and said she had found indecent images of children which had been emailed to her husband. Rooney's emails which contained indecent images of children also had requests for the man to allow his own children to be sexually abused. Police found Rooney had sent pictures to another paedophile showing him abusing a sleeping child. Rooney admitted raping a girl under 13, sexually assaulting another young girl, taking indecent photos of kids, sexually assaulting a boy and making, possessing and distributing child porn images. Sentencing him at Plymouth Crown Court, Judge Paul Darlow described him as a 'casual, callous predatory paedophile'. A mother whose children were just a baby and toddler at the time of the offences has told Rooney's crimes have hugely damaged her and children's lives. She said: 'When the police told me, I started shaking uncontrollably. They came around five days later and showed us the pictures. He told the police they were my children. But we still needed to look at the pictures to identify them. 'It was just disgusting. I felt so physically sick. I just broke down and could not carry on. The image was imprinted on my mind.' The court heard Rooney (pictured with a toddler and a baby) joked about his abuse  in online forums . The mother added: 'The images will stay with us for the rest of our lives. They have caused a lot of trauma. That feeling of violation is never going to go away. '(My children) had to be taken away to be medically examined. They had to have a lot of tests. Every time I took them out they were really nervous - we had to go to a few different clinics. 'I could not face it. One of my daughters had a mental health assessment and has needed speech therapy and I have had to receive counselling.' Rooney was arrested after an image of him abusing the woman's baby was found on his mobile phone. The mother expressed her anger at Rooney's sentence, which means he will be freed in just six years. The mother said that it was Rooney's seemingly normal existence that made his crimes more chilling. Rooney was once a trusted Navy officer who was posted to Whitehall in 2009 and 2010, it has emerged . She said: 'He was not your stereotype of a paedophile and that is the scariest thing. He was a respected sailor in the Navy, who would have had to go through the strongest of background checks to work in Whitehall. 'He was really sneaky, horrible and manipulative. It was scary just how confident he was. What we have been through is every mother's worst nightmare. 'If I had any advice for others it would be to always believe what your children say, go with your gut feeling and listen to what they are saying.' After the case, investigator Det Con Pete Shotton said: '(Rooney) was utterly driven by his preoccupation with child sexual abuse. That one little phone call has uncovered one of the nastiest predatory paedophiles we've dealt with. He gloried in it.'","Officer was once trusted serviceman and was even posted to Whitehall .

"Police investigating the murder of a former Miss Venezuela and her British husband have arrested a teenager over his alleged involvement in the highway robbery. Gerardo Jose Contreras, 19, was detained in the western state of Yaracuy yesterday, according to Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz. Monica Spear, 29, and her 39-year-old husband Thomas Berry, from London, were slain in January 2014 when they resisted a robbery attempt while stranded on a lonely stretch of highway. An 11th suspect has been arrested in connection with the killing of Monica Spear, seen here competing in the Miss Universe competition in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005 . They were killed in cold blood after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway at around 10pm on January 6. Armed men surrounded the Toyota Corolla while the couple waited for a repair truck, and the terrified pair locked themselves in but the robbers opened fire through the windows. The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their then five-year-old daughter Maya, who survived despite being shot in the leg. She suffered a glancing wound and was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery. In September, three men were each sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for the killing. Contreras is the 11th suspect to be detained and faces charges including homicide and aggravated robbery. Ms Spear and husband Thomas Berry, from London, were both killed in the highway robbery . Mr Berry's British-born parents moved to Venezuela 30 years ago, while Ms Spear's parents live in Florida. Monica Spear lived in Venezuela for a few years as a child but their family moved to Florida, and she eventually graduated from the University of Central Florida. She was named Miss Venezuela in 2004 and then came in fourth place at the Miss Universe competition the next year. She was also a well-known soap actress in Venezuela, starring in the popular 'Forbidden Pleasures' show. Ms Spear and Mr Berry had reportedly separated a year before their death but remained close and went on vacations together to spend time with their daughter. They were on one such trip touring the country during the week leading up to the attack and their friends thought that it may lead to a reunion. Police have attributed the fatal attack to the damaging of Venezuela's moral fibre as a result of the dramatic telenovelas like the one that Ms Spears starred in. The oil-rich has one of the world's highest homicide rates. The couple locked themselves in their car but the robbers fired through the windows, killing them both . Three men have already been sentenced to more than 20 years in prison each over the killings .","Gerardo Jose Contreras, 19, was detained in Venezuela yesterday .

"Andy Eckersall (pictured) from Stockport was eating a large Tandoori Hot pizza from Domino's when he claims he found a chicken claw in his mouth . An IT director was horrified to discover an inch-long 'chicken claw' in his Domino's pizza - but only noticed after it got stuck in his gum. Andy Eckersall, 35, from Stockport in Greater Manchester, was tucking into a large Tandoori Hot pizza from the takeaway when he felt something hard dig into his gum. He claims that to his disgust he pulled out an inch-long grisly black claw from his mouth. Bosses at the popular pizza takeaway franchise have said they are investigating the incident. Mr Eckersall said: 'I initially thought it was a burnt piece. It stuck into my gum. 'When I pulled it out I saw it and it was this claw with gristle around the knuckle. ' I initially wanted to throw up. My wife was horrified. It was the last piece of that half of the pizza. 'It was not really solid because it had been baked. It could have hooked into someone's throat. It could quite easily have been swallowed and got jammed.' He said that he and his wife ordered two large pizzas, garlic bread, potato wedges and a bottle of Coca Cola from their local Domino's branch in Heaton Chapel, costing £22.99. After finding the claw Mr Eckersall said he immediately rang the local branch, who he has ordered from many times the past, to complain. He said: 'I got straight on the phone to the Heaton Chapel Branch. Their immediate response was to say they were sorry and that they would send another pizza. 'I said ""no I do not want another pizza."" At that point I was still in shock.' The branch told Mr Eckersall they would send a driver over to collect the offending claw and the remaining uneaten pizza. After being ignored for an hour and a half, Mr Eckersall said he called the branch back at 9pm to find out what was happening. Mr Eckersall said: 'An hour and a half later there was still no driver. I phoned back to ask what was going on and said I want a refund. The mystery claw Mr Eckersall claims to have found in his Domino's pizza - he says he could have choked . Bosses at the popular pizza takeaway have said they have launched an investigation into the incident . 'I got on the phone with a girl called Sonya and I was chatting to her and she said they would give us a refund and that they would send out the van.' But after the van not turning up and initially receiving no response to his complaint from the pizza company he resorted to posting a rant on the Domino's Pizza UK Facebook page. It read: 'The pizza arrived promptly, but whilst eating I experienced a sharp pain and found myself half choking whilst chewing a mouthful of pizza that had chicken tikka on it. 'I continued to pull a solid chunk out of my mouth and to my horror found I'd been chewing on a chicken claw!?!?' 'With something as serious as this I was amazed that it wasn't dealt with as a priority, it appears that your company prefers to continue sending out drivers for more profit than worrying about sharp objects being put in your pizzas! 'I was promised there would be a driver sent out immediately and would be with us within 10 minutes.' Mr Eckersall added: 'When the driver turned up he said ""that's not nice"". 'I said ""I was chewing on that mate."" It wasn't his fault though. He took it away and that was the end of it. 'I was happy to just get my money back and try and forget the whole thing.' Mr Eckersall and his wife had ordered the pizza from their local Domino's in Heaton Chapel (pictured) As the couple had paid for their Domino's takeout meal on January 16 through PayPal the branch said they would receive a refund in the next 3-5 working days. However the following Thursday they had still received no refund and the manager of the Heaton Chapel Domino's called Mr Eckersall up to tell him they could not give him the refund and he would have to email the head office. Having not received any email back from Domino's head office, Andy took matters into his own hands and took to Facebook again to share his nightmare takeout. It read: 'Why couldn't your own staff contact you themselves and get this sorted!? And even worse, having emailed that address with my complaint on Thursday, it is now the following Monday and still nobody has got back to me?!?!!' Since posting the rant on Domino's UK Facebook page the disturbing picture of the claw has been shared nearly 400 times. Mr Eckersall said he has contacted Environmental Health about the claw to see if they could help . Mr Eckersall said today: 'I stuck it on Facebook to see if I got any response. I got one response from them asking if I had a reference number.' 'I replied that I had been fobbed off by the branch to email them. Someone must know about it but I haven't heard anything back since.' Mr Eckersall said he has contacted Environmental Health to see what they could do to help. He said: 'The girl I spoke to was horrified herself. She did say it was hard to tell from pictures what it is. 'She said it is hard to tell if it is a chicken claw although a couple of people on facebook were saying it could be a dog claw. 'It is very difficult for them to do anything without the claw itself to analyse. 'She is going to try to get hold of the area manager to see if there has been any investigation or record into it.' He added: 'God knows how it got in there. Possible someone was just trying to pump the pizzas out without looking. 'But how it got in the pizza I don't know. The Environmental Health lady said it could be from the supplier but how did the claw get there is beyond me. 'The whole thing is ridiculous. I will never eat there again, that's for sure.' In a statement a spokesperson for Domino's Pizza Group PLC said: 'The safety of our food is of upmost priority for Domino's and we have strict processes and procedures in place for handling all ingredients and pizzas. 'We are currently working with the store to conduct a full and thorough investigation into this issue and ensure this is resolved to the customer's satisfaction.' Just two days ago MailOnine reported how a disgusted university student was left with a foul taste in her mouth after taking a bite into her Domino's pepperoni pizza and finding a fingernail. Sophie Manser, 20, was having a night in with her housemates enjoying films and a takeaway when she heard a crunch and realised she had bit into the yellowed nail, which was baked into the crust. The third year Plymouth University student offered the rest of the slice to a friend who was more than happy to finish it and the unfazed Miss Manser continued to eat the remainder. She then contacted the takeaway in the Mutley area of Plymouth in Devon where she ordered the food and was sent a replacement and vouchers for two free pizzas as an apology. She said: 'I was just having a night in with my housemates so we decided to order Dominos and watch some films. 'When I was eating my third slice, I bit down on something crunchy. 'I pulled it out my mouth and was shocked to see it was a quite big human fingernail . 'It looked like it had been bitten or torn off and baked in the crust. It was pretty disgusting really.'

"Backpacker Jack Davies, 21, was found hanged in Thailand 'after feeling pressure to come home' to Britain, an inquest heard . A backpacker who moved to Thailand after watching Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach was found hanged in his hotel room 'after feeling pressure to come home'. Jack Davies, 21, was found dead 6,000 miles from home, moving to the tropical paradise after seeing the Danny Boyle cult movie, an inquest heard.

"Iggy Azalea has been left furious after Steve Madden allegedly released images from 'the most disgusting photo shoot ever' to promote her debut line with them, without her approval. The rapper took to Twitter on Thursday to lash out at the brand, claiming they shared the photos via company-launched Tumblr page smxiggy.tumblr.com - which has since been taken down - without telling her. ‘Everything in a collaboration is supposed to be mutually approved. But Steve Madden did the most disgusting photo shoot ever and never even told me about it,’ the 24-year-old fumed. Scroll down for video . Not happy: Iggy Azalea unleashed on shoe company Steve Madden via a series of furious Tweets, claiming they shared images promoting the upcoming collaboration through a company-launched Tumblr page without telling her . Although Steve Madden have since blocked the page, it wasn't before Iggy could label the images as  ‘god awful.' However a few hours after her angry tweets, she released three images on her Instagram account from the campaign that she said she 'absolutely loved' alongside a statement. ‘For the record: I absolutely LOVE these images they are from the shoot I directed for my Steve Madden campaign. Im incredibly proud of the shoes we've made together, as well as these images that I've been anxiously waiting to share with you all,’ Iggy wrote next to a montage from the vibrant shoot. Angry: The 24-year-old didn't hold back when it came to calling out the popular American shoe brand . In shock: Iggy claims she had no idea about the photos until she saw them on a 'random tumblr' page . Adding: ‘What I had a ""rant"" about on Twitter isn't in regards to these pictures, it was about another, different set of images i wasn't a part of creating that I felt weren't reflective of my vision and direction for the collection.’ ‘I'm an artist and I'm extremely passionate and emotional and crazy sometimes because I care ALOoOoot about this s***! I love Steve and he gets it! Artists clash sometimes, it doesn't mean I dislike the brand.’ With her debut shoe line  dropping imminently the star insisted she is looking forward to collaborating with Steve Madden for three more seasons but was simply fighting for her artistic integrity: ‘I love Steve Madden as an individual and as a company,' Iggy defended. She finished off her long post by saying she truly believed in the collection and that she put her ‘heart and soul’ into making it. ‘I didn't mean for it to turn into some big blog situation (as usual) but I'm not gonna sit back and totally let Steve Madden get dragged under the bus because as a whole they're awesome ppl. I just don't support neoprene Jesus sandals WITH socks. That all,' she concluded. In the approved photos posted to her Instagram account, the Aussie rapper wears a red crop-top and matching shorts as she shows off her endless legs in a pair of royal blue platform shoes from her collection, while a woman holding a goldfish nuzzles up to her. Damage control? The website smxiggy.tumblr.com has since been taken down, however the campaign images which earned Iggy's ire are circulating online . Later Iggy leans up against a railing in a green sports bra, waisted white shorts, a flowing kimono and strappy platforms. However the 'gross' images in question, which have circulated online, show a woman posing provocatively in socks and sandals. Earlier in the day, the outspoken star took to Twitter to let off some steam about  a Tumbrl that was believed to be set up by the company. ‘I’m just now seeing it as its uploaded on some random tumblr page and iam [sic] livid,’ she tweeted. Before adding: ‘I worked really hard on the creative direction of both the shoes and the shoot I WAS involved with and in.’ Putting her foot in it? Hours after her Twitter tirade, the star took to her Instagram account to clear up some things . Mad about shoe: Iggy has been giving fans a sneak peek of her creations over the last few months. In October the star posted this image saying 'These are just my personal favorites' ‘I really feel it’s been tainted with these God awful images that Steve madden took appon [sic] themselves to create and share without my knowledge. Gross gross gross,’ the blonde beauty raged. ‘Ivd [sic] been bamboozled with a tumblr page where everyone wears sock and taken unintentional crotch shots on pool toys. I’m in shock,’ she capped off the rant. Iggy has since deleted the tweets. Daily Mail Australia have reached out to both Iggy and Steve Madden for comment. Her boss T.I., who signed her in 2012, told TMZ that instead of going on Twitter rants, the rapper should be putting her energy into her music. Bad timing: The rapper's debut shoe line with Steve Madden is set to drop next month . 'God awful': Images from the unauthorised shoot show a woman provocatively posing in socks and sandals . Devastated: The Aussie superstar has since deleted her tweets and the Tumbrl page has been blocked .

'I think she should focus on what got her here and that’s her music, her performing, and just continue to present her talents to the world,' he said. 'It’s just like asking Tom Brady if he should be commenting on Deflate-gate. He should worry about the big game on Sunday. Same with Iggy.' Indeed the irreverent singer is well-known for her social media tirades and as usual the Twittersphere lit up with many fans weighing in on the drama. ‘Can see why @IGGYAZALEA is p***** off with the images @SteveMadden put up to promote the new range with her! #tacky,’ one user wrote. Another teaser: Three months ago the rapper shared this snap and gushed: 'Just came in the mail.  Can't wait for spring...' Before the drama: 'I put all my love and passion into these shoes because this project is sentimental to me,' the rapper stated earlier in the month next to this snap of her name on the Steve Madden label . ‘I like Steve Madden, but after this I have lost lots of respect for him. That so was unprofessional,’ another agreed. But others slammed the Mullumbimby native, calling her out for her constant feuds: ‘Now @IggyAzalea is beefing with her endorser @SteveMadden ? It seems like everyone has got it out for her...’ one person suggested. Just three weeks ago Iggy, who is dating NBA pro Nick Young, was singing the shoe company's praises on Instagram after she shared a close-up shot of one of her soon-to-be-released creations. 'It's seriously amazing everytime I see this label. I know to most it's just a shoe but Steve Madden was my S*** when I first came to America.' 'It's really a full circle moment for me to get to share this tiny little label with Steve inside a shoe (haha), not just another celebrity cosign. I put all my love and passion into these shoes because this project is sentimental to me. I hope when you see them u girls LOvE!,' she wrote. A special project tainted?

"A female adventurer has spoken out about sexism after she was turned down for a BBC show because of her gender. Sophie Radcliffe, who has cycled from London to Paris in 24 hours, participated in Iron Man and completed the Three Peak Cycle Challenge, applied for a new show, World’s Toughest Army, but was rejected based on her sex. Sophie, originally from Windsor and now living in Chamonix, applied for the show, which  specifies it is  looking for the 'toughest men in the country to tackle some of the hardest military courses in the world'. However, according to The Telegraph, she received a reply explaining that in keeping with the selection criteria of the special forces, only men could apply. Sophie Radcliffe applied for BBC's new show, World's Toughest Army, but was rejected based on her sex . The letter explained: ‘The idea is we want to keep it as ""real"" as possible and in the special forces we are featuring, women are not currently eligible unfortunately.' On BBC's website, the show's blurb reads: 'Over days of intense physical and mental endurance, our candidates will attempt a uniquely constructed programme based on real techniques used by Special Forces from around the world. 'Bodies and brains will be stretched to the limit as staff sergeants from around the world push our hopefuls to the maximum of their capacity... and beyond.' Sophie, who wants to inspire women to believe in themselves the way she does, told the paper how disappointed she was by the incident. Her rejection letter explained: 'The idea is we want to keep it as ""real"" as possible and in the special forces we are featuring, women are not currently eligible unfortunately' Sophie has cycled from London to Paris in 24 hours, participated in Iron Man and completed the Three Peak Cycle Challenge . 'TV programmes like this, make all our hard work to encourage women seem like a waste of time,' she said. 'Everybody knows men are strong. Everybody knows men can join the army. I feel women are going to watch programmes like this and think ""the BBC says women can’t do this, so what’s the point?"".' Sophie speaks from authority. At the end of last year, she completed the world's first Alpine Coast to Coast in which she cycled 1669km and climbed 141km by foot. She became interested in the show after hearing her army friends' tales and completing British Military Fitness training. She added: 'I would love women to be given a chance to show the world and themselves what they are capable of. The BBC opening up opportunities for women to do that would encourage more of us to believe in ourselves and achieve across all areas of life: jobs, relationships and sport.' Sophie says she would love women to be given a chance to show the world and themselves what they are capable of . A BBC Spokesperson said: 'This series applies the same selection criteria as the United Kingdom's SAS, but that does not necessarily rule out an all-female follow up series.' Sophie's story comes at the same time as recent research  that revealed women are failing to exercise for fear of being judged over their appearance and ability at the gym. It found that across the UK two million fewer women than men take part in sport and regularly exercise. They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles. The study has prompted a new campaign by Sport England to empower women, encouraging more to get active and improve their health. The campaign, This Girl Can, encourages women to join local sports clubs, gyms, and exercise at home.","Sophie Radcliffe, 29, applied for BBC show .

"Animal lovers are in for a real treat this weekend, with not one but two pet-dominated Super Bowl specials to choose from. The wildly popular Puppy Bowl returns for its 11th annual showdown courtesy of the Animal Planet at 3pm EST on Sunday, with Hallmark Channel's Kitten Bowl - back for its second year - kicking off at noon.

Twenty-five pups have been on display each day this week outside a Phoenix cafe where a fake football field has been set up, as spectators gather to cheer them on. A black-and-white shirted human 'referee' kept a score, of sorts, and Team Fluff was soon beating Team Ruff by two goals to zip. 'That's a flag! That's unnecessary roughness, plus it's embarrassing because you're on the same side!' said the referee, blowing his whistle as onlookers laughed.

"More mothers have weighed in on the debate over whether being bored playing with your children makes you a bad parent. Catherine Cooper and Denise Sumpter appeared on today's This Morning to reveal their conflicting views. Mother-of-two Catherine, a freelance journalist based in South West France and London, said it's natural for adults to find the repetitive nature of children's games a complete bore. Scroll down for video . Debating the issue: Denise Sumpter, left, and Catherine Cooper - both mothers of two - on This Morning . She said: 'You're a grown woman, with different interests to a child. Small children love repetitive games. It might be delightful to play peek-a-boo at first but not 300 times later.' Catherine, whose children are now 10 and 12, said she's glad the issue is finally being debated as it's something she never felt she could not admit when hers were small. 'I felt guilty when my children were babies as I assumed everyone else was having a wonderful time,' she said. She added: 'One of my son, Toby's, favourite games when he was little was to stand up in a tube which he wanted me to hold up - I defy anyone to find that interesting.' But mother-of-two Denise Sumpter said she would. Arguing the other side of the case on the ITV daytime show, she said: 'I find the different ways my children interpret things so interesting. The way they can see something different in a pen or a piece of paper or a cardboard box. Duty to play along: Repetitive games is when children learn and develop . 'I'm fascinated by what my child does on an iPad, they play games on there I don't know how to work.' Denise, 44, from North London, who has a six-year-old daughter Belle and son Beau, 19 months, said parents should put aside how they feel about 'boring' games because taking part is helping their child learn and develop. She said: 'It's boring from the perspective of an adult but our children rely on us to nurture them and move them forward.' She added that if mothers are bored playing with their children at home, there are plenty of playgroups and activities on offer in communities to give them a change of scene. Catherine, left, said it's natural for adults to find what children enjoy dull but Denise disagreed saying she find's her children's view of the world fascinating . The mothers debate with presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes who have a son of their own . Presenter Ruth Langsford admitted she did find it difficult to say no to playing with her son, Jack, 12, who she has with husband and co-presenter Eamonn Holmes. 'As he's an only child, I feel I should play with him when he wants me to, I'd find it hard to say I'm bored,' she admitted. But Catherine argued that parents should not feel bad about this, as it's only natural. 'You are a grown up, you don't need to fold a piece of paper a 100 times, children can do it themselves,' she said. The show asked viewers to vote on whether there have there been times they've been bored by their children. They said... Definitely: 37 per cent . Sometimes: 32 per cent . Never: 31 per cent . Catherine's views echo those of Daily Mail columnist and mother-of-four Lorraine Candy, who made her position clear earlier this week. She said: 'Once you’ve kissed all their delicious fatty bits, sniffed the top of their heads and taken comedy pictures of them in adult sunglasses, babies and young toddlers are boring if you spend all day every day with them.' The editor of Elle magazine said she made an effort with her older two children but soon learnt that it 'drained the joy out of being with them and made me short-tempered and impatient. 'Those were foolish times. When the next two arrived, I drew up a shortlist of stuff I was - and wasn't - going to do. I stopped being an ""over-involved mummy pleaser"" and started being me. I like a bit of glitter-sticking, an hour or so of Monopoly and the occasional bake-off. 'I do not like Cluedo, putting on a play, pretending to be a fairytale creature, or watching musicals. I loathe hide-and-seek and bike-riding.'","Two mothers took part in debate on today's This Morning .

"Princess Beatrice has been likened to a benefit scrounger after taking three luxury holidays within weeks of quitting her job. The 26-year-old and her boyfriend Dave Clark, 32, have enjoyed two breaks in the Caribbean and one in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier since she left her £20,000-a-year post at Sony Entertainment Pictures in December. First, the couple took a holiday at her parents’ £13million ski chalet. Then they jetted out on trips to the exclusive island of St Barts – the second one just last week. Scroll down for video .

Despite no longer having a personal income, Beatrice has two grace-and-favour homes – at her family’s Royal Lodge in the grounds of Windsor Castle and a four-bedroom apartment at St James’s Palace, rented for her by her father Prince Andrew for £20,000 a year. The London flat was given a £250,000 taxpayer-funded makeover in 2008, before she moved in as a student at Goldsmiths College, where she studied for a BA in History and History of Ideas. The princess’s jet-set lifestyle was attacked by anti-monarchy campaigners who said she should not receive public subsidies unless she was performing royal duties. In December, she visited the upmarket Swiss ski-resort of Verbier visiting her parent's £13million ski chalet . Beatrice joined Sony in January 2014 but she quit her post as an ‘intermediate coordinating producer’ based in London after details of her salary were revealed when Sony’s computer systems were hacked by a group thought to be linked to North Korea. Even while working, the princess – sixth in line to the throne – managed eight luxury breaks abroad. In 2014, she travelled to Aspen, Colorado, twice to St Barts, and took trips to Spain, New York, Memphis, Abu Dhabi and Verbier. The Abu Dhabi trip in November saw her take leave from work to join her father at the Grand Prix. In June, she managed to hitch a lift with the Royal Navy for a trip to the Isle of Wight. She managed ten holidays the previous year, visiting the South of France three times, St Barts, Verbier, Venice, South Africa, Spain, Antigua and New York. Buckingham Palace has insisted that the princess’s travel was ‘entirely privately funded’ – helped by her parents and boyfriend, who is believed to earn a six-figure salary working for Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism project. The Duke of York’s official website continues to state Beatrice ‘works full time in business’ and emphasises her charity work which includes being a patron of six organisations. The princess and her sister Eugenie have also carried out royal visits on behalf of the Queen. But Graham Smith, head of the pressure group Republic, said: ‘Beatrice is a royal scrounger. She has the HRH title and is living off the taxpayer by using subsidised housing. 'But she’s not putting the hours in so she shouldn’t be getting any money off the state. She either ought to pull her finger out or quit. 'Maybe it’s time she gave up her HRH and abandoned her subsidised apartments in the palace. ‘If she becomes a private individual and doesn’t need to work then that’s entirely up to her.’ A spokesman for the Duchess of York, 55, defended her daughter. He said: ‘Her key focus is her work.’","Royal critics have likened Princess Beatrice  to a 'benefits scrounger'

"Seattle-based coffee giant Starbucks has offered up a flavorsome form of support to its home team, the Seahawks, as they prepare to take on the New England Patriots at Sunday's Super Bowl, by creating a limited edition green and blue Frappuccino in honor of the team's colors. Created by long-time Starbucks employee Thom Arvin, the Seahawks Frappuccino is a unique take on the company's much-loved Vanilla Bean Crème beverage, which blends blueberries and matcha green tea in order to achieve the team's traditional blue and green coloring. 'It’s definitely difficult to make something blue,' Mr Arvin said of his creation. 'I thought blueberry would be the best option to add to a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino and the matcha green tea adds a touch of green to the whipped cream. Go team!

Part of the team: On Friday, Starbucks employees in Washington and Oregon encouraged customers to sample the specially-blended beverage which was created by long-time employee Thom Arvin .

"Convicted: Trevor Cole, 57, pictured, assaulted seven young boys on isolated forest roads near Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute, after taking them there under the pretence of a driving lesson . A paedophile driving instructor promised boys as young as nine off-road lessons before abusing them in woodland near his home. Trevor Cole, 57, assaulted seven young boys on isolated forest roads near Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute, after taking them there under the pretence of a driving lesson. He now faces jail after being convicted of a string of offences at Dunoon Sheriff Court yesterday. Cole's victims gave evidence via video link. They were targeted by Cole, who has since moved to Cambridgeshire, over a period of nine years. One boy said that Cole had invited him to watch porn videos with him while Cole exposed himself to him, the Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard reported. Others said Cole had tried to expose or touch their private parts. Procurator fiscal David Glancy said that Cole's behaviour was 'a catalogue of inappropriate conduct towards these boys for his own sexual gratification', it was reported. The sexual predator found another cover for his crimes by becoming head of the parent council at the school in the small Argyll village where he lived, according to the Daily Record. Speaking to the newspaper following the conviction, the father of one of the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Cole was 'always taking photos of kids'. He said: 'We always thought it must be to do with the school or whatever, and although he came across as a bit weird, no one though he would be capable of this. 'He totally abused his position of trust in the worst possible way and it has had a horrific effect on the whole village. 'When he was on bail before the trial, he was still walking around the village like he didn’t have a care in the world. His victims were left terrified every time they saw him wandering around.' On Cole’s website, he offered driving lessons for £24 an hour as well as a range of learner packages. Children under the age of 17 are allowed to have driving lessons as long as they are not on public roads . Defending, Lorraine Glancy QC insisted that Cole was innocent of all charges and that the boys were telling lies, according to the Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard. On Cole’s website, he offered driving lessons for £24 an hour as well as a range of learner packages. Children under the age of 17 are allowed to have driving lessons as long as they are not on public roads. Cole was found guilty of seven charges, including four of sexual assault on children under 13 and two of the same offence against under-16s. He was also convicted of 'lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour'. One of the offences took place in 2004, while the six others happened between 2011 and 2013. Cole has now been remanded in custody and placed on the sex offender's register. He will be sentenced at Dunoon Sheriff Court on 9 March.

"Wearing veils and dressed in black from head to toe, these women are symbols of Egypt's cultural revolution following the Arab Spring. They are employees of Maria TV, a new satellite news channel that features only women wearing full Islamic attire. Men are banned from the show, even on phone-ins, and all staff, including those behind the camera, also wear veils. This is the news: A presenter looks on in the studio as she talks to the camera on Maria TV . The channel's first broadcast yesterday is one sign of the social change sweeping the country after last year's uprising, which has resulted in a swing towards more hardline Islamic values. Previously, even though Egypt was already a conservative and predominantly Muslim society, women covering their face with a niqab veil complained of being routinely discriminated against for jobs, especially on TV, as well as in education. Female preacher El-Sheikha Safaa Refai, who heads Maria TV, claimed that the channel's existence showed how far the country had come since the uprising that ousted president Hosni Mubarak. On the subject of wearing a niqab to read the news, she added: 'I was told that it won't work because of the body language. Well, the tone of my voice can convey my emotions and reactions.' She said that she hoped that by appearing on TV in full Islamic dress, she could show people 'that there are successful women  wearing niqab'. New horizons: The abolition of the ban may lead to entire broadcasting teams wearing hijab or niqab, like this private satellite one, on state television . It is named after a Coptic . Christian woman who was married to the Prophet Mohammad, . Abeer Shahin graduated from the prestigious American University in Cairo but struggled to find a job because of employers' aversion to her full Islamic face veil, or niqab. But now she has found a job she hopes will change how Egyptian society views niqab wearers once and for all: she is going to work as a TV anchor for a new channel being managed and run exclusively by women who wear the full veil. New format: Maria TV is to be launched this weekend on the first day of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan . 'It's unfair to deal with veiled women as a standard religious housewife. No, she can be a doctor, a professor and an engineer,' said Shahin, wearing a loose black robe and a black head scarf that reveals only her eyes. 'I was told that it (TV anchorwoman wearing niqab) won't work because of the body language. Well, the tone of my voice can convey my emotions and reactions.' In an age of new freedoms in the post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt, niqab-wearing women long oppressed socially and politically are hoping for a new place in society. Pioneering: A director discusses the script with a presenter - Maria TV is named after a Coptic Christian woman who was married to the Prophet Mohammad . Though Egypt is a deeply conservative and predominantly Muslim society, niqab wearers have cited discrimination in the job market, education and elsewhere. There have been instances where some were even prevented from sitting their university exams. Shahin hopes the channel will let people know 'that there are successful women wearing niqab'. Three veiled women sat in a salon earlier this week waiting to submit their job applications, while others were receiving television training ahead of the launch. Islamists have moved to the heart of political life and government since Mubarak was removed from power last year, though the founders of Maria TV said that had nothing to do with their own channel, which had been planned as far back as 2008. 'I am sure it will be attacked ...They will say: 'Why didn't they start a radio station instead?'' said Shahin. 'This amounts to the exclusion of a sector in society that shouldn't be excluded.'","Stationed in a small apartment in the working class district of Abassiya, Maria TV is to be launched this weekend .
The channel will be broadcast for six hours a day on al-Ummah channel, a religious station run by ultra-orthodox Salafi Islamists ."
"Voters cannot understand why the bankers who oversaw the collapse of RBS have not been pursued by prosecutors, Vince Cable said last night. The Business Secretary piled pressure on the authorities to bring Fred Goodwin and other former bosses to account. A legal report prepared for Mr Cable is understood to have concluded there was 'prosecutable evidence' against several of the bank's executives. They steered RBS into the biggest corporate disaster in British history, leaving taxpayers with a £45billion bill for its rescue. Scroll down for video . Financial crash: Voters cannot understand why the bankers who oversaw the collapse of RBS have not been pursued by prosecutors, Vince Cable (pictured, file photo) said last night . Mr Cable asked Scotland's Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to consider prosecutions in January 2012. He is now understood to have asked Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland – Scotland's chief public prosecutor – why there has been no resolution three years on. As well as Mr Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, it is believed that Johnny Cameron, the former head of RBS's investment bank, and a few other directors might also be pursued. Disqualification, which would ban them from sitting on company boards, could be enacted by the courts or through civil action. Mr Cable told the Daily Mail: 'The investigation into the misconduct of directors at RBS has been a long and complicated affair. 'I have spoken to the Lord Advocate, who is responsible for overseeing the investigation in Scotland, and he has updated me on the latest progress of the investigation. 'Whilst I fully appreciate the complexity and volume of the materials being investigated, I also have a lot of sympathy with ordinary members of the public who cannot understand why it has so far taken three years to look into this. Accountable: The Business Secretary piled pressure on the authorities to bring former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin (pictured in 2009) and other former bosses to account . 'I will be keeping abreast of any further developments and will continue to press for these investigations to be concluded as speedily as possible.' Aides stressed that Mr Cable was not seeking to influence the outcome, but believed voters were angry about the lack of accountability. Watchdogs who investigated the collapse of RBS found that its directors made a number of poor decisions in the run-up to Labour's £45billion bailout of the bank. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) concluded bosses had aggressively expanded the institution during Mr Goodwin's eight-year tenure in charge, culminating in the disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007. It found RBS had been brought to its knees by 'multiple poor decisions' and a £50billion 'gamble' on buying the Dutch bank. The FSA report detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and Mr Goodwin before 2005, in particular RBS's reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA one-to-one. 'FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference,' the watchdog said. Economic failings: RBS bosses steered the company into the biggest corporate disaster in British history, Vince Cable said (file photo) The FSA said Mr Goodwin pushed ahead with the reckless ABN Amro deal without 'a sufficient understanding of the risks involved'. It added that many would find the idea that no director would face sanctions 'difficult to accept', adding: 'Surely someone can and should be held responsible.' The report also concluded that Mr Goodwin's 'robust and assertive' management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003. The banker won his knighthood under the last government in 2004, only to see it removed by a Whitehall committee following pressure from Prime Minister David Cameron. A Crown Office spokesman said: 'The Lord Advocate instructed an investigation into allegations involving the Scottish banking sector. 'That investigation is being led by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Serious and Organised Crime Division, with assistance from expert forensic accountants and banking specialists. The investigation is complex and ongoing.' The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim. Banks have so far paid out £17.3billion to those who were wrongly sold PPI alongside loans and credit cards. If the FCA proposals are passed, then victims could be barred from making a claim three years after they first realised the mis-selling had taken place. The City watchdog will announce its plans in the summer, which could involve introducing the deadline, an advertising campaign to alert mis-selling victims who have not yet put in a claim, or other rule changes. Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years. 'To make it work fairly for consumers they'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit, so people know they have been mis-sold. Deadline: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim (file photo) Martin Lewis (pictured), of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years . 'More importantly they'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to, knowing most people won't take it this far ... I can't see either of those things happening, so a time limit should be a strict no-go.' Tens of millions of PPI policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans, mortgages and credit cards. They were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so. Often, victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years. Since the scandal broke, banks have been inundated with PPI complaints. Although many of these come from actual wronged customers, others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls. Alongside millions of legitimate claims, banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms. The independent Financial Ombudsman Service says it is receiving around 4,000 PPI complaints a week, down from a peak of 12,000. It finds in the customer's favour in roughly two-thirds of cases. Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: 'I fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly. The banks had their hands in customers' pockets for years. Victims shouldn't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around.'","Voters wondering why RBS bankers have not been pursued, Cable has said .

"A man who couldn't find a black doll in the shops as a gift for his niece decided to take matters into his own hands. In 2007, Taofick Okoya, 43, created his own doll that Nigerian girls could identify with by recreating their skin colour and style - and it is now so successful that it is outselling Barbie. The doll, which is called Queens of Africa, comes with traditional outfits and accessories and costs around £4.50. Scroll down for video . A Nigerian businessman decided to create  own doll that Nigerian girls could identify with called Queens of Africa, by recreating their skin colour and style - and now it's outselling Barbie in his native country . The dolls' look is modelled on three of the country's biggest tribes and aims to promote strong feminine ideals, like love, peace and endurance. The doll is now so popular that, according to Reuters, it is selling up to 9,000 units a month -  a staggering 15 per cent of the country's toy market. But the Queens of Africa aren't just selling in their home country. Thanks to the doll's online presence, customers are coming from as far as America, Brazil and Europe.

The doll is now so popular that, it is selling up to 9,000 units a month - 15 per cent of the country's toy market . Speaking to ELLE about his dolls out-selling Barbie in his native Nigeria, Okoya said: 'My mission is to make the Queens of Africa a symbol of hope, trust, and confidence by promoting African history, culture, and fashion.' One person that Okoya really hopes the dolls will have a positive impact on is his daughter, who, he explains, once wished she was white. Okoya said: 'I don't believe Mattel sees the Nigerian market as a priority, yet their product has great influence on the psyche of the children here and affirms certain values contrary to our society' He explained that even though they live in Nigeria, there was a lot of Western influence. He said: '[This] might have been responsible for her wishing she was white. It made me aware that I needed to make her proud and happy being a black African girl, and not limit it to her alone as this was a common trend among the younger generation. The Queens of Africa became a platform to achieve this.' Unfortunately, Okoya has been told that he won't be able to sell the dolls on the shelves of mainline stories in America and will have to limit his business to specialist stores. But he is determined to see the decision overturned, he said: 'I am looking to prove them wrong.'","In 2007, Taofick Okoya, created a doll that Nigerian girls could identify with .

"A report by the IRR reveals policemen in South Africa are arresting young women in order to rape them. IRR CEO Frans Cronje, pictured, called the findings 'disturbing' A shocking report has revealed how large numbers of policemen in South Africa are 'regularly' arresting young women in order to rape them. The 'Broken Blue Line' conducted by the Johannesburg-based Institute of Race Relations, investigated the extent in which police officers in the country plan and execute serious and violent crimes such as murder, rape, and armed robbery. And it drew a disturbing conclusion: that police involvement in serious and violent crimes, including rape and murder, were a 'pattern of behaviour' and not isolated incidents. The report, funded by Afriforum, analysed 100 randomly chosen media reports from April 2011 to January 2015 on alleged police involvement in serious crimes. Of those, 32 were murders and attempted murders, 22 were armed robberies, and 26 were rapes, as well as other serious offences. The results were compared against two sources of information on disciplinary action against police officers implicated in crimes. The project has been undertaken by the IRR since 2011 to track police involvement in criminality. In 2015, it found that officers exploit their official status and equipment to perpetrate crimes and rely on that status to escape arrest and prosecution. Significant numbers of officers, despite being convicted of serious crimes, remain employed with the police . The most worrying aspect was that 'it is often with good reason that the public fear the police, especially with regard to sexual violence and rape perpetrated by officers against vulnerable women.' In a number of incidents, the police officer used his authority to force the victims to submit to his demands. In one incident, a woman was raped several times while in custody and in another, a woman was raped in court. Nine out of the 26 listed rape cases occurred in either police station cells or official police vehicles. The report says in a typical case, a police officer would stop a young woman in a public place, before taking her away to be raped in the back of a police vehicle and then setting her free. It found a 'significant evidence of a trend' where police officers detain women in order to rape them. A 2011 version of the report had similar results, including a serious problem with sexual violence by police officers in a country which has one of the highest recorded rates of rape in the world. And while South African Police Service management is attempting to deal with the problem, it is with limited success. It warned that 'violent crime levels in South Africa won’t turn around while the ""wolf guards the sheep"".' The report said a typical case involved an officer stopping a young woman in a public place, before taking her away to be raped in the back of a police vehicle. File photo . Pretoria News reported in July 2013, that almost 1 500 serving police officers had criminal records as shown on the table below – this is more than one in every 100 sworn officers . A report in Pretoria News in July 2013 said that almost 1,500 serving police officers had criminal records - which is more than one in every 100 officers in the country. A two-year audit into the police service revealed there were even South African Police Service members behind bars who were paid monthly salaries. The newspaper reported that the shadow minister of police, Diane Koehler Barnard of the Democratic Alliance, had said that the police were, in effect, admitting that their service was 'populated with murderers, rapists, fraudsters and other offenders'. IRR CEO Frans Cronje said that the project is one of the most disturbing ever undertaken by his organisation. He said: 'You would expect the police to safeguard society by infiltrating criminal elements. 'In our country there is much evidence that criminal elements have infiltrated the police.' The number of complaints made to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate by the category of complaint and the number the IPID says have been successfully handled by some form of disciplinary action .","Report found police involvement serious crimes is a 'pattern of behaviour'

"A 20-year-old waitress from Wichita, Kansas, unexpectedly found herself at the center of a debate on race relations after she was verbally attacked for dating a black man. Ashlyn Sullivan, who is white, has responded to racist comments about her and her boyfriend by penning a powerful blog entry, which has since gone viral. In her personal essay titled, 'I am not dating a racial slur,' Ashlyn writes that she and her boyfriend, Ra'Montae Green, have been together for two years and have never directly experienced racism as an interracial couple. Scroll down for video . Color-blind: Ashlyn Sullivan, 20, who is white, has responded to racist comments about her and her boyfriend, Ra'Montae Green (right), by penning a powerful blog post last month, which has since gone viral . Taking a stand: Ashlyn penned the post after a group of drunken men at a bar where she works referred to her boyfriend of two years as a 'n*****' All that changed on December 22 as Sullivan was working a shift as a server at a Buffalo Wild Wings bar and grill. She writes that a table of six very drunk men began catcalling her and making offensive remarks about her physical appearance. To put an end to the patrons' rude behavior, Sullivan told the men she had a boyfriend, but they suggested she was lying. As a proof, Sullivan pulled up a photo of her boyfriend, Ra'Montae, on her phone and showed it to one of the customers. 'Awh girl, why are you dating a n*gger? They ain’t gone treat you right,' Sullivan quoted the inebriated man as saying. Ashlyn writes that instead of walking away, she called the bar patron 'racist' and threatened to have him tossed out. 'Let me just get this straight though. I am not dating a N*gger,' the 20-year-old aspiring social worker stated in her blog post before launching into a poetic tirade praising her boyfriend's numerous good qualities. ‘I am dating a man with the smoothest brown skin, and curly hair. I am dating a respectable, hardworking man that would do anything to make me smile at the end of the day. Video courtesy KAKE . Courting controversy: Before long, death threats and vile comments about Ashlyn and Ra'Montea's interracial relationship started pouring in. For Green, it was his only second ever encounter with racism in 20 years . ‘I am dating a man who helps me buy groceries, wash laundry, and even clean my apartment even though he has other things to do, works 40 hours a week, and it’s not his job. I am dating a man that holds doors open for me and everyone else behind him EVERY TIME. ‘I am dating a man who has never been arrested, and doesn’t walk around acting like a fool. I am dating a humble man, someone who puts others before himself. I am dating a man who loves motorcycles, and music. I am dating a man with a future. ‘I am dating a man with a great sense of humor. I am dating a man who cuddles his puppy like a newborn baby. I am dating a man that will eat hot cheetos with me while binge watching netflix. I am dating a man who tells me I look pretty in glasses and pajamas that I haven’t taken off for two days in a row. ‘I am dating a man who loves to cook, and is sooooo good at it. I am dating a man that spoils me. I am dating a man who loves God. I am dating a man who loves me unconditionally.’ She concluded her post by urging people to 'wake up' and stop judging others based on skin color. ‘Why do people care? Why make it a big deal? Why even bring race into the picture?’ she wondered. ‘We are all human, no matter what you hair, skin, or eye color is.. we all bleed red. I cannot stand the ignorance of some people in this world.’ Her impassioned post in defense of her boyfriend went viral almost instantly, drawing 300,000 views the first day alone. Before long, death threats and vile comments about Ashlyn and Ra'Montea's romance began pouring in. Some commenters peppered her with Bible verses telling her how God doesn't want humans laying with animals. Another attacker accused the 20-year-old college student of polluting the white gene pool by dating a black man. A third critic threatened her with death, while another urged her to kill herself. There were also comments about how ‘disgusting’ she and Ra’Montae looked together in photos, how one day she will end up as a single mother of five living on welfare, and how her parents did not raise her right. Young and in love: In her post, Ashlyn (pictured here before her tonsil surgery) described her boyfriend as a man who is hardworking, responsible, who's never been arrested and who loves her unconditionally . Ra'Montea said Ashlyn broke down in tears reading the comments section of her blog. ‘He told me it should not matter what is said by people who are just sitting on a computer screen,’ Sullivan told Kansas.com. For Green, it was his only second ever encounter with racism in 20 years. Around the time of the incident at the Buffalo Wild Wings bar, Green said an 'old white guy' pulled up alongside him at a stop sign, showed him the middle finger and called him the N-word. ‘I know that for some people in some places in Wichita, racism can be bad,’ he said. ‘Other than that thing a month ago, the only time I’ve ever seen racism is in the movies.’ Ashlyn and Ra'Montea first met in high school as kids. After being friends for a while, they briefly tried dating but then drifted apart. Two years ago, the two reconnected while working together at a McDonald’s in Goddard and struck up a romance. Ra’Montae works at Protection One as a monitoring representative. Ashlyn is a college sophomore at Wichita State University working on a degree in social work. Her goal is to become an advocate for children and animals.","Ashlyn Sullivan, 20, penned a powerful blog post last month after a pack of drunken bar patrons called her black boyfriend the N-word .

After two years of intensive medical treatment, Ms Crisan can still only manage to use about 70 percent of her facial muscles.

"She's currently ringing in her 60th birthday with two future kings, in itself a demonstration of how far Carole Middleton has come. Raised in a Southall council flat, Mrs Middleton, a former air hostess, is now the chatelaine of a sprawling Berkshire pile and is grandmother to the third-in-line to the throne. So how did the still glamorous 60-year-old do it? According to those who know her, the answer is a considerable amount of hard work. Scroll down for video . As Carole Middleton celebrates turning 60, FEMAIL charts her leap from council flat dweller to the glamorous grandmother of the future King . Carole is grandmother to Prince George, the third in line to the throne . The most obvious manifestation of her steely work ethic is Party Pieces, a multi-million pound company set up by Mrs Middleton and her husband Michael. That has helped her claw her way up from her lowly start as the daughter of sales assistant Dorothy Harrison and painter Ronald Goldsmith, who grew up in a small house and attended a local state school. From there, she went on to train as an air hostess, attending British Airways' Cranebank training centre in West London in 1976. But according to OK! magazine's former royal correspondent Marcia Moody, the author of Kate: A Biography, the training in those days was more like 'an antiquated finishing school'. Carole Middleton holding daughter Catherine (L), who went on to become the Duchess of Cambridge . The family, pictured at Gatwick, are holidaying in the tropical luxury  to celebrate Carole's 60th birthday at a £10,000-a-week villa . 'They were taught how to be good listeners, how to maintain good eye contact and always have a smile on their face,' she writes. 'Many people commented on how composed the Middletons were at the royal wedding and it struck me that Carole's training provided exactly the right sort of skillset you might need to be a member of the Royal Family.' It was here that Carole met her husband of 34 years, Michael Middleton who was training to become a pilot. In 1980, just a year before the wedding of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer, she and Mr Middleton married at a small church in Dorney, Buckinghamshire. Carole, pictured second from right, has adapted well to Royal life, despite William's pals famously mocking Kate with their 'doors to manual' air hostess impressions . Carole, who was born the eldest daughter of sales assistant Dorothy Harrison and painter Ronald Goldsmith, and grew up in a small house, has fit into royal life with ease . In 1981, Mrs Middleton became pregnant for the first time. Her daughter, named Catherine by her proud parents, would go on to become a royal bride. Not, however, that her parents knew it at the time. Instead, the Middletons, with Carole unable to work because of her pregnancy, were searching for a solution to a cash flow crisis. The eureka moment came when Mrs Middleton began making up children’s party bags which she sold to friends and neighbours for pin-money. Michael Middleton's cousin Matita Glassborow, 63, told the Mail On Sunday: 'Carole was very pregnant with Catherine and couldn’t possibly continue working as an air hostess in her condition. 'So while she was at home waiting for the baby she started making goody bags for children’s parties among her friends. ‘And the business just grew so much that Michael eventually gave up his own admin job with the airline to work with Carole.’ Carole Middleton stands on the balcony with The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall with her granddaughter Eliza Lopez  following the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Mrs Middleton went on to have her second child Pippa in September 1983 and James in April 1987, but continued to run Party Pieces at the same time. By 1995, the company was so successful that it relocated into farm buildings at Ashampstead Common and started employing several members of staff. Despite their riches, the Middletons lived comfortably, if not lavishly, with the children's private education funded with the help of Mr Middleton's family trust. One mother, whose child was in the same house as Kate at Marlborough College, famously said: 'There was always something slightly galling about having your child at school with the Middletons. 'Every pristine item of their clothing would have a beautifully sewn-in name-tape, for instance. It was unthinkable that they would resort to marker pen on labels. Carole and Michael Middleton leaving St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in July 2013, after visiting their daughter Kate and her newborn baby boy, Prince George of Cambridge . 'It made other families feel rather hopeless.' Nevertheless, all three Middleton children proved diligent students and all went on to university, including the now Duchess of Cambridge who met her husband while at St. Andrew's University. Prince William was welcomed into the Middleton clan, with Mrs Middleton regularly inviting her daughter's royal beau for Sunday lunch. Now, like her daughter, part of royal circles, Mrs Middleton has adapted well to life as a royal in-law, despite early hiccups such as the famous incident in which William's friends mocked her with 'doors to manual' air hostess jibes. But while William's friends proved snobbish, his family was not with the Queen in particular embracing Mrs Middleton. Indeed, the warm affection and genuine enthusiasm that the monarch has shown towards the Middletons has taken even seasoned courtiers by surprise. Kate, Pippa and Carol wave to the crowds outside the Goring Hotel ahead of the Royal Wedding in 2011 . Despite Carole's more humble beginnings, she has gone on to conquer the fashion world for women of a certain age, too. Pictured here with Pippa at wedding in 2012 . She  let it be known she thought the family  conducted themselves ‘impeccably’ since news of the royal engagement was announced and demonstrated her approval by inviting them to a number of ‘inner sanctum’ events. These include a private ‘getting-to-know-you’ lunch at Windsor Castle the week before April 2011's Royal Wedding, as well as sending them invitations to her Royal Ascot Week party. ‘The Queen likes them enormously,’ one courtier told the Mail on Sunday. ‘Her decision to invite them to Royal Ascot was a very personal gesture that was entirely her own idea. 'It shows the level at which she has welcomed them into their extended family.’ Pippa and Carole at Queen's club watching Andy Murray in 2013; the family are avid tennis fans . Despite the responsibilities that come with her role as the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate remains incredibly close to her parents. The Middletons, who live in a £4.8million Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire, were the first to arrive at the scene when Prince George was born. They were also the first visitors to Anmer Hall, with the Duchess of Cambridge hosting Christmas at her Norfolk home last year. Mrs Middleton has also won plaudits for her style and was even described as 'sexy' by sharp-tongued Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. So popular has her look become, supermarket Asda produced a cut-price range inspired by the Middleton matriarch after customers repeatedly asked for similar clothes. She certainly looked younger than her years as she set off for Mustique earlier this week, opting for a pair of skinny jeans, a black top and blazer and flat boots - none of which would have looked out of place on one of her daughters. Carole and Kate often wear similar outfits and opt for the same colour palette . Carole Middleton (L), Pippa Middleton (2nd L), James Middleton (2nd R) and Michael Middleton leave the Goring Hotel in London in 2011 following the Royal Wedding . The family, including Pippa and James Middleton, are holidaying in the tropical luxury of Mustique and staying in a £10,000-a-week villa. It is understood that the family – accompanied by a team of Scotland Yard bodyguards – have taken over Villa Rocina. Designed and built in 1971 in the style of a Caribbean plantation, it boasts its own 30ft pool as well as stunning views. Guests have only to walk a few feet from their garden to snorkel in the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea in front of the house. Each bedroom has its own en-suite bath and dressing room, and the property also has an air-conditioned gym for guests who manage to tear themselves away from the sun and sand. Four members of staff – a chef, a butler, a housekeeper and a gardener – will be on hand throughout the family’s stay to tend to their every whim. Luxury holidays, royal in-laws and a multi-million pound business: It is all a very long way from the humble Southall council flat that Mrs Middleton once called home.

"There are roughly 6,500 spoken languages in the world, but new research has revealed that the climate may have played a role how each one developed. Scientists have found that humidity in different areas may have influenced the way languages evolved there. They found that languages with complex tones - those that use one or more contrasting tones to give meaning to words like Cantonese - tend to occur in humid regions of the world. This map shows the regions where languages with complex tones have developed (red dots), clustered in tropical humid areas, while those languages that do not use complex tones are marked with blue dots . Languages with simple tones, like many European languages including English, are found in drier regions - either in the colder north or in arid deserts. A leading linguist claims that within a century 90 per cent of languages around the world will die out. Ever increasing globalisation, international travel and access to the the internet is expected to lead to just 600 of the current 6,500 languages surviving. Already more than 2,000 of the languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers, with many on the verge of dying out altogether. Dr John McWhorter, a linguist at Columbia University, said those languages that do survive will be less complicated than they are today - especially in the way they are spoken. Lesser known cultures and their unique languages will struggle to survive, leaving widely spoken languages such as English and Chinese to swallow them up and in turn wipe them out. The researchers say that this is because inhaling dry air can dehydrate the vocal cords and make them less elastic, making it harder to produce complex tones in words. Instead languages that evolved in dry climates tend to have imprecise pitch and varying intensity. Most European languages are thought to originate from a common ancestral tongue called Proto-Indo-European that was spoken 6,000 years ago by people living on the relatively dry Pontic Steppe north of the Black Sea. This dry climate may have led to the evolution of the modern non-tonal languages that exist here today, according to Dr Caleb Everett, a linguist at the University of Miami who led the research. He said: 'It does not imply that languages are completely determined by climate, but that climate can, over the long haul, be one of the factors that helps shape languages. 'More broadly, this suggests another non-conscious way in which humans have adapted to their very different and harsh environments.' Dr Everett and his colleagues, whose research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined more than 3,700 languages. They found 629 languages with complex tones, with most in tropical regions throughout Africa and Southeast Asia, but also some in humid regions of North America, Amazonia and New Guinea. Vietnamese, being written by the Hmong schoolgirl in the image above, uses complex tones when spoken . The humid climate in Burma, shown above, is thought to make the human vocal cords more adaptable . Languages like Vietnamese, Burmese, all of the Chinese languages and most languages from Sub-Saharan Africa like Nigerian and Congolese are considered tonal. Languages like Mongolian, Egyptian and Amdo Tibetan all developed in drier and more arid climates. To produce speech the human vocal cords, which are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs, need to flex in length and tension to tune the pitch and tone. It is also thought to be why learning a new language can be difficult at first and require the muscles that control the vocal cords to be trained to make new sounds. If the new research is correct it would also suggest that people who live in drier climates may find it harder to make the sounds needed to pronounce words in tonal languages. Dr Everett added: 'Also, there may be some health benefits to certain sound patterns in certain climates, but more research is needed to establish that in a satisfactory way.' The spoken languages in China all use complex tones and are thought to have developed due to the humid climate in much of the country, particularly in the south, where the moist air helped vocal cords to be flexible .","Linguists from the University of Miami examined 3,700 different languages .

She said: 'If you have a tight, strong, and healthy muscle design, and you are good at cardio, sweating, and detoxifying, then your skin will age much better.' She adds that there's 'no pill, cleanse, or quick fix' that is going to 'outperform exercise' when it comes to rolling back the years. So if you want a healthy body and want to stay looking young, you're going to have to work for it. By using her method of workouts targeting specific muscle groups, she claims you won't have to worry about 'chicken wings' (aka bingo wings, the dreaded under arm flab). She blames poor 'muscular design' for the phenomenon and suggests developing a 'tight and strong' upper arm through plenty of exercise. She said this will help the skin age better and reduce the loss of collagen and proteins that cause it to sag. These are the principles she shares in her famous '30 Day Method' which has helped stars like Gwyneth, Madonna and Kim Kardashian stay in shape. Tracy urges women not to wait until their forties or fifties to take action on having a healthy body as the muscles will begin to age in the thirties. Or as she puts it: 'We all need to wear gym t-shirts that say ""later-life knowledge seeker"" for our muscles, because for them to stay ""young,"" just like the rest of our system, they need to be fed and challenged regularly.'","Tracy Anderson has been a friend and trainer to Gwyneth Paltrow for years .

"Lee Harvey Oswald's casket that was auctioned off for more than $87,000, actually belongs to Oswald's brother, not the funeral home that sold it, a Texas judge said. Oswald's brother, Robert, 80, had sued Baumgardner Funeral Home in Fort Worth, Texas, after it sold the pine coffin for $87,468 in 2010. A Tarrant County judge on Friday ordered the funeral home to pay the same amount of money in damages to Robert Oswald, saying its conduct was 'malicious and wanton.' Scroll down for video . Lee Harvey Oswald's original pine burial coffin is pictured - it was sold at auction for over $87,000 . Lee Harvey Oswald (right), was accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy (left) Lee Harvey Oswald, accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy, was fatally shot during a jail transfer two days after Kennedy's death. Oswald was buried at the Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Texas in 1963, but his body was exhumed 18 years later and examined after mounting speculation about CIA involvement. After being exhumed in 1981, the casket was too damaged for reburial. The lawsuit says Oswald's family thought the casket had been thrown away but was actually kept in storage. Robert Oswald said he paid a total of $679 to purchase the casket, vault, suit and flowers for the funeral. The body of Lee Harvey Oswald lies in a casket at Parkland Morgue in Dallas, Texas, in 1963 . Funeral director Allen Baumgardener failed to sell the coffin on numerous occasions but finally found a buyer in 2010. After Oswald's death, doubts that he was the true assassin quickly surfaced and some historians came to believe that he was in fact a covert U.S. intelligence agent. The former Marine is said to have defected to the Soviet Union in 1960 promising to reveal valuable military secrets. But he was allowed back into the country less than two years later with no consequences for his betrayal. The government theory that Oswald acted alone was not enough to convince many Americans following the President's assassination, including the leader's own brother. Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General at the time, immediately suspected that the CIA had something to do with the President's death in Dallas.

"A former UCLA water polo player accused of attacking three women, including a fellow student, has pleaded no contest to single counts of assault and making criminal threats. City News Service says Hakop Kaplanyan of Glendale was immediately sentenced Thursday to 180 days in jail and five years of probation. He was also ordered to undergo one year of counseling. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed all of the other counts against him, including charges of forcible rape and false imprisonment. Hakop Kaplanyan pleaded no contest to single counts of assault and making criminal threats after prosecutors in the case against the 20-year-old former UCLA polo player admitted they did not have enough evidence to pursue rape charges . As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed all of the other counts against him, including charges of forcible rape and false imprisonment . Prosecutors admitted and the judge agreed there was not enough evidence to try the case--no DNA, no corroborating testimony, no witnesses and no physical evidence, reports KABC. Prosecutors contend that Kaplanyan attacked three women between 2012 and 2013, when he was arrested after a student filed a report with campus police alleging he'd raped her in a campus residence hall. According to Kaplanyan's attorney George Mgdesyan, the damage has been done. The star water polo was arrested after a woman reported Kaplanyan to campus police that he had raped her in his dorm room in April 2013 . Kaplanyan had been a rising star polo player as a freshman, but as his lawyer said Thursday 'his dreams are quashed' 'This man’s lost a lot,' Mgdesyan told KTLA. 'This is a kid who went to college, it’s a dream to go to UCLA, be a water polo player, and before you know it, his dreams are quashed and he’s kicked out of school and can’t play water polo.' Kaplanyan is now a student at L.A. Valley College, where he's on the water polo team. Mgdesyan called the allegations 'not true' and 'suspect, at best.'

"This is the £500,000 in cash that a trucker was attempting to smuggle out of the country in his spare tyres, . Thomas Kent, 45, was jailed after he was stopped by police as he attempted to drive his vehicle transporter onto a ferry in Portsmouth, Hampshire. The carrier was loaded with Transit vans and Kent, who worked for Manchester-based haulage firm Motor Movers, claimed they were for a client in the Mondragón area of northern Spain. This is the £500,000 in cash that Thomas Kent was attempting to smuggle out of the country when he was stopped by Border Force officers . Thomas Kent, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of attempting to remove criminal property from the UK . Border Force officers became suspicious when they discovered spare tyres in the back of one of the vans that did not fit any of the vehicles. Further investigation led to them finding £500,000 stuffed inside three of the mystery wheels. Kent of Brighton, East Sussex, denied attempting to remove criminal property from the UK, but was convicted after a trial. He was sentenced to five years in prison by a judge at Portsmouth Crown Court. The jury heard the money was likely to have been used to finance drug deals in Spain. The amount seized was roughly the same as the cost of purchasing 20 kilos of cocaine at wholesale price. Robert Holness, from the National Crime Agency's Border Policing Command, said: 'This was a significant amount of money and the way it was being transported, concealed within tyres, immediately made us suspicious. 'By seizing this money we have derailed a deal which has kept dangerous drugs off the streets and has prevented criminals making a profit to reinvest in further crimes.' In a previous trial the boss of Motor Movers, John Tague, 51, from Lancashire, was acquitted of the same charge. Officers found the money, believed to be destined for Spain, stashed inside the arch of three spare tyres .","Thomas Kent was stopped driving his vehicle transporter onto ferry .

"Boxing legend Floyd 'Money' Mayweather Jnr is used to winning, in fact, he's never been beaten inside the ring. However, his biggest fight is happening outside of the hempen square, with calls for him to be banned from entering Australia next week because of his abusive past. An on-line petition has been launched via change.org to stop him from visiting the country because it states 'he abused his ex-partner in front of his children and went to jail after abusing five different women'. Mayweather, 37, was jailed in 2012 for an attack (two years earlier) on his ex-girlfriend and needs the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to rubber stamp his visa application before heading down under next week, where he's expected to be the star turn at two dinners in Melbourne and Sydney. His local promoter, Max Markson, remains confident the boxing millionaire will be allowed to fly in with his entourage of 30 people. Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr. is led away in handcuffs at the Clark County Regional Justice Centre in Las Vegas to serve two months of a three-month jail term in June, 2012. Domestic violence prevention advocates say his criminal record should preclude him from visiting Australia . He's the money man. Floyd Mayweather Jnr. is a multi-millionaire whose triumphs are not restricted to boxing bouts with several well documented betting plunges on sporting events . Floyd Mayweather Jnr. vs Marcos Maidana during their WBC/WBA welterweight title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on September 13, 2014 in Las Vegas. He followed his father of the same name into the boxing game and has a record of 47 wins and no losses . 'He is no danger or threat to Australian society and is bringing his 14-year-old daughter and her mother along,' Mr Markson said. 'He hasn't offended for almost 4 or 5 years and has become a bigger star in terms of boxing, in fact he's the highest paid sports star in the world.' As precedents go, two years ago former heavyweight champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson, also faced a backlash over his planned tour but was granted a visa in the end. Mayweather served two of the three-month prison sentence he was handed for a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on former lover Josie Harris, as two of their three children watched. Floyd Mayweather Jnr. walks into court escorted by attorney Karen Winckler, and rap artist 50 Cent, ahead of his jail term in June, 2012. The undefeated five-division champion surrendered before the judge who had sentenced him the previous year for an attack on his ex-girlfriend, while two of their children watched . Wherever Floyd 'Money' Mayweather Jnr. travels, he does it in style. But he is still awaiting a visa to allow entry to Australia for a promotional tour . Mayweather is considered one of the most bankable sporting stars in the world, his bouts regularly ranking in multi-million dollar purses . The petition against his entry states: 'His assaults are sickening to read about. He's alleged to have slammed a car door on a woman, then repeatedly punched her in the backseat. And he still seems completely without regret.' 'Allowing a chronic perpetrator of violence like Floyd Mayweather to visit Australia sends a terrifying message – that vicious, repeat abuse isn't serious.' Immigration Minister Dutton's office has been contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia but there is still no word as to whether the visa will be approved. But the promoter of some of his planned Australian events, Max Markson, says the boxer should be granted a visa because 'he passes the character test'. 'There are reasons for it (visa being considered) because of his criminal record but he has done his time for that,' he said. 'The reason I believe the minister will approve (the visa) is the economic, social and tourism. 'There is no pressure on him to sign off on the visa, I wrote to him yesterday a few other people have written to him. 'It (the planned trip) will generate $1.5 million dollars and socially it will raise money for charity by helping the Reverend Bill Crews, founder of the Exodus foundation.' Promoter of Mayweather's planned dinners in Australia, Max Markson (l) believes the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton (r) will grant the boxer a visa to enter Australia because 'he passes the character test' Author Tasha Robinson-White, whose memoir 'Right Hand to the Champ', chronicled the twelve years she spent working for the boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr. Mayweather, 37, is expected to hold a news conference in Australia, where his local promoter suggests he will announce his decision to take the Super Fight offer with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 . Mr Markson also believes the publicity Mayweather will generate while in Australia, will be unparalleled in sporting terms. 'He is scheduled to hold a news conference, I think as to whether he will fight Manny Pacquiao - the last time he spoke publicly about the possible fight was in mid-December.' The promoter insists the boxer will announce his acceptance of terms for the Super Fight while in Australia. 'Bob Arum has May 2nd booked, Manny is ready, all the terms are agreed - now only Floyd needs to say yes. 'This is the reason why Floyd wants to come here - look, he could have done it at Super Bowl time but he is bringing 31 people, paying a lot trainers to come along. Since his release from jail Mayweather has continued to extend his unbeaten run, which now stands at 47 wins . Max Markson says Mayweather does not present a threat to Australian society and will be playing the tourist, including walking the Sydney Harbour Bridge . 'From a business perspective and sport too, it's all that global branding, you open restaurants all over the world, you had Pacquiao in London and Mayweather announcing he's planning to go to Australia. 'It's the biggest fight in boxing history and Floyd will get 60 per cent of it and some people say it will be $1 billion.' The promoter insists Mayweather, despite his 'Money' man moniker, will not make much out of the planned trip. 'It is costing him more than he's getting to come here, and from a tourism point of view it will go global. 'He will climb the Harbour Bridge, he has almost 20 million followers and will be posting all that vision around the world, I think it will be on a scale of the Oprah and Ellen visits.' There are reports Mayweather will officially accept the challenge to fight Manny Pacquiao while in Australia at a media conference set down for the Crown Casino in Melbourne . Talking tough. Floyd Mayweather is watched closely by Manny Pacquiao when they bumped into each other at a Miami Heat basketball game . I'm free on May 2nd, what about you? This could have been the topic of conversation between boxing legends Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather when they met at a recent basketball match in the US. It's rumoured the latter will use an Australian media conference to announce his intention to take up the Super Fight offer . Fiona McCormack, the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria, has also backed a ban on the boxer from entering the country. 'At a time when public concern around the epidemic of violence against women in Australia has never been higher - a decision to allow someone into the country with such a history of violence against women, and who publicly defends that behaviour, would send a powerful message that we can ignore or trivialise violence against women,' she said. 'Men who choose to use violence against women do so because they believe that they have an entitlement, or right, to behave that way. 'When we glorify their achievements, it reinforces the stance that it is okay to abuse and control women"". Victoria's premier, who has launched a Royal Commission into domestic violence, was also less than welcoming when asked about the boxer's impending visit. 'I certainly won't be attending,' Premier Daniel Andrews said. 'I think my views, and the view of my government, on family violence are well understood.' But Mr Andrews agreed Mayweather's visa was a matter for the Commonwealth. Mayweather made his pro debut in 1996 and has won world titles in five different divisions in the years since . The sporting world is holding its breath for the reported Super Fight between two of the biggest ever names in boxing - Pacquiao and Mayweather. But will it be officially announced at the Crown Casino in Melbourne? 'Mr Mayweather’s celebrity will give our charity and the work we do great exposure over the coming months which will assist us greatly to help even more people in Australia,' said the Reverend Bill Crews . Mayweather, whose earnings last year reportedly topped $US100 million, is currently the world's best pound-for-pound boxer, holding both the welterweight and super welterweight world titles. He has accumulated a record of 47-0 with 26 KOs since making his professional debut in 1996. But apart from the jail term, he has reportedly been involved in seven assaults on five women that resulted in arrest or a citation from police. Mr Markson thought is adamant he's coming down under for the right reasons and should be welcomed. 'I've hosted Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and many many big names - they cost me a lot of money, a lot more than Floyd will cost me,' he added. And he also appears to have Reverend Bill Crews in his corner. 'Mr Mayweather’s celebrity will give our charity and the work we do great exposure over the coming months which will assist us greatly to help even more people in Australia,' he said. 'The charitable funds raised during Mr Mayweather’s time in Australia will be used in the following manner: providing food and health and well-being programs for homeless, disabled, disadvantaged and needy people and children including Aboriginal. 'Our charity relies on the generous support of the general public and people like Mr Mayweather to provide a safety net to those that need it most.'","Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr is scheduled to spend almost a week down under on business and to play tourist .

"Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill who was jailed for 12 years for 'terrifying' sexual abuse against two teenage girls . A former police surgeon has been jailed for 12 years after he robbed two teenage girls of their childhood by subjecting them to 'terrifying' sexual abuse. Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, 61, from Tasburgh in Norfolk admitted raping and sexually assaulting the two children after appearing at Norwich Crown Court. The court heard how his crimes represented a 'fall from grace' for a respected member of the community who worked for Norfolk Police in the 1980s and as a GP for 37 years. However, his offending is not linked to his role as a doctor. Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said the two victims were under the age of 14 at the time of the attacks and came to light after one of them was prompted to contact police as a result of media coverage of high profile sexual abuse cases. One of the vicitms, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said in a statement read to the court that she could no longer trust others and she regarded the abuse as her 'terrible secret'. She added: 'It was the most terrifying experience of my life. 'There is not one evening that goes by when I don't relive what he did to me before going to sleep at night.' Meanwhile the other victim said she felt like she had been terrorised and had slept with a knife under her pillow in order to feel safe. She added: 'When I think about my childhood, I feel as though it was taken away from me.' O'Neill pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and once count of gross indecency against one victim, and two counts of gross indecency against a second victim. Sentencing him to 12 years in prison, Judge Anthony Bate said: 'These offences reflect sustained sexual abuse. 'The enduring impact of that violation, is movingly and poignantly described in the victim's statement. Norwich Crown Court, pictured, heard how O'Neill's crimes represented a 'fall from grace' for the respected member of the community who worked for Norfolk Police in the 1980s and as a GP for 37 years . 'It was a breach of trust of the utmost gravity. You are now a broken man - your disgrace is complete.' Michael Clare, mitigating, accepted that O’Neill’s behaviour represented a breach of trust. He said that in every other aspect of his life, O’Neill was a law abiding, caring and 'outstanding' man. He added: 'The higher you have risen in life, the harder the fall from grace. 'He is experiencing that now: one week ago his wife told him that their marriage is over. 'He is at about the lowest ebb he has ever been.' O’Neill has also been suspended from his duties by local NHS managers.","Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill admitted raping and sexually abusing two girls .

"TV watchdog Ofcom has been bombarded with a fresh flood of complaints about Celebrity Big Brother contestant Perez Hilton's latest brush with Katie Hopkins. The controversial US blogger has formed a strange rivalry with the outspoken newspaper columnist in the reality TV show's opening weeks. But their odd relationship appeared to boil over when Hilton was returned to the house earlier this week. Hilton, 36, was shown leaning towards Hopkins and sticking his tongue out in an apparent attempt to lick her face. Scroll down for video . Lewd: Perez Hilton reportedly demanded that Katie Hopkins perform a sex act on him after trying to lick her face as he made a shock return to the Celebrity Big Brother house on Wednesday . Ofcom had already received 71 complaints about the incident. The calls and emails came on top of more than 700 complaints about Hilton's 'sexual' behaviour in the house's garden last Friday and more than 2000 complaints about the show's latest series as a whole. An Ofcom spokesman: 'Ofcom has received 2,005 complaints about Celebrity Big Brother to date. We are assessing these complaints, before deciding whether to investigate.' It has been reported that the attempted face-licking was not gossip blogger Hilton's only inappriopriate behaviour towards Hopkins, 39, on Wednesday. In actions not screened on air, Hilton is also said to have been seen 'frantically thrusting his hips' towards his housemate. He also reportedly told her to 'lick it good, suck this d*** just like you should' - a take on Khia's sexually-charged 2002 rap hit My Neck, My Back. It was claimed today that the off-screen exchange could now lead to Hilton being questioned by police when he eventually leaves the house. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We have received no complaints either from audiences or anyone in the house. Obviously if any incidents are reported we would fully investigate these.' One is not amused: Katie was far from impressed with the attention she received from her arch nemesis . It wouldn't be the first time police have had to investigate incidents on the show. Fellow contestant Jeremy Jackson, 34, was kicked off the programme earlier this month after he lunged at Chloe Goodman while she was wearing only a bathrobe. He was later handed a formal caution by Hertfordshire Police. Hopkins did not mention the incident in her column in The Sun this morning, suggesting she is unlikely to go to police. She did however call Hilton 'walking anthrax' and claimed he had been brought back into the fold to give her 'someone to spar with'. Hilton has been dubbed the 'most hated man in Britain' for his behaviour on the show, in which he often appears dressed only in his underwear. He has been cited as the reason singer Alexander O'Neal walked out of the house, after the singer claimed Hilton's 'taunts' had put him under 'unbearable stress'. Columnist Katie Hopkins has been most vocal in her dislike of the American, branding him 'vile' and 'disgusting' to his face.

"After 15 years of painstaking restoration, scientists say they are on the brink of solving what sank the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley - the first sub in history to wreck an enemy warship. Considered the Confederacy's stealth weapon during the Civil War, the hand-cranked Hunley sank the Union warship Housatonic in winter 1864 and then disappeared with all eight Confederate sailors inside. Its remains were discovered in 1995 in waters off South Carolina and five later it was raised to a conservation lab. Now with about 70per cent of the hull cleaned of heavy rust, Paul Mardikian, a senior conservator on the Hunley project, says that crucial clues have been unearthed but 'it's too early to talk about it yet.' Scroll down for video . Painstaking: Conservators work at removing the encrustation from the hull of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley at a conservation lab in North Charleston, South Carolina on January 27, 2015 . Code-breakers: Scientists say that  about 70 per cent of the encrusted sand, silt and rust from the outside of the sub has been removed - they hope that when the entire hull is revealed, it will provide the clues as to why the Hunley sank . He added: 'It's like unwrapping a Christmas gift after 15 years. We have been wanting to do this for many years now. We have a submarine that is encrypted. It's like an Enigma machine.' He said the clues will be studied closely as scientists finally piece together what happened to the 40-foot submarine that night decades ago. The narrow, top-secret 'torpedo fish,' built in Mobile, Alabama by Horace Hunley from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand-cranked propeller, arrived in Charleston in 1863 while the city was under siege by Union troops and ships. In the ensuing few months, it sank twice after sea trial accidents, killing 13 crew members including Horace Hunley, who was steering. 'There are historical references that the bodies of one crew had to be cut into pieces to remove them from the submarine,' said Mardikian. 'There was forensic evidence when they found the bones (between 1993 and 2004 in a Confederate graveyard beneath a football stadium in Charleston) that that was true.' The Confederate Navy hauled the sub up twice, recovered the bodies of the crew, and planned a winter attack. From a metal spar on its bow, the Hunley planted a 135-pound torpedo in the hull of the ship, which burned and sank. Flashback: This June 15 2011 photo shows the Hunley before conservationists started the next round of derusting . Ongoing process: Conservator Paul Mardikian works at removing encrustation from the hull of the  Hunley, using tools similar to a dentist . Purpose-built: The narrow, top-secret 'torpedo fish,' built in Mobile, Alabama by Horace Hunley from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand-cranked propeller, arrived in Charleston in 1863 while the city was under siege by Union troops and ships . Before the collision, a lookout on the Housatonic spotted a bizarre vessel approaching just below the surface - with only its coning tower visible - and sounded the alarm. The Housatonic's cannons couldn't be lowered enough to fire at the strange craft, so crewmen used rifles and pistols, but these were not effective. Some historians say that the submarine showed a mission-accomplished lantern signal from its hatch to troops back on shore before it disappeared. Soon after the signal had been fired, the sub sank about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) off Charleston. More than a century later, in 1995, the Hunley was discovered off the South Carolina. It was raised in 2000 and brought to a conservation lab in North Charleston. Mardikian has the lantern, which archaeologists found in the submarine more than a century later, in his laboratory. Scientists removed ten tons of sediment from the submarine, along with the bones, skulls and even brain matter of the crew members. They also found fabric and sailors' personal belongings. Facial reconstructions were made of each member of the third and final crew. They are displayed along with other artifacts in a museum near the submarine. In a nearby vault is a bent gold coin that archaeologists also found in the submarine. Origins of name: After it was unveiled, the sub sank twice during sea trials, killing 13 crew members including Horace Hunley, who was steering - The Confederate Navy recovered the bodies and planned a winter attack using the vessel . The USS Housatonic was sunk by the H.L. Hunley in February of 1864 off the coast of South Caroline . A computer generated view of what the H.L. Hunley would look like with its explosive spar torpedo attached . A schematic of the submarine from 1863 shows the rudimentary system of propulsion via levers . It was carried by the sub's captain, Lieutenant George Dixon, for good luck after it stopped a bullet from entering his leg during the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. 'The submarine was a perfect time capsule of everything inside,' said Ben Rennison, one of three maritime archaeologists on the project. For almost 15 years the sub sat in a 90,000-gallon tank of fresh water to leech salt out of its iron hull. Then, last May it was finally ready to be bathed in a solution of sodium hydroxide to loosen the encrustation. Four months later scientists, using small air-powered chisels and dental tools, began the laborious job of removing the coating. The Hunley Project is a partnership among the South Carolina Hunley Commission, Clemson University Restoration Institute, the Naval Historical Center and the nonprofit Friends of the Hunley. The nonprofit group raised and spent $22 million on the project through 2010, said a spokeswoman. Scientists have found the vessel to be a more sophisticated feat of engineering than historians had thought, said Michael Drews, director of Clemson's Warren Lasch Conservation Center. 'It has the ballast tanks fore and aft, the dive planes were counterbalanced, the propeller was shrouded,' Drews said. 'It's just got all of the elements that the modern submarines have, updated.' There were previous submarines, Drews said, but the Hunley, designed to sail in the open ocean and built for warfare, was cutting-edge technology at the time. 'Dixon's mission was to attack and sink an enemy ship and he did,' Drews said. 'At that particular time, the mindset of naval warfare was, basically, big ships sink little ships. 'Little ships do not sink big ships. And the Hunley turned that upside down.'","H.L Hunley was the first submarine ever to sink an enemy warship in combat - in 1864 .

"Millions of motorists face a 'spy in the cab' offensive by police using a secret unmarked lorry to catch drivers who text and phone at the wheel. Thousands are expected to be prosecuted after it starts patrolling motorways and A-roads this spring. A police driver and an officer with a video camera sitting high above the traffic will be on the look-out for offenders who cannot usually be seen from ground level. Scroll down for video . On the lookout: An officer in the police lorry during the trial of the in-cab video camera . A support team of two police motorcyclists and a marked police car in constant touch with the juggernaut will drive nearby to help gather evidence. Offences to be targeted include texting or phoning while driving, speeding, hogging the middle or outside lane, drink or drug driving, driving without care, and failing to wear a seat belt. Police will deal with the errant drivers through 'enforcement and education' including 'words of advice, driver education courses, fixed penalty notices or summons to court'. The decision follows a three-month trial last year in five police areas – Surrey, Hampshire, Sussex, Thames Valley and Warwickshire – in conjunction with the Highways Agency. Codenamed Operation Tramline, it led to the detection of 462 offences. The new scheme will cover England's major motorways and strategic roads used daily by more than four million drivers. The aim is to tackle those offenders who are not spotted by conventional static speed cameras. Crackdown: Offences to be targeted include texting or phoning while driving, speeding and drink driving . The Highways Agency has paid MAN Trucks for the hire of the unmarked lorry cab, which will be sent around the 45 police forces in England. The agency said: 'The vehicle provided an ideal viewing platform for officers to observe drivers' actions from a high vantage point while out on the road. 'The unit enables the police to observe and record poor and dangerous driving behaviour using a video camera. The pilot was very successful at identifying unsafe driving behaviour. 'The aim of extending the project to a national initiative is not revenue generation but to improve driver behaviour and hence safety on the motorway network.' Officials said the original objective had been to use the raised seating position of the HGV cab to focus on dangerously driven lorries, but police quickly realised its usefulness for spotting other offences being committed. The Highways Agency spokesman said: 'Car drivers' texting while driving are not easy to identify from police patrol vehicles but the elevated seating position makes this offence much easier to see.' Sergeant Chris Schultze from Surrey's Roads Policing Unit, which led the trials, said: 'Drivers continue to put themselves and others at risk. We have been looking for things like drivers who are not in proper control of the vehicle, if they are doing anything that is distracting them. It's been a massive success.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Police will literally be looking down on drivers to check they are concentrating on the road and not being distracted by the latest message on their phone. 'Motorways are our safest roads but given the speeds involved and the mix of traffic, when things go wrong the results can be serious. Rooting out bad and anti-social behaviour is important. Now motorists tempted to break the law are likely to have traffic officers peering right over their shoulders.' Using a hand-held mobile while driving has been illegal for a decade and is subject to three penalty points and a £100 fine, rising to a possible £1,000 on conviction in court. But Government figures show the number of accidents in which mobile phones and texting have been contributory factors has soared by 21 per cent in only three years.","Police will start using unmarked lorry to catch drivers who text and phone .

"Accused: Prosecutors say Sean Frayne (pictured on January 26) 'forcefully' raped a woman . A chief fire officer broke down in court yesterday after telling a jury he had sex with a woman in a village pub, while his unwitting wife sat drinking yards away. Sean Frayne is accused of raping the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in an empty part of the building in Etwall, Derby in December 2006. But the 48-year-old father-of-three claims the encounter was consensual and began when his accuser 'came on to him' with a 'passionate' kiss. Mr Frayne was giving evidence in his own defence. He claims the woman turned to him after they had sex and said:  'We shouldn't have done that with your wife nearby.' He wept as he told jurors he was a 'fool' for having a 'one night stand' with her but added: 'I'm not a rapist.' Prosecutors say Frayne, the chief officer of Derbyshire's Fire and Rescue Service, followed the woman to an unused section of the pub and made polite conversation before 'forcefully' raping her. They claim he then returned to his wife Helen Frayne in the bar area 'as though nothing had happened'. The woman kept quiet about the alleged attack for seven years, Derby Crown Court has heard. She eventually broke down and confided in a friend during a family wedding in 2013 and Frayne was arrested in February last year. But he says his version of events was 'the truth' and the allegation had 'wrecked his life'. The court heard he is currently suspended from his £142,000 a year job and his wife of 20 years had been 'destroyed' when he was forced to tell her about having sex with another woman. Frayne claimed the liaison began when he and his alleged victim found themselves alone - and she kissed him. He said he 'unfortunately' kissed her back and told jurors: 'It was a nice, warm, welcoming passionate kiss. It wasn't a peck on the cheek.' He added the woman then touched him intimately before they ended up having sex for a 'couple of minutes'. Frayne said: 'It stopped and she looked round and said, ""We shouldn't have done that with your wife nearby"". 'Destroyed': Mr Frayne (left, pictured on January 26) says his version of events was 'the truth' and the allegation had 'wrecked his life' Chief: The court heard Mr Frayne (pictured) has been suspended from his £142,000 a year job as chief officer of Derbyshire's Fire and Rescue Service . 'I'm a fool. I'd never experienced anything like that in my life. I zipped myself up and left I went to the toilet, washed my hands, and went back in the bar. 'She [his accuser] was sat back in there next to my wife.' Frayne added the couple stayed for a 'few more drinks' before leaving the pub. He told the court he has seen his accuser in the years since the alleged attack and everything had appeared 'normal'. He next heard about the allegation when he received a letter accusing him of rape. It had been sent by a friend of the woman and suggested the matter could be settled 'with an out of court payment'. Frayne and his wife went to confront his accuser who claimed to know nothing about the letter at her home. She made a formal complaint to police in December 2013. Frayne, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, denies rape. The trial continues.

"It's every parent's worst nightmare - when Alison and Basil Eastwood waved their daughter off on a gap year adventure, the thought she would never return home was inconceivable. But the parents from Bicester, Oxfordshire, were bereft after Cecily, 19, was killed while she was volunteering in Zambia. The teenager had been enjoying teaching at a school in Kitwe where she ran a homework club for orphans. She intended to stay there for a year before taking up a place at Cambridge University. Basil and Alison today, the couple have made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of children in Africa after setting up a charity in memory of their late daughter . Life cut short: Cecily had been enjoying a gap year in Zambia before taking a place at Cambridge University . But her life was cut short when a pick-up truck she had been travelling in crashed after its tyre burst due to striking a pothole. Alison, Basil and their three other daughters, Philippa, Verity and Alice were devastated. In search of closure, Alison and Basil felt compelled to visit the area where Cecily had spent her final days. Alison, 68, said: 'It was very hard going to visit Zambia. Everywhere we went there were reminders of Cecily. 'The places we were going to were all places that Cecily had been. I even saw a woman in the market who was wearing one of Cecily's dresses because after Cecily passed away her clothes were distributed within the community.' Loss: From left Basil, Philippa, Cecily, Verity, Alice and mother Alison before Cecily's gap year . In her memory: Alison, left, was determined to help the orphans her daughter, right, had worked with after she visited the school where Cecily had volunteered . The trip ended up being more than just a chance to feel closer to their daughter after Alison, who used to work as a language teacher, and Basil, 70, a former British Ambassador, met the orphans Cecily had worked with. Alison realised that they too had felt loss and she knew she had to do something to help them - which would also allow her to honour Cecily's memory. She recalled: 'When we got there all the children that Cecily had been teaching met us and sang a welcoming African song, which was incredibly moving. There were hundreds of them. I realised that we had lost one child and all these children had lost parents. And that coming from a privileged society we were in a position to do something to help them. 'There is never any reason or meaning you can bring to a young death but being able to continue the work that Cecily started has been so important to us. Not only has it helped the children in Zambia it has helped me and Cecily’s sisters to be able to do something in her name. In some way it keeps her alive.' Moved by their plight: Alison and Basil with the children in Zambia they vowed to help, pictured during their visit in 1997 following the death of their daughter . Since setting up the charity in 1998, Basil, pictured with children in Zambia, and Alison have helped thousands . Money donated to Cecily's Fund, which is now supported by Comic Relief, helps students like these who would not otherwise get a good education in Zambia . These female students have been given access to education thanks to fundraising in Cecily's memory . There are 1.2 million orphaned children living in Zambia, almost half have lost at least one parent to HIV/AIDS. Without parental support, many go without a good education. But thanks to donations this Red Nose Day... The parents set up Cecily's Fund which supports thousands of six to eighteen-year-olds who have lost one or both of their parents to HIV, enabling them to access primary and secondary education in the Copperbelt region of Zambia. Since starting the charity in 1998, the year after Cecily's death, they have raised thousands of pounds that has made a difference to the lives of thousands of children. Their supporters have run marathons, scaled mountains and walked for miles in order to secure sponsorship. Alison, who has taken on fundraising challenges herself along with her family, said: 'In the 16 years since our beloved Cecily died her Fund has paid over 82,000 primary school fees and 38,000 secondary school fees. 'On average we have been supporting about 8,000 children in school each year. By enabling them to go to school Cecily’s Fund has given them a ladder to climb up out of the destitution to which they would otherwise have been condemned. That is something very special.' Now the charity has joined forces with Comic Relief - which launched its latest appeal on Monday ahead of Red Nose Day on Friday 13th March. With help from Comic Relief, the charity's main priority is to increase the attendance of orphaned children - and in particular girls - in schools and to ensure they receive a full course of primary education. A common obstacle for children in Zambia is the inability to afford essential school kit such as uniforms and textbooks. Cecily's Fund pays for these crucial items so children can then access education. Red Nose Day is back on Friday 13th March. Money raised this Red Nose Day will help to transform lives here in the UK and across Africa. Find out how you can help at www.rednoseday.com .","Cecily Eastwood was 19 when she died in Zambia .

"These pictures reveal what life is like inside Brazi's most notorious and dangerous prison. At least 75 inmates have died in the Pedrinhas Prison Complex since 2013, National Council of Justice claims. And three people were brutally beheaded in the complex that year during violent riots which claimed 60 lives. Heavily armed military police keep a constant and watchful eye on the prisoners homed within the walls in Maranhao state. Scroll down for video . At least 75 inmates have died in Pedrinhas Prison in the Maranhao state in Brazil since 2013, making it one of the most violent on the planet . During one riot, three inmates were decapitated after two rival gangs broke out of their cells and went on the rampage . Despite the presence of heavily armed officers, equipped with ballistic shields, shotguns and CS gas, the inmates were able to rampage . Long term neglect allowed the number of damaged cells to increase which in turn allowed inmates freedom to roam the entire facility . But some of the unrest inside the complex in Sao Luis has cooled recently following efforts from a new state administration, prison officials and leading judges from the state. Much of the violence stemmed from damaged cells which allowed inmates from rival gangs to mix in the prison's open spaces. Officials have recently repaired and repopulated the cells which allows the military police guarding the facility to move more freely. They claim there have been no prisoner-on-prisoner killings in the complex for nearly four months and violence is decreasing. Other reforms include a policy of custody hearings and real-time camera feeds. Brazil has the fourth-largest prison population in the world with around 550,000 people behind bars - when almost 800,000 spaces are needed . Justice officials say that more spaces will be needed to cope with the rising number of arrests for even minor drug offences . Military police are forced to patrol the sprawling prison complex, ready with pump-action shotguns, semi-automatic handguns and gas . Overcrowding was believed to be one of the primary causes of rioting and violence in Brazil's prisons. Additionally, densely packed complexes strengthened prison gangs which now span the country and control the suburbs of cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Sao Luis, where the Pedrinhas Prison Complex lies. Brazil has the fourth-largest prison population in the world behind the Russia, the U.S. and China. The number of prisoners has quadrupled in the past twenty years to around 550,000 and the country needs at least 200,000 new spaces to eliminate overcrowding. Even though the prison is an incredibly violent place, some of the inmates have been granted special privileges such as using art tools . Some of the prisoners' art works are displayed on the walls to entertain fellow inmates, although the subject matter is not surprising . A vast increase in minor drug arrests, a lack of legal advice for criminals and a lack of political will for new prisons have contributed to the increases. In October 2013,  prison gangs inside the complex in north-eastern Brazil left 10 dead and 30 injured in a violent uprising. Rioting broke out between rival factions and spilled out into the city centre where marauding supporters torched seven buses and besieged the local hospital. The mutiny started after several prisoners refused to allow wardens to carry out an inspection of their cells. However, it is not all men who are detained inside the prison, as it is home to female inmates - some of whom are heavily pregnant . The pregnant women give birth inside the jail and some of them are allowed to keep their children with them behind bars . The men and the women are kept separate from each other although authorities are unable to prevent all attempts at fraternising . The situation rapidly escalated into a confrontation between the officers and the detainees. And according to the Latin Times, at least 36 inmates managed to escape from Pedrinhas in September the following year. Several of them stole a dump truck which they used to knock down a wall in the facility. Four of the prisoners were able to steal the vehicle, which was inside the prison complex because of ongoing construction, and they rammed it into the outer wall to open up an enormous hole. According to the Justice and Prison Administration Secretariat of Maranhao, authorities arrested a 19-year-old man for his alleged involvement in stealing the truck and helping the inmates escape. As part of the the efforts to reduce tension inside the prison, inmates have been offered special exercise regimes . Also, many areas in the prison are covered by CCTV systems, which can alert authorities immediately to any potential problems .","At least 75 inmates have died in the Pedrinhas Prison complex since 2013 according to Brazilian justice sources .

"It’s every man’s worst nightmare: things being over in the bedroom before they've even begun. Now, one expert has a simple solution which can help men control their ejaculation. Marni Kinrys, a U.S. dating coach, says holding in urine for five seconds at a time strengthens the Kegel, or pelvic, muscles. This, in turn, can improve a man’s performance in the bedroom if practised often enough. Holding in urine can control and prolong a man's ejaculation, as this strengthens the Kegel muscles. Previous studies show 40 per cent of men will suffer premature ejaculation at one point (file photo) Kegel, or pubococcygeus (PC) muscles help with bladder function and ejaculation, but become weaker or stretched as men and women age. Ms Kinrys says strengthening these muscles, just as one would strengthen any other muscle group, allows men to last longer between the sheets. When a person stops urinating mid-stream, the Kegel muscles are activated. In a video posted to Youtube, Ms Kinrys explains: ‘Kegel exercises are something you can do everywhere, at every moment in your life. Driving in a car, in your office, sitting at the doctors. ‘They control your pubococcygeus (PC) muscles so you can control ejaculation and prolong ejaculation’ ‘You want to work your way up to 50 reps a day, a rep being clenching your PC muscles for three to five seconds, and then releasing. Working these muscles has been shown to help with premature ejaculation. To identify the muscles sit relaxed and tighten the muscle around the back passage, as if trying to control wind. You should be able to feel the muscle move. With the correct technique you should feel a dip at the base of the penis, while the scrotum moves up slightly. To perform the exercises: sit, stand or lie with your knees slightly apart. Slowly tighten and pull up the pelvic floor muscles as hard as you can for as long as you can. Rest for four seconds then repeat. Build up until you can do 10 slow contractions at a time, holding them for 10 seconds each. Results are only likely to be seen after daily practice for three months. Source: Bladder and Bowel foundation . ‘You start off by doing 1 to 20 reps then work up to doing 50 reps. ‘Then you want to increase the time from 5 to 7 seconds. Keep increasing from there.’ ‘This will help strengthen your PC muscles so you never have to worry about premature ejaculation again.’ Up to 40 per cent of men suffer from premature ejaculation - defined by the International Society of Sexual Medicine as ejaculation 'within a minute' - at some point in their lives. In most men, the cause is simply being unable to control the ejaculatory response, explains Wendy Hurn, urology nurse consultant at Bristol Royal Infirmary. ‘Some may have more sensitive nerve endings, however stress or pressure can also make the problem worse,' she said. Pelvic floor exercises are often used to help male incontinence, especially after surgery such as operations for prostate cancer. Italian research published last year found that carrying out Kegel exercises daily for 12 weeks increased the average ejaculation time four-fould. The average ejaculation time was 31.7 seconds at the beginning of the trial, but after 12 weeks of exercises this had increased to 146.2 seconds (two minutes and 26 seconds). In total, 33 of the 40 men improved within 12 weeks. Only five men showed no significant improvement. Two had dropped out of the trial early, after showing an improvement. Ms Kinrys recommends clenching when going to the loo for three to five seconds, and repeating this 50 times throughout the day .","Studies show 40% of men will suffer premature ejaculation at some point .

"The Taliban have claimed responsibility for an insider attack by an Afghan soldier that killed three American contractors at a Kabul airport on Thursday. A spokesman for the insurgent group said that the attacker's name was Ehsanullah and that he was from Laghman Province in the east of the country. The Taliban said the soldier 'opened fire on invaders,' according to the Washington Post. Stepped up security: Afghan army vehicles patrol the perimeter of the airport in Kabul where three American contractors were shot dead by an Afghan army soldier . The names of the contractors, who were working to train the Afghan air force, were not released. The Taliban said the soldier, whom they called an 'infiltrator,' was 'martyred by return fire,' the Post reports. A fourth American was injured in the attack and the US-led coalition confirmed that an Afghan, believed to be the attacker, was killed. The attack occurred at an Afghan military base at the North Kabul International Airport complex. 'Insider attacks' by Afghan security forces have been on the rise in recent years and have led to the deaths of 142 people. Western troops and civilians training Afghan security forces have faced lethal assaults from Afghans in uniform who turn their guns on their counterparts. They have had a major impact on trust between US and NATO and Afghan forces since 2008 and leading up to the winding down of combat operations in the country. Fortified: The military base where the Americans were shot his heavily guarded and difficult to enter, except for authorized personnel . In August Major Gen. Harold J. Greene was the highest ranking official to be killed in four decades in a war zone as the result of an 'insider attack.' The airport in the Afghan capital Kabul is heavily guarded, with one section devoted to commercial aircraft and another area set aside for a NATO contingent. Thursday's attack came after a surge in violence by the Taliban insurgency over the past year. At least nine people were killed earlier Thursday in the country's east when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive at a funeral for victims of a roadside bomb attack. Most NATO combat troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year but a small contingent of about 12,000 remains in the country, including roughly 10,600 American forces. The American soldiers, along with other NATO troops and private contractors, are helping the Afghans improve their logistics and build up a fledgling air force.","A fourth American was also wounded in the deadly incident on Thursday .

"Average Americans will chow down on 2,400 calories during the Super Bowl, though their favorite food for the event may also be the most healthy. Vegetables have been the most popular food eaten during the big game for the past 30 years, said Harry Balzer, a chief food industry analyst for NPD. Baby carrots and vegetable trays are the most eaten food during the NFL's championship game. However, wings, pizza and beer will also see sales increases when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in Arizona. Scroll down for video .

Superbowl Sunday is thought to be the day of America's second-highest day for food consumption each year after Thanksgiving, according to Reuters. The Atlanta-based Calorie Control Council said that the estimated 2,400 calories set to be consumed by the average American amounts to a slice of pizza, four cans of beer, one serving of BBQ wings, one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries. The National Chicken Council says that the country will eat 1.25billion chicken wings, with ranch, barbeque and blue cheese dressings the most popular dips. The ten-figure number of wings is enough to put more than 500 on every seat of every NFL football stadium and adds up to nearly two chickens killed for every American. Domnio's and Pizza Hut generally expect to sell around 11million and 2million slices respectively, according to Forbes. Americans will wash it all down by drinking 325.5million gallons of beer. NPD said that sales of televisions during Super Bowl week, which is the third most popular week to buy a TV, will also likely increase this year. Americans will spend about $14.3 billion in total on the Super Bowl, or an average of $77.88 per consumer.

"A Florida judge on Thursday declared a multimillionaire legally dead, nearly three years after he went missing while out sailing in rough seas. Oil and gas tycoon Guma Aguiar, 35, vanished from Fort Lauderdale at sunset on June 19, 2012, just hours after his wife allegedly threatened him with a divorce. His 31-foot boat T.T. Zion washed ashore the next day on a beach with the lights on and its engine on full throttle. Police found Aguiar’s cell phone and wallet aboard the vessel, but there was no sign of the married father of four. Rest in peace: Oil and gas tycoon Guma Aguiar, 35, has been declared officially dead. The Jewish philanthropist vanished without a trace from Fort Lauderdale at sunset on June 19, 2012 . Lost at sea: Aguiar was last seen sailing his 31-foot fishing boat, T.T. Zion at high speeds through Port Everglade . This frame grab taken from a surveillance video at Port Everglades and provided by the Fort Lauderdale Police Deptartment, shows oil tycoon Guma Aguiar steering his boat into the ocean on Tuesday June 19, 2012. It is the last known image of 35-year-old Guma Aguiar, whose boat washed ashore June 20 without him . Days after Aguiar's mysterious disappearance, his wife and mother went to war for control of his $100million fortune. But this week the two women temporarily put their differences aside and submitted a joint petition asking a Broward County judge to officially declare Aguiar dead so they could gain access to his estate. After hearing testimony from Jamie and Ellen Aguiar, as well as from the lead detective investigating the missing-person case, Judge Mark Speiser granted the women's request. 'The legal battles are settled and resolved,' attorney Albert Frevola representing Aguiar's now-widow told Sun-Sentinel. 'And the survivors will be able to move on with their lives.' The petition to have Aguiar declared dead states that he accidentally fell overboard and drowned. His body was never recovered. His wife, Jamie, broke down in tears in court Wednesday as she described the day she learned of her husband's disappearance. ‘The police showed up at our house and said they found his boat had washed ashore,’ said Jamie Aguiar, reported CBS Miami.

Family feud: Ellen Aguiar (left), the missing man's mother, has been locked in a legal battle with his wife, Jamie (right) for the control of her son's $100million fortune . Temporary truce: Jamie Aguiar, pictured here with Guma in 2006, had joined forces with her mother-in-law to file a petition to have her husband declared dead . Putting on a brave face: Aguiar, the owner of an Israeli basketball team, had a history of mental illness . Mrs Aguiar also said that her husband’s bank accounts have been dormant for nearly three years, providing further proof that he was dead. Guma Aguilar, a Brazilian-born Jewish philanthropist, made his fortune in 2006 when his Texas-based oil and gas exploration company, Leor Energy, sold for a reported $2.55billion. His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at $5million, he had seven cars valued at $1.1million and a yacht called Zion worth $2.1million. The missing magnate was born to Jewish parents but was raised as an Evangelical Christian. Aguiar has donated $8million in the past to Nefesh b'Nefesh, an organization that helps American and British Jews move to Israel, and was also a large supporter of the 'March of the Living' - an educational program in Poland and Israel designed to continue public awareness of the Holocaust in those countries. He also became a regular on Israeli sports pages when he invested $4 million into Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar Jerusalem in July 2009. Home sweet home: The Fort Lauderdale house of Jamie and Guma Aguiar valued at $5million . Aguiar owned this 77-foot yacht called Zion valued at $2.1million . In September 2009, Aguiar also purchased Jerusalem's leading basketball franchise Hapoel Jerusalem for $1.5million. Despite his family and business interests, Aguiar has a history of mental illness and was admitted to an Israeli psychiatric hospital after claiming to know a soldier in Israel who had been abducted by the terrorist group Hamas. He was on probation for domestic violence when he disappeared. The multi-millionaire had reportedly argued with his wife, when she is said to have threatened him with a divorce, hours before he disappeared. A lawyer for Guma Aguiar's mother, Ellen, said the wealthy humanitarian was in low spirits when he went out on his boat that fateful Tuesday in June, after receiving the blow from Jamie - a claim the wife has repeatedly denied. The 35-year-old man had spoken with his mother an hour before he got on to his 31-foot boat, the T.T. Zion, and sailed off on June 19. A surveillance video showed Aguiar alone aboard the boat as it made its way through Port Everglades at high speeds. According to police, Aguiar began having steering trouble due to equipment malfunction. GPS data began tracking Aguiar at 7.29pm after he had left the inlet by his house. He traveled northeast for nearly 30 minutes into the open ocean. At 7.56pm, the 31-foot vessel suddenly made an ominously abrupt turn, slowing to speeds below 3mph. The yacht was controlled by a person until 7.54am, when both its engines died. About six hours after Aguiar sped off in his boat, it was discovered abandoned on the beach next to a bar with its navigation lights on and the keys still in the ignition.","Brazilian-born millionaire Guma Aguiar, 35, disappeared June 19, 2012, after steering his yacht alone through Port Everglades, Florida .

"Andressa Urach went from being a single teenage mom nicknamed 'Beanpole' to a reality TV bombshell in Brazil thanks to silicone implants, anabolic steroids, a nose job, and gel and Botox injections, a fact she wasn't ashamed to share with fans. 'There are plenty of ugly women,' she said last year. 'If you have the money, you can be beautiful. This pretty face you see here, my dear, it costs some.' More, it turns out, than she bargained for. The 27-year-old Urach, arguably Brazil's most outspoken advocate of advancement through cosmetic surgery, recently went into septic shock and was placed on life support after a botched operation to augment her thighs, sparking a debate about the risks Brazilian women will take for beauty at a moment when the nation has surpassed the U.S. as the world's plastic surgery capital. Scroll down for video . Surgery fan: Andressa Urach in November 2012 competing in Miss Bumbum Brazil. The now-27-year-old went into septic shock on December 1, 2014 and was placed on life support after an operation to augment her thighs . Ordeal: Urach pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com. Brazil's Plastic Surgery Society said she was given a dose of silicone gel 200 times what the government allows . It led the runner-up in Brazil's 'Miss Bum Bum' contest to express regret 'that I put that poison in my body, mostly because of having too much vanity.' Urach appeared on television this week for the first time since falling ill two months ago, her wounds still so fresh that blood could be seen soaking through her skirt. Urach told Rede TV that she blamed 'society, which unfortunately holds a standard of beauty in which you have to be perfect.' 'I hope that these wounds at least serve as a warning to other women,' Urach added. Since Urach's ordeal, several celebrities have come forward to disclose that similar procedures had sent them to the hospital. In October, a 39-year-old woman died from a pulmonary embolism hours after hydrogel was injected in her buttocks in the city of Goiana. Experts and activists worry that Brazil's culture of beauty has numbed women to the dangers and encouraged them to experiment with riskier, untested materials and methods and even unlicensed practitioners. 'They are selling us these plastic surgeries, these synthetic injections like it was any other product,' said Sara Winter, a women's rights activist who protested on Copacabana beach in December with a large needle made of cardboard and signs sending good wishes for Urach's recovery. While Brazil has around 5,500 certified plastic surgeons, another 12,000 doctors without specialized training are performing cosmetic procedures, according to the country's Federal Council of Medicine, which is in charge of medical licenses. And some women turn to paramedics, or even people with no medical training at all. Brazil's Plastic Surgery Society said Urach was given a dose of silicone gel 200 times what the government allows and used a hydrogel that isn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's not clear where or even who carried out the procedure on Urach; she hasn't disclosed the information. Regrets: Urach pictured in hospital, her legs unbandaged. She says: 'I hope that these wounds at least serve as a warning to other women' Despite the debate there is no sign of flagging demand to fight sagging flesh. Brazil recently surpassed the United States in plastic surgeries, with 1.5 million procedures in 2013, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. One of Urach's closest friends, Jessica Lopes, a reality TV star she met in the Miss BumBum contest, told the celebrity news site EGO that the two used to schedule visits to the plastic surgeon together as if it were 'a trip to the mall.' Many young women visit doctors asking to look like models such as Urach, or at least to improve their self-esteem. Brazil's Dr. Ivo Pitanguy, one of the world's top plastic surgeons, has urged doctors to think of themselves as 'a psychologist with a scalpel in his hand.' 'Women's lives changed,' said Dr. Fernando de Almeida, president of the Sao Paulo chapter of the Society of Plastic Surgery. 'Plastic surgery helps women who thought their life was over just because their breasts sagged and their belly got ugly.' 'Plastic surgery is so tied to this dream of becoming somebody,' said Alvaro Jarrin, a College of the Holy Cross professor who has researched the expansion of plastic surgery among low-income patients in Brazil. 'For the growing middle class with more purchasing power, plastic surgery is a means for upward mobility.' Urach once said that she had her nose job 'to have the face of a rich girl,' and after placing runner-up in the a 2012 beauty pageant that crowned Brazil's best bottom, Urach was invited to a reality show where she stripped naked and became a TV host known for incidents like pouring water on her breasts while interviewing politicians about a drought hitting southeast Brazil. For Vania Prisco, a 31-year-old Rio de Janeiro lawyer, Urach's problems were a reminder of her own botched operation. Prisco is still recovering from a 2013 surgery carried out by a woman she later discovered didn't have a medical degree. The procedure was to put a type of acrylic glass filler in her bottom to add more shape, but it resulted in an infection that spread throughout her body and left her hospitalized for six months. Prisco filed a police report, but authorities have yet to locate the woman who carried out the procedure. 'I was misled. I only heard the good things. No one tells you about all the problems it will cause you,' said Prisco. 'I did something stupid. I didn't even need this because I looked good. In the end I forgot that the most important thing is to be healthy and happy.'","Andressa Urach, 27, went into septic shock and was placed on life support in December after a botched operation to augment her thighs .

"Camels, goats, cows and donkeys carrying explosives  could be used in deadly attacks by Nigerian terror group Boko Haram. Intelligence reports gathered by Nigerian's security agencies reveal the group is planning to use the livestock in busy public places, the country's government has warned. Youngsters disguised as cobblers hiding explosives in their tool boxes are also set to be used in the terror attacks. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Boko Haram is believed to have killed more than 10,000 people in 2014 alone and now plans to use livestock carrying explosives to murder more innocent people have emerged . Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Center, said: 'Available intelligence reports indicate a plan by Boko Haram to use young male suicide bombers disguised as cobblers to hide explosives in their tool boxes and detonate them in soft target areas such as markets, restaurants, ATM locations, political rallies, worship centres, as well as other public places. 'Also there is indication of a plan by this group to use livestock, such as goats, cows, donkeys and camels, laden with explosives to attack chosen targets. 'In view of these, the general public, including all persons operating within and around the aforementioned places, is advised to be vigilant and mindful of suspicious activities within their environment.' The warning came yesterday as Chad sent a warplane dropping bombs and ground troops to drive Islamic extremists from Malumfatori village in Nigeria's Borno state, leaving it strewn with the bodies of the Islamic extremists. Thursday's bombing marked the first such action by foreign troops on Nigerian soil to fight Boko Haram. To further help Nigeria battle its extremists, the African Union (AU) moved to send ground forces and the U.S. said it would assist. The union chair, at an AU summit in Ethiopia, called for deployment of 7,500 West African troops to fight the spreading uprising by Nigeria's home-grown extremists. Boko Haram's uprising has killed about 10,000 people in the last year and displaced 1 million people. Human Rights Watch has previously warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks . This week it was revealed the terrorists are training child soldiers how to use semi-automatic weapons. The group released pictures showing more than a dozen children posing with, and learning how to aim, AK-47's. The images appear to have been taken in northern Nigeria where Boko Haram has committed most of its attacks. They were published online by Al Urwa al Wuthaqa, a media group that has been associated with the insurgents, and come months after Human Rights Watch warned that boys and girls kidnapped by the terrorist group were being used during their attacks.","Intelligence reveals group is planning to use the livestock in public places .

"A teacher who was violently assaulted by a pupil when he tried to confiscate their mobile phone is not ready to return to work, union bosses claim. The 16-year-old high school student at John F. Kennedy High School in Paterson, New Jersey, is facing jail time after the shocking attack on his  physics teacher that was captured on video. The footage shows him slamming the 62-year-old to the ground in front of other students after being asked for his phone at the end of class. Fight: The student then slams the 62-year-old physics teacher into a desk as other students watch on . Doctors have cleared the teacher to go back to work, but president of the Paterson Education Association, the teachers union Peter Tirri disagreed. He told CBS New York: 'He said he had injuries to his hand, his lower back, his head and his shoulder. 'I want his doctors to clear him rather than the district itself,' Mr Tirri said. 'He was not in any shape even yesterday to go back to work.' The association is now planning to file a grievance about the incident and Mr Tirri will be meeting with the superintendent. Security guards were called to the incident, the boy was suspended from school and later arrested at home on third-degree aggravated assault charges. David Cozart, the school's principal of operations, said that the boy became irate after his teacher took the cellphone from him. Altercation: The student is seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist . Bad behavior: In this part of the video the boy is seen dragging the teacher to the floor as he towers over him . In the 23-second clip posted to YouTube, the student can be seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist and slams him into a desk. Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'stop' and 'chill' but none tried to physically stop him during the assault. Some were seen moving away from the scene saying 'I'm out, I'm out' and others hollered for the security saying 'Someone help him'! Lee McNulty, a retired JFK teacher told NorthJersey.com: 'What strikes me is that the teacher never even defended himself, that just shows how much teachers are afraid of losing their job.' Police have not released the names of the suspect or the teacher. 'This was a very upsetting incident and certainly one that we took seriously as the safety of our students and staff is our top priority,' school spokesperson Terry Corallo said in a statement. Class: Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'chill,' and one, seen here, tried to get the boy to stop afterwards . Mr Tirri added that he was 'disappointed' that other students didn't try to help the teacher. 'Maybe they were afraid, I don't know,' he said. Jonathan Hodges, a veteran school board member told the site: 'It's troubling that in our society today students think that inside a school they can put their hands on each other and teachers.' 'I went online trying to find this video and I found numerous videos of teachers being attacked by their students.' The student will be home schooled during his suspension. A disciplinary hearing will reportedly determine his status for the remainder of the school year.","The ninth grade student was from John F. Kennedy High School, Paterson .

"Joanna Inch (pictured), 22, was jailed for four months for stealing the pensioner's money . A carer has been caught on a home made CCTV camera taking £15 from the purse of the 93-year-old woman she was supposed to be looking after. Joanna Inch was jailed for four months today for the heartless theft – and the judge said he wished he could have doubled the length of the sentence. Mrs Nancy Rolf's son Alan became suspicious when she said money was going missing. The judge said other carers may have taken cash from her – but it was 22-year-old Inch who was caught out when Mr Rolf fitted the covert CCTV camera in the kitchen of her home in Barnstaple, North Devon. Inch denied the theft charge and told police that Mrs Rolf had given her the money which she had taken from her purse which was in her handbag in the kitchen – before she stashed the two notes into the back of her mobile phone. Inch even whinged to the jury that the case had cost her her job as a carer, her car and her income. But Judge Phillip Wassall said today at Exeter Crown Court that Mrs Rolf had given very clear evidence via video link from North Devon. He said: 'She was telling the truth, her memory was extraordinary and completely clear.' He said Inch, from Bideford, North Devon, had shown no remorse and was still in total denial that she had done anything wrong. The judge said elderly people 'befriend and rely' on those who care for them in their own homes and the betrayal and breach of trust by Inch was evident. He said: 'The £15 taken is a small amount of money but the breach of trust is so high that it passed the custody threshold. The CCTV showed Inch going into the kitchen and opening the purse and taking out one note, which she places on the table, before pulling out a second note. She then left the kitchen before returning with disabled Mrs Rolf, who walks with a zimmer frame. Prosecutor Gareth Evans said Inch told police that Mrs Rolf had 'given her the money', but the frail pensioner denied that was the case when she gave her evidence during the trial last year. Inch will spend two months in jail before she is released on licence - the judge said he had taken her age into account. Nigel Wraith, defending, said she had no previous convictions and the theft conviction would blight the rest of her life having worked hard to earn a diploma in health and social care so that she could become a regular carer to Mrs Rolf. In this image taken from a makeshift CCTV camera, Inch can be seen taking £15 from Mrs Rolf's purse . The pensioner's son Alan installed the camera after his mother told him money was going missing.

District Attorney Ray Tonkin filed notice this week that he will seek the death penalty, listing aggravating factors that include the killing of a police officer. Weinstein said outside court Thursday that there has been no discussion of a plea. 'It's very early in this case,' he said, adding that the district attorney 'hasn't seen what we can produce, and we certainly haven't seen the discovery, so I wouldn't anticipate that he would start talking about resolution to this case.' Tonkin told reporters the death penalty is 'important in this case,' adding he's not considering a plea 'at this point in time.' Authorities have said Frein confessed to what he described as an assassination designed to 'wake people up' and result in a change in government and the restoration of liberties. His trial is tentatively scheduled for March, but Weinstein does not expect it to happen until 2016. One of many issues that will likely need to be resolved is where to hold the trial, with the defense considering a request to move it to another county. The ambush and subsequent manhunt drew blanket media coverage, and residents were both frightened and inconvenienced as law enforcement officials from around the nation descended on the rural region to look for the trooper's killer. 'There's no question that venue's an issue,' Weinstein said. 'We don't want to pretend it's not.'","Eric Frein, 31, allegedly killed one officer and seriously injured another .

"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim. Banks have so far paid out £17.3billion to those who were wrongly sold PPI alongside loans and credit cards. If the FCA proposals are passed, then victims could be barred from making a claim three years after they first realised the mis-selling had taken place. The City watchdog will announce its plans in the summer, which could involve introducing the deadline, an advertising campaign to alert mis-selling victims who have not yet put in a claim, or other rule changes. Deadline: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim (file photo) Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years. 'To make it work fairly for consumers they'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit, so people know they have been mis-sold. 'More importantly they'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to, knowing most people won't take it this far. 'I can't see either of those things happening, so a time limit should be a strict no-go.' Tens of millions of PPI policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans, mortgages and credit cards. They were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so. Often, victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years. Since the scandal broke, banks have been inundated with PPI complaints. Although many of these come from actual wronged customers, others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls. Martin Lewis (pictured), of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years . Alongside millions of legitimate claims, banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms. The independent Financial Ombudsman Service says it is receiving around 4,000 PPI complaints a week, down from a peak of 12,000. It finds in the customer's favour in roughly two-thirds of cases. Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: 'I fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly. The banks had their hands in customers' pockets for years. Victims shouldn't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around.'","Banks so far paid out £17.3billion to those wrongly sold PPI alongside loans .

"Two teenagers who forced a mentally ill woman to drink urine and smoke a cannabis joint filled with curry power while filming it on their mobile phones have been jailed. Jamie Rhys Campin, 19, was given ten years behind bars after he was also convicted of sexually assaulting the 43-year-old victim, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. His accomplice, 19-year-old Connor James, was jailed for two years after he was also found guilty of helping to steal a ring and laptop worth £400 from the home in Hillingdon, Greater London. Jamie Rhys Campin, 19 (left), jailed for ten years he sexually assaulted a mentally ill woman, and forced her to drink urine and smoke cannabis. Connor James, also 19, was jailed for two years (right) Isleworth crown court heard that the victim was alone in her house one day between the July 5 and July 14 when Campin and James approached her front door. The victim, who was suffering a psychotic episode, said she couldn't remember the exact date, and told the jury that she let the pair in because she convinced herself that she knew them. She said: 'I was not one hundred per cent well at that time because I have a mental health problem and I did not have any control of the situation. They just walked in and I didn’t want any trouble. 'These people entered my house early, at seven or eight in the morning and I don’t understand why I let them in, in the first place. In my head I believed these people were friends of mine. 'I don’t understand why I didn’t throw them out. I was very vulnerable at the time.' The victim, who also has an alcohol problem, was alone on that particular day after her husband left due to an argument. She said a third man may also have been present, but she clearly remembered two of them going into her bathroom. James was found guilty of forcing the woman to smoke drugs and drink urine, and of stealing a laptop and ring worth £400. The pair had a history of planning and filming attacks on the mentally frail, a court heard . The victim, a 43-year-old married woman with paranoid schizophrenia, told Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) that she let the men in because 'in my head I believed these people were friends of mine' She added: 'I remember them walking out with a plastic cup and they asked me to drink it and I drunk a bit and realised there was wee in it and spat it out. 'I was lured into my bedroom and I don’t remember being forced onto the mattress, but the person who assaulted me was on top of me. 'I was very scared at the time. I was confused and I do not know if it was sheer pure fright or if I was going along with it and not really knowing what was happening. 'I remember my trousers being undone. I don’t know if I did it or he did. I don’t think it was me, in fact I know it wasn’t.' She told the court she was not sure if a second man was in the bedroom at the time, but said he had spent his time in her house: 'With his hands down the front of his trousers.' The court heard that Campin and James both had histories of abusing mentally ill people, and had a history of planning such attacks and recording them. Police investigating the incident later found footage of the woman being given a cannabis joint which had been laced with curry powder.","Jamie Rhys Campin, 19, and Connor James, also 19, were both jailed today .

"This is the moment two bungling crooks steal an ATM from a Canadian casino not realizing that it's empty. CCTV footage shows the thieves running into Casino Calgary in Alberta just before 6am on Wednesday morning dressed in dark clothing and bright white sneakers. After loading the cash machine on a dolly they wheel it away, with it clumsily toppling over at one point. Caught on camera: This is the moment two bungling crooks steal an ATM from a Canadian casino not realizing that it's empty . After the minor catastrophe - which almost crushed one of the robbers - they exit the casino with their loot in tow. The operation took less than a minute to complete. Police say the thieving duo smashed the glass doors of the casino with a crowbar to gain entry and then headed directly to the ATM. There were several employees inside the arcade at the time of the theft; however, no one was injured.

Authorities have arrested three people in connection two of the 13 incidents; however, it’s believed copycat offenders orchestrated the most recent offence. Police are now looking for the two offenders and are asking for anyone with information to step forward.","CCTV footage shows the thieves running into Casino Calgary in Alberta just before 6am on Wednesday morning .

"Shame: The guidance was issued in the wake of the furore over Ched Evans, convicted of raping a woman, but who maintains the sex was consensual . A row broke out last night over guidelines which would see men accused of date rape being asked to prove that a woman wanted to have sex. As part of a major shake-up of investigations into sex offences, the Director of Public Prosecutions said it was vital to remove ‘any grey area’ to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent. Campaigners described the move as a ‘huge step forward’ in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice. But critics said the guidelines threatened to undermine Britain’s long-standing principle that people were innocent until proven guilty. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It is not clear how anyone is supposed to prove that consent was given. Is the CPS really suggesting that you have to get a signed statement off someone before they have sex? ‘Nobody wants to see rapists walk free. I’m as hardline as they come on crime, but this is ridiculous. Our legal system is based on people being innocent until proven guilty and the CPS are trying to turn that on its head.’ Alison Saunders, the DPP, issued the guidance in the wake of the furore over Ched Evans, who was released from prison in October halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a Welsh hotel. The footballer has always professed his innocence, saying the sex was consensual, but the woman said she was too drunk to agree. The guidelines, issued to all police forces and prosecutors, move well beyond the idea of ‘no means no’ for the first time. They spell out situations where victims would not be in a position to agree to sex, such as if they were incapacitated through alcohol or drugs, had mental health problems or learning difficulties, or were asleep or unconscious. Rape suspects in positions of power – such as a teacher, employer or doctor – and domestic violence situations where a complainant ‘may be financially or otherwise’ dependent on their alleged rapist, should also be scrutinised, the Crown Prosecution Service said. The document also made clear that behaviour such as staying silent or using contraception did not signify consent. The guidance tells police officers and lawyers to ask how the suspect knew the alleged victim had consented to sex ‘with full capacity and freedom to do so’. Investigators have been told to put greater emphasis on an accused man demonstrating that he had obtained the woman’s agreement ‘fully and freely’. Alison Saunders, the DPP, left, said it was vital to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent. But Tory MP Philip Davies, right, said it wasn't clear how proof of consent could work . In August last year a leading female judge provoked controversy by criticising rape victims who drank too much and were unable to remember their attack clearly. Judge Mary Jane Mowat said: ‘I’m not saying it’s right to rape a drunken woman, I’m not saying for a moment that it’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman. ‘But a jury in a position where they’ve got a woman who says, “I was absolutely off my head, I can’t really remember what I was doing, I can’t remember what I said, I can’t remember if I consented or not but I know I wouldn’t have done” – when a jury is faced with something like that, how are they supposed to react?’ Mrs Saunders said: ‘Consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely. ‘We want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue: How did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly?’ Sarah Green, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘The guidance is a huge step forward. It will help ensure that juries are asked to look in detail at the behaviour of defendants as well as at that of the complainant.’ But David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, warned: ‘The burden of proof should always be on the prosecution and we should never relax that requirement.’","New guidelines would force alleged rapists to prove consent was given .

"A woman claims her kidney was stolen by doctors who sold it to traffickers after tricking her into having surgery by saying she had colon cancer. Xu Xiuying, 48, has been fighting a seven-year battle for compensation after only discovering her organ was missing during a routine X-ray when she complained of backache. She said: 'I thought it was a result of a genetic defect and assumed I had been born like that, so I didn't think any more of it.' But when a neighbour alerted her to a scandal involving a trade in stolen kidneys she looked at the matter again. Xu Xiuying (left) claims her kidney was stolen by doctors during one of two operations (the scars from which can be seen, right) after they allegedly tricked her into having surgery by saying she had colon cancer . Xu only discovered her organ was missing during a routine X-ray when she complained of backache . Xu, who lives in the city of Xiangcheng in central China's Henan province, realised unscrupulous doctors must have removed her healthy organ and sold it on the black market. Healthy kidneys can be sold for thousands of pounds illegally and a huge investigation has been launched into the trade in China where the illicit operation took place. Xu, who has found she had two healthy kidneys in 2006 by looking at medical records held by her doctor, was told that she wrongly had colon cancer and faced major operations. She was admitted to two hospitals over a period of 12 months, undergoing a seven-hour operation in the first. She had more treatment in the second, but is now unsure when exactly her kidney was stolen. Healthy kidneys can be sold for thousands of pounds illegally and a huge investigation has been launched into the trade in China . Xu has been fighting a seven-year battle for compensation, but the courts say they is not enough evidence to prove which of the two hospitals carried out the surgery in which her kidney was stolen . It was during treatment at a third hospital that she discovered it was missing. She now claims it could only have happened during treatment at either the Xiangcheng First People's Hospital or the Xiangcheng Suburb Hospital. As neither hospital will admit responsibility, she is having to sue both of them for compensation for her lost kidney. A recent offer of a small amount of compensation by the First People's Hospital has been turned down by Xu. A judicial review confirmed her kidney was removed during surgery and that she was entitled to compensation. But the courts are refusing to rule on who should pay it because of  lack of evidence over which hospital was to blame.","Xu Xiuying only learnt organ was missing after routine X-ray for backache .

"Emmanuel Kanu: Accused of groping patient . A doctor groped a vulnerable divorcee in her home days after she had attempted suicide – but kept his job after citing 'cultural differences'. Dr Emmanuel Kanu stroked her breast, repeatedly tried to kiss her and told her, 'You want it' when she tried to escape his clutches during the visit - which he hid from colleagues. When she later texted him to tell him to stop ringing her he withheld his number on the next call. But Kanu, a married Nigerian father of one, has been allowed to keep his job by a fitness to practise panel even though the General Medical Council called for him to be struck off. He told the panel he had not molested the patient and claimed 'cultural differences' led to the visit on September 3, 2011, saying: 'There is a clear divide between the doctor and the patient here, which is very different in Nigeria.' But the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service only suspended the 36-year-old for six months, despite finding he was guilty of sexually motivated serious misconduct. Campaigners against violence towards women criticised the 'incredibly lenient penalty'. Nicole Westmarland, former chairman of Rape Crisis and Professor of Criminology at Durham University, asked 'what it takes for a doctor to be struck off'. She said: 'This doctor has committed a number of sexual offences on a woman who was in a very vulnerable position. 'A six-month suspension is an incredibly lenient penalty and the question remains: what will happen within the six months that will supposedly change his behaviour when he returns to work?' The doctor, who had recently completed GP training and was undergoing specialist training in psychiatry, was on a locum shift at the A&E department of Darlington Memorial Hospital, County Durham, when the divorcee was brought in after taking a 'substantial overdose'. She was still recovering in an emergency ward bed when he asked for her mobile number and then rang her when she was discharged five days later to say he was 'thinking of her'. He arranged to meet the mother-of-two, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at her home in Darlington for what the woman believed was a medical assessment. But he asked to use her laptop and then viewed Facebook photos of her as he sat next to her on a sofa. A report into his actions stated that he put his arm around her and stroked her chest. It added: 'She informed the panel she was ""scared, frozen to the spot"" and said ""I was unsure, he was a doctor"". Suspended: General Medical Council said Dr Emmanuel Kanu (pictured) should be struck off . 'She said when you saw the picture of her [breast] feeding her son you said ""They're big. Are they as big as that now?"" and squeezed her left breast.' When she stormed off to her kitchen Kanu followed her and kept trying to kiss her, saying at one point: 'I can see it in your eyes that you want it.' Kanu, who qualified in 2005 from the University of Nigeria, called her after he left but the woman, who was 43 at the time, texted: 'It was not right what you tried to do. You are a doctor and I was your patient. I didn't want or asked to be touched by you.' Kanu, who worked at Borders General Hospital near his home in Melrose, Roxburghshire, was acquitted of sexual assault at Durham Crown Court in 2012. He told the fitness to practise panel he had not molested the patient and claimed 'cultural differences' led to the visit on September 3, 2011, saying: 'There is a clear divide between the doctor and the patient here, which is very different in Nigeria.' But this was dismissed as not being a 'credible explanation'. The panel branded his behaviour 'deplorable' and 'unprofessional.' Kanu denied any knowledge of the case when approached by the Daily Mail. A spokesman for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said Kanu was dismissed as soon as the complaint came to light.","Dr Emmanuel Kanu stroked the woman's breast and told her: 'You want it'

"Ministers were facing fresh accusations of electioneering on the taxpayer last night after flocking to marginal seats across the country to announce £1billion in new spending. Some 21 ministers, including half the Cabinet, made official visits to towns and cities across England to announce details of the Government’s ‘Growth Deals’. Between them, they visited 19 seats that are either marginal constituencies or neighbouring marginals. Scroll down for video . Grand plans: More than 20 ministers were in or near key seats yesterday, including David Cameron (above) David Cameron visited two key marginal seats in Devon and Cornwall, announcing £5.9 million for a new road junction in Camborne and Redruth, where Tory MP George Eustice is defending a majority of just 66. Nick Clegg announced £4 million to expand a ‘business incubation facility’ in Bristol, where Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams is defending a marginal seat. And Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove visited Thurrock, in Essex, where Jackie Doyle-Price is fending off challenges from both Labour and Ukip. The visits and announcements will fuel growing concerns that ministers are effectively using public funds to bolster their election campaigns. Because the trips are ‘official’ visits, the bill is met by the taxpayer. The high proportion of marginal seats gaining rewards is also likely to raise eyebrows. The Cabinet Office last night denied there was any breach of rules that forbid ministers from electioneering on the taxpayer. Electioneering: Nick Clegg announced £4 million to expand a ‘business incubation facility’ in Bristol . A spokesman said: ‘These visits are not at all about campaigning. 'They’re about going and meeting Local Enterprise Partnerships on the day they’ve agreed a billion pounds of deals with the Government.’ But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘Ministers need to come clean and justify this expenditure. 'They must prove this is in the public interest, not just their own electoral interest.’ The SNP last night accused the Lib Dems of a ‘desperate ploy to try and reverse their collapse in support’ following the announcement of a £300 million deal for Inverness, including £2 million to promote tourism linked to the Loch Ness Monster. Lib Dem leader tries to claim credit for recovery . Mr Clegg yesterday sought to claim credit for the economic recovery and urged voters to keep the Lib Dems in power as two expert forecasts suggested Britain was heading for an election stalemate. Bidding to be part of a second coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour, Mr Clegg said that without the Lib Dems, Britain would have been plunged into a debt crisis equivalent to that in Greece. ‘Economic recovery would not have happened without us stepping up to the plate and creating this stable government,’ he said. Mr Clegg’s pitch to remain in office came as academics at Election Forecast UK predicted a dead-heat between the two main parties, with only a three-way coalition able to command a Commons majority. The company forecast 283 seats for the Conservatives, 283 for Labour, 33 for the Scottish Nationalists, 27 for the Lib Dems, eight for the DUP and three for Ukip. A separate forecast, published in the Guardian, also suggested Labour and the Conservatives are on course to win the same number of seats – 273 each.","Some 21 ministers made visits in or near 19 marginal constituencies .

"Hallmark has joined other mainstream brands and debuted its first ad featuring a same-sex couple as a part of its new series of Valentine's Day videos. The greeting card giant enlisted real-life lesbian couple of two years, Eugenia and Corinna, for its Put Your Heart to Paper campaign, which asks romantic partners to describe their feelings for each other without using the word 'love'. For the series of clips, real couples were filmed as they shared touching stories about their significant others and their relationships. Scroll down for video . True love: Eugenia (left) and Corinna (right) star in Hallmark's first ad featuring a same-sex couple. The real-life partners have been dating for two years . In the video featuring Eugenia and Corinna, both women recalled the attention-grabbing outfit Eugenia had worn on their first date. 'I think I was wearing the worst outfit that I could ever wear,' Eugenia admitted, later explaining. 'I wear like every possible item in my closet if I am really nervous.' Corinna noted: 'I wasn't sure about her when we first met because she was wearing these bright, shiny purple pants and three different shirts.' But during their first meeting, Eugenia said she started 'laughing really hard' and when she looked over, she noticed that Corinna was laughing too. 'I was like, ""Oh this absolutely perfect.""' she said. When asked how often they say 'I love you', Corinna explained that it often comes out 'in every day moments'. Eugenia added: 'I think its like an every day thing or at least before you go to bed you're like: ""Hey hun, I love you.""' After completing their separate interviews, the two women were reunited to watch what they had said about each other. No words: As a part of of the brand's Put Your Heart to Paper campaign, the two women were asked to express how they feel about each other - without using saying the word 'love' Moved to tears: After completing their separate interviews, Eugenia (left) and Corinna (right) were reunited to watch what they had said about each other . While Corinna said that Eugenia is 'inspiring' and 'brings optimism' to her life, Eugenia described her feelings for Corinna as 'warm fuzzies eating chocolate chip cookies all the time.' 'She means so many things to me,' Corinna said. 'She means being excited for the future and the right now.' After watching the heartwarming video, one online commenter wrote: 'Well done. Glad to see hallmark taking a brave stand for a wider scope of love in our many faceted society. Bravo!' Another added: 'This makes me so very happy and proud to be a Hallmark employee, who is also gay, and who has been pushing our idea of expanded love identities forward for a long time. My heart is bursting, my eyes are spilling. Thank you for sharing your story with us, and your love with each other.' Hallmark is the latest big-name company to feature a same-sex couple in its advertising. Earlier this month iconic jewelry giant Tiffany & Co. released its first ad starring two gay men who are also dating in real life. And last year, makers of Honey Maid graham crackers featured two gay dads and their children in its commercial celebrating all families. Breaking barriers: Earlier this month, Tiffany & Co. released its first ad starring two gay men as a part of its Will You? campaign . After receiving some backlash, the company released another commercial in which two artists printed out the negative comments and turned them into a piece of art that spells out 'Love'. Honey Maid noted in the ad that it had received 10 times more positives responses than negative ones. The movement towards inclusive advertising is nothing new. Major retailers, including J. Crew, Gap and Banana Republic have also used same-sex couples in advertising campaigns over the past couple of years. Although Hallmark has been making marriage cards for same-sex couples since 2008, this is the first time the brand has featured one in advertising. Despite its best intentions, the brand faced scrutiny in 2013 after it replaced the word 'gay' with 'fun' on an ornament featuring a popular lyric from the Christmas song 'Deck the Halls'. Hallmark later issued an apology, saying: 'We never intend to offend or make political statements with our products and in hindsight, we realize we shouldn't have changed the lyrics on the ornament.'","The greeting card company has debuted a video ad featuring a real-life lesbian couple as a part of its Put Your Heart to Paper campaign .

"A New York bus driver claims he didn't hear a woman's heartwrenching screams as she was crushed to death beneath his bus on Thursday evening. Horrified witnesses waved their hands yelling 'stop, stop, stop!' but the driver of the N6 Nassau Inter-County Express Bus turned the corner as though he saw and heard nothing. Witnesses say that both the driver of the bus and the woman, 42, had a green light, but that the driver didn't stop for her to walk . Horrific crash: A New York bus driver claims he didn't hear a woman's heartwrenching screams as she was crushed to death beneath this bus on Thursday evening . The bus in Jamaica, Queens was turning right onto Hillside Avenue from 165th St. in an intersection that allows both pedestrians to walk and cars to turn the corner at the same time. Those who observed the accident, both on the bus and on the street, were aghast and couldn't understand how the driver didn't notice the woman right in front of him. 'Oh my God!' cried the woman seconds before her death. 'I see the bus hit the lady and then the bus went 15 feet more,' said chauffeur Jose Valleo to The New York Daily News. A passenger on the bus was able to observe the accident even though the driver wasn't. 'Everyone (on the bus) was screaming ""Stop, stop, stop!"" and he didn't stop until after the fact,' said passenger Dwayne Gray. 'I don’t understand how he couldn’t see her, that’s unbelievable. He didn’t even realize he hit somebody until afterwards,' Gray continued. 'I heard her scream.' The woman was first rolled over by the front of the bus, barely missing the front tires. Witnesses say had the driver stopped at the point the woman might still be alive but when the bus was turning the back wheels hit her, killing her. 'She got lucky the first time and went between the front wheels, but when the bus was turning, the back wheels hit her,' said a 15-year-old witness Tanvir. Police say that the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver stayed at the scene of the crash and he was not immediately charged or ticketed. The bus also hit a vehicle, causing damage to the car, the FDNY told NBC. None of the passengers on the bus was injured.","A New York bus driver claims he didn't hear a woman's heartwrenching screams as she was crushed to death beneath his bus .

But the average person waits nearly two weeks before they see a health professional. The poll, by LloydsPharmacy found 30 per cent of respondents turn to their GP in the first instance if they have a health concern, 18 per cent rely on the internet and just six per cent would go to a pharmacy first. Five per cent of 25 - 34 year olds say they end up in A&E every couple of weeks. On average we wait 11 days to speak to a health professional about an upset stomach and five days for chest pains – including those with cardiovascular disease. But struggling on despite nasty symptoms could prove dangerous. The research found people with asthma wait nine days before seeking help for wheezing, even though this could be a symptom of an asthma attack.

"When she was invited to meet U.S President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle the naïve teenager had no understanding of the importance of such a meeting. But after getting a warm hug from the First Lady and making international headlines, Payal Jangid, 14, feels she is 'the luckiest girl in India'. Payal works tirelessly to support the right to education for young girls in India and dedicates her life to ending the practice of child marriage. Honored: Payal Jangid, 14, said she feels like she is 'the luckiest girl in India' after being hugged by MIchelle Obama during the First Lady's visit to India with her husband U.S President Barack Obama . Campaigner: Payal, along with 12 other activists aged between 10-14 years old, is very vocal about child rights and encourages parents in her village to send their children to school . Young peacemaker: Mrs Obama hugs the children's rights activist, right, while Mr Obama talks with Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi . She was chosen out of many young girls in India to meet the Obamas during their three-day visit to India this week. The First Lady hugged Payal while her husband met with Nobel Peace Prize winner and anti-child labor activist Kailash Satyarthi. Payal, from Virat Nagar, on the outskirts of Jaipur, in the western state of Rajasthan, is a leader of the child parliament in her village, and admits she did not know who Michelle Obama was until she met her. She said: 'She was lovely and after she hugged me people started asking me how I felt. I kept asking people why are people so interested and only then did I come to know how popular Michelle is.' She added: 'I was surprised when she hugged me as most famous personalities do not even talk to poor people like me. 'She even took out a ring and handed it to me but I politely refused to take it as my parents have taught me to not take gifts. I was already in awe of her and didn't know how to react in that moment. 'She praised me for my work and that was the biggest present. I had tears in my eyes. 'She told me her younger daughter is my age and that she would bring her to meet me when she visits India next.' Payal, along with 12 other activists aged between 10-14 years old, is very vocal about child rights and encourages parents in her village to send their children to school.

Leaving on a jet plane: President Obama and the First Lady  gesture as they board Air Force One prior to departing from New Delhi on Tuesday . She said: 'In our society education is not given much importance but it is my duty to explain to the older generation how schooling is very much needed. 'We formed this council comprising of children to speak about the problems faced by our peers and why we need school. I think that's why I was chosen to meet the Obamas because I'm trying to improve my community.' In 2013, Payal was chosen from a dozen candidates in her class to lead the children council. She said: 'We organize meetings and discuss various issues like lack of separate toilets for girls in schools and the need to stop child marriage and let children be children. 'We go from door to door and explain to parents the importance of education. We also tell them not to beat their children and respect their emotions. If parents are loving and caring, children will have a better environment to grow. We aim to make our village 'child friendly'.' Payal, whose father works as a carpenter, is in a government-run school and dreams of becoming a teacher so that she can 'give education to underprivileged children when I am older'. She said: 'I want to make most of this opportunity and aim to become a teacher so that I can give education to underprivileged children when I am older.' Payal who has two sisters and one brother, has been working with Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood) since 2012. It's an India-based movement campaigning for the rights of children started in 1980 by Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi.

"After hundreds of battered Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porches rolled off the stricken cargo ship the sole £260,000 Rolls Royce on board emerged without a scratch. The Hoegh Osaka was bound for Bremerhaven in Germany with 1,400 luxury cars on January 3, when it was deliberately grounded on Bramble Bank in the Solent to stop it capsizing. Its cargo arrived back into Southampton Port with 'limited damage', but the ship owners says it is unable to confirm the future of the vehicles after fears were raised that the entire fleet would need to be scrapped. Scroll down for video . Unscathed: The single Rolls Royce Wraith, worth £260,000 emerged from the Hoegh Osaka in pristine condition after the ship began to list . Lined up: Row upon row of expensive cars, which have been taken off the stricken ship, wait in the dock's yard to be assessed by engineers . More than two weeks after the Singapore-registered vessel was stranded off the Hampshire coast, ship owners Hoegh Autoliners began the work of unloading the goods, which included 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, 65 Mini cars and 105 pieces of JCB construction equipment. And surprisingly, among the dented doors and scratched paintwork sat a single Rolls Royce Wraith, destined for private owners believed to be in the Middle East - the final destination for the ship, which arrived in pristine condition. The incident happened after an excavator on one of the decks had shifted, punching a hole in the hull and causing 3,000 tonnes of water to flood some of the car decks - leaving a some of the vehicles under water. The ship, which has 12 decks, was just a third full when it left the English coast and was expected to pick up more cargo when it arrived at the German port, before heading to its final destination in the Middle East. The Hoegh Osaka was bound for Bremerhaven in Germany with 1,400 luxury cars on January 3 . Rescued: A Range Rover covered in plastic is taken off the Hoegh Osaka by a fork lift truck, after the ship ran aground 45 minutes off the coast . Damaged: Another plastic-covered Range Rover is driven off the Singapore-registered vehicle into Southampton's Docks where it waits for assessment . Ruined: A loader transports other seriously damaged vehicles - some of which had been submerged in water - off the ill-fated vessel . A spokesman for the ship owners said the Osaka had come from India to the UK and that 'the majority of the cargo was headed for the Far and Middle East' where it was likely to go on to a range of dealers and some private owners. He said: 'These ships are used for transporting very big equipment and we are chartered with transporting the cargo. Höegh Autoliners has no right to decide on the future of the cargo. 'We need our ship back so that we can fix it and that;s going to happen in Southampton. We are going through the process of removing the cargo, which needs to go and be reviewed and engineers are looking at a variety of cars and equipment which has already been offloaded. 'It presents a logistical issue for the owners of the cars about what to do next.' He added that the discharge operation is expected to continue into next week. Concerns over the fleets future were raised after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 Mazdas. The cars were sent to the crusher after transporter MV Cougar Ace partially capsized in the North Pacific while carrying the cars away from the factory. Battered: A Mini Cooper with a dented door is driver from the ship. It is one of 65 Minis that were on board at the time the ship started to list . Wrecked: The ship's owners said there was 'limited damage' to most of the 1,400 luxury vehicles, however, plenty rolled off with doors missing . It was left resting for just over three weeks - a similar length of time to the Hoegh Osaka - at an angle of 60 degrees. Initially a Mazda spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash, either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles, but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed. Engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars, especially on the electrolyte in the batteries. Rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults, the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot. Untouched: Among the dented Jaguars and Porsche emerged a perfectly preserved armoured personnel carrier (pictured) Sturdy: The massive tank was among hundreds of heavy equipment on board including 105 pieces of construction equipment . The Osaka was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees, a similar angle to the Cougar Ace, just after leaving Southampton port. If it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds. High winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the Osaka as it was being towed. It is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by 'a variety of parties' - including dealers and private owners. Cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship. The 25 person crew had to be rescued by RNLI lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident. The cargo ship, which is 180 metres long and 32 metres wide, finally arrived back in Southampton on January 22. A spokeswoman from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) confirmed they were investigating what had caused the large vessel to list so dramatically. January 3, 8.30pm - The Hoegh Osaka, a Singapore-registered ship, left the port of Southampton  bound for Bremerhaven in Germany.The 180 metre long ship was bound for Germany, and loaded with 1,400 cars including Land Rovers, Jaguars and a £260,000 Rolls Royce. January 3, 9.20pm - About 45 minutes after it left the port the 15 year old ship started to list badly at 52 degrees. It was deliberately grounded by the crew, near the Isle of Wight in Hampshire, to prevent it capsizing. A rescue operation was then launched to rescue the captain and 25 crew members. It is understood the cargo ship, which has a nine-metre draught, turned sharply to the left as it passed the notorious Bramble Bank sandbank near Cowes and ran aground. Following the incident a 200 metre exclusion zone was set up around the ship, to prevent other vessels interfering with the tugs. January 5 - Salvage experts unsuccessfully tried to re-float the huge ship by using four tugs to pull it off the sandbank. The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately grounded in the Solent, around 20 minutes into its journey, after it started listing at 52 degrees . January 7 - The ship was floated from Bramble Bank on the high tide and tugs were used to tow it to Alpha Anchorage near Lee-on-the-Solent. January 10 - One of the tugs crashed into the ship during a period of high winds.An excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull, which was quickly repaired. But some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel. January 17 - The 3,000 tonnes of water was pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board. January 22 - Salvage firm Svitzer was able to complete ballast management and reduce the ship's list to five degrees. It was then towed to Southampton Docks by four tugs.During its journey, an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place, set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side. Airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution. Hundreds of people gathered at Southampton Water to watch the ship complete its three hour journey back to the port. January 27 - luxury cars, including Range Rovers and a Porsche, started to be driven off the ship.","The Hoegh Osaka was bound for Germany with 1,400 luxury cars on board when it started list at 45 degrees .

"Two brothers who laughed as they threw chilli powder in women's faces before stealing their mobile phones have been jailed. Kashif Ashraf, 34, and Khalid Ahraf, 28, targeted lone victims walking through Birmingham city centre between June 21 and July 6 last year. Birmingham Crown Court heard how one of the pair would grab the phone while the other rubbed chilli powder in the victim's eyes leaving them in agony. Kashif Ashraf, left, and Khalid Ashraf, right, who have been jailed after throwing chilli powder in women's faces before stealing their mobile phones . On one occasion they even laughed at the pain they had inflicted on one victim after she was left temporarily blinded. Now the pair of Smethwick in the West Midlands have been jailed for a total of 13 years after Kashif was sentenced to six years and Khalid to seven years after they were both found guilty of robbery following a trial. The court heard how the first robbery took place on June 21 in an underpass at around 6.45pm as a 23-year-old woman was walking home. Her phone was grabbed from her and as she screamed for help, they knocked her glasses off and rubbed chilli powder into her eyes. Nine days later at 12.40pm, the pair robbed an 18-year-old woman who was on her phone outside Birmingham's Marriott Hotel. Again, one of the brothers grabbed the phone while the other rubbed chilli powder in her face. The third robbery was later the same day at 5.30pm, when they targeted a 30-year-old woman sat on seating near to Morrison's Supermarket on Hagley Road. When the woman refused to let go of her phone, they scratched her hand to release her grip. The brazen pair were eventually caught minutes after their last robbery on July 6 at 8.45pm by the Bullring Shopping Centre. The pair were jailed for a total of 12 years at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, after the court heard how one of the pair would grab the phone while the other rubbed chilli powder in the vicitm's eyes leaving them in agony . They snatched a phone from a 39-year-old woman and as they ran off one of the brothers turned round and laughed at her. A passing member of the public, who had seen the robbery, chased the pair and also managed to flag down a passing police car who were then able to arrest them and recover the phone. At the time of the four robberies, Kashif Ashraf was already on bail in connection with an attempted robbery on a lone woman. He was found guilty of that offence in September last year. During a preliminary hearing, Kashif pleaded guilty to the July 6 robbery but maintained his innocence to the other three throughout the trial. After the case, Detective Constable Jamie Simon, from West Midlands Police, said: 'On each occasion, the brothers targeted women who were on their own. 'They saw them using their phones and then lay in wait to attack them at an opportune moment. 'Three of the women were physically hurt during their ordeal particularly when the substance believed to be chilli powder was used. 'We believe this was a deliberate attempt by the brothers to try and mask their identity. 'Both cynically elected a trial, even though they both knew the weight of the evidence was against them. 'Neither showed any remorse throughout the trial or gave any thought to their victims who were all clearly left upset and traumatised. 'In summing up the trial, the judge described it as a short campaign of terror, targeted against vulnerable females, which was clearly planned and aggravated by the fact that chilli pepper was used as a weapon during two of the robberies.'","Kashif and Khalid Ashraf targeted their victims in Birmingham city centre .

"It may look like a Photoshop effort, but Rami the dog really does have the head of a pit bull and the body of a dachshund. And now photos of the rare combination dog, who's looking for a new home, have been shared widely by Internet users proclaiming his cuteness - though some say he looks more like an alien or a dinosaur. The Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society in Georgia is currently accepting applications for Rami, whose adoption post has gone viral. Scroll down for video . Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society in Georgia is accepting applications for Rami, a pit bull-dachshund mix . The posts advertising Rami have received more than 40,000 shares on Facebook since his photos went viral on Tuesday . Rami's unique pit bull head has led him to be compared to a Tyrannosaurus Rex or bobblehead doll. His body is long, but his legs are more muscular like those of a pit bull. The dog breeding website Designer Mixes says that the combination of pit bulls and dachshunds is called a Doxbull or a Pitwee and can weigh about 25lbs when fully grown. The Humane Society says that Rami is 'full of energy' and doesn't 'listen very well, so you'll need to take some time to train me. Because I tend to be a bit hyper'. Rami's ears have also been cut for an unknown reason. Potential owners will need to go through an interview process and pay for the canine's vaccinations before taking him home. Internet users have left more than 9,000 comments on the photos and videos showing Rami, though they remain divided as to whether the dog is adorable or strange-looking . Photos and videos of the dog have been shared more than 40,000 times and generated more than 9,000 comments since Tuesday, most of which say that Rami is adorable. Some commenters were unconvinced and thought that the pictures were doctored or that the animal was not a mix but actually has canine dwarfism, a condition that affects dogs' growth and spines. Others were not impressed by the dog's unique appearance, saying Rami is 'freaky looking'. Fears remain that the overwhelming interest in Rami will lead breeders to try and manufacture more unnatural designer mixes, which often have health problems. For those that may be disappointed by missing out on adopting Rami, the Moultrie Colquitt County Humane Society says there are many more unique animals at shelters across the country.","Pitbull-dachsund mix Rami has been put up for adoption by dog home .

"A mysterious fire has gutted the $90 million mansion built by five-and-dime creator F W Woolworth. One of the East Coast's most elaborate estates, the marble-pillared abode was constructed in 1916 - after the family's first property was mysteriously burned down. Ever since, it has been plagued by rumors of paranormal activity as people claim to hear the cries of Woolworth's daughter, who committed suicide in 1917, from the forever-locked Marie Antoinette room. On Wednesday, flames ripped through the 16-acre Glen Cove estate, leaving the current owners with millions of dollars worth of damage. Scroll down for video . Burned down: The blaze erupted on Wednesday at the mansion on Long Island built by five-and-dime store founder F.W. Woolworth . Former glory: This is what the 16-acre Glen Cove estate looked like before flames spread through a wing of the 1916 structure . The blaze erupted shortly before 11am in a first-floor bedroom, officials said. Flames quickly spread through a wing of the 25,000-square-foot 1916 structure while the owners were out. One firefighter was hospitalized suffering from carbon monoxide-related side effects after 150 officers from 10 different departments responded to the call.

"A man was today challenging his placement on a government no-fly list in the Supreme Court - hours after his older brother was placed on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. A federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia on Friday heard the case of Gulet Mohamed who has been fighting his place on the no-fly list since 2011. The judge expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of the government's no-fly list. Travel ban: Gulet Mohamed, (pictured left in August 2013), leaves the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, with his attorney, Gadeir Abbas, from the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Mr Mohamed was back in court today to challenge his placement on the government's no fly list . Government lawyers defended the list at a hearing and have been trying to get the suit tossed out for the last four years. However at court on Friday, Judge Anthony Trenga again questioned the lack of a meaningful opportunity for people to challenge their status. On the eve of Friday's hearing, the FBI added Gulet Mohamed's older brother Liban  to its list of most wanted terrorists, accusing him of being a recruiter for al-Shabaab. Gulet Mohamed's lawyer said the announcement was timed to pressure the judge. On Thursday, the FBI added Liban Haji Mohamed, a former taxi driver from northern Virginia to its list of most-wanted terrorists. The bureau has claimed that he was a recruiter for the al-Shabab terrorist organization in Somalia. An arrest warrant, originally issued in February, was unsealed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria for the 29-year-old, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Somalia. For the past four years, his younger brother Gulet has been challenging his placement on the government's no-fly list, his attorney, Gadeir Abbas, said this week. The FBI on Thursday added  Liban Haji Mohamed (pictured) to the most wanted terrorists' list. His younger brother's case was being heard in Supreme Court on Friday after he claimed he was unconstitutionally placed on a no-fly list . Mr Abbas said Liban Mohamed aggressively advocated on his younger brother's behalf when Gulet Mohamed was detained in Kuwait several years ago and barred from returning to the U.S., and that the FBI began to harass him as a result. He said his family suspects he went into hiding to avoid the harassment. 'Al-Shabab has killed Liban's uncle and imprisoned his cousins,' Mr Abbas said. 'His family believes the allegations have no basis in fact.' FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Ram said in an email late Thursday that the FBI had no comment on Abbas' allegations. Liban Mohamed is charged with providing material support to al-Qaida and al-Shabab. Additional court records detailing the charges against him in federal court remained under seal Thursday. He is now one of 31 people on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. The FBI believes Liban Mohamed left the U.S. in July 2012 for east Africa. He lived in the Alexandria area of Fairfax County prior to that, working as a taxi driver. The FBI says he is a key target because his knowledge of the nation's capital could help al-Shabab plot an attack here. 'It is important for us to locate Mohamed because he has knowledge of the Washington, D.C., area's infrastructure such as shopping areas, Metro, airports, and government buildings,' said Carl Ghattas, special agent in charge of the Counterterrorism Division at the FBI's Washington Field Office. 'This makes him an asset to his terrorist associates who might plot attacks on U.S. soil.' The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Liban Mohamed's arrest and conviction. Abbas said the timing of the FBI's announcement is an attempt to influence a judge to toss out a lawsuit that Gulet Mohamed filed against the government challenging his placement on the no-fly list. The government is seeking to have the case tossed out, in part because it says it would be forced to divulge state secrets if forced to defend the lawsuit. 'We would question the timing of the FBI's placement of Liban on the most-wanted list on the day before a major hearing on the government's authority to maintain the no-fly list,' Abbas said in a telephone interview. Gulet Mohamed, an Alexandria resident and also naturalized U.S. citizen, was 19 when he was detained by Kuwaiti authorities in 2011. He has said that he was beaten and interrogated at the behest of the U.S. and denied the right to fly home. U.S. authorities allowed Mohamed to fly home after he filed a federal lawsuit, but Mohamed says he remains on the list without justification. Abbas said Liban Mohamed aggressively advocated on his brother's behalf to get him home, and in return the FBI subjected him to harassment. 'He was constantly being approached by people of dubious backgrounds that bore the hallmark of FBI informants,' Abbas said. 'The family believes Liban may have sought to escape that scrutiny.' Abbas said that in 2012, the Mohamed family lost contact with Liban Mohamed and asked the lawyer to see if the FBI knew of his whereabouts. The U.S. has long refused to even confirm whether Gulet Mohamed is on the no-fly list. Gulet Mohamed said he went to Somalia and Yemen briefly in 2009 to stay with family and learn Arabic, and investigators questioned him about his travels. The FBI, in announcing Liban Mohamed's placement on the most-wanted list, described him as a 'close associate' of Zachary Chesser, a northern Virginia man who in 2011 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for trying to join al-Shabaab and for making online threats against the creators of the 'South Park' cartoon for an episode perceived as an insult to the prophet Muhammad.

"A group of pranksters made a homemade 'ejector seat' with an airbag and videoed their friend being blow up on it - leaving him with a fractured spine. The men, from Haverhill, in Suffolk, uploaded the video on to YouTube, Facebook and LiveLeak yesterday and it has already received more than 10,000 views. The video shows Hari Farlie, 19, sitting on two tyres with an unreleased airbag in between them, which is attached by a wire to a nearby car engine. Scroll down for video . The video shows Hari Farlie sitting on two tyres with an unreleased airbag in between them . Hari Farlie ended up in hospital (pictured) with two fractures to his spine after the prank went wrong . When one of the pranksters triggers the airbag, causing it to suddenly inflate, the teenager is violently thrown into the air and lands in a nearby bush. As his friends laugh uproariously the youngster groans and holds his lower back. The video then shows the now deflated airbag and tyres several feet away from where Hari is lying. As the young man groans and writhes in agony the video shows his friends continue to laugh. The airbag is attached by a wire to a nearby car engine - when it is inflated he is thrown violently in the air . Hari and the airbag and tyres part company in this action shot which shows him falling towards the bushes . Hari luckily lands in the bushes on the side of the pavement rather than the busy road to his left . Kyle Lyons, 24, from Haverhill in Suffolk, posted the video on Facebook, and said that Hari suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra in the incident. Mr Falrie was taken to hospital and a subsequent picture shows him lying on his side in hospital sucking  on gas and air. Mr Lyon posted on YouTube last night that Hari fractured his spine in two places and will have to wear a back brace for the next three months, but added that he is now home from hospital. He said: ‘We asked him if he wanted to do it and he said he was up for it.’ He said they had the idea after helping a friend remove the airbags from his van and they created the contraption with the tyres, airbags, some wood, a couple of bricks and some jump leads. Mr Lyon added they did not think Hari would have been seriously hurt in the incident. He said: ‘We thought he would have bruised his coccyx, we didn’t expect him to break his back! ‘He said afterwards it would have been funnier if he had been standing up. ‘We do normally prank him – last week we put 200mg of Viagra in his cup of tea. Hari Farlie, 19, (pictured left) was hurt in the prank, which was videoed by Kyle Lyons, 24, (right) As his friends laugh uproariously, the video shows Hari groaning groans and holding his lower back . ‘He didn’t realise until he got to the pub, he had to go to the toilet sitting down. ‘I don’t think he thought it was going to hurt as much. He couldn’t walk after it happened, he lay in the bush for about half an hour. ‘In the end we picked him up and took him to the hospital in my mate’s van. ‘He got back home yesterday, he only stayed in overnight. He seems to be doing alright, hes got crutches and a back brace. ‘We never thought it would go viral, just thought it would be a little prank. ‘He wanted to do it but I don’t think he knew what it would entail. He didn’t think it was going to hurt – he’s not the brightest one. ‘He’s sort of a guinea pig – we were going to paint him like a crash test dummy but we didn’t have time. ‘But he’s alright, it could have been worse. He could have been paralysed apparently. ‘We won’t be doing any more pranks for a few months.’ Hari suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra in the incident and will have to wear a back brace for three months .

"A schoolboy described as 'a model pupil' was barred lessons after shaving his head to raise money for Macmillan Cancer charity because his school says he has set a bad example. Year nine pupil Stan Lock, 13, from Wrington, Somerset, decided to lose his thick brown hair after a number of friends and family were struck down by the disease. The model pupil had the trim on Sunday after setting up a donation page for Macmillan Cancer care - with some teachers from Churchill Academy at North Somerset giving him money. Year nine pupil Stan Lock has been banned from classes after he decided to shave his hair for charity after a number of friends and family were struck down by the disease. He is pictured before and after (above) But he was devastated when he went to school the next day and was told his number zero hairstyle was against the rules. He is banned from attending lessons and spends all day inside an individual booth, including lunch and break times. Staff  have said he must stay in exclusion until his hair had grown back to at least a number two - which could take weeks. His mother, Mel Rees, 47, said she was extremely proud of her son's decision to shave his head  and helped to set up a JustGiving page. But now she says she is furious at the school's decision. She said: 'When he came home on the Monday evening he said he was really worried that he was in serious trouble over the cut. Stan having his head shaved (pictured) - he has now been forced into isolation at his school for the short cut . 'The next day he ended up in isolation and was told that he would have to stay there until his hair grew back to at least a number two. 'I've tried speaking to the headteacher but he says if he lets one student off with it the other 1,400 might follow. It's madness. 'On Tuesday Stan was saying that he almost regretted do it, which is such a shame. Luckily now he's had so much support he's enjoying it and he realises that what he has done for charity is a great thing. 'He's a model pupil, he's on track to do really well, it's not as if he's a troublemaker or a little rebel trying to stick two fingers up at the school.' Stan hoped to raise just £100 from the head shave but has now raised more than £1,200 as news of the school's reaction has spread. Stan said he is 'upset and disappointed' that he is being punished for trying to do a good deed . Friends have rallied around and set up a Facebook page calling for his release, a petition and have even started posting #freestan on posters around the school. Stan said: 'I decided to shave my head because cancer is horrible and people I know have been affected by it, so I decided to do something to help. 'On Monday teachers were supportive and one even donated. But in my last lesson my PE teachers were concerned and took photos to send to the head of house. 'The next day my tutor was told that I had to go to isolation. I tried to explain that it was for charity. 'I am very upset and disappointed as I am being punished for doing charity fund raising. 'I have had my break and lunch time taken away to be sat behind a computer screen in a small box like room. 'I am starting to regret shaving my head because the days feel like weeks, it feels like a prison.' The uniform policy at the school - rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted - states: 'Very short hair or hair with designs cut in will be considered 'extreme'. 'Children who have extreme hairstyles will be isolated.' Stan says some teachers from Churchill Academy (pictured) even donated money to his charity page on JustGiving before he was told his hairstyle was against uniform rules and barred from the classroom . Headteacher Dr Barry Wratten said: ‘I do not favour speaking publicly about individual students or their families and will not do so now. 'Churchill Academy and Sixth Form have held a firm line against those who decide to flout our behaviour policies for many years - it is only by doing this can we uphold our standards and make sure we are fair to all. 'This incident isn’t the first and won’t be the last of this nature. 'In the past parents have approached us about stunts to raise money for charity and we have been able to advise and work with them to avoid any difficulty. 'At times, some parents do not do this and do not advise their children of potential problems. 'Isolation is one of the consequences for students that break our behaviour policies. 'My stance is to review when someone is able to take their place again in the mainstream of our learning community – this I will do in these circumstances and this will be based on discussions with the student. 'Speaking generally, there are many ways to raise money for charity - most we will support; rushing into a particular way without thought is always likely to cause consequences. 'Some people wish to avoid consequences by blaming others - I think this sends a poor message to young people. ' I have consistently held this stance and parents, generally, know we set high standards. That's why we expect them to have a dialogue with us before they allow their child to do something they may regret.' Stan's fundraising increased ten-fold within an hour of his story becoming public today and by 3pm his fundraising has soared to almost 40 times his original target, reaching £3,823.19, with donations still flooding in. The teenager was hoping to raise a modest £100 from his head shave. He was also swamped by messages from well-wishers who supported his decision to shave his head and criticised the school for putting him in isolation. One wrote: 'Just read about your exclusion from school and wanted to say that you're a very inspirational young man and stay strong in your beliefs as you go through life Stan. Take care x' Another added: 'Well done young Sir Stan - very courageous and admirable with a big heart. 'Your school teacher can learn to grow up following your example. Do not be bullied into not following your heart by anyone.' Anyone wishing to donate to Stan's cause should visit his JustGiving page. Last January pupils staged a protest at a Redcar Academy in North Yorkshire amid claims a teenager who shaved her head to raise money for charity after her best friend died of cancer was banned from lessons. Mia Flood, then 14, was devastated when friend Georgina Anderson, 15, died after a battle with cancer. She promised her friend before she died that she would shave her head and donate the hair to the Little Princesses Trust - a charity which makes wigs for other young cancer patients. She planned to donate money raised from the charity head shave to the Teenage Cancer Trust, as a thank you for helping Georgina's family throughout her ordeal. Mia's mother ordered a wig but until it arrived her daughter was forced to be schooled at home. A statement released by the academy and Mia's family said that it had been agreed that arrangements for Mia's education would be made if she went ahead with the shave. In July 2013 MailOnline reported three 12-year-olds who raised £800 for Cancer Research UK by each shaving half their hair off were taken out of classes and allegedly told 'it's pathetic way to raise money'. Kiera Thomas, Gemma Wright and Macey Daden decided to adopt the unusual hairstyles, with the breast cancer ribbon shaved onto the side of their heads, in order to battle cancer after losing loved ones to the disease. They raised £800 for Cancer Research UK, with some of their teachers at St Leonards Academy in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex, among the generous donors who sponsored the girls. However, they were hauled before the head of Year Seven and told off for their appearance, while Kiera was put in isolation from her classmates because of her haircut. Jenny Jones, principal of St Leonards Academy, said: 'While we applaud these girls for their efforts in raising money for charity, we have rules and regulations regarding dress and appearance which apply to all our students.' In April last year 15-year-old Jess Vine, from the Isle of Wight, cut her long hair, which came to below her waist, to fundraise for Cancer Research UK after her grandfather lost his battle with the illness last year. But she was then told by her school, Ryde Academy, she could not attend classes unless she wore a wig. Ryde Academy confirmed Jess had to wear the wig as part of uniform policy.","Stan Lock, 13, decided to shave his head to raise money for cancer charity .

"A mother addicted to alcohol while pregnant says she feels guilty every single day for the damage she has caused her daughter. Linda McFadden, 49, drank eight cans of lager a day while carrying daughter Claire - and says she was powerless to stop. As a result, Claire, who weighed just 2lb when she was born, has endured a lifetime of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which has caused her both mental and physical difficulties. The condition occurs when an unborn baby is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to a high blood alcohol concentration. Scroll down for video . Addiction: Linda McFadden, 49, drank eight cans of lager a day while carrying daughter Claire - and says she was powerless to stop . Damaged: As a result of her mother's drinking, Claire, who weighed just 2lb when she was born, has endured a lifetime of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome . That limits the growth of white matter in the baby's brain, potentially causing learning difficulties. Signs that a baby is suffering from the syndrome include small and narrow eyes, a small head, a smooth area between the nose and the lips and a thin upper lip. Claire, now 20, has also been left with facial deformities and learning disabilities due to her mother's behaviour while pregnant. Speaking on ITV'S This Morning, Mrs McFadden, who has now been dry for 14 years, said:  'I knew it was my fault and I will always feel guilty. 'I was an addict - I couldn't control it - I needed a drink to get me through the day.' Despite drinking while pregnant with her first child, Sarah, Mrs McFadden admits her alcohol consumption was heavier when she was carrying Claire. She told the show's hosts, Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'I must have been aware that alcohol wasn't good while you are pregnant, but I didn't know what damage it could cause.' She admits she developed tricks to mask her heavy drinking from friends, family and her husband, David. 'If anyone came to see me, I had a spot in the kitchen where I'd hide the can. There were cans of lager hidden around everywhere. I'm sure people knew.' Foetal alcohol syndrome occurs where an unborn baby is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to a high blood alcohol concentration. That limits the growth of white matter in the baby's brain, potentially causing learning difficulties. A lack of oxygen between weeks six and nine of pregnancy can also cause facial deformities while the baby's features form, while drinking in the first three months can cause organ damage. Signs that a baby is suffering from the syndrome include small and narrow eyes, a small head, a smooth area between the nose and the lips and a thin upper lip. Babies diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) are also known to suffer birth defects. These include a smaller head circumference, heart problems, limb damage, kidney damage, damage to the brain, eye problems, hearing problems and specific facial characteristics. They are also prone to suffering learning difficulties, memory problems, hyperactivity and poor problem-solving skills. She believes the problem began as early as 17, when she started going to the pub - and really enjoyed the way drinking made her feel. And moving out of home gave her the opportunity to drink whenever she liked. 'I was drinking eight cans of lager a day, which is around 100 units a week, and maintained that for more than 15 years, but never considered myself an alcoholic,' she told The Sun newspaper. 'It was tough juggling a newborn and drinking, but the stress of trying to cut back would've been impossible.' 'I'd wake up and feel so nauseous I'd vomit, then crack open a beer at 8am.' Mrs McFadden's heavy drinking meant Claire was born two months early and weighing less than 2lb. She was given less than a 50 per cent chance of survival after being delivered by emergency Caesearean section because she had stopped moving. Her mother admits she broke down with the shame of what she had done to her baby daughter. 'Of course I blamed myself - I came home crying as deep down, I knew it was my fault. 'But we couldn't do anything about it - we had to live with it. I have carried the guilt for years. ' Suffering: Today, Claire works as a PA, but says her school years were a nightmare - mainly because there was so little awareness about Foetal Alcohol Syndrome . Indeed, her drinking has left Claire with a lifetime legacy of physical and learning issues. It took nine months for her to reach the weight of a newborn, and she didn't walk until she was two or speak until she was three. Today, Claire works as a PA, but says her school years were a nightmare - mainly because there was so little awareness about Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. 'No one really knew anything about it - people just treated me differently and didn't take into account I had this condition,' she told Ruth and Eamonn. 'I was really shy, I wouldn't - and couldn't socialise - and my memory wasn't good.' For her mother, every day was a reminder of the terrible damage she had caused - something which affected the pair's relationship for a long time. 'When Mum first told me about the alcohol, I was very angry - I did blame her a lot, all the time,' Claire told This Morning. 'But as I've got older, I completely understand - I can't blame her.' Commenting on the issue, This Morning's Dr Dawn Harper urged other pregnant women with alcohol problems not to suffer in silence. She said: 'Don't be ashamed - admitting you have a problem is the brave thing to do.' Honest: Speaking on ITV'S This Morning, Mrs McFadden, who has now been dry for 14 years, said: 'I knew it was my fault and I will always guilty. 'I was an addict - I couldn't control it' The number of babies being born with foetal alcohol syndrome caused by mothers drinking while pregnant has increased by almost 40 per cent in the last three years. Between 2012 and 2013 doctors treated 252 cases of the syndrome, which can cause learning difficulties, organ damage and facial deformity, in England alone. Susan Fleisher, chief executive of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, said recently: 'There have been studies in Italy and the US that say that between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of the population is affected by this. 'And, remember, Britain is the number one binge-drinking country in Europe. The chances are we are closer to 5 per cent, although we can't say that for sure because it is under-diagnosed and difficult to diagnose.' And earlier month, an MP said women should not drink any alcohol while they are pregnant because of the risks to their unborn child. Bill Esterson wants it to be made compulsory for all alcoholic beverages to carry compulsory warning labels directed at expectant mothers. Presenting his Alcohol Labeling (Pregnancy) Bill, the Labour MP for Sefton Central on Merseyside told MPs that 7,000 children a year were born in the UK damaged by alcohol, equating to one in every 100 births. He said: 'Mild brain damage can be caused to children by even small amounts of alcohol at the wrong time during pregnancy, especially in the early stages when an embryo does not have the protection of a blood stream. 'Much scientific evidence suggests that there is no safe limit when it comes to drinking in pregnancy but sadly not everyone is aware of the dangers.'","Linda McFadden, 49, drank heavily while carrying daughter Claire, now 20 .

"Fashion label Marc Jacobs has launched a new collection of S&M-style accessories, including a studded whip, leather handcuffs and a collar and leash. The collection, which is a collaboration with New York-based leather brand Zana Bayne, was launched online and in select stores earlier this week, with prices ranging from $65, for a pair of leather nipple pasties, to $240 for the heart-shaped riding crop. No doubt inspired by the upcoming big screen adaptation of best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, the collection is described as the ideal 'cheeky and sexy' gift for your loved one this Valentine's Day. Scroll down for video . Giddy up: The collection's most expensive piece is this $240 riding crop . Something for everyone: For those with a slightly smaller budget, this mini whip key chain could be the perfect gift option this Valentine's Day . I want it all: Thus far the collection has received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media, with many praising the designer's decision to take on such a risque project . Close your eyes... The collection appears to be inspired by the upcoming big screen adaptation of erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, however it is not officially connected with the movie . And despite the somewhat saucy nature of the pieces, designer Zana Bayne insists that they can - and should - be shown off outside of the bedroom. 'The best thing about the collaboration is that they are pieces that you can display and show off,' she told Vogue. 'They make for great conversation starters, and are perfect to wear to a party or a masquerade. 'Not to mention, they are definitely wicked little gifts.' Ms Bayne added that the leather collar and cuff could absolutely be worn as accessories in their own right - although she suggested that the wearer might want to remove the chain-metal leash which normally connects the two. No peeking: Marc Jacobs' collaboration with leather brand Zana Bayne also includes this $150 studded mask, which is available in black and red . For the bedroom - and beyond: Designer Zana Bayne believes that this $200 collar and cuff set could be worn as an everyday fashion accessory, while the key ring is one of the cheaper options from the collection . Valentine's Day gifts: The collection has been described as the perfect 'cheeky and sexy' gift to give your loved ones for the romantic holiday . All about the illusion: The collection's $65 leather pasties are intended to make it appear as though the wearer has had their nipples pierced . And to give the other-wise risque gifts an added dash of romance, each of the accessories come packaged in a more traditional red heart-shaped box, making them the perfect present to hand over to a loved one, no matter what holiday you are celebrating. Thus far the collection has had an incredibly positive response on social media, with many suggesting the kinky accessories will be going straight to the top of their Valentine's Day wish lists. 'The Zana Bayne Marc Jacobs collab is literatlly everything I ever wanted!' one fashion fan tweeted, while another added: 'Wow wow wow, god do I want this [collection].' Perhaps surprisingly, some Twitter users went as far as to suggest that the collection is disappointingly 'vanilla' for their tastes, insisting that the brands should have taken their collaboration a step further in terms of the risque element. Seductive: The hotly-anticipated big screen adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey stars actress Dakota Johnson (pictured) as Anastasia Steele . Romance: Ms Johnson stars alongside British actor Jamie Dornan (pictured together), who takes on the role of Christian Grey . 'Can we discuss the vanilla b******t that is the Marc Jacobs/Zana Bayne collaboration. DO BETTER,' one incensed fan commented. A second described the collection as 'interesting' but added that the designers 'could have done better' when it came to the accessories' shock factor. While Marc Jacobs' kinky collaboration does not appear to be officially affiliated with the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie, a number of official merchandise collections have already been launched in anticipation of the big screen release. Earlier this week, UK-based lingerie company Bluebella announced the launch of its Black Label collection, a selection of seductive underwear which was inspired by the upcoming movie release and has even been given the seal of approval by Fifty Shades author EL James. The collection features lingerie which appears to cage and harness the wearer and was described by Ms James as 'luxurious, provocative and elegantly erotic'.","The designer has collaborated with New York-based leather brand Zana Bayne on the collection .

"Scientists have identified a biological clock that could help predict a person's lifespan. Researchers studied chemical changes to DNA to establish an individual's biological age which they compared with their actual age. They found that people  whose biological age was greater than their true age were more likely to die sooner than those whose biological and actual ages were the same. People whose biological age was greater than their true age were more likely to die sooner than those whose biological and actual ages were the same, a study found . Four independent studies tracked the lives of almost 5,000 older people for up to 14 years. Each person's biological age was measured from a blood sample at the outset, and participants were followed up throughout the study. Four independent studies tracked the lives of almost 5,000 older people for up to 14 years. Each person's biological age was measured from a blood sample at the outset and participants were followed up throughout the study. Researchers found that the link between having a faster-running biological clock and early death held true even after accounting for other factors such as smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The study's principal investigator, Professor Ian Deary, from the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, said: 'This new research increases our understanding of longevity and healthy ageing. 'It is exciting as it has identified a novel indicator of ageing, which improves the prediction of lifespan over and above the contribution of factors such as smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.' The study involved scientists from the University of Edinburgh in collaboration with researchers in Australia and the US. They measured each person's biological age by studying a chemical modification to DNA, known as methylation. The modification does not alter the DNA sequence but plays an important role in biological processes and can influence how genes are turned off and on. Methylation changes can affect many genes and occur throughout a person's life. Researchers found that the link between having a faster-running biological clock and early death held true even after accounting for other factors such as smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Dr Riccardo Marioni, of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, said: 'The same results in four studies indicated a link between the biological clock and deaths from all causes. 'At present, it is not clear what lifestyle or genetic factors influence a person's biological age. We have several follow-up projects planned to investigate this in detail.' The study is published in the journal Genome Biology. It was conducted by researchers from the University of Edinburgh, University of Queensland, Harvard University, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Boston University, the Johns Hopkins University Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.","Chemical changes to DNA can establish an individual's biological age .

"The old adage that 'time is like a river', suggesting that we move through it like a ship sailing on water, may be wrong. A new theory claims that time does not move forward, but rather, everything in time is ever-present. According to the theory, if we were to ‘look down’ upon the universe, we would see time spread out in all directions, just as we see space at the moment. Scroll down for video . A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of philosophy has presented a new theory of time. Dr Bradford Skow says the idea that time flows like a river (stock image shown) is not necessarily correct. Instead he claims space-time is a 'block universe' where the past, present and future all exist together . The intriguing theory was put forward by Dr Bradford Skow, an associated professor of philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In his new book, Objective Becoming, he examines some of the theories that have been postulated to explain time. ‘When you ask people, “Tell me about the passage of time,” they usually make a metaphor,’ he said. In 1927 British astronomer Arthur Eddington first devised the ‘one-way direction’ or ‘asymmetry ‘ of time. He said that by studying the organisation of matter, it was possible to make a 4D map of the universe. The so-called ‘arrow of time’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘random’ future, toward which everything is moving. This is also known as entropy, which tends to increase with time. Entropy, a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse. This means that entropy will always increase in the universe. Some say this may lead to a ‘heat death’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in Isaac Asimov’s short story The Last Question. However, owing to the law of gravity, some think such a future is not a possibility. And Dr Skow thinks the 'arrow of time' theory itself is not necessarily correct. ‘They say time flows like a river, or we move through time like a ship sailing through the sea.’ Another theory states that the present is a ‘spotlight’ that moves from the past to the future, with us being located in the spotlight as it moves forward. Dr Skow, however, said he ‘wouldn’t want to believe in that unless I saw good arguments for it.’ Rather, he favours a theory known as the ‘block universe’, which states that the past, present and future already exist. Dr Skow said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of space-time. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' Dr Skow said. ‘We’re not located at a single time.’ Instead he says we are in a 'temporarily scattered' condition. He asserts that our passage through space-time is not like a spotlight - and the experiences you had yesterday, last week, or even years ago are all real. But he says time travel between the different times is not possible, as we are now in a different part of space-time. Dr Skow (pictured) said that he does not think events sail past us and vanish forever - instead, they exist in different parts of spacetime. ‘The block universe theory says you’re spread out in time, something like the way you’re spread out in space,' he said. ‘We’re not located at a single time’ If we were to look down upon the universe, we would see time spread out, said Dr Skow. But he adds the present is not a 'spotlight' in time - but rather we are in a 'temporally scattered' condition. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang, a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time. The radical theory was proposed by Dr Julian Barbour of College Farm in the UK, Dr Tim Koslowski of the University of New Brunswick in Canada and Dr Flavio Mercati of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, also in Canada. Their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘arrow of time’ - which is the concept that time is ‘symmetric’ and everything moves forwards. They say that at the time of the Big Bang not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time, but opposite to each other. His theory follows another postulated by scientists back in December. They proposed that at the moment of the Big Bang (illustrated), a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards . This universe would not be exactly the same as ours, though; it would have evolved and changed in its own way, completely separate to our own. However, it would be subject to the same laws of physics, so it would likely have planets, stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos. And Dr Barbour told MailOnline the theory could open up a new way to think about the Big Bang. ‘At the moment when people talk about the Big Bang, they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they can’t say what happened,' he said. ‘Now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought.’ Which theory of time proves to be correct, though - Dr Skow's block universe, the mirror universe or perhaps another - remains to be seen.","A Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of philosophy has presented a new theory of time .

"A party is always better with a pinata, but these creepy ones that stray in looks from their intended characters may not do much to lift the mood at a gathering. In Disney's film Frozen, for example, Olaf is a goofy, cuddly snowman but this version makes him appear sinister - while SpongeBob SquarePants is surprisingly hairy and Peppa Pig could easily be Peppa Fox. Mexican couple Melesio Vicente Flores and Cecilia Albarran have been making and selling their high-end pinatas - which are stuffed with candies and broken open with a stick during parties - for 25 years. And it's not just children they cater for, as can be seen by their pole-dancing pinatas. A party is always better with a pinata, but these creepy ones stray in looks from their intended characters.

Together the Vicente-Albarran family create 40 to 60 pinatas per week, with perennial favorites including Spider-Man and Buzz Lightyear, as they work from their four-story shared house built into a hillside on the east side of Mexico's sprawling capital. Working from their rooftop, cement molds are covered in the shapes of body parts with newspaper and are then laid out to dry. On the lower floors, mother and daughter cut newspapers into strips, coat them in glue made from wheat flour and layer over gaps. Vicente assembles the pieces into completed characters. After drying in the sun, the pinatas are brought inside to be painted. Colorful paper and tape create eyes, hair styles and costume details. It takes about two days to complete a pinata during the dry season and twice as long during the rainy season. 'It's hard work and there are lots of things to do, so there is no chance of getting bored. Time flies,' said Albarran.

The more elaborate pinatas sell wholesale for 180 pesos ($12) but other vendors are selling them for less using cheaper materials making competition stiff. Three other rooftops full of the drying figures are visible on the hillside below the couple's workshop and home. 'Before we sold 100, now we sell 50 in a week,' said Vicente. 'We earn just enough to get by.' The family's designs include characters such as Mickey Mouse for children's birthdays or caricatures of despised politicians for protests. Characters from the Disney hit 'Frozen' currently appear to be top sellers in local markets and Albarran said 'princesses never go out of fashion.' Gerardo Moreno Alejo, who sells pinatas at La Merced, one of Mexico City's biggest markets, said university students requested pinatas of President Enrique Pena Nieto last year amid anger over the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college. While competition may make it more difficult to sell pinatas, the Vicente-Albarran family hope to keep making them as long as possible. 'We are not here to make ourselves rich,' said Albarran.

"Kenneth Ireland (pictured), 44, was awarded $6million from the state of Connecticut after being wrongly jailed for 21 years . A man who was wrongfully imprisoned for 21 years for the rape and murder of a mother of four was awarded $6million from the state of Connecticut. Kenneth Ireland, 44, was jailed when he was 18 and released in 2009 after DNA tests proved another man fatally beat and raped 30-year-old Barbara Pelkey in Wallingford. The other man, Kevin Benefield, is serving a 60-year prison sentence for killing the mother-of-four. Mr Ireland was issued the award yesterday under Connecticut's wrongful incarceration compensation law. State claims commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr issued the award to Mr Ireland and said in a report: 'No words or dollar amount will suffice to give him back the time that he lost and the misery that he endured. 'Mr. Ireland was wrongfully convicted and was labeled a murderer and sex offender and was forced to spend a long portion of his life in maximum security prisons. 'He experienced 21 years of violence, sleepless nights and the constant fear and hopelessness that he would die in prison as an innocent man.' The new DNA testing came after the Connecticut Innocence Project, which looks into potentially wrong convictions, began reviewing Ireland's case in 2007. Mr Ireland outlined the daily terror he experienced while in jail during the state's hearing to decide his compensation. 'Not one moment in my entire 21 years did I not have fear' Mr Ireland told NBC Connecticut in 2012. 'You'd look up and there'd be 30 inmates, and everyone would have a sharpened piece of steel and they would just start stabbing other inmates.' He described prison as an endless cycle that would rotate between 'months and months' of boredom with '30 seconds of the most violent terror you could imagine', eventually resigning himself to the belief that he would die in prison of old age or 'more likely, a violent altercation'. In 1987 two people came forward to the police and said Mr Ireland and another man had made incriminating statements regarding their involvement in Mrs Pelkey's murder. A third person came forward a few months later and said Mr Ireland had confessed to the killing. The third witness later admitted she was drunk at the time and may have imagined that the statements were made. Mr Ireland was charged based on these witness statements. He had sought up to $8million from the state under the wrongful incarceration compensation law. Mr Ireland was imprisoned at the age of 18 for the rape and murder of Barbara Pelkey (left) and was released in 2009 after the Connecticut Innocence Project reviewed his case and initiated new DNA testing . He said he was 'extremely pleased' and 'thankful for the hard work and the thoughtfulness of the state and the claims commissioner', on Thursday. 'You can't replace those years, but I've gotten beyond that and I'm looking forward to the future. I'm not a live-in-the-past kind of guy.' Mr Ireland said he looks forward to traveling, possibly to Europe and Australia, but has no definitive plans for the $6million. 'This ensures my security and affords me a little bit of room to explore the world and become familiar with and see things I've missed,' he said. Ireland worked as a bookkeeper after he was freed from prison. In October, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy appointed him to a paid position on the state parole board with an annual salary of $92,500. Kevin Benefield (right) was found guilty for the murder and is now serving a 60-year prison sentence. Mr Ireland (pictured after his charges were dropped in 2009) said he looks forward to using the money for travel . In a statement on Thursday, Gov. Malloy said: 'Kenneth Ireland is a man of extraordinary character who endured the unimaginable pain of two decades of wrongful incarceration, and yet is not only without bitterness, but is incredibly thoughtful, insightful and committed to public safety and service.' 'Modern DNA technologies are ensuring that the violent criminals who have actually committed the crimes are convicted and remain behind bars. I applaud the work of the Innocence Project.' Mr Vance broke down to the million just how the state figured out what it owed to Mr Ireland. 'For loss of liberty and enjoyment of life, $2.5 million; loss of earnings and earning capacity, $1.5 million; loss of reputation, $300,000; physical and mental injuries, $1.5 million; costs and expenses, $200,000.' Mr Ireland's $6million award is the first under the wrongful incarceration compensation law. The statute was passed in 2008, a year after the legislature awarded $5million to James Tillman, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for a rape he didn't commit and freed in 2006.","Kenneth Ireland, 44, was freed in 2009 after DNA tests cleared him of killing mother-of-four Barbara Pelkey .

"The Church of England has said it would be irresponsible to rush through a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born. It spoke out as MPs prepare to vote on whether Britain should be the first country in the world to sanction the creation of children that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father. The row surrounds a technique designed to prevent devastating diseases caused by faults in mitochondria, the tiny ‘engine rooms’ that power the cells in the body. Developed by scientists at Newcastle University, it involves swapping a mother-to-be’s diseased mitochondria with healthy ones from an egg donated by another woman. The Church of England has entered the debate on whether Britain should sanction the creation of three parent children . Supporters say the legislation would allow those living in the shadow of incurable disease the chance of having a healthy child. It is estimated at least 150 babies a year could be born using the technique. But critics argue that genetically engineering eggs crosses a critical ethical line, and argue that it is impossible to know if the technique is safe. Now the Church of England has entered the debate. It is particularly concerned that not enough is known about mitochondria’s role in passing on hereditary characteristics. The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy, the Anglicans’ national adviser on medical ethics, said: ‘The Church of England accepts in certain circumstances that embryo research is permissible as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect. The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy said: ‘The Archbishops’ Council does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer' ‘The Archbishops’ Council does not feel there has been sufficient scientific study or informed consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of mitochondria transfer. ‘Without a clearer picture of the role mitochondria play in the transfer of hereditary characteristics, the Church does not feel it would be responsible to change the law at this time.’ Flawed mitochondria can cause degenerative genetic diseases which kill in infancy. Women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless. Those backing the law change include five Nobel prize winners, who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents. In a letter to The Times, they said: ‘We believe those who know what it is like to care for, and sometimes to lose, an extremely sick child are the best-placed to decide whether this technology is right for them.’ But a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, urged caution, saying ‘critical’ experiments still needed to be carried out. Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons will be followed by one in the House of Lords. If the change is passed, it would not become law until October.","MPs set to vote to sanction the creation of children that have three parents .

"The 18 New England residents sitting on the jury in the murder trial of former Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will be allowed to watch the home team play in Sunday's Super Bowl, but the judge overseeing the case says they must leave the room if his name is mentioned. Hernandez, 25, caught quarterback Tom Brady's last Super Bowl touchdown pass in the Patriots' 2012 loss to the New York Giants. Now he is on trial for murder, charged with the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister. The trial is playing out just as Hernandez's old team is preparing to take on the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL championship game. Scroll down for video .

(AP Photo/The Boston Herald, Ted Fitzgerald, Pool) Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh closed the second day of testimony Friday by telling jurors they may watch the game if it is important to them, but they must be vigilant for mention of the case or Hernandez. 'You hear that word, you've got to walk out of the room,' Garsh said. 'Distance yourself.' Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was arrested. Earlier Friday, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, was overcome with emotion and had to leave the courtroom as a prosecutor showed graphic photos of her son's body at the industrial park where he was found.

The former Pats player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (pictured on the screen) Hernandez listens during his murder trial as a prosecution exhibit is displayed on the screen . The 27-year-old Lloyd was shown lying on his back with his left fist curled in a ball over the gunshot wounds to his chest. It was the second straight day she left the courtroom in tears. Lloyd's body was found riddled with bullets in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home, not far from Gillette Stadium. On Friday, two men who worked at a business in the industrial park described a teenage jogger coming to their office early on the evening of June 17, 2013, then leading them down to an empty lot. One of the men, David Swithers, said he stopped about 20 feet away and saw a man on his back. The judge had cautioned jurors that the images would be graphic and that they shouldn't let their emotions sway them in the case. 'He was stiff and motionless. There were flies flying in and out of his nostrils,' he said. 'I called 911.' Also testifying Friday was Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd. Her sister, Shayanna, 25, is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his two-year-old child. The sisters sit on opposite sides of the courtroom, Shaneah with Lloyd's mother and Shayanna with Hernandez's family. Shayanna Jenkins was not in court Friday. Shaneah Jenkins testified Friday that she introduced Lloyd to Hernandez and that although they had a cordial relationship, they were not close. Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée, looks on in court on Thursday during opening statements at his murder trial. Prosecutors have listed Shayanna Jenkins as a possible witness and this month petitioned the court to grant immunity to her, compelling her to testify . Earlier Friday, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, was overcome with emotion and had to leave the courtroom as a prosecutor showed graphic photos of her son's body at the industrial park where he was found . At 23 Hernandez had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots, but then he was arrested in June 2013 and charged with murder . She said the two men would hang out in the basement or smoke marijuana together when they came to visit, but that, apart from the weekend Lloyd was killed, the two men did not spend time together without her there. Hernandez's lawyer, Michael Fee, told jurors in his opening statement that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill him. He said they could have some day been brothers-in-law. Shaneah Jenkins is expected to resume testimony the next day court is in session. That could be Monday, though the judge told jurors a snowstorm forecast for Monday could delay that. In a separate murder case that has yet to come to trial, Hernandez was charged last year in Boston with killing two men in 2012 after someone spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. The judge has ruled that prosecutors in the Lloyd case cannot tell the jury about those slayings.","The 18 New England jurors in the murder trial of former Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will be allowed to watch his team play in Sunday's Super Bowl .

"A girl who was told she cannot attend a father-daughter dance with her single mom will get a dance of her own. Meghan, eight, asked her mother Shawna Steeves, 30, to be her date for the annual party at Southwest Elementary School in Lawson, Missouri, next week. But when the school heard of their plan, the Parent Teacher Association informed Steeves no mothers are allowed for 'authenticity' reasons. Now, after a week-long battle, the school has refused to change the rules - but a community group has pledged to throw a separate party for Meghan and other children of widows or single mothers. Single mother: Shawna Steeves was asked by her daughter Meghan (both pictured) to be her date to the event at Southwest Elementary in Lawson, Missouri. The 30-year-old said she would be honored . 'It's open to all the students and they can bring any adult role model they wish,' Antonio DeLaCruz, a member of Missouri Widows Sons Masonic Riders Association and organizer of 'Meghan's Dance', told ABC News. 'Of course, she's the driving force,' DeLaCruz added, 'but there's other kids in her situation that want to attend school functions like the father-daughter dance and they can't.' The dispute has sparked outrage in the community, after Steeves revealed Meghan had already got a dress for the event that all her friends were attending. Though the youngster considers Shawna to be both her mother and father, the school said only fathers could attend. According to the poster, daughters can bring an uncle or grandpa but not a mother. It adds: 'Moms... no need to feel left out... PTO is hosting Mother-Son Challenge & Muffins with Mom soon!' Disappointment: The PTO said Miss Steeves could not accompany her daughter to the dance because it would damage the integrity of the event. They told her any other male figure would suffice . Speaking to a local TV station, a school spokesman said: 'Our PTO works very hard at creating events that give ample opportunity for all families to [participate] in throughout the year. Regarding the situation with this event there were several options given to this family and all families so that all Southwest elementary school aged girls are welcome to attend regardless of their family situation. 'Our goal is to keep this special event authentic. We offer many other events that are family oriented. 'Examples would be muffins with mom and donuts with dad, the family 5k walk/run, pancakes with Santa, Trunk or treat and our mother son challenge. 'We are very proud of our organization and what we do for the students and our community.' The principle initially said yes, but the PTO overturned the decision because they wanted to make sure the dance maintained its integrity. Response: Meghan  insisted she would write a letter to the school in a bid to have the decision overturned . They told Miss Steeves that any other male figure - including uncles or grandparents - were more than welcome to attend.  But Meghan insisted she wants her mother there. The mom was left devastated, having already bought her daughter a black and white dress with a purple sash - Meghan's favorite color. She told FoxK4: 'If you're going to have that and you're going to tell someone to bring their father figure, why not me? I'm just as good. 'I would love to find a substitute so she could go. I have. She ultimately turns around and says, 'you're my mom and you're my dad' and I would love to go with you . When Miss Steeves broke the news to her daughter, the youngster said she would write a letter to the school in a bid to have the decision overturned.","Shawna Steeves was asked by her daughter Meghan to be her date .

"It is the latest culinary craze - slowly poaching food inside airtight bags for hours on end. Now a new kitchen 'robot' will allow you to start cooking those time consuming sous-vide creations before you even get home. Named Mellow, the device is able to take instructions from a mobile phone app so busy home cooks can start the process before they get home. Scroll down for video . Mellow (above) will revolutionise cooking by making sous vide open to everyone, according to its designers . The machine keeps food at refrigerator temperatures and can warm up within ten minutes to temperatures of up to 90 degrees C. Robots are learning to cook like humans - by watching YouTube videos. Researchers from the University of Maryland and the Australian research center NICTA, have been using a form of artificial intelligence called 'deep learning.' This involves using training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of information derived from audio, images, and other inputs. In order to train the robots, researchers selected data from 88 YouTube videos of people cooking to generate commands that a robot could then execute. They were then able to teach the robots to identify the way a hand is grasping an item, and to recognize specific objects. Their system was also able to anticipate the action involving an object and a hand. Using a mobile phone, it is possible to tell the device when to start cooking, how hot and for how long. It will even suggest cooking sequences according to the ingredients being used and how the user would like them to taste. However, aspiring chefs will still need to prepare the ingredients and seal them in the airtight bag before leaving them in the 4.5 litre water bath. According to Ze Pinto Ferreira, one of the designers, said: 'We're hoping it will get people cooking great food from fresh ingredients daily. 'It makes those involved, labour-intensive dishes you'd normally only make for a special occasion fast and stress-free to cook.' Sous-vide was initially developed by engineers in the 1960s as a way of preserving food before later being adopted by top chefs around the world. It requires food to vacuum packed and slowly cooked in a waterbath kept at a carefully controlled temperature - usually around 55°C (131°F). Users would still need to prepare their ingredients but they can leave them in the machine until ready to cook . Cooking meat can take several hours, depending on how rare it is to be while some recipes call for cooking times of up to 72 hours to produce tender food from tough meat. For Mellow, which is sold by FNV Labs for around $400 (£265) has a double-walled tank, which helps increase its efficiency and requires just 30 watts of power. The mobile software also attempts to learn from feedback it receives about meals so that it can adapt recipes and cooking times to reflect your palate. The designers say the device will boil or poach eggs, as shown above, so they are ready in time for breakfast . The device can be controlled using a mobile phone app, above, that allows users to set the temperature and cooking time while also suggesting adjustments to alter the taste according to the users' preferences . FNV has already sold 1,000 of the devices over pre-order and is now hoping to make more available in the future. Mr Ferreira added: 'We guide you through a set of screens to learn what ingredients you're cooking, how you'd like them cooked and when you want them ready. ""Everything else we can either take from the food you put in, because Mellow has a built-in scale, or current food science. 'You wouldn't roast a turkey or finish a lasagne in Mellow, but I do think it can make 95 per cent of dishes a lot better, less stressful and less time-consuming to cook. ""Cooking different foods at the same time is a challenge right now, but we're working on ways to do that.'","$400 robotic waterbath, Mellow, can be controlled using a mobile phone .

"A mother has warned parents about the dangers of Nurofen for Children after it triggered kidney failure in her 12 year-old son. Louize Carroll, 39, treated her son Josh with the recommended dose of liquid ibuprofen when he complained of a sore throat and a temperature. The bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years-old and Josh recovered from his illness. Danger: Josh Carroll, 12, suffered kidney failure two weeks after taking Nurofen for Children for a sore throat . But a couple of weeks later he started to vomit and complained of severe stomach pains. His GP was unable to pinpoint the problem and diagnosed stress and stomach issues. But the pain did not subside and a blood test on New Year's Eve revealed Josh, from Ashford, Kent, had kidney problems. He was sent to Evelina London Children's Hospital where a biopsy showed he had an inflammation of the kidney called tubulointerstitial nephritis, which causes kidney failure. Doctors told his parents his condition was a side-effect of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen - an ingredient in Nurofen. They stressed he had not had an allergic reaction to the medicine. Josh spent a total of eight days in hospital but is now back home and has returned to school. Medicine: The bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years . He is taking steroids to 'kick-start' his kidneys and is on a low-potassium diet to aid his recovery. Mrs Carroll, a HR Manager, said she felt guilty for giving him the drugs but said she had been told it is a common problem. She said: 'It was horrible watching him go through it. 'I felt guilty because I'd given him the Nurofen, but I just gave him a normal dose for three days. 'I was surprised when we were told the Nurofen had caused Josh's problems but a nurse said they see a lot of similar cases.' The worst case scenario is that his Josh's kidneys do not recover. 'We still don't know how his condition will develop,' his mother said. 'If that happens then obviously there is still a possibility that he would need dialysis or a transplant. 'I feel really surprised that something that is aimed at children can be so dangerous.' The warnings about the side-effects are on the leaflet inside the Nurofen for Children box but not displayed externally. Josh said that he is confused why it is described by the firm as a 'rare' problem when it affects up to five per cent of users. He said: 'On Christmas Day I got really bad stomach pains. I couldn't eat my Christmas dinner. 'I couldn't move because it hurt so much and I didn't really know what was happening. 'If I met the owner of the company that makes Nurofen, I'd ask them why it causes kidney problems. 'And I would ask why it says this is a rare problem when it happens to one to five per cent of people who take it. 'They should put a warning on the bottle because not a lot of people read the leaflet.' Action: Mr and Mrs Carroll are now calling on Nurofen's parent company Reckitt Benckiser to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems . His father Paul, 44, a warehouse manager, said: 'As a parent, watching your child go through that, you fear the worst. 'Every time he got stomach pains he was in agony and going white. On one occasion he went grey. 'He was very brave about it. He had about 18 blood tests.' Mr and Mrs Carroll are now calling on Nurofen's parent company Reckitt Benckiser to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems. In a statement, Nurofen for Children said: 'We and we are very sorry to hear about Josh Carroll’s condition, we wish him a swift and full recovery. 'We have informed our consumer safety team who will be in touch with the family to find out more about the case and investigate further. 'Single reports of acute renal failure with ibuprofen are classified as ‘very rare’ by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which means less than one in 10,000 cases. 'We encourage all consumers to report any adverse events to help us monitor and ensure the continuing good safety profile of these products.' 'Based on our internal safety monitoring data of the last 5 years, the incidence of serious renal impairment was less than 1 case per 30 million exposures of Nurofen for Children.' Neal Patel, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told MailOnline: 'Although very rare when severe side effects with medicines occur, they can have a serious impact. 'If after taking even a relatively safe medicine like ibuprofen you feel unwell, always consult a pharmacist to see if symptoms are due to side effects or an adverse reaction.'","Louize Carroll gave son Josh the recommended dose of liquid ibuprofen .

"A woman known as North Carolina's 'Bear Lady' may have been killed by a bear. The remains of Kay Grayson, 67, were found in a well-known bear path just 100 yards from her isolated home in Tyrrell County on Monday. Authorities could only find bones, hair and ripped clothing, which had likely been there for two weeks after she was reported missing. Fears: Authorities believe so-called 'bear lady' Kay Grayson could have been killed by a bear by her home . Awaiting the results of a post mortem examination, Sheriff Darryl Liverman told FoxNews.com he believe it is likely she was attacked by a bear. 'Based on what we saw, we do believe that she was dragged into the woods by bears or multiple bears,' he said. 'The remains were on a path that was used by bears. Her clothing had been ripped by what appeared to be bears.' 'She fed the bears a lot,' Liverman added, 'But we do not know if bears actually killed her.' Grayson, who lived alone in the home she dubbed 'Bearsong' without a phone, electricity, or running water, had spent 20 years feeding the local animals with peanuts and dog food. At one with nature: Grayson lived without a phone, running water or electricity for two decades at the home she dubbed 'Bearsong' and used to feed the animals with peanuts and dog food . However, last year she stopped feeding black bears after Sgt Mark Cagle, of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, warned her of the dangers. Black bears have killed 61 Americans since 1900, including six in the past five years, far outnumbering brown bear attacks. Humans are warned not to approach the species with food as black bears are not used to contact with people. Nonetheless, Cagle explains, Grayson 'loved all of nature, especially bears'.","Remains of Kay Grayson, 67, found in wooded area near her home .

"Inventors have come up with a novel solution to avoid waking up a partner in the night when turning on a bedside lamp - by hiding it under the bed. The discreet light aims to solve the age-old problem, as it comes on automatically under the bed as you climb out for any reason - such as checking on a crying child. Its smart motion sensor detects both light and movement and guides you to the bathroom or anywhere else you might be heading. Scroll down for video . New York-based e3light has devised a 'smart' £49.99 ($75) bed light. Called mylight, it uses motion detectors and is placed under a bed. When someone steps on the ground, the light turns on (shown) The motion sensor, which only operates in the dark, can attached to a bed leg and looks out for movement laterally. Meanwhile, the user fits strips of LED lights on the bed frame underneath the mattress. The kits, called mylight and made by New York-based e3light, are being sold through John Lewis stores - with one priced at £49.99 ($75) and two for £64.95 ($98). The company are even in talks with hotel chains and cruise liners to use in their hotel rooms and cabins, as well as healthcare suppliers.

Snuggling up with a good book in bed has long been seen as a way to wind down at the end of the day. But scientists have discovered that the millions who read their bedtime stories on an iPad or a Kindle Fire are actually keeping themselves awake. They found that people who regularly read electronic books before lights out sleep for fewer hours. They had reduced levels of melatonin, a hormone which plays a role in inducing sleepiness. The study was carried out by Penn State and Harvard universities in the US and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Kasper Daugaard, 36, global sales manager for e3light, said: 'So many people are waking up their partners every night when going to the bathroom. 'With mylight a subtle light turns on at floor level and you are guided to your bathroom or wherever you are headed. 'This is also why cruise lines and hotels like it - there's no need to fumble for light you don't know where anything is in the dark. 'People with dementia have gained from this product as the light automatically comes on and there is no need to begin or remember where the light switch is. 'People think its a great and original idea. 'At first it seems like a ""like to have"" product and not a ""need to have"", but once its installed we see clients coming back to purchase more for their children's rooms. 'People are now also installing it in their closets as we now also have a product called Closet light that does this.' The product can also be helpful for children who get out of bed in the middle of the night, providing them with light so they can find their way to the door .","New York-based e3light has devised a 'smart' £49.99 bed light .

"A Victorian truck diver kidnapped two prostitutes and forced them into his live-in bus where he kept a homemade 'raping machine', a court has heard. Serial sex offender Dennis William Newall is in jail for raping a backpacker in WA about four years ago, and was also sentenced to eight years prison in 2002 for raping a Melbourne sex worker. The 56-year-old pleaded guilty on Thursday to kidnapping and raping two more St Kilda prostitutes on separate occasions in November and December 2001. A Victorian truck diver kidnapped two prostitutes and forced them into his live-in bus where he kept a homemade 'raping machine', a court has heard . Both women thought they were going to die after Newall enticed them into his car, covered their heads and took them to his converted bus at Brooklyn, the Victorian County Court heard. Newall kept a wooden cross-like structure on the bus and told one woman it was a 'sex machine' and he was planning to add a mechanical arm to it. He asked one of his victims to 'rate his performance' after raping her, and later requested her phone number. The court heard Newall forced his son, then 17, to help carry out one of the kidnappings. His teenage son got in the boot of Newall's car and leapt out to place a pillowcase over the woman's head while she was in the back seat. An unknown man was involved in the other kidnapping. The women, who were aged 20 and 27 at the time, did not go to police about the attacks until recently. Newall told one victim 'no one would believe a junkie whore' like her, she told the court. Both women said they remained traumatised by what he had done. One referred to his wooden, cross-like structure as a 'raping machine'. 'I couldn't wrap my head around the sadism and depravity needed to build such a machine,' she told the court. All three Melbourne-based attacks took place within about a month, crown prosecutor John Livitsanos told the court. Defence barrister Shaun Ginsbourg said Newall had developed remorse over his behaviour. He will be sentenced at a later date.","A truck driver kidnapped two prostitutes and forced them into his live-in bus .

"Until now, DNA left at the scene of a crime only proves useful if it is already stored in a database and can be matched to a suspect. But a team of forensic experts have devised a way to recreate the face of a person, including eye and skin colour, using as little as 50 picograms (0.05 nanograms) of extracted DNA. Called DNA phenotyping, the tests also determine the person's ancestry, if they have freckles and can be used to match with distant relatives. DNA phenotyping is the prediction of physical appearance from DNA and is a technique being pioneered by Virginia-based Parabon Nanolabs (example pictured). The technology can be used to generate leads in cases where there are no suspects or database hits, or to help identify remains, for example . DNA phenotyping is the prediction of physical appearance from DNA and is a technique being pioneered by Virginia-based Parabon Nanolabs. The technology can be used to generate leads in criminal cases where there are no suspects or database hits, or to help identify remains, for example. Samples can be potentially taken from as little as a fingerprint. Family history site Ancestry has extended its AncestryDNA service - a home testing kit that unlocks the secrets of a person’s genetic ethnicity - to the UK. The results can be cross-checked with millions of family trees to help people discover unknown relatives. It uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, which looks at person’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations using saliva. Since it was released in 2012, AncestryDNA has been used by around 700,000 people. All of these results have been stored on a secure, encrypted database, and each set of results is linked to a person’s individual Ancestry account and subsequent family tree. AncestryDNA can help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible DNA member matches. Parabon's Snapshot Forensic system is said to be able to accurately predict genetic ancestry, eye colour, hair colour, skin colour, freckling, and face shape in individuals from any ethnic background. Each prediction is presented with a ‘measure of confidence’. As an example, the test can say a person has green eyes with 61 per cent confidence, green or blue with 79 per cent confidence, and that they definitely don’t have brown eyes, with 99 per cent confidence. Based on ancestry, and other markers, the test also creates a likely facial shape. From all of this information, it builds a computer generated e-fit. And the test will predict how two people are related, as distant as third cousins, and great-great-great-great-grandparents. ‘DNA carries the genetic instruction set for an individual's physical characteristics, producing the wide range of appearances among people,’ explained Parabon Nanolabs. ‘By determining how genetic information translates into physical appearance, it is possible to “reverse-engineer"" DNA into a physical profile. ‘Snapshot reads tens of thousands of genetic variants from a DNA sample and uses this information to predict what an unknown person looks like.’ The project was supported with funding from the the US Department of Defense (DoD). Samples can be taken from as little as a fingerprint. Parabon's Snapshot Forensic system is said to be able to accurately predict genetic ancestry, eye colour, hair colour, skin colour, freckling, and face shape in individuals from any ethnic background (example pictured) Each prediction is presented with a ‘measure of confidence’. As an example, the test can say a person has green eyes with 61 per cent confidence, green or blue with 79 per cent confidence, and that they definitely don’t have brown eyes, with 99 per cent confidence. A series of example charts is pictured . Ellen McRae Greytak, Parabon's director of bioinformatics told Popular Science that the system has been used in 10 cases across the US, and the first department to release a Snapshot report was the Columbia Police Department. It produced a profile for a ‘person of interest’ in the murder of 25-year-old Candra Alston and her daughter Malaysia Boykin in 2011. The only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified DNA sample. Investigators in South Carolina are hoping the DNA technique could lead to to a breakthrough in the unsolved murder case of Malaysia Boykin, three, (left) and her mother Candra Alston (right) in 2011 . There were no witnesses to the murder, so the local authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the person was a male with dark-skinned, brown hair and brown eyes (profile pictured) There were no witnesses to the murder, so the local authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the person was a male with dark-skinned, brown hair and brown eyes. Mark Vinson, a cold case investigator with the Columbia police department, said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the  deaths. Around 150 of them submitted their DNA - but none matched the sample left at the scene.","DNA Phenotyping is the prediction of physical appearance from DNA .

"In its bid to become the tourist destination of the future, the oil-rich nation of Qatar has gone all-out to impress visitors. And nowhere moreso than at its sleek airport, where the glitzy accessories range from the  beautiful to the somewhat bizarre (yes, it really has an oversized teddy bear lamp at the entrance). Perhaps the world's most over-the-top airport, Doha's Hamad International has taken extravagance to the next level, with gold-plated coffee kiosks, a life-size replica Formula One car and a sleek hotel offering VIP travellers use of its Presidential Suite for three-hour layovers. Scroll down for video . The newly-remodelled Hamad Airport in Doha, Qatar, is easily one of the most luxurious in the world . The terminal itself cost billions to build - and the money is evident in the gold-plated counter of one of the many airport coffee shop . As well as an in-airport hotel, there are also extensive shopping opportunities - both duty-free and luxury offerings . Here's hoping that Qatar, which also won the rights to the FIFA World Cup in 2022, will put on a sporting event even half as spectacular as their airport. If there was any doubt about the airport's fascination with luxury, head to the 80 stores scattered throughout the terminals - a who's who of designer brands from Armani and Chanel to Hermes and Bulgari. A mini art gallery has been designed to entertain culture vultures, while the business class lounge measures a huge 33,000 square feet. Head beyond security and you'll find a luxury hotel, complete with suites for relaxation for travellers who don't feel the need to ever leave the comfort of the terminal. The gigantic 1,400-square foot Presidential Suite is of particular note, and to suit quick layovers, can be rented out for as little as three hours. There's also a restaurant and fitness centre, complete with a spa-inspired indoor pool that overlooks the departing and arriving planes. Opened to great fanfare last year, Hamad International is said to have cost the oil-rich nation billions to build. Among the building's impressive features is Hamad's Airport Hotel, which boasts 100 rooms and suites conveniently located inside the airport itself. Hamad's Airport Hotel boasts 100 rooms and suites, all conveniently located inside the airport, as well as an opulent swimming pool . Cat nap!

For those looking to indulge, there are boutique offerings from Giorgio Armani (pictured), Harrod's, Hermes and Chanel . As one of the richest countries in the world, the Gulf nation is also home to an impressive gold industry. It's no surprise then that passengers can pick up many styles of the precious metal in the airport's Au Gold Boutique. With 70 boutique shops available to choose from, Hamad Airport rivals the opulent shopping experience of Heathrow Terminal 5. And once you're done browsing, passengers can re-fuel at one of the terminal's 30 restaurants, where everything from American to Italian cuisine is available. The terminal is home to over 30 restaurants, including Le Grand Comptoir, inspired by traditional French bistros . From American cuisine to Italian pasta, there is something for every taste at the Qatar airport - even caviar . For those with a sweet tooth, the newly-opened Godiva stand offers plenty of chocolate treats to enjoy pre-flight . However, for those who prefer to relax in a lounge setting, look no further than the 33,000-square foot Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge. There are shower rooms, 'quiet rooms' with beds, meeting rooms, two restaurants, a game room and - proving that kids really do have all the fun - even a children's play room with a full-size replica of a Formula One racing car. And, of course, in the lounge - as well as the rest of the airport - WiFi is readily available and absolutely free.

There are meeting facilities, nap rooms with beds and shower facilities to allow passengers to refresh before a long-haul flight . There are also two restaurants inside the well-appointed lounge, in case the airport's other offerings don't spark your interest . There are also works of art throughout the terminal, like the over-size Lamp Bear by Swiss artist Urs Fishcer (pictured) But if you prefer not to bury your head in your iPad, plenty of art is also available to observe throughout the terminal. The Qatari royal family is known for their collection of prime artworks, so it's not entirely surprising that the Hamad airport would display local, Arab and Western artists prominently. Current works include the over-size Lamp Bear by Swiss artist Urs Fischer and a 'flock' of Arabian Oryx by Dutch artist Tom Claassen. Pieces by Maurizio Cattelan, Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer will also be displayed in the future.","Qatar has poured billions of pounds into Hamad International Airport's newly-remodelled terminal .

"Two pilots have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the Pacific Ocean, according to their team. American Troy Bradley and Russia's Leonid Tiukhtyaev have flown more than 5,260 miles (8,467km) since leaving Saga, Japan last Sunday. They are now expected to arrive somewhere in Baja California, Mexico, tomorrow after unexpected weather forced them to change course from their original landing zone in the US. Scroll down for video . Troy Bradley of New Mexico and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia have flown more than 5,260 miles (8,467km) since leaving Japan last Sunday. Dubbed the 'Two Eagles', the pair rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles (8,383 km) for human flight in a gas balloon on Thursday, which had been set on the only previous manned trans-Pacific flight, in 1981. When they eclipsed the distance record, a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum in New Mexico with people posing for pictures with the mile counter. Art Lloyd Jr, a mission support control worker at the site, said: 'We're really excited and just now concentrating on getting them to a nice safe landing.' To set new distance and durations records the team needed to beat the existing records by one per cent. Yesterday the Two Eagles team tweeted: ' The pilots have just surpassed the distance needed to set a new record. 5261 miles or 8467 km.' The pilots, dubbed the Two Eagles, have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the Pacific Ocean, according to their team . They had been aiming to land in Canada or the US but unexpected weather forced them to change course and they are now expected to arrive in Baja California, Mexico, tomorrow . 'We're not taking any time to celebrate,' Steve Shope, head of mission control, told My Fox Atlanta. 'We have a lot of work we have to do, and we're just taking this flight one hour at a time.' The pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours, five minutes and 50 seconds, set in 1978 by a team of three pilots in Double Eagle II- the first to cross the Atlantic by helium balloon. In 1981, the Double Eagle V, manned by several members of the same team, was also the first gas balloon to successfully cross the Pacific Ocean and set the record for  distance. Bradley and Tiukhtyaev, who named their balloon in honour of the the Double Eagle team, should pass the existing record at about 3.50pm GMT after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes. The balloon, which relies solely on an enclosed chamber of helium gas for lift, is different from hot air balloons and so-called Roziere balloons, which rely on both hot air and lighter-than-air gas. The pair, who have been equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater, are suspended beneath the balloon in a tiny, cramped  capsule .

The huge helium-filled envelope, made of Kevlar and carbon-fibre, carries the team in a tiny capsule which sits beneath and is designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days. Lloyd said the cramped conditions of the capsule has not affected the pilots, who have subsisted on a diet that includes fresh fruit, freeze-dried hikers' meals, beef jerky and the occasional hot meal from a small stove. They are equipped with cold-weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater. The team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down although they estimate the balloon will land in Baja California, Mexico. A network of balloonists has been established across the US and in southern Canada who can serve as chase crews, those who are on the ground to help with tethering the capsule and rounding up the balloon's envelope as it deflates. The volunteers are ready to travel within a 200-mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear. Their records must be officially certified by the National Aeronautic Association and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, which can take months.

"Relatives of passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have demanded officials retract an announcement that everyone on board is dead. Chinese relatives of passengers found no solace in yesterday's verdict, which officially declared the flight's disappearance an accident with all on board presumed dead, clearing the way for families to be awarded compensation. Today, about 100 Chinese families demanded officials retract the statement, as they do not want to start compensation claims without hard evidence. Scroll down for video .

Policemen were pictured moving in to stop family members giving an interview to the media, during a gathering to pray for the safe return of the passengers, in front of the Yonghegong Lama Temple, Beijing . But as they gathered to pray for the safe return of their family members at the the Yonghegong Lama Temple in Beijing, they were pictured being prevented by policemen from giving interviews. The Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on March 8 last year, carrying 239 passengers and crew shortly after taking off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing. So far, investigators have failed to find any trace of the aircraft and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has now ruled that the disappearance accidental. 'We don't accept it,' said Zhang Qian, whose husband was on the plane. 'As a matter of fact, we are demanding the statement to be retracted.' She added: 'I feel like I am giving it all up if we start talking about compensation.

Chinese relatives of passengers of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 give interviews to the media. They are demanding officials retract the statement that all aboard are dead without hard evidence . About 100 Chinese families demanded officials retract the statement as they gathered at the Yonghegong Lama temple in Beijing . Earlier this week, in anticipation of the Malaysian statement, 110 members in a group of 115 relatives of passengers voted to demand that Malaysian officials refrain from making any announcement. Jiang Hui, whose mother was a passenger aboard the flight, said the new announcement was based on no new facts. He said: 'We not only demand the Malaysian government retract the statement, but also issue an apology. 'That's the wish of the majority of family members.' Therese Rando, a clinical psychologist who has worked extensively in grief counseling, said the relatives' continued refusal to accept the conclusion is understandable because they are going through an 'ambiguous loss', where there has been no body or wreckage to confirm death. She told the Associated Press: 'For any family member to make the move to presume death in the absence of confirmation is a huge step. 'They need to have eliminated other possibilities; to do otherwise would be tantamount to prematurely abandoning their loved one.'

Their calls came as today, officials revealed they are confident of finding the aircraft soon. Officials said today that the undersea search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has covered almost a third of its target area. They added that they were confident the aircraft is in the zone - after months of searches have failed to turn up any trace. Malaysia, along with China and Australia, has been searching for the plane in the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Perth, Australia. Mior Nor Badrishah Mohamad, an official of Malaysia's civil aviation department, told a press conference that 31.04% of the search area had been covered. He said: 'Based on the available data, this is the place'. Authorities reiterated that they expect the undersea search of an area of 60,000 square km (23,000 square miles) to be completed by May. Mr Mohamad added: 'If we cannot find MH370 within this area, we need to sit down again and decide what's the best way forward, based on the data we have'. He said poor weather after May would make the search more difficult. Yesterday, DCA director-general Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said: 'We officially declare Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 an . accident... and that all 239 of the passengers and crew onboard .

Malaysia Airlines is ready to proceed immediately with compensation to next-of-kin of passengers on the . flight, he said. International investigators are still looking into why the jet veered thousands of miles off course from its scheduled . route before eventually plunging into the Indian Ocean. Malaysia is also conducting a criminal investigation. 'Both investigations are limited by the lack of physical . evidence at this time, particularly the flight recorders,' said . Azharuddin.

"The funeral service for Bernard Jordan, the D-Day veteran who broke out of his care home for the 70-year commemorations, has been held today along with his wife's - after she died just a week after him. Hundreds of mourners, including war veterans and RNLI members, packed St Michael and All Angels Church in Brighton, East Sussex, this morning to bid farewell to the couple, who were married for more than 50 years. Mr Jordan, who was known as Bernie, was 90 when he passed away on December 30 - six months after he earned the nickname of 'the Great Escaper' following his cross-Channel adventure last summer. Scroll down for video . Service: The funeral of D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan, who broke out of his care home for the 70-year commemorations, was held this morning . Commemoration: It was a joint service for Mr Jordan and his wife Irene, who he was married to for 50 years, and died just seven days after him . Around 150 mourners gathered as Mr Jordan's coffin, draped in the Union flag and topped with his medals and a wreath of poppies, arrived at church in front of his wife, Irene's, who died a week later at the age of 88. Assistant curate Father Mark Lyon, who led the service, said: 'It's a great privilege to give thanks for the lives of Bernie and Rene. Although Bernie made the headlines, it's a testament to the depth of her that Rene would not allow him to make this final journey alone. 'In this we can take comfort, knowing that they make their journey into eternity together, hand in hand.' Mr and Mrs Jordan, who did not have children, had been married for 59 years and celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 2005. It emerged this week that the couple, who stayed in the same care home, left their entire £600,000 estate to the RNLI. As a former mayor of Hove, the service was told Mr Jordan had been a long-serving community stalwart before his trip to last year's D-Day commemorations. Paying tribute, Mr Fitch said Mr Jordan 'had a flare for being outrageous' and that Brighton and Hove had 'lost two of its dearest souls'. Together: It emerged this week that Irene (left) and Bernard - known as Bernie - Jordan (right) left their £600,000 estate entirely to the RNLI charity. Mr Jordan was a former mayor of Hove and is pictured wearing the ceremonial chain . Police search: Mr Jordan earned the nickname 'the Great Escaper' after he disappeared from his care home last summer (left). He is pictured right on his wedding day to Irene in 1946 . He said: 'Bernie, in what were to be the last few months of his life, became a national and international figure due to his trip to France and his desire to participate in the Normandy Landings commemorations. 'What really captured the public's imagination was not his own scheduled flit from the Pines (care home) but the character of the man - a person determined to honour and value his comrades despite his increasing age and less than perfect health.' Mr Fitch also paid tribute to Mrs Jordan as 'demure and quiet', adding that 'she was the perfect foil for her gregarious and big-hearted husband'. Dennis Smith, the husband of one of the couple's nieces, told the service that the Jordans were 'different characters' who complemented each other. He said Mrs Jordan took a great interest in the Royal Family, particularly the younger generation and she acted as an 'assertive' figure, often keeping her husband grounded during his 'flights of fancy'. He added that her death, just days after her husband, came as she 'saw little prospect of a life without him'. After the Last Post sounded, Royal British Legion standard bearers lowered their flags before mourners filed out of the church ahead of a private committal. The funeral cortege made its way along the streets of Brighton this morning as dozens of people turned out to pay their respects to the couple .

Salute: A minute's silence will be held at the next full meeting of Brighton and Hove City Council to remember Mr and Mrs Jordan . Veteran Bernard Jordan was found in Normandy after travelling to France to mark the anniversary of D-Day. He is pictured shortly after his escapade (left) and during his time as a member of the Royal Navy (right) Irene Jordan (pictured), 88, died on the evening of January 6 - a week following the death of her husband, Bernard, at the carehome they shared . The veteran sprang to prominence after sparking a police search when he left The Pines care home in Hove, telling carers he was going for a walk - but in reality he hopped on a ferry to France to go to D-Day events in Normandy. He was wearing his war medals and a grey mac and his whereabouts emerged only when a younger veteran phoned later that night, on June 5, to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe. Royal Navy veteran Mr Jordan, an ex-mayor of Hove, told reporters on his return that his aim was to remember his fallen 'mates'. Speaking in interviews after his escapade, he described how he kept his exploit secret from his wife: ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss. I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss. 'I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.” Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out.’ Mr Jordan had, in past interviews, referred to his wife as a ‘smashing woman’. A statement from Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare which runs  care home where the couple lived, confirmed Mrs Jordan's death. Floral tributes laid inside the hearse with messages 'Rest in Peace Irene and Bernard'. His wife Irene died at the age of 88 on January 6 . 'Beloved sister and brother-in-law to the late Harold Moffatt. Sadly missed, by Joan, John and Louise,' reads one message placed on flowers . The Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan's decision to go to France highlighted 'the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation' Mr Jordan, an ex-mayor of Hove, was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove in a special ceremony at Brighton Town Hall last year . It said: 'Irene and Bernie will both be much missed by everyone at the home and our thoughts and prayers go out to their friends and family at this sad time.' Mr Jordan had decided to join British veterans, most making their final pilgrimage to revisit the scene of their momentous invasion, to remember the heroes of the liberation of Europe in June 2014. Some 156,000 Allied troops landed on the five invasion beaches on June 6 1944, sparking an 80-day campaign to liberate Normandy involving three million troops and costing 250,000 lives. Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this June. Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life. Following his death, the Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan's decision to go to France highlighted 'the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation'. On his 90th birthday, days after he returned from his escapade, he was inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world. Mr Jordan was later made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove in a special ceremony at Brighton Town Hall. He joined an elite list to receive the honour, including Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, former Olympic champion Steve Ovett, and First World War hero Henry Allingham, who became the world's oldest man before his death aged 113 in 2009.

"World number one Novak Djokovic is through to Sunday's final of the Australian Open after a less-than-convincing face-off with defending Melbourne champion Stan Wawrinka. The match was one of twists and turns, with an uneven performance on both sides which had spectators wondering about the energy levels and health of Djokovic. The 27-year-old admitted in the post-match interview that the error-riddled game had sapped him of his energy after the third set, but said he still thought he had played well. Scroll down for video . Novak Djokovic is through to the final of the Australian Open after beating Stanislas Warwrinka in five-sets . 'We pushed each other to limit,' said Djokovic. 'As was the case in the past three years, it took five sets, and credit to Stan for that.' The match played out over the course of a curious 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 to a victory for the Serb. Djokovic said that the many unforced errors he had played during the match had disadvantaged his game, and that he had made his life 'very difficult on court'. After winning the third set against Wawrinka, the world number one walked back onto the court, appearing not to have noticed that the set was over. After Wawrinka netted with the forehand, Djokovic turned around and looked surprised as security ran onto the court as they usually do during the set break. Umpire James Keothavong had a good laugh at Djokovic as he sheepishly walked to his courtside chair. Djokovic was cloyed by the tension of a semi-final that turned in the decider when the Swiss missed his chance of an early breakthrough and subsided from there. The reaction at the end was more one of relief. Stanislas Wawrinka gets across to hit a return to Novak Djokovic during their semi-final match on Friday . Serbia's Novak Djokovic plays a shot during his men's singles semi-final match against Stanislas Wawrinka . This move had some commentators wondering whether his flagging energy was to blame for the lack of concentration. When asked during the post-match interview whether he had ever experienced something similar during his career, he said that he might have 'in [his] junior days'. 'Sometimes these things happen, you get carried away by the moment,' he said. 'In a semi final in a full stadium where there's a lot of tension and emotion, and you're both trying to do your personal best, sometimes you can't keep track of score.' The Serb will now face Andy Murray on Sunday evening for the men's grand final, which Djokovic said he was looking forward to. 'Andy and I go back to 12 years old, that's when we first met, there's only a week difference in age between us,' Djokovic said. 'We have a very friendly relationship off court, so it will be nice to see each other and be playing another grand slam against each other,' he said.

Djokovic holds a 15-8 record over Murray and has won seven times out of the last eight, the exception being the famous Wimbledon final of 2013. Twice he has beaten Murray in the Melbourne final, although it was the 27 year-old Scot who had the more impressive passage through the last four. American powerhouse Serena Williams also appeared to be under the weather,  retiring from practice on Friday afternoon after only ten minutes of play. Ahead of her Australian open final against Russia's Maria Sharapova, Williams was hunched over in pain after a rigorous start to her workout. Williams has been plagued by health problems over the past year, appearing to be under the weather in interviews leading up to her semi-final match, and said that she was afraid she had caught a virus. Williams, 33, was comforted on court at Melbourne Park by her coach and boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, who has been assisting the world number one since 2012. 'I've felt better, but I'm feeling OK. I'm just happy to still be in the tournament', said Williams. Former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe attended the match .

"A gang created an elaborate underground cannabis factory in a series of buried shipping containers that were accessed through a trapdoor cut into a caravan, a court heard. The subterranean enterprise, cultivating plants with a street value of £150,000, had running water, electricity, and its own sophisticated air supply system. Cunning Adam Williams, 42, and David Bradbury, 51, had buried the four capsules in a remote field in the West Country and covered them with two caravans. The duo had then cut trapdoors into the floor of one of the caravans and used a series of ladders to climb down into the submerged containers. Scroll down for video .

Inside one of the caravans that the gang had cut a trapdoors into, so they could enter their submerged cave . The subterranean enterprise had running water, electricity, and its own sophisticated air supply system . Each container was its own mini cannabis production unit and was equipped with powerful lights to help the cannabis plants grow. A police video showed the interior of the factory with ventilation pipes and fans powered by a complex electrical set-up. A deck chair can also be seen nestled among the growing plants. When police raided the cave-style operation  they discovered a crop of more than 150 plants, worth an estimated £150,000. Bradbury was jailed for three-and-a-half years, and Williams was sent to prison for four-and-a-half years for production of cannabis at Taunton Crown Court in May last year.

"One of South Africa's most notorious apartheid murderers, known as 'Prime Evil', has been granted parole  after 20 years in jail. Eugene De Kock carried out a reign of terror in which he committed more than 100 acts of murder, torture and fraud as head of the infamous Vlakplaas police death squad which targeted anti-apartheid activists. The highly decorated former colonel was sentenced to two life terms plus 212 years in prison for his crimes, including the 1982 bombing of the ANC's London offices. Scroll down for video . Euguene De Kock has been granted parole after serving 20 years in prison for a string of apartheid-era crimes . South Africa's Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha told a news briefing today: 'In the interest of nation-building and reconciliation I have decided to place Mr De Kock on parole.' De Kock admitted his vile past to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 1995 to consider amnesty for those who confessed their crimes during apartheid. The run-up to the parole decision rekindled bitter debate over the crimes of the former white-minority regime. To some his crimes of multiple murder, kidnapping and torture were too heinous for forgiveness. To others, the former police officer was a symbolic and repentant prisoner serving time as a scapegoat for countless perpetrators of apartheid evil who were never punished. Michael Masutha (right) has granted De Kock (left) parole 'In the interest of nation-building and reconciliation' It is a point De Kock made in his court appeal against last year's parole denial. 'I am the only member of the South African Police Service that is serving a sentence for crimes which I had committed, as part of the National Party's attempt to uphold apartheid and fight the liberation movements. 'Not one of the previous generals, or ministers who were in cabinet up to 1990 have been prosecuted at all,' he wrote. He has apparently been a model prisoner, engaging with the families of his victims and cooperating with the government in locating the dumped bodies of those he killed. De Kock has made confessions before tribunals, written letters begging forgiveness and named top officials who gave him orders. He has been eligible for parole consideration for more than seven years, but his second bid for release was denied in July, against the recommendation of the parole board.

"At least 12 people have been killed in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk following a day of bloody clashes between pro-Russia separatists and government forces. Two people were killed when a mortar shell exploded near a bus stop, with another five killed outside a community centre whilst waiting for humanitarian aid. Another five people died as the city suffered heavy artillery bombardment on a day of chaos in the Ukraine.

Chaos: Locals try to go about their daily business as a man lies dead in the street in Donetsk. The city suffered heavy artillery bombardment on a day of chaos . Death: At least 12 people were killed in Donetsk after intense artillery fire. It was not immediately clear if the shells that caused the deaths had been fired by government troops or pro-Russian separatists . Slaughter: A bloodstained hand can be seen underneath a blanket following the day of fighting in the war-torn city in eastern Ukraine . Terror: men are seen cowering in fear as heavy artillery fire explodes around Donetsk. Clashes between pro-Russian separatists and government forces have intensified in recent weeks . Pictures showed scenes of chaos in the city, as terrified locals were forced to run for their lives after battle erupted on the streets. Full-blown fighting between the rebels and government forces erupted anew earlier this month following a period of relative tranquility. Tonight, it was not immediately clear if the shells that caused the deaths had been fired by government troops or pro-Russian separatists. Hostilities now seem to be focused around Debaltseve, a railway hub which could prove a crucial link between the rebels in Donetsk and in Luhansk to the northeast to it. While clashes in east Ukraine rage, hopes are still being invested in reviving a peace process that has been undermined with every new day of fighting. Comfort: Three bodies covered by blankets can be seen in the background as a man comforts a woman following a day of bloodshed in Donetsk. Horror: Men look at the covered bodies of victims at a site hit by shelling in Donetsk.

Grim: Men remove the body of one of the dead who was killed in the day of intense fighting . Bleak: Fear is etched on the faces of locals who were close to the scene of the shelling . Two rebel representatives went to Minsk in Belarus for peace talks today, but went back to eastern Ukraine a few hours later after the Ukrainian representative failed to turn up. Donetsk rebel representative Denis Pushilin insisted that the rebels' ongoing offence is a way to protect the civilians from Ukrainian artillery fire and said they will go ahead with it unless Kiev stops shelling the rebel-held areas. He said: 'The situation has worsened and it is forcing us to go on offensive. New victims are inevitable, I'm afraid.' It was also revealed today that United States Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Ukraine next week to show  support for the government as Ukrainian troops fight pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that Kerry will be in Kiev for talks with senior Ukrainian officials and lawmakers on February 5. Kerry will then to head to an international security conference in Munich, Germany. The US and Russia have been at increasing odds over the situation in Ukraine with Washington routinely accusing Moscow of supporting the rebels with heavy weaponry, including tanks and artillery, as well as military advice and personnel. Moscow denies those allegations and charges that US and European support for the government in Kiev is fueling the fighting. The violence has intensified again in recent days. UN estimates say that more than 5,100 people have been killed in the conflict so far.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Rescued from car boot sales and online auctions, these throw-back images from the 1950s and 60s showcase a long-forgotten Britain and highlight how this country has been changed beyond recognition in the space of a single generation. Where once there was  a bustling city centre and a quaint family-owned chemist, there is now nothing more than a carpark and a charity shop. In one shot from the 1960s the Mayor of St Ives is seen strutting through the city centre dressed in his red robes of office, surrounded by officials decked in purple, medals from the all too recent First and Second World Wars pinned proudly to their chests. By comparison a photograph taken in precisely the same spot today  shows a mass of parked cars, double-yellow lines, railings, benches, and parking machines - though the town's war memorial still stands tall. Then: The Mayor of St Ives and town officials are pictured walking through the main square with medals, likely from service in the recent Second World War, pinned to their chests . And now: While the War Memorial still takes pride of place, little else has remained the same as car parking has been added, along with modern road markings, a parking machine, railings and benches . Quaint: Bryant's party shop is pictured next to family chemist (right) in St Ives while classic cars can been seen parked along the street . Today: The party shop has been replaced with a department store, while a charity shop occupies the site of the old chemist . This remarkable set of pictures, which would make even the most hardened heart long for the Britain of 50 years ago, was put together by collector and amateur photographer Martin Snelling. But a second set of comparison photographs, taken half a century later, also reveals how much this nation has changed during those years. If she were alive today, the Queen Mother would barely recognise a lawn in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, where she took a stroll outside an agriculture show in 1960s, in front of cheering crowds. Today, the building has been transformed into a Toyota garage, while the lawn itself has been tarmacked over as a space to park the display cars. A small verge which borders the main road is all the greenery that is left. The only thing that has hardly changed is the River Ouse cutting the same course as ever through the village of Hemingford Grey, nestled just below St Ives, where a group of leisure seekers were pictured rowing along in 1960. Time gone by: Old fashioned cars and a van for Smedley's Frozen Foods are parked along Bridge Street in the centre of St Ives . Modern Britain: A row of hi-tech cars sit along the much wider pavement, while the shops in the background have long-since changed hands . Out for a stroll: The Queen Mother waves to the crowds and amateur photographers as she walks on a lawn outside an agricultural fair in St Ives, Cambridgshire, in 1960 . Transformed: Another image taken of the same site today shows it has been turned into a Toyota garage, while the lawn has been covered with tarmac to provide space for the display cars . The old images, which portray a forgotten age in the years after the Second World War as Britain learned to enjoy itself once more, were among 200 60mm and 70mm slides Mr Snelling found on for sale on eBay. Old-fashioned shops line streets dotted with classic 1950s and 1960s cars, couples wear their finest clothes as they enjoy an al fresco meal on their patio and children flock in their masses to church for Sunday schools. He has spent the past six months collecting more than 6,000 retro slides as part of an art project documenting the changing face of Britain. In one of the more astonishing pictures Heathrow is seen without the modern-day entrance halls, shopping centres, jet planes and departure gates. Instead a single piece of tarmac is dotted with propeller-engined planes, while passengers walk across the runway on foot. At a traditional country fair a car can be won for just one shilling, while a sign proclaims 'Please help us to help the spastics' - a dated term used to refer to sufferers of cerebral palsy. Taking a punt: A man and a group of women enjoy a leisurely day out as they row their way down the River Ouse, in Hemmingford Grey . Unchanged: The river is one of the few things that remains unchanged in half a century, winding the same path as always through the country . Happy as a sandboy: Two women and a young boy enjoy a day out at the beach at Hunstanton, Norfolk in 1960 . Early days: A British European Airways flight is boarded by passengers at Heathrow in this colourful photo taken in the late 1950s . Scenic: Passengers casually lean out of the window of a steam train as it snakes through the Welsh hills in September 1958 . The amateur photographer regularly picks up boxes of the pictures at auctions and car boot sales but bought the most recent batch  for £13. He was sent two boxes of old slides but when he opened them up he found nearly all of them were all taken in St Ives. Believing the pictures were taken by one man named David Bryant, Mr Snelling, 44, launched an online campaign to return the album to its original owner or his descendants. He has now had contact with Mr Bryant's son, who has said he does not want to be reunited with the images. Sunday school: A large group of children gather for church school on a sunny day in Spring in St. Ives, Cambridgeshire in 1958 . Artistic: Weathered boats docked in water near a church surrounded by trees at Hemingford Grey on the Great Ouse, near St. Ives . Al fresco: A couple enjoy a spot of lunch on the patio outside their home on a sunny day in St. Ives in April 1958 . March: The Mayor is followed by a procession including a judge and a priest during the annual Mayor's Parade in St. Ives, 1960. The man with the top hat to the right of the vicar has been identified as Jack Bullen, town clerk of St. Ives at the time . He did not explain his decision, but told the photographer that he wanted to get rid of the slides and had actually dumped them in a skip himself. Mr Bryant's son revealed his father and mother Molly as well as his sister Jane have all since passed away. Now Mr Snelling is hoping to track down the faces in the photos and reunite them with lost glimpses of their former lives. He said: 'There are other families involved who are in the photos and who I would like to get in touch with. 'There was a lot of information on these ones which helped me work out the people involved whereas other ones I collect have very little detail. 'It is a great feeling when you eventually reunite people with these childhood memories and I want to track down the faces in the pictures.' The father-of-three, from Portchester, Hampshire, added: 'They show a lot of family moments like christenings, weddings and family holidays. Quaint: A woman walks up a road winding parallel to the seafront at Bournemouth in this stunning picture taken in 1958 .

Wrapped up warm: A young girl wearing matching red gloves and wellington boots pictures in a garden in St. Ives in 1960 . 'The colours are amazing and still remain strong. They have been placed in glass and have obviously been in storage which has protected them from the light.' He added: 'I think I was searching eBay one day because I was in a creative rut. I picked up some slides for about £3 and got addicted. 'I just thought it would be interesting to see how people and places had changed over the past few decades. 'My wife isn't best pleased because the house is now full of boxes of photographic slides.' Break from the slopes: A group of skiers are seen relaxing and drinking outside a bar in Wengen, Switzerland in 1959 . Bargain! A car is offered as a competition prize, entry for which is just one shilling, at a fair believed to have been held at at Kimbolton School, Cambridgeshire. The sign 'help the spastics' is an outdated reference to cerebral palsy sufferers and is no longer acceptable to use . One of the particularly scenic photos was taken from a popular boathouse with upstairs tea rooms and a balcony overlooking the Geat Ouse. The boathouse was built by Ernest Giddins in the 1920s. After his early death, it was subsequently run by his brother Jack until it was taken over post-war by Jack's son Rodney. Sadly, the wooden building required major renovation and restoration during the 1970s and the funds were not available to carry out the work so it had to be demolished. In the late 1950s, a trip out on one of the boats would have cost around one shilling per hour or five shillings for the day. Pensive: This photo dates back to May 1958 and was captioned as the Bournemouth Round Table Conference . Dated: A woman walks past Barton Chemist on Bridge Street, St. Ives, Cambridgeshire, in 1960 . Mr Snelling bought the slides on eBay on January 2 from a man who found them at an auction in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. The seller knew nothing of their history so Mr Snelling posted the images on social media, and he now wants to identify the people pictured in the album. The rest of the St. Ives slides can be viewed at http://www.viewfromthisside.com/ .

"A mansion on a street dubbed Billionaires' Row was sold for £33.7million in December - 2,750 times more than the month's cheapest deal in Britain. Eight-bedroom Jersey House, a 20,000 sq/ft new build located on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London, sold for the huge sum last month. The stately home - on one of the capital's most exclusive streets - comes with an indoor swimming pool, staff accommodation and more than an acre of land. Meanwhile a one-bed flat in the North East fetched just £12,250 at auction - the cheapest sale in Britain in December. Stately home: Jersey Hose, an eight-bedroom mansion on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London, sold for £33.7million in December -  the most expensive property of the month . Meanwhile the cheapest deal in December was for a flat in this block in Washington, Tyne and Wear, which sold for £12,250 at auction . Grand: Jersey House's reception hall (pictured) has a 21-foot high ceiling, eight person lift and a dining room large enough to hold ten . Splendid Jersey House has a reception hall with a 21-foot high ceiling, eight person lift and a dining room large enough to hold ten. The master suite alone is spread over 1,800 sq/ft - twice the size of the average new home. Ten different types of marble were used in the construction of Jersey House, with the floors decked out in 'luxurious deep woven wool carpet'. The mansion was originally put on the market for £39million, but was reduced last year to just under £35million. It has now been sold for £33.7million, making it the most expensive sale of December and the third highest of the year. This is considerably more than the £4.2million paid for the site back in 2001. Glentree International is thought to be the estate agency behind the deal. The property - on one of the capital's most exclusive streets - comes with an indoor swimming pool, staff accommodation and 1.2 acres of land . Pricey: The floors of the £33.7million home are decked out in 'luxurious deep woven wool carpet' The mansion was originally put on the market for £39million, but it was reduced last year to just under £35million . Agency boss Trevor Abrahmsohn, whose total property sales on The Bishops Avenue totals £3billion, declined to comment. The sale was logged with the Land Registry on December 5, the day after the controversial stamp duty changes were introduced. If they managed to get the deal through before the changes were implemented, the buyer would have paid £2.35million in stamp duty, far less than £3.95million they would pay now. The mammoth sale was 2,750 times more than the £12,250 paid for the one-bed flat in Washington, near Sunderland, which was originally offered for less than £10,000. While the London property is a state-of-the-art 'turnkey' home, the Washington is one of a block of small flats. It was bought at auction and boasts a bedroom, lounge, kitchen and bathroom. The flat has a rental value of £313 a month, pennies compared to the £20,000 a month Jersey House would command. The flat on Waterloo Walk, Washington, comes with one bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen and living room . The flat in Washington (pictured) cost 2,750 times less than Jersey House and has a rental value of £313 a month . The Land Registry's latest report says there were 1,132 homes sold for more than £1million in October - up from 984 in October 2013. However, the recent stamp duty hike, a fear of a mansion tax and the election looming has prompted one industry expert to predict a drop in big sales. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'The million pound market was already slowing in the Autumn and whilst we wait for official figures I think this trend continued up to Christmas. 'Buying a property after George Osborne changed the stamp duty bands has become very expensive - enough to put some people completely off the idea of moving. 'In the first half of 2015 I expect sales of £1million homes to be just a fraction of what they were last year as small time developers retreat and even those end-users think twice about sitting down and playing big boy Monopoly. 'The second half of the decade looks like it will be very different from the first. 'The top end of the market is certainly pausing for breath. The question is whether it is gets a second wind.' The average price of a home in England and Wales is now £177,766, which is a seven per cent year-on-year increase but still £3,500 lower than in 2008. This is helped in part by London, where homes typically cost £464,936. The cheapest place to buy is the North East, where the average property is just £99,132.","Eight-room stately home Jersey House sold for £33.7million in December .

"One of the last surviving Doolittle Raiders who attacked Japan during a daring World War II mission credited with boosting American morale, has died. Lt. Col. Edward Saylor was a young flight engineer-gunner when he volunteered for the dangerous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo on April 28, 1942. Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan. Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety. Lt. Col. Ed Saylor (left) one of the last surviving members of the Doolittle Raid has died aged 94 . 'It was what you do ... over time, we've been told what effect our raid had on the war and the morale of the people,' Saylor told The Associated Press in a 2013 interview. Son Rod Saylor said his father died of natural causes aged 94 on Wednesday in Sumner, Washington. Tom Casey, a manager for the Doolittle Raiders, said  that, despite the risks, 'they all volunteered to go anyway.' 'He did something very famous,'he added. The 16 B-25 bombers, each carrying five men, dropped bombs on targets such as factory areas and military installations and headed to designated airfields in mainland China realizing that they would run out of fuel, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. In 2013, retired Lt. Col Saylor joined fellow survivors of the history-making World War II Doolittle Raid retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole and David Thatcher at a Florida Air Force base for a final public reunion . The raiders still toast their fallen comrades each year using silver goblets which have the name of each raider inscribed . Lt. Col. Edward Saylor was a young flight engineer-gunner when he volunteered for the dangerous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo on April 28, 1942 (pictured) Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers. Of the eight Raiders captured by Japanese soldiers, three were executed and another died in captivity. Saylor told the AP in 2013 that he was one of the lucky ones. 'There were a whole bunch of guys in World War II; a lot of people didn't come back,' he said. The brave crewman grew up on a ranch in Brusett, Montana, and enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1939. He was just 22 when he volunteered for the Doolittle Raid and went onto serve in the Air Force for 28 years before retiring as a lieutenant colonel. 'At the time of the raid, you know the war was on and it was just a mission we went on, we were lucky enough to survive it but it didn't seem like that big of a deal at the time,' Saylor said in 2013. 'I spent the rest of the war in Europe and with the guys in Normandy and taking bodies out of airplanes and stuff and I didn't feel like a hero. Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan . Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety . Gen. James H. Doolittle (pictured) led airmen on the daring raid on Japan during World War II . 'My reaction when I out found out we were bombing Japan from an aircraft carrier was that it was too far to swim back home so we might as well go ahead with it,' he said. 'I never learned how to swim.'I was raised on a cattle ranch out in Montana.' In 2013, retired Lt. Col Saylor joined fellow survivors of the history-making World War II Doolittle Raid retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole and David Thatcher at a Florida Air Force base for a final public reunion. The fourth surviving raider, Robert Hite, could not make the event. They decided to meet at Eglin base because it is where they trained for their top-secret mission in the winter of 1942, just weeks after the Japanese devastated the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. 'I didn't expect to survive. We should have been shot down,' said Saylor. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter maintenance hangar at Elgin base was named in his honor. The Raiders also received the Congressional Gold Medal for heroism and valor and would still toast their fallen comrades each year using silver goblets which have the name of each raider inscribed. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific . The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety . The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.' The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces.","The April 1942 air raid gave Americans hope in the wake of Pearl Harbour .

"A Philadelphia radio station has released an excruciating, never-before-seen clip of the moment Chris Christie slipped from a chair in its studio. The New Jersey governor was trying to sit down at SportsRadio 94WIP last June when he promptly fell from the chair, in a scene right out of a slapstick comedy. With a look of horror on his face, Christie lands with a bump. 'We've got a chair issue!' host Angelo Cataldi can be heard saying as crew members rush over to the portly politician. In the footage, Christie looks shocked - especially once he notices the camera - but manages to get on his feet as he says: 'We're alright now.' Trouble ahead: Chris Christie enters the SportsRadio 94WIP studio ahead of his interview last June . Going, going...: Christie tries to sit on a chair but promptly slips off with a look of horror on his face . Ouch: The stunned politician falls to the ground as the chair gets away from him . The footage, which was taken ahead of the station's interview with Christie last June, was released during the station's Wing Bowl on Friday after they added a comedy soundtrack to the slip-up. Cataldi, who lives in New Jersey, had been shocked when Christie was seen cheering for the Dallas Cowboys from owner Jerry Jones' box - and pressed him about it on the show. Christie famously follows the Cowboys despite his team having a long-standing rivalry with the New York Giants in his own state because they play in the same NFL conference every year. Christie told Cataldi he always knew he would take heat for being a Cowboys fan, but did not deny it when he was asked about it when he first ran for governor. The day after he revealed his allegiance, Jones called him to say, 'Buddy, I'm so proud,' he said. Christie was also filmed hugging Jones and his son Stephen after Dallas defeated the Detroit Lions in a game earlier this month. The radio station shared the footage on Friday as questions remain over whether the governor will make a 2016 bid for the White House. Earlier this week, he started his fundraising effort by filing paperwork to form a political action committee. Red-faced: Christie finally gets to his feet and assures the crew and viewers: 'We're alright now' Back to work: Christie appeared on the show in June, pictured, but the footage has only just been shared . The politician has long been named as a potential contender for the Republican seat, and among the speculation are questions over whether he has lost weight to get in shape for the bid. In November, a leading weight loss doctor estimated that the Christie has lost at least 100 pounds since undergoing gastric band surgery in February 2013. Despite having visibly slimmed down since undergoing the surgery, Christie has to date refused to put a figure on his weight loss. Christie has struggled with his weight for years and said he decided to have the Lap-band surgery for his 'long-term health' and for the sake of his family.

"A school have been forced to apologise after an 'exemplar' slide  which listed Ukip as a racist group alongside Neo Nazis and compared the party's beliefs to Hitler's was shown to hundreds of pupils. The UK Independence Party was named alongside far-right groups the British National Party and English Defence League as part of a 'thought for the week' session surrounding the Holocaust. Bridge Learning Campus in Bristol sent out the presentation to all tutor groups within the secondary school, which caters for 660 pupils aged 11 to 16, to form the basis for a discussion. This comes days after headteacher Keziah Featherstone  was accused of double standards after a pupil was allegedly expelled following a row about his hairstyle - despite having dyed hair herself. Scroll down for video . Keziah Featherstone, headteacher of the Bristol school, said the slide which listed Ukip as a racist group alongside Neo Nazis was a 'genuine error' from one individual . The slide, headed The Rise of Racist Groups, said: 'You have the right to believe what you want - but if you have racist ideas and discriminate against a group of people – then you are a racist.' It was written by one teacher who is currently being investigated and is said to be 'mortified' by the blunder. The presentation which also claimed parties were trying to 'sound reasonable by hiding their racism' has prompted a furious response among Ukip representatives. Michael Frost, who is Bristol's first Ukip councillor, representing Hengrove, said: 'At that young age, pupils have got knowledge-thirsty minds and something like this could give them a false impression of a legitimate mainstream party, showing them to be something they are not. 'The teacher has a serious responsibility in the education of our young people. Whether deliberate or naive, this is serious.' Bridge Learning Campus in Bristol sent out the presentation to all tutor groups within the secondary school, which caters for 660 pupils aged 11 to 16 . The slide, shown to pupils on Wednesday, said: 'Some group rise up and spout racist ideas – they want to discriminate against a group of people but want to sound respectable – they want to sound reasonable and hide their racism by trying to give reasons for their anger hate and violence. 'But listen carefully and you will hear they are not so different from Hitler – and that is what is scary.' John Langley, UKIP's Bristol spokesman, said: 'This is outrageous and highly inflammatory given that some students may live in Hengrove where we have an elected councillor who is very much anti-racist. 'It is a dangerous attempt to defame UKIP as we head towards another election, and leaves Bridge Learning Campus in an untenable position of showing inappropriate political bias contrary to law.' He said the teaching material was in breach of the 1996 Education Act, which states that bias should be avoided when teaching political issues. The matter has been referred to HM Inspectorate of Education and Ofsted. Keziah Featherstone, headteacher of the Bristol school, said the slide was a 'genuine error' from one individual who has been at the school for several years. 'It was sent out as part of 'thought for the week' which centered around the Holocaust. It was to be used to form a discussion at tutor time,' she said. Ms Featherstone hit the headlines earlier this week after expelling a pupil who posted a picture of her with dyed hair on his Facebook timeline with the caption: 'This is not an example to set to other students' 'One teacher usually produces an exemplar slide and it is then sent round to all the form group tutors who can use it to form the basis of a discussion. 'The nature of a school means there is not enough time for everything to be thoroughly checked. 'The teacher in question is currently being investigated. It was a genuine mistake and the teacher is mortified.' Ms Featherstone hit the headlines earlier this week after it was reported that a pupil was expelled after posting a picture of her with dyed hair on his Facebook with the caption: 'This is not an example to set to other students'. Michael Frost, who is Bristol's first Ukip councillor, said: 'Whether deliberate or naive, this is serious' Jordan Ford, 14, was upset after the headteacher  told him his red Mohawk hair style was unacceptable. So he  found a picture of Ms Featherstone in which she also appears to have dyed purple hair and posted it on social media - attracting 50 comments which made reference to her looks and weight. The school's 'racist groups' presentation has also sparked a furious response on social media. Marilyn Laurence said: 'I would like to register a complaint that Bridge Learning Campus are teaching pupils that UKIP are racist - please explain.' Danny Carroll tweeted saying: 'Hope @UKIP will reporting #bridgelearningcampus for slander.' Mark Davies, chief executive of the school, said: 'The slide was used in a class discussion about community relationships and tolerance, and was designed to stimulate debate among our pupils. 'It was a mistake for UKIP to have been listed along with the other groups, and I have apologised to the party for its inclusion. 'The reference has been removed from the slide and the teacher concerned has apologised and we have taken steps to ensure it will not reappear in future.' A school governors' chairman was forced to quit his post after joining Ukip because they political party's policies are 'against it's ethos' in November last year. Mike Ward claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip.","'Exemplar' slide sent out which listed Ukip as 'racist' along with BNP .

"An Israeli conductor collapsed and died in the middle of a performance as horrified audience members looked on. Internationally renowned Israel Yinon, 59, was directing an orchestra at the Lucerne Culture and Convention Centre last night, concert organizers said. Midway through conducting the Youth Philharmonic Orchestra of Central Switzerland in a rendition of Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony, he collapsed and tumbled off the platform headfirst, according to Neue Luzerner Zeitung. Israel Yinon collapsed and died while conducting a performance of Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony . The symphony had reached an instrumental 'summit' when the concert hall was filled with screams from musicians and members of the audience in the front row, the newspaper said. Yinon was internationally renowned and had conducted the BBC Symphony and Berlin Symphony orchestras . Musicians left the stage and the audience was asked to leave the concert hall. Marc Reinhardt, a spokesman for Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, whose students were performing, told the Associated Press an audience member tried to save Yinon, but he died in the ambulance on his way to a hospital. He had no details on what led the conductor to collapse and it is not yet known what caused his death. The theme of the concert was 'the healing Alps' which, as various Swiss media noted, was a cruel irony given how events unfolded. Yinon had previously conducted the BBC Symphony and Berlin Symphony orchestras, and various others across Europe, making numerous CD recordings. He was initially trained in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Yinon had previously led the students of the Jungen Philharmonie Zentralschweiz orchestra in concerts in 2009 and 2012. The school said they lost 'not only a highly regarded musical colleague and sensitive educator, but a big-hearted friend.'

The CCTV footage, which was shown on a local TV report, quickly went viral in her homeland.

'I was inside for three days and I'm still off work as a result of my injuries. 'I wasn't aware of anybody in front of me as I passed the reception desk talking to a girl, and as I looked towards the receptionist I suddenly felt two pairs of hands shove me over. 'I hit the floor but when I looked up I couldn't see anybody, and I thought they probably had run off.' Ms Carrasco said she had never believed in ghosts and is now frightened of leaving the house. She added: 'When the receptionist told me that there was nobody there, I didn't believe them until they showed me the footage. Now I am convinced that it was a ghost because I felt the hands even though there was nobody around.' The CCTV footage quickly went viral in her homeland after it was featured on a local news report on TV . Ms Carrasco (pictured) said: 'I'm worried the ghost might be after me. I have no idea why I was shoved over' She said: 'I remember seeing a film where a ghosts kept attacking a woman and now I'm worried the ghost might be after me. I have no idea why I was shoved over.' Hospital staff confirmed the woman had head injuries conducive with having fallen over or been pushed over. Local parapsychologist Rodolfo Orozco said: 'It certainly seems as if something supernatural happened here but in order to investigate it more, we would really need to look at the energy levels in the building, and so far we have not been invited to investigate by the owners.' Doctors, however, are sceptical that it was ghosts saying that the woman had received a substantial blow to the head, and that could have caused confusion about the circumstances of her injury. They were unable however to explain the video which appears to show her being shoved with some force backwards.

"A convicted drug dealer has been charged with murdering a Hollywood studio executive whose remains were found in the desert last fall, nearly two years after his disappearance. John Lenzie Creech, 42, was charged Thursday with 57-year-old Gavin Smith's death, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Smith, who was married with three children, was last seen leaving a female friend's home in Ventura County's Oak Park neighborhood May 1, 2012. Scroll down for videos . Case closed: Drug dealer John Lenzie Creech (left), 42, has been charged with the 2012 murder of 57-year-old Hollywood movie studio executive Gavin Smith (right) Femme fatale: Smith allegedly had an affair with Creech's wife, Chandrika (pictured), whom he met in drug rehab in 2009 . Hikers discovered the remains about 70 miles away, near Palmdale in rural Antelope Valley, on October 26, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Authorities said earlier they had found Smith's black 2000 Mercedes-Benz at a Simi Valley storage facility nine months after his disappearance. Its condition along with witness statements led them to believe Smith was killed. Investigators found Smith's blood and body tissue, including skin stuck to the car's seat. He was declared dead in May of 2014 and a death certificate was issued for him, even though no remains had been found. In November, police said a skull and other bones found by hikers in a shallow grave in the desert east of Los Angeles had been identified as belonging to Smith. Authorities have not said how Smith was killed. Creech has been a longtime person of interest in the Sheriff's Department investigation. Missing: 20 Century Fox executive Gavin Smith was last seen on May 1, 2012. After a year investigating his disappearance, police declared Smith dead and said it was a homicide case . The storage facility where Smith's car was found was linked to Creech, who is serving an eight-year jail sentence after pleading no contest to one count of transportation for sale of a controlled substance in September 2012. A law enforcement official previously told the Associated Press that Smith was believed to have had a romantic relationship with Creech's wife, Chandrika, after meeting her in drug rehabilitation in 2009. Smith was with Fox's movie distribution department for nearly 18 years and was a branch manager for several theaters. He was also known for playing on UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team. Creech is scheduled to be arraigned on the new felony charge Monday. If convicted, he faces 25 years to life in state prison. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said in November that hikers stumbled across human remains in the area of the Angeles National Forest on October 26, KTLA5 reported. They were later identified as the 57-year-old husband and father of three sons. A cause of death has not yet been determined, as autopsy results were not finasalizedNishida said.

Smith, pictured here with his family, was apparently setting up a home for his mistress and her family . Smith was last seen in May in Ventura County in Los Angeles after leaving a friend's home. His wife, Lisa, reported him missing the following day when he failed to pick up their eldest son, Evan, to take him to school, as he had promised to do. In March last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech. At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with John Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, whom he met in drug rehab. John Creech is currently in prison on unrelated drug charges. Frustrated police said that while they had a number of leads in the investigation, they did not have enough evidence to lay charges and the absence of a body was a significant hole in the case. Two years after going missing, in May 2014, a death certificate was issued for Smith, with the death officially recorded as May 1, 2012 - the day he disappeared. Gavin and Lisa Smith on their wedding day. At the time of his disappearance, Gavin Smith was in the grip of a mid-life crisis involving drugs and at least two mistresses, Mrs Smith said . Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, was devastating to his wife and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin. Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband. 'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.' She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women. Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their lavish Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills. Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus. She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Chandrika Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family. It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house. Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress women. 'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said. She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.

Michael Moore has confirmed that Clint Eastwood had previously threatened his life as the fallout between the pair continues after the filmmaker criticized the director's movie, American Sniper. Writing on his Facebook page, the documentary maker said Eastwood made the comments in January 2005 - '10 years ago this week' at the National Board of Review Awards dinner. Moore said Eastwood announced 'to me and to the crowd that he would 'kill' me if I ever came to his house with my camera for an interview. 'I'll kill you,' he declared.' At the time Eastwood was being honored for his film Million Dollar Baby. He made the comments after referring to Moore's on-camera confrontation with then-National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston in his documentary Bowling For Columbine. Speaking from the stage, Eastwood Said: 'Michael Moore and I actually have a lot in common. 'We both appreciate living in a country where there's free expression. But, Michael, if you ever show up at my front door with a camera, I'll kill you.' Moore said he laughed nervously along with the rest of the audience. He assumed, Eastwood was joking. He wrote: Having just experienced a half-dozen assaults in the previous year from crazies upset at 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and my anti-war Oscar speech, plus the attempt by a right wing extremist to blow up my house (he was caught in time and went to prison), I was a bit stunned to hear Eastwood, out of the blue, make such a violent statement. But I instantly decided he was just trying to be funny, so I laughed the same nervous laugh everyone else did. Clint, though, didn't seem to like all that laughter. 'I mean it,' he barked, and the audience grew more quiet. 'I'll shoot you.' Moore said there was a 'smattering of approving applause', but most people simply turned around to check his reaction.

Eastwood's movie American Sniper has been a box-office hit but has sparked widespread debate; the director is pictured above at the AFL Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month, . Blockbuster: The film stars Bradley Cooper as real-life Naxy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, who was tragically killed just a few years after leaving the military . He said: 'I tried to keep that fake smile on my face so as to appear as if he hadn't 'gotten' to me. But he had. I then mumbled to those sitting at my table. 'I think Dirty Harry just said, ""Make my day, punk.''' Moore sparked a flurry of debate after he spoke out on Twitter following the release of Eastwood's box-office record beating American Sniper, calling snipers 'cowards'. Sarah Palin was one of many high-profile people to defend the film calling out Moore for his 'disrespect' of U.S. troops. While attending the Iowa Freedom Summit last week, the former vice presidential candidate posed with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, who held up a sign reading 'F*** you Michael Moore'. In his Facebook page, Moore goes on to say that Eastwood is a 'great filmmaker' and that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time, before then proceeding to attack him further. He writes: 'But something started to go haywire with Clint in the last decade.' He cites Eastwood casting himself in 'Gran Tarino' and his staging of a conversation with an invisible Barack Obama two years later at a Republican National Convention. Eastwood made the comments at the National Board of Review Awards dinner in 2005 where he was being honored for his movie Million Dollar Baby, which he is pictured above receiving a Golden Globe Award for . Sarah Palin criticized Moore's reaction to American Sniper, while attending the Iowa Freedom Summit; she is pictured above with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer (left), who brought the sign to the event . He then heaps more criticizim on American Sniper which he calls a 'mess of a film that rewrites history' and perpetrates a 'racist sentiment to Arabs'. Moore said in the coming days he will share 'some thoughtful pieces' on American Sniper, by others, as well as 'my real thoughts' on it. He concludes by writing that what was 'bothersome' about Eastwood's remarks was that he was backing up earlier comments made by TV show host Glenn Beck who has said he was thinking of 'killing Michael Moore'. Similar comments were also made by Fox News's Bill O'Reilly. Moore wrote: 'This past week or so of hysterical attacks on me only proves that the American lovers of violence and the issuers of fatwas in OUR society haven't gone away. They are our American Isis - ""Criticize or mock those whom we deify, like our sainted sniper, and we will harm you most assuredly.'''","Michael Moore released a statement about the death threat this week .

"Bernice Gordon, a prolific crossword constructor whose puzzles were published in major newspapers and brain-teaser books, has died at the age of 101. Gordon died at her Philadelphia home early Thursday, her son Jim Lanard confirmed Friday. A private memorial service was planned, he said. A Philadelphia native and University of Pennsylvania graduate, Gordon raised three children before working as an artist and traveling around the world. She began creating the puzzles in her 30s because she enjoyed the mental challenge. Her puzzles were published in The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and others including puzzle books from Dell and Simon & Schuster. Arbiter: Bernice Gordon is credited with pioneering the 'rebus' puzzle, which requires solvers to occasionally fill in symbols instead of letters. She died at her Philadelphia home on Thursday.  She was 101 . In an interview with The Associated Press on her 100th birthday a year ago this month, she said the puzzles 'make my life' and that she constructed a new puzzle grid every day. Gordon is credited with pioneering the 'rebus' puzzle, which requires solvers to occasionally use symbols instead of letters. Her first rebus in the Times used an ampersand to represent the letters AND, so an answer like SANDWICH ISLANDS had to be entered as S&WICH ISL&S. Readers reacted strongly in hundreds of letters, some complaining that it was cheating and other applauding the novel approach, she said. 'It's something new.

Among the scores of Gordon's grids that the Times has published since her 1952 debut was a 2013 collaboration with teenage constructor David Steinberg, a regular Times contributor. Steinberg said the puzzle that emerged blended Gordon's deep classical knowledge and his penchant for modern language. 'Our styles are a bit different in that way, but we still had a lot of fun collaborating,' he said. Peter Mucha, a former Inquirer reporter who wrote a story about Gordon in 1995 and remained friends with her, said he was impressed that she used computer programs to develop crossword puzzles. And he often marveled at the breadth of her vocabulary. 'She would just pull these obscure words out of a hat,' Mucha said Friday.

"Kim Sears has been subjected to a vile online backlash from Czech tennis fans after her courtside outburst while supporting fiancée Andy Murray. Sick trolls have posted hateful messages on a Facebook fan page dedicated to Miss Sears, who appeared to call Murray's opponent Tomas Berdych a 'Czech flash f***' during a tense moment in yesterday's Australian Open semi final. The hurtful posts say they hope Miss Sears 'dies', and that she 'deserves a couple of slaps' for her foul-mouthed rant during the match. Scroll down for video . Kim Sears has faced a vile online backlash after her courtside outburst as she watched Andy Murray do battle in the Australian Open semi-final yesterday . REPLACE . Sick posts on an unofficial Kim Sears fan page said the 27-year-old should 'die', and that she 'deserved a couple of slaps' Ms Sears was caught on camera using colourful language as Murray secured a break in the third set to put himself firmly in control of the match with Czech Tomas Berdych . During one of the highly-charged moments in yesterday's match, Miss Sears, 27, appeared to hurl a string of expletives in the direction of the Czech player. As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. The sickening messages were written just hours after Murray emerged victorious from his duel with Berdych, sending the Briton into the final. Posting on the unofficial Facebook page, Pavel Kratochvil, from Prague, wrote: 'Die. you s***.' Karel Zelezny added: 'F***ing English B****! Such a f***ing p****. You deserve someone to give you couple of slaps.' While David Carbol added: 'Little stupid cow. I'm czech.' Other posts called Miss Sears a 'bad sport s***', a 'silly stupid girl' and a 'British f***'. Abuse flooded in just hours after Murray's victory, with expletive-ridden posts filling the Kim Sears fan page . Last night Andy Murray was quick to defend his fiance, saying that the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match. He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal. 'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable. 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7. Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match. Amid the vile backlash, hundreds of people pledge their support for Miss Sears, who has often remained quiet and reserved during matches. German tennis player Andrea Petkovic tweeted, in capitals: 'I love Kim Sears so much.' Comedian Jack Whitehall also took to Twitter and said: 'Anyone else find Kim Sears incredibly sexy when she's angry?' Television presenter Anita Rani said: 'Kim Sears swears! So f***ing what? Newsflash - women swear.' Last night Andy Murray was quick to defend his fiance, saying that the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match . It was the first time Murray had played Berdych (pictured) since he hired Murray's former coach, which no doubt added a fiery edge to the match . The highly-charged match was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu. Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November. Speaking on court, Murray said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary. 'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension. 'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.' But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo. He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it. 'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday morning after the Serb defeated Swiss player Stanislas Wawrinka. The pair, both 27, had been together for nine years when Murray proposed in November last year . Kim Sears' astonishing court-side outburst quickly went viral. The video showing her swearing profusely, apparently at Berdych, was soon retweeted thousands of times on Twitter. Very quickly 'Kim Sears' was trending on Twitter and remains in the top 10 this morning - making her one of the most tweeted about topics in the last 24 hours. For the most part social media users have been supportive, with many finding her unexpected aptitude for swearing both funny and endearing. As the video and subsequent pictures went viral, she was branded 'a legend' and 'hilarious' by people on Twitter and Facebook. Kim was even given the 'Thug Life' treatment - a spoof meme which juxtaposes unlikely subjects with a Tupac Shakur quote.

"A factory has been accused of bringing in a jeweller to cut off workers' wedding rings as part of health and safety rules. Unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed, some for the first time since their wedding day. However, the firm – Becton Dickinson, which makes sterile medical equipment and employs more than 700 people in Plymouth – said it had simply brought in a jeweller to resize the rings to make them easier to remove as part of the safety drive. Unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed, some for the first time since their wedding day. They added that workers had only agreed to the measure because they had a 'gun to their head' A leaked memo suggests the rules have been introduced after a worker lost a finger when they got their wedding ring caught on a piece of equipment. Dave Springbett, regional officer for the Unite union, said: 'There are women in tears, women whose husbands put that ring on their finger 20 or 30 years ago and it has never been taken off.' He added: 'I work with plenty of people in factories who wear gloves or tape [over their jewellery], but they have said no to that. They have even had a jeweller here cutting people's rings off.' A memo sent out on December 15 said the new rules will come in on February 1, this Sunday, for workers in the operational, warehouse and toolroom areas, and anyone who works with equipment. But it says stud earrings, necklaces, body piercings covered by clothing and medical bracelets will still be permitted. While Mr Springbett acknowledged workers had been informed, he said the lack of information in the interim meant they thought the company had changed its mind. Becton Dickinson, which employs more than 700 people at its Plymouth site, pictured – said it had simply brought in a jeweller to resize the rings to make them easier to remove as part of the safety drive . He said: 'Apparently it's on health and safety grounds which is, quite frankly, ridiculous. There is no health and safety reason and no hygiene reason.' Mr Springbett said that while workers have agreed to the policy, it is only because they had 'a gun to their heads' and wanted to keep their jobs. A spokesman for Becton Dickinson said: 'We have implemented a policy that excludes the wearing of jewellery, or any other personal items, in those areas in which they could constitute a safety risk. 'We understand that a small number of our associates may be unhappy, and we are sensitive to their feelings, but our overriding priority must be workplace safety. 'We have offered associates who were unable to remove their rings the opportunity for a professional jeweller to come to the site to resize their rings. This is entirely voluntary and the cost is being paid by BD.'","Becton Dickinson accused of bringing in jeweller to cut off wedding rings .

"New romance: Tessa Hardy describes the new relationship with BBC newsreader Tim Willcox as ‘casual’ He first made headlines for his affair with his married co-presenter Sophie Long. And yesterday it emerged that BBC newsreader Tim Willcox has moved on to another blonde with a husband – Tessa Hardy, wife of telecoms multi-millionaire Warren Hardy. The pair met at a dinner party in 2013, when Mr Willcox, 51, was still with Miss Long, but struck up a relationship shortly after Mrs Hardy, 53, and her husband began a trial separation. Yesterday friends of Mr Hardy said he was devastated to discover that Mr Willcox had wheedled his way into his wife’s affections when he had been desperately trying to win her back and salvage their 24-year marriage, which produced three children now aged 23, 20 and 17. A source close to Mr Hardy, 58, said recent business problems had placed a strain on his relationship with his wife – who bears a striking resemblance to Miss Long, 37. The friend said: ‘She was very vulnerable when she started a relationship with Tim and he is taking advantage of her. ‘She had only just split from Warren and they were only supposed to be having a short, trial separation. ‘Warren does not think Tim is good for Tessa. She is an attractive, sexy woman and she doesn’t look too dissimilar to Sophie Long, so he clearly has a type. 'This whole thing has been very hard on Warren. Losing his wife has almost ruined him. ‘He always thought that after the trial separation they would be getting back together.’ Mr Hardy made his fortune from his mobile phone business European Telecom. It was floated on the stock exchange in 1996, and by 2000 he appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List as worth £115million. He later founded White Eagle, which developed mobile payment technology. Scroll down for video . In 2000, the family built a £7million mansion in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, complete with indoor and outdoor pools and staff quarters. Mr Hardy’s friend said: ‘Warren worked hard and gave everything to his family. He made sure [Tessa] lived like a princess. Tim won’t be able to provide for her financially. Old flame: Mr Willcox and Sophie Long were co-presenters on the BBC. Mr Willcox left his wife of 17 years - with whom he has four children - for Miss Long . 'Tessa has said Tim provides for her emotionally and sexually.’ Mr Willcox became tangled in a similar scandal in 2012, when he left his wife of 17 years – with whom he has four children – for Miss Long. Separation: Warren and Tessa Hardy who have separated after 24 years of marriage. Mr Hardy is said to be devastated by his wife's new relationship . The pair were presenters on BBC News 24, now renamed the BBC News Channel, and Mr Willcox had been one of the guests at Miss Long’s wedding to childhood sweetheart Will Green just two years earlier. A former member of the British Youth Orchestra, he even serenaded the newlyweds on trumpet. Yesterday Mrs Hardy told the Daily Mail her estranged husband had no grounds for unhappiness about her ‘casual relationship’ with the BBC newsreader, saying: ‘Tim’s divorced and I’m getting divorced. 'We’re both completely free agents to do what we want when we want. ‘I’ve been separated since April, almost a year, I’m not with my husband. I didn’t leave my husband for Tim, I left because I did. 'And I didn’t hook up with Tim until several months after I had separated.’ Mrs Hardy added that Mr Willcox had also been separated from Miss Long ‘for ages’ before she became involved with him. The former housewife now runs Exceptional Pieces, a website selling art and other items. Mr Willcox did not respond to a request for a comment.","BBC's Tim Willcox seeing Tessa Hardy, wife of millionaire Warren Hardy .

"A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has accused President Obama of lying to the American people earlier this year when he blamed President Bashar al-Assad for a sarin-gas attack that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians in August. Seymour Hersh, 76, who had previously described the official account of the 2011 raid which killed Osama Bin Laden as ‘one big lie,’ claims the current administration ‘cherry-picked intelligence’ on Syria. Hersh first gained worldwide recognition . in 1969 for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the . Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for . International Reporting. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh has accused President Obama of lying to the American people earlier this year when he blamed President Bashar al-Assad for a sarin-gas attack that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians in August . Hersh, 76, cited conversations with military officials who spoke of their 'immense frustration' with the President . In early September, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had proof that the nerve-gas attack in Syria was made on Assad's orders. ‘We know the Assad regime was responsible,’ President Obama told the nation in an address days after this revelation, when he said he had been pushed over the ‘red line’ to consider military intervention. In Sunday's London Review of Book, Hersh accused the administration of ‘cherry-picked intelligence,’ citing conversations with intelligence and military officials. ‘A former senior intelligence official told me that the Obama administration had altered the available information – in terms of its timing and sequence - to enable the president and his advisers to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been picked up and analyzed in real time, as the attack was happening,’ he wrote. Some 355 people showing 'neurotoxic symptoms' died August 21 after the deadly sarin gas attack which U.S. authorities accused forces loyal to President Assad of carrying out . President Bashar al-Assad repeatedly denied that his soldiers carried out the sarin-gas attack that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians in August . According to Hersh, the situation reminded him of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, when President Johnson's administration had reversed the sequence of National Security Agency intercepts to justify one of their early bombings of North Vietnam. Hersh also said that his contacts spoke of ‘immense frustration inside the military and intelligence bureaucracy’ regarding the current President. ‘The guys are throwing their hands in the air and saying, “How can we help this guy [Obama] when he and his cronies in the White House make up the intelligence as they go along?”’ Hersh also claims that the administration buried intelligence on the fundamentalist group/rebel group al-Nusra related to the sarin attacks, plus he repeated his accusation that the U.S. media fails to properly question what information is given to them by the government. A United Nations resolution ultimately prevented American military intervention, but Hersh believes that the information he has unveiled is similar to when President George W. Bush justified his invasion of Iraq with evidence concerning nuclear weapons which later turned out not to be true. In early September, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had proof that the nerve-gas attack in Syria was made on Assad's orders . 'Lying': Hersh says 'not one word' of the Obama administration's account of the raid that supposedly killed Osama Bin Laden is true. The government has never released pictures of Bin Laden's dead body to the public . 'The cherry-picking was similar to the process used to justify the Iraq war,' wrote Hersh. This isn’t the first time he has . accused President Obama of lying. In September he said that ‘not one . word’ of the administration’s narrative on the killing of Osama Binladen . was true. At that time . Hersh also savaged the U.S. media for failing to challenge the White . House on a whole host of issues, from NSA spying, to drone attacks, to . aggression against Syria. He said the Navy Seal raid that supposedly resulted in the death of the Al-Qaeda terror leader, Hersh said, ‘not one word of it is true’. According to Hersh the problem is that the U.S. media is allowing the Obama administration to get away with lying. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the national security team watch the raid live from the White House's Situation Room on May 1, 2011 . The compound: The Pakistan home of the al Qaeda leader was in flames after it was attacked by Navy Seals . ‘It’s pathetic. They are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama].’ Hersh said the American press spends ‘so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would’. In his opinion, the solution would be to shut down news networks like NBC and ABC and fire 90 per cent of mainstream editors and replace them with ‘real’ journalists who are not afraid to speak truth to power. ‘The republic’s in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple,’ he said.","The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist claims the Obama Administration 'cherry-picked intelligence' on Syria .

"Amy Duggar, the 27-year-old niece of Jim Bob Duggar, has confirmed rumors that she was born out of wedlock - a sin in the eyes of her ultra-religious family, the stars of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting. Jim Bob's sister Deanna, now 52, had Amy with her now-husband Terry, also 52, when they were 25 years old, but they didn't get married until 2006, 18 years after Amy's birth. 'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock,' Amy wrote in a lengthy post on Instagram on Tuesday, along with a photo of her with her parents. 'I'm sure [my mom] was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed.' Scroll down for video . Revealed: Jim Bob's sister Deanna (left) had Amy, 27, (center) with Terry (right) when they were 25 years old, but they didn't get married until 2006, 18 years after Amy's birth . Outspoken: Amy, pictured in 2012, wrote a lengthy confession on Instagram which accompanied a snap of her with her parents (previous photo) - confirming 'my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock' Amy, an aspiring country singer, wrote: 'Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect! 'God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. He knew my parents story would be told.' Amy also remarked that 'everyone sins differently' but that 'Jesus paid for it all'. She then gushed over her parents, saying: 'I'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life', and, 'I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad! Seriously he's the greatest!' Dad: Amy also wrote, 'I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad!'

Of her mother (right), Amy (left) wrote, 'I'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life' When the news was initially broken last week by Radar Online, there was speculation that Terry might not be Amy's biological father, since Terry said in a 2012 interview that he and Deanna had been dating for 20 years, which would have been five years after Amy was born. It seems, however, that this was simply a miscalculation on Terry's part. In a 2009 interview on 19 Kids and Counting, Deanna said: 'Terry and I knew each other a long time ago, and I got pregnant with Amy. And so, we dated each other on and off for quite some time. 'Then we finally decided you know what, we need to get married! So we got married, we’ve been together three years.' Getting it off her chest: In the post (pictured), Amy insists, 'Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect!' Forgiven: Jim Bob (left) is against even hugging before marriage, but is still close with his sister Deanna and niece Amy, who shared this FaceTime session (right) with cousin Josie, five, on Instagram only yesterday . Related: When the news  initially broke last week, there was speculation that Terry (left) might not be Amy's (right) biological father, but Amy denied this. Pictured, a throwback snap of the pair . Shunned: Jill (left), a practicing midwife, was apparently forbidden by her parents from helping Susanna Keller (right) - the youngest sister of Anna Duggar - when she became pregnant outside of wedlock in 2012 . While all that may seem against the Duggar family principles, Jim Bob still very much loves his sister and says they spend time together every week. 'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock. Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect! God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. He knew my parents' story would be told. How amazing is that?! Your testimony is everything. Everyone struggles, and sins differently. But Jesus paid it all!! I'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life. I'm sure she was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed. God's grace covered it though! She's beautiful inside and out. I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad! Seriously he's the greatest! Jesus, thank you for restoring hearts, relationships and families. No matter what you have done, don't think your a second you're alone in this world. Jesus died so that you may be free! John3:16' Indeed, only yesterday Amy posted a snap of herself chatting with her five-year-old cousin Josie, Jim Bob and Michelle's youngest child, on FaceTime. 'Face timing the family tonight! #allsmiles @duggarfam', she captioned the image. Amy's confession comes hot on the heels on rumors that Jim Bob and Michelle once banned their midwife daughter Jill from helping a member of their extended family, because she too got pregnant out of wedlock. This allegation concerns Susanna Keller, the 22-year-old younger sister of Anna Duggar, 23, who is married to Jim Bob and Michelle's oldest son Josh. When Susanna give birth to her first child two years ago, Jill was apparently forbidden from helping by her strict parents because they didn't want her fraternizing with an unwed mother-to-be. 'Jill was very excited to assist Susanna through the birth,' a source told Radar. 'Michelle and Jim Bob, however, wouldn't let her participate. They thought Jill shouldn't be exposed to an unmarried mother in that condition.' The Duggars are well known for following a hardline Christian sect known as the Quiverfull movement, which promotes procreation and eschews all forms of birth control. Another recent scandal involves the recent revelation that Michelle has a sister who is a lesbian. Michelle has never said much of the woman, Evelyn Ruark, who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner, but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult. We are worried about them,’ Evelyn's partner Sharon Callahan told The National Enquirer in 2010. ‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’","Jim Bob Duggar's sister Deanna and her husband Terry had their daughter Amy, now 27, a full 18 years before they wed .
Amy confirmed the news with an Instagram post, saying her mom must have been 'ashamed and ridiculed' at the time .

"When Ruben and Sequoia Mendoza boarded a hot air balloon, the dream wedding they had planned was finally about to begin. But moments after the couple said 'I do' in the skies above San Diego, their ceremony took an unexpected turn. After a sudden change in wind direction the pilot, Phil Brandt, told the party they would be making an emergency landing in the streets below - in the middle of rush hour. Scroll down for video . Unexpected turn: Ruben and Sequoia Mendoza were in the middle of their wedding ceremony over the skies of the Sorrento Valley in San Diego when there was a sudden change in wind direction . Dramatic descent: Pilot Phil Brandt told the wedding party they would be making an emergency landing in the middle of rush hour . Minutes later they touched down on a busy road in the Sorrento Valley, with cars swerving to avoid it. But the ballon was quickly pushed into a nearby parking lot by Good Samaritans who were near the landing site at the time. Despite the terrifying set of events, the wedding guests insist they felt safe the entire flight and now the pilot has been branded a hero. Mr Brandt, who has been driving hot air balloons for 25 years, used a tree to slow the balloon down as it descended and then leaned it against a poll so it rested safely. However he insists he was just doing his job. The bride's father Curtis Kam told CBS 8: 'We didn't feel like we were in any danger, we were just slow in the balloon. It was fun, it was fun. Control: As the balloon dropped the pilot kept igniting the flame in a bid to land the balloon in a safer spot . 'We hit the tree harder than the landing. The tree helped us and when we landed it was pretty soft.' The groom's relative Maria Hafferkamp also told the station: 'We had a very professional driver and he did the best he had to do to get out us out safely and we are very happy to be in one piece. 'We are lucky for people everywhere who volunteer to help right away.' Despite the dramatic drop, groom Mr Mendoza said: 'We had an awesome experience, that was fun.'

"A mother-of-two and her young daughters have chopped off their long locks in an effort to show how even the smallest of actions can help someone. Melinda Bowden and her children Lana, seven, and Lacie Rees, five, from Stroud in New South Wales, all had much-loved hair that flowed well past their waists. But in an effort to help those suffering through cancer, they chopped their locks and donated them to a program run by Pantene and Look Good… Feel Better to be turned into wigs after the illness struck too close to home. Melinda Bowden and her children Lana, 7, and Lacie Rees, 5, cut their wait long hair and donated it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients . 'My aunty had breast cancer and then a few years later it came back in her bones – she was terminal,' Ms Bowden told Daily Mail Australia. 'She had mastectomy and then about five years later it came back as secondary breast cancer- she has it in her pelvis and there is nothing they can do for her. 'She went through chemo and I know how that made her feel, having no hair. It's such a simple thing that you can do that can change someone's self-esteem.' Ms Bowden's daughters, the youngest of which had never had her hair trimmed, both jumped on board the idea of donating their locks. Ms Bowden said she was inspired by her aunty, who was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer . Lacie, five, had never had her hair cut before, but both girls jumped up at the idea . 'They were quite excited to have it cut and they were even happier when I told them about donating it and that it was going to someone special,' their mother said. Look Good… Feel Better is a charity that runs thousands of workshops through volunteers across the country which supports cancer patients through the appearance-related side-effects that are caused by their treatments. Six to eight ponytails are needed to make each wig, which is then distributed free of charge and cut and styled to suit each recipient, according to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths campaign. Over 10,000 ponytails have been donated across Australia and New Zealand since the program’s launch.

"No good deed goes unnoticed - no matter how small it may seem at the time. On January 16 in Serbia, a man called Zoran Pavlovic, was heading home to meet a few friends. When he got there, they told him that there was a small dog stranded on one of the Nisava river islands. Although Pavlovic and his friends headed over in hopes of helping, once they arrived there didn't believe that there was much that could be done without gear and tools. They began calling several pet rescue facilities in the area, but only one good Samaritan, a man called Sasa Pesic, who works at a dog shelter in Nis, Serbia, was willing to come to their aide. With hardly a second of consideration for his own safety, Pesic climbed down from the highway overpass and waded across the river to the island where the dog was sitting. On January 16, a man called Zoran Pavlovic was heading home in Serbia, when he and some friends heard about a stranded dog under a bridge overpass . Sasa Pesic, who works at dog shelter in Nis, Serbia, came to the dog's aide - quickly climbing down from the overpass onto the river island . After gaining the dog's trust, he lifted it up and carried him back toward the highway bridge . Pesic passed the dog up to a man who was waiting atop a stone column, who then passed it further along to several men standing on the bridge . Pesic was then helped back up onto the brick column - and onto the overpass - following his heroic deed . Although it took several minutes for the dog to fully emerge from the bushes, Pesic quickly gathered the dog in his arms and began to wade back toward the overpass column. He passed the dog to another passer-by who was standing on top of the brick column that serves to prop up the bridge. Pesic handed the dog to the middle man, who then quickly passed the dog off to the man on the bridge, before helping the everyday hero back up onto the road.","Good Samaritan Sasa Pesic climbed off river overpass to rescue small pup .

"The FBI has released photos made from surveillance video of three masked thieves stealing historic gold nuggets on display at a San Francisco bank museum after ramming a stolen SUV through its revolving door. San Francisco police say the robbers took up to 10 ounces of gold worth roughly $10,000 early Monday. One of the robbers held a gun to a security guard's head while his accomplices stole the gold nuggets from the Wells Fargo History Museum, the site where the bank launched in 1852. The photos released Thursday show the men in ski masks and gloves that obscure their identities. They're seen next to the SUV covered in broken glass and grabbing a display case .

One of the robbers held a gun to a security guard's head while his accomplices stole the gold nuggets from the Wells Fargo History Museum . Each man is described as about 6 feet tall and all escaped in a sedan . Wells Fargo Bank officials have vowed to reopen the popular corporate museum in the heart of San Francisco's financial district. The museum is a destination for schoolchildren and tourists and includes two restored stagecoaches, a working telegraph and other California Gold Rush-era memorabilia. 'Rest assured, the museum will reopen, so it can continue to serve the thousands of visitors and Bay Area residents who visit it each year,' Pulido said. Wells Fargo opened its first branch on the site in 1852, he said. The tactic mirrored three other smash-and-grab thefts involving vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area since May. Police said they are investigating whether there's a connection. In this image from surveillance video released by the FBI,  a suspect is seen inside of the Wells Fargo Museum on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015 in San Francisco . Last week, thieves backed a U-Haul van through the front of a Patagonia store near San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, loaded it with high-end outdoor clothing and gear, and sped off. On Nov. 26, two men rammed a vehicle into an upscale designer boutique in Union Square and took handbags. Across San Francisco Bay, robbers in May busted through the glass at an Apple Store in a bustling shopping district in Berkeley to steal electronics. Police did not reveal the value of the stolen merchandise in any of the cases. In Tuesday's robbery, the stolen gold was estimated to be worth roughly $10,000, but Wells Fargo officials were trying to determine exactly what was taken before settling on a more precise figure. Wells Fargo Bank officials have vowed to reopen the popular corporate museum in the heart of San Francisco's financial district . The robbers may have difficulty selling the nuggets unless they get melted down . Dealers of precious metals say they will be on the lookout for nuggets with historical significance that suddenly appear on the market, rare coin dealer Don Kagin said. The robbers may have difficulty selling the nuggets unless they get melted down, he said. Melting the gold could remove possible markings concerning when and where the nuggets were mined, said Fred Holabird, a mining geologist and an owner of a rare and unique collectibles business in Reno, Nevada. 'This is such bad news from my viewpoint,' he said, calling the potential loss of historical indicators a tragedy. Holabird said the nuggets could be worth two to 10 times the value of gold, now selling for about $1,300 an ounce on the open market. Holabird said the nuggets could be worth two to 10 times the value of gold, now selling for about $1,300 an ounce on the open market . Selling stolen precious metals is difficult but not impossible. Robbers who swiped $1.3 million in gold, quartz and other valuable metals on display at the California State Mining and Mineral Museum in 2012 were able to sell about $12,000 worth of gold to pawn shops and dealers, police said. Some of the stolen items, including a bag of ground-up quartz, were recovered. Five men were convicted of the heist at the museum in the Sierra Nevada foothills.","San Francisco police say the robbers took up to 10 ounces of gold worth roughly $10,000 early Monday .

I would give him a little bit of money and he would help me clean my garage and I’d help him pay probation and stuff like that,' Davis told My Fox 8. Winder came by Davis's home last week asking for the loan of a tire iron. 'When I turned around I recon he knocked my brains out with the tire iron,' Davis recalled. Davis was then dragged into the house. Winder continued beating the man, all the while asking him to hand over his cash.

"Walking along the dusty street in a small town on the fringes of Bangkok, smiling baby in her arms, passersby stop and stare. Pattamaron Chanbua ignores them and flashes a kind smile back at her little boy fidgeting in the heat, as she makes her way to collect his siblings from school. 'See how everyone looks,' she says, 'they call him a farang [foreigner in Thai ] because they don't believe he's mine he's so white.

Gammy's six-year-old brother Seagame and four-year-old sister Gamsai love playing with him . The pallid boy she holds tenderly is  Gammy, the one-year-old Down syndrome boy who became an overnight sensation in the gossipy town of the Chon Buri province where he lives, and indeed internationally, after he was unceremoniously abandoned in Thailand by his Australian parents. The case sparked international outrage when it was reported that Wendy and David Farnell returned from Thailand with his healthy twin sister but left Gammy behind. Mr Farnell claimed they had been told Gammy would be born with the genetic disorder before the twins were born, and asked the surrogacy agency to abort the child and give them a refund or find a solution. Pattamaron, or Goy as she is more commonly known, insists that was never the case and that they dumped the boy and left.

"A mother has made an emotional appeal to her husband's family to return her young daughter, who was taken to Libya in a 'tug-of-love' battle between the parents. Mal Szymanowicz's daughter Talia was snatched by Maher Belaid - Ms Szymanowicz's estranged husband - in 2012 and taken to his home country in North Africa. Belaid was jailed for Talia's kidnap last year after returning to Britain without his little daughter, who remains in Libya with his family and now calls her paternal grandmother 'mum'. Belaid has refused to comply with a court order to bring the little girl back to the UK to see Ms Szymanowicz, who has now been separated from the youngster for more than two years. Mal Szymanowicz has made an emotional plea for the return of her daughter, who was snatched by Ms Szymanowicz's estranged husband Maher Belaid (pictured, right, at their wedding) The mother has now been separated from her daughter (pictured with Belaid in Libya before he returned to Britain was jailed for her abduction) for more than two years . Ms Szymanowicz has now made a desperate plea for help in having her daughter returned to her home in Barry, south Wales. She said: 'My heart is broken, I can't even put my pain into words. I wonder if I will ever see my beautiful daughter again. 'I cry every single day for her. She was only-15-weeks old when she was stolen, now she is two. Its so long since I held her in my arms, they feel so empty. 'What Belaid has done is beyond cruel. He has deprived Talia of a mother and me of my only child. It's a physical pain that never goes away.' 'It's like being in a never-ending nightmare - there must be someone out there who can help me get my baby girl back.' Ms Szymanowicz came to Britain from Poland in 2002 and met Libyan national Belaid, who working in a pizza takeaway, and they got married and had a child together. This is one of few pictures Ms Szymanowicz has of her and her baby, who was snatched aged just 15 weeks . The couple split around the time of Talia's birth before Belaid (right) kidnapped the then-baby . The mother says that when she does get to see her daughter 'she doesn't even really know who I am' Their marriage - the only thing which allowed Belaid to stay in the UK - broke down soon after Talia was born when Belaid spent three weeks in Libya with his family. Ms Szymanowicz was  shopping in Mothercare when her then-15-week-old daughter  was taken by Belaid. Nearly two children a day are taken out of the UK against a court order or without the consent of one parent, figures show. Foreign Office data reveals the number of parental child abduction cases has  doubled in the last decade, from 272 in 2004 to 580 in 2013. The most common destination countries for parental abductions from the UK in 2013 were Pakistan, where 35 were taken, the US, where 32 children went, and Poland, which saw 29 abductions. Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds said at the time a report into the issue: 'Once children are taken overseas it can be extremely difficult to secure their return.' She said: 'It was an ordinary day and we went shopping as a family into town. 'While I was buying new clothes for Talia my husband said he would go for a coffee with Talia but instead he kidnapped her and took her to Libya.' In a phone call made from Tunisia shortly after the kidnapping, Belaid told Ms Szymanowicz he was 'teaching her a lesson'. Ms Szymanowicz has been apart from her daughter since November 2012 - and has only seen her during brief Skype calls. She attempted to visit the chaotic country soon after the abduction but was advised against it a because, as a western woman travelling alone, she would not be safe. Little Talia, now two, is being looked after by Belaid's Libyan family and calls her grandmother 'mum'. Ms Szymanowicz says the family often hang up when she calls or refuse to let her speak to or see her daughter. She added: 'I've been allowed to see her on Skye for a few minutes but she now calls my husband's mother ""mum"". She doesn't even really know who I am.' Belaid returned to the UK earlier this year, but didn't bring Talia with him, he was arrested at Gatwick airport for abuction. Ms Szymanowicz has only seen her daughter in photos and during brief chats on Skype since she was taken . Talia, pictured as a baby before she was snatched, is now two years old and living with Belaid's family in war-torn Libya, who are refusing to return the youngster to Britain . Cardiff Crown Court heard how his baby snatch was inspired by his uncle Mohammed who also stayed in Libya with his young daughter and not allowed her to return to Britain. Judge Patrick Harrington QC told Belaid to return Talia to the UK but he refused to co-operate. He said: 'You put into effect a cruel deception and the torment you have inflicted on a very nice girl is simply beyond measure. Rarely have I seen a case of such unspeakable cruelty.' The judge took the rare step of apologising for not being able to jail Belaid for longer, saying he would have given him a 'far, far longer' jail term if not for legal restrictions on his sentencing powers. There is currently no prospect of Talia being returned home, although Ms Szymanowicz has written to the Prime Minister and the British Embassy in Libya begging for help.","Polish woman and Libyan man had child after meeting in south Wales .

"Republican lawmakers are holding their ground and refusing to fund the proposals President Barack Obama  laid out in his State of the Union address. Having already panned his pitches as 'unserious' and 'dead on arrival,' Republicans are now threatening to shred most of Obama's budget, due for release on Tuesday, the moment it lands on their desks. 'He is the most liberal, fiscally irresponsible president we’ve had in history,' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told the Washington Post after seeing a preview of the president's spending requests. 'I don’t know why he doesn’t see it.' The White House on Thursday admitted that it doesn't expect the president's budget to pass 'in its current form.' Rather, it considers the document 'a way that we can codify our values and our priorities.' President Barack Obama is pictured here in the East Room of the White House giving a speech today. Yesterday, Obama revealed that his 2016 budget would 'fully reverse the sequestration cuts for domestic priorities' and increase defense spending . Obama told Democrats on Thursday he would ask for a $74 billion in 2015 above the ceiling mandated by a bipartisan agreement. The White House confirmed that Obama will ask Congress to trash the sequester. 'No way,' Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said in response to the news. 'Initial peak at Pres budget shows same wonderland mentality that Washington can tax and spend its way to prosperity Am ppl can't be fooled,' Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted. Hatch told the Post the U.S. is 'facing a debt crisis not because Americans are taxed too little but because the government spends too much.' In his State of the Union address Obama presented an ambitious framework of revenue increases that place even higher tax burdens on financial institutions and wealthy Americans and would raise $320 billion over 10 years to pay for his favored programs. But Republicans have firmly dismissed any attempt to increase revenues through those means. 'I don’t know any Republican, myself included, that would support any of that,' Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters last week, using the 'dead on arrival' refrain. 'I think it's pretty clear that that’s a non-starter, and I think the president knows that,' Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock told Daily Mail Online. 'Those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy. And you know we still have a very fragile economy.' Republican after Republican has slammed the new measures as bad for the same Americans it purports to help - the middle class - since his joint appearance before Congress last week. 'President Obama stayed the course of tax, spend, borrow, regulate, and add to the debt. This policy has hammered working families,' Alabama's other senator, Jeff Sessions, also a Republican, said in a statement. 'Instead of trying to manipulate our tax code to punish success, President Obama should work with Congress to fundamentally reform our tax code in ways that will grow our entire economy and provide relief to all families,' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz contended that Obama was tone-deaf and did not 'hear' the American peoples' message in November when they ousted his party from power in the upper chamber. 'He intends to do precisely the opposite' of what they voted for, Cruz said. 'He intends to double down on the failed policies of the last six years. He intends to have yet more and more government spending and taxes and debt and all of the policies that are hurting hardworking Americans.' House Speaker John Boehner accused Obama of 'more of the same approach that has failed middle-class families.' 'Unnserious proposals may make for good political theater, he said, but 'they will not distract this new American Congress from our focus on the people's priorities.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that in digging in his heels Obama 'missed' and opportunity for 'bipartisan, constructive engagement.' 'We know the president may not be wild about the people’s choice of a Congress. But he owes it to the American people to find a serious way to work with the representatives they elected,' the GOP leader said. Moderate Democrats are waiting until Obama's budget is unveiled to determine whether Obama and the White House 'have really gone too far left,' Matt Bennett, co-founder of left-aligned group Third Way indicated to Politico. 'We are big believers in dealing with the long-term mandatory spending crisis and driving economic growth for the middle class,' he said of his organization, 'and we hope to see some of that when the whole budget comes out.' Obama has already had to strike one of his changes to the tax code from his budget in the last week after he faced blow back from Republicans and Democrats alike, including the top Democrat in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Dick Durbin. The president wanted to amend the rules pertaining to popular college savings accounts often referred to as 529s as part of his plan to reform the tax code. Used most often by the wealthy, the White House wanted to begin taxing withdraws from the investment accounts. Democrats argued that too many middle income Americans use the accounts, though, for that to be a smart source of revenue for Obama's free community college tuition plan that's been promoted as a boon for average American families. Building on the State of the Union, Obama offered a preview of his budget on Thursday in an op-ed for the Huffington Post. 'We have to build on the bipartisan budget agreement I signed in 2013 that helped us end some of the arbitrary, across-the-board budget cuts known as ""sequestration,"" ' the president wrote. 'In order to get wages and incomes rising faster, we need to take the next step. That's why my Budget will fully reverse the sequestration cuts for domestic priorities in 2016.' Not only does the president intend to give the Department of Defense back the money it would lose next fiscal year if the sequester were allowed to take effect, he will propose 'equal dollar increases for defense funding.' 'If Congress rejects my plan and refuses to undo these arbitrary cuts, it will threaten our economy and our military,' he said in his op-ed. 'Investments in key areas will fall to their lowest level in ten years, adjusted for inflation, putting American research, education, infrastructure, and national security at risk. 'But if Congress joins me, we can make sure that ending sequestration is fully paid for by cutting inefficient spending and closing tax loopholes.' Yesterday, Obama told Democrats he would ask for a $74 billion in 2015 above the ceiling mandated by a bipartisan agreement in his budget, due out next Tuesday. He is pictured here at their retreat in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . The White House said Thursday that the president's budget is based on his belief that is possible to 'make our tax code fairer and more simple, and do it all in a way that’s fiscally responsible.' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest said, the White House believes 'there is a better way that we could have succeeded in reducing the deficit' than sequestration - and that would have been to raise tax rates on Wall Street. 'But in some ways, those are debates for the past. What we want to talk about now is the future. And I do think that the strategy that the President has laid out - focusing on middle-class families - is one that certainly deserves strong bipartisan support in the Congress,' he said. Earnest contended that 'no President has ever put forward a budget with the expectation that Congress is going to pass it in its current form,' he said, even when the executive and legislative branches of government were controlled by the same party. Still, President Obama's budget is 'important,' he said, because it 'codifies the President’s values and vision for the country.' 'But Republicans in Congress will certainly have their say and we look forward to seeing what they put forward,' he noted. Looming cuts to defense spending is a problem that Obama and Republicans who favor a robust military agree must be resolved. At a Senate Armed Forces hearing on the sequester on Wednesday the committee's chair, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said the U.S. is en route to shaving $1 trillion off of its  defense budget by they year 2021. 'If we in Congress do not act,' McCain said, and the sequester goes into effect next year, Congress will be 'setting our military on a far more dangerous course.' 'Why would we do this to ourselves now?' he said, recalling the global crises of late, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ISIS' violent rampage across Iraq and Syria. McCain said the Army and Marine Corps won't have enough forces if the sequester kicks in and the Air Force won't have enough planes. The aircraft the Air Force will in many cases 'be too old,' he said. Continuing, he warned, 'Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will not get the training or equipment they need. And it will become increasingly difficult for them to respond to any number of contingencies that could threaten our national interests around the world.' Quoting retired United States Marine Corps General James Mattis, who spoke to the committee on Tuesday, McCain said: ‘No foe in the field can wreck such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is achieving.’ McCain ally, Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina told Fox News he'd even consider tax increases to stop sequestration. 'Whatever it takes within reason to get this problem fixed is what I'm willing to do,' he said, adding that he'd do what it takes 'just to get the damn thing done.' Graham's eagerness to raise revenues to save the military is not shared by the entire Republican Party. 'A lot of this gets down to whether or not the president is willing to work through tax reform and entitlement reform, or decide he wants to raise taxes,' Republican Rep. Tom Cole told the Post. 'I don’t believe Republicans are willing to raise taxes.'","White House considers the budget  'a way that we can codify our values and our priorities'

"A Syrian woman survived an execution by stoning in Syria and managed to flee because it was 'God's will that she lived'. The woman was being stoned by the Islamic State group for alleged adultery and left for dead. But the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said today that she has 'miraculously' walked away from the brutal punishment alive. Scroll down for video . A Syrian woman has surviving an execution by stoning in Syria and managed to flee. Earlier this month, ISIS revealed pictures which show a woman (pictured) accused of adultery being brutally stoned to death . The organisation said the jihadist group sentenced the woman to be 'stoned for adultery' in the town of Raqqa - an ISIS stronghold in northern Syria. Militants carried out the punishment and 'stoned her until they thought she had died,' said the Britain-based monitor. But just as they had stopped pelting her with stones, the woman stood up and tried to flee. 'An IS militant was about to open fire at her when an Islamist jurist intervened and stopped him saying it was God's will that she did not die,' said the Observatory, without specifying when it happened. The jurist told the woman she can walk free but that she must 'repent'. He reportedly told the gunman: 'Her sentence is done, let her go and repent to her God.' In the earlier execution, the burqa-clad woman read her charges for adultery by Abu Omar al-Ansari, an elderly Islamic State fighter, before she is stoned to death . According to the Observatory, at least 15 people, nine of them women, have been executed by jihadists in Syria, including Al-Qaeda-linked militants, since July for alleged adultery and homosexuality. Earlier this month, the terrorist group revealed evidence of a series of horrific public executions. They included two men who were hurled from the top of a tower block as a punishment for being gay, men who were crucified for banditry and a woman stoned to death for adultery. The burqa clad woman was pictured being stoned to death by a horde of Islamic State militants, who hurled large rocks at her. A piece of blue tarpaulin was then used to cover the dead woman’s body, which was seen on the ground surrounded by a pile of rocks. ISIS and the Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syria branch, hold large swathes of Syria and have imposed a brutal version of Islamic law in territory under their control. A horde of Islamic State militants were shown hurling large rocks at the woman before her body is covered .","Woman was being stoned by the Islamic State group for alleged adultery .

"A young boy who became stranded on a frozen river as the ice began to crack under his feet has been rescued by a team of firefighters. Fire Department New York City were called to the Bronx River at just after 4.30pm yesterday after reports a ten-year-old boy was trapped on the ice. The youngster had gone out onto the treacherous ice with a girl when she fell through the ice. The girl was able to pull herself onto nearby rocks and climb out of the river. Scroll down for video . Firefighters from Fire Department New York City rescue a ten-year-old boy who became trapped on the ice in the Bronx River, New York . But the 'terrified' boy was still standing on the  thin ice when the fire department arrived to save him. It took a team of firefighters in cold water gear just a couple of minutes to rescue the boy who is now being treated for exposure. Captain Thomas Yuneman said the ice had been cracking beneath the youngster's feet when he arrived and warned him to stand still and stay calm. Firefighters pass a lifesaver and then a ladder to the terrified youngster who eventually climbs to safety . Members of the team threw the boy a life preserver and two of the rescuers had attempted to make their way to him but the ice would not support their weight- plunging them into the freezing river in New York. They then lowered a ladder across the ice for him to climb across to safety. The boy, who never fell into the water, and one of his rescuers were transported to a hospital. Firefighter Chris Harkinish said: 'The ice was very thin and the situation could have been much worse.' 'Within two minutes we had him coming to shore,' added Captain Yuneman.

"The flogging of a Saudi blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam has been postponed for the third week in a row, his wife said today. Raef Badawi, 30, received the first 50 lashes of his sentence outside a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jeddah on January 9. The next round was postponed for the following two weeks on medical grounds. Now his wife Ensaf Haidar said he 'was not flogged' today either, adding that the reason was unclear. Scroll down for video . Raif Badawi (pictured) was handed down the sentence after criticising the country's Sunni clerics on his blog . Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone purported to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi was hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch . Last week, Badawi's spokeswoman said there was a chance he could have his jail sentence reduced. Dr Elham Manea, who is a professor at the University of Zurich, said the Saudi ambassador in Germany had told a broadcaster of the development. In a posting on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'Saudi ambassador in Germany informed NDR-TV that flogging will not continue and #RaifBadawi maybe not (sic) have to serve the whole time in prison.' Her comments came just a day after the second round of the 31-year-old's flogging was postponed a second time due to medical concerns. Only a few days ago Saudi Arabia was accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' after it initially delayed the father of three's flogging sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again. Saudi Arabia has come under huge international pressure after Mr Badawi's plight was championed by human rights campaigners. The 31-year-old won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to the hefty jail time, a £177,000 fine and the lashes. Elham Manea's Facebook post claimed the flogging was to be stopped and his 10-year jail sentence reduced . Mr Badawi and his wife Ensaf Haidar pictured together while they were both still living in Saudi Arabia . Father of three Raif Badawi was facing 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks for 'insulting Islam' His official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticise the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. He faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks. If it's true that his prison sentence has been reduced and flogging finished, it will be considered a small victory for his supporters after they made repeated calls for the 'torture' to be unconditionally stopped. Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone is believed to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi is hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch. Mr Badawi's wife has fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me.' UN officials say the flogging breaches international law as a 'cruel and unusual punishment' and the Foreign Office has said it would continue to raise the case.","Raif Badawi is facing 1,000 lashes and 10 years in jail for blog postings .

"The earliest known colour footage of the Beatles showing the Fab Four backstage at a concert in Blackpool has surfaced for the very first time. The three-and-a-half minute film, that has never before been seen, shows John, Paul, George and Ringo at the ABC Theatre in August 1963. The footage, that has no sound, was shot on an 8mm film by Chas McDevitt of the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group, which was one of the support acts for the Beatles that night. A still from the earliest known colour footage of the Beatles showing the Fab Four backstage at a concert in Blackpool . The footage features all four members of the group, including John Lennon, pictured. It was filmed by Chas McDevitt of the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group, which was one of the support acts for the Beatles that night . Some of the film shows the band performing live and was recorded in the wings of the stage by Mr McDevitt. The footage has now been made available for sale with copyright at auction alongside more than 100 photos of the Beatles that have also never been seen before. The black and white snaps were taken by Eve Bowen during the band’s tour of America in 1965 at the height of Beatlemania. The photographer followed the band as they travelled by train from Washington to New York where they appeared and performed on the Ed Sullivan Show. Her photos show one of superstar John Lennon having to wait behind the buffet trolley as it wheels its way down the narrow train aisle while passengers sit either looking on. A sign on the trolley advertising cheese and pickle sandwiches and a can of Coca Cola for 60 cents shows the snacks the group might have enjoyed on the journey.

"For most people, the game Sunday between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks is the Super Bowl. But for many business owners, it's simply the 'big game' or 'game day', due to the NFL's strict policies on the trademarked name. The strict policy means radio hosts are tripping over their tongues and airport signs are carefully worded to keep from referring to it as the Super Bowl. So as not to infringe on the NFL Super Bowl name trademark, all non-rights holders have to use different wording to promote any Super Bowl (restaurant in Phoenix pictured) Mom-and-pop shops and large companies hoping to cash in on the game — but also don't want to run afoul of league lawyers — have found ways to color inside the lines. Tyler Ellis, whose Coney Island Grill is located within the downtown Super Bowl Central village, is selling souvenir tie-dye shirts. The garments say 'Coney Island 2015' as well as 'the big game.' The $15 shirts come in pink, red, blue and green. Fortunately, the restaurant owner was fully aware of the league's reputation for coming down on trademark infringers. 'I'm just an NFL follower. You can't even YouTube their videos. They're just strict with their licensing,' Ellis said. Grocery chain Whole Foods has avoided using 'Super Bowl' on in-store signs and social media. The Facebook page for the central Phoenix location offers recipe ideas for 'your Big Game party.' Signs at American Airlines ticket counters in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport greet travelers with 'Welcome to the big game.' American Airlines spokesman Casey Norton said though it is the official airline for the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, the company isn't an NFL partner. 'Like any brand, we work to protect our valuable intellectual property and the rights we extend to our partners,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. What constitutes a violation is determined on a case-by case basis, McCarthy said. For example, a restaurant writing up a Super Bowl menu on a chalkboard wouldn't be an issue. And according to trademark law, a fair use exception allows for news organizations to use the Super Bowl moniker. This Whole Foods grocery store sees a customer pass a promotional display for 'the big game' McCarthy said if a potential infringement is discovered, the league will notify the party involved. If nothing changes, then a cease-and-desist letter follows. McCarthy declined to discuss how many companies have received letters in recent months. One of the participants in the Super Bowl is not a stranger to trademark disputes. Texas A&M University has long held the trademark for the term '12th Man,' the nickname for the Seahawks' large and vocal fan base. The Seahawks and university reached a settlement in 2006 that allows the team to use some versions of the phrase. And the NFL is not the only sports organization to be vigilant about its brand. Congress has created protections for the U.S. Olympic Committee so it has exclusive rights to use 'Olympics' and the interlocking rings logo. International soccer governing body FIFA is requiring countries that host the World Cup to create special rights in their constitutions to protect advertisers, said Jeff Greenbaum, a New York-based advertising lawyer with the firm Frankfurt Kurnit. Roger N. Behle Jr., an intellectual property lawyer with the firm Foley Bezek Behle & Curtis, said the NFL's monitoring is about maximizing revenue. 'They do have a right to police it. They spent a lot of money to build the brand up, make it profitable and not have any Tom, Dick and Harry use the marks,' said Behle, who has worked on licensing deals with the NFL and other major sports leagues. Greenbaum said the NFL's enforcement is also about protecting its sponsors. The league creates 'official' beers, chips, sodas and other items, which can give a business a distinct advantage over its competitors. 'The strategy that they're employing is to create enough concern among marketers that they're afraid to even get close to the line,' Greenbaum said.","Business owners must not use 'Super Bowl' name due to strict trademark policies .

"Passengers aboard a JetBlue flight have told of their terror as they narrowly avoided a mid-air collision with a small private plane that was 'joyriding' in commercial air space.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to lead his party to the next election, saying the success of his best ministers owes much to the team's 'captain'. Mr Abbott was responding to reports senior government MPs have given him until the second half of 2015 to improve his performance or risk losing his job. Coalition MPs have publicly and privately criticised Mr Abbott in recent weeks, with his decision to award a knighthood to Prince Philip seen by some as the last straw in a series of poor decisions. Asked whether he would lead the coalition to the 2016 election, Mr Abbott said: 'Absolutely.'

'One of the reasons why so many members of the team are able to perform so well is because they have got a very good captain,' said Mr Abbott, who was visiting a dairy farm in the regional Victorian city of Colac on Friday. 'It takes a good captain to help all the players of a team to excel.' Facing criticism he is out of touch with the community, Mr Abbott said he kept in contact by dropping in on cafes while going on his regular bike rides. 'Most weekends I'm in local cafes - admittedly dressed in lycra riding with the local cycling group,' he told reporters.

"Locked-in sufferers, who are fully conscious but completely paralysed, could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones. The breakthrough follows the development of two portable 'mind readers' that combine the use of vibrating pads and an electrode cap to measure a patient's brain signals. Scientists say these could help prevent people being misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative state, when in reality they can understand everything going on around them. The breakthrough follows the development of two portable 'mind readers' (pictured) that combine the use of vibrating pads and an electrode cap to measure a patient's brain signals . Up until now, huge fMRI scanners were one of the only hope for locked-in patients to communicate, according to a report by Clare Wilson in the New Scientist. Previous tests had shown success in communicating with people in a locked-in state by concentrating on the specific words, 'yes' or 'no' while inside the scanner. By studying their brain activity using electrodes, researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers. Adrian Owen of Western University in London, Canada, has been developing a system that involves placing vibrating pads on someone's arm, and then asking them to focus on one vibrator. The idea is that paying attention to a sense-like vibration creates electrical signals in the brain that are much easier to read than eye movements. Locked-in sufferers, who are fully conscious but completely paralysed, could soon be given the ability to communicate with their loved ones. Pictured is an example of how the brain lights up when someone with locked in syndrome reacts to the question 'are you married?' Last year, a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state was able to follow the plot of a short Hitchcock film. Doctors believed the 34-year-old Canadian was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago. But scans taken while the patient was shown 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' revealed brain activity linked to feelings of anticipation and excitement. The brain patterns resembled that of healthy participants, suggesting not only that the patient was consciously aware, but also that he understood the film. 'For the first time, we show that a patient with unknown levels of consciousness can monitor and analyse information from their environment, in the same way as healthy individuals,' said Lorina Naci, a researcher at the University of Western Ontario. 'We already know that up to one in five of these patients are misdiagnosed as being unconscious and this new technique may reveal that that number is even higher.' 'Tactile stimulation works very well.' Professor Owen told New Scientist. 'We have had some successes.' An Austrian company, called g.tec, has developed a similar system using vibrating pads on a patient's wrists and then measuring their brain waves. According to the New Scientist, the University of Liège in Belgium has successfully tested it on people with classic locked-in syndrome by asking them to count the vibrations felt. By analysing their brain activity using electrodes, researchers have shown that they can accurately read their answers. Professor Owen's has previously shown that some people described as being in a 'vegetative state' could understand and follow instructions. Up until now, huge fMRI scanners (pictured) were one of the only hopes for locked-in patients to communicate . Several years ago, his team used fMRi to show that one in five people in vegetated states could think about playing tennis or walking around their home. In September, a man diagnosed as being in a vegetative state has been able to follow the plot of a short Hitchcock film. Doctors believed the 34-year-old Canadian was left entirely unresponsive after suffering a cardiac arrest 16 years ago. But scans taken while the patient was shown 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' revealed brain activity linked to feelings of anticipation and excitement. The brain patterns resembled that of healthy participants, suggesting not only that the patient was consciously aware, but also that he understood the film. 'We already know that up to one in five of these patients are misdiagnosed as being unconscious and this new technique may reveal that that number is even higher,' said Lorina Naci, a researcher at the University of Western Ontario.","Locked-in sufferers are fully conscious but completely paralysed .
Devices that analyse brain waves can allow them to communicate .
Previously this analysis could only be done in a large fMRI scanner .
Now two separate research groups have created a portable version .

"A chef has created Scotland's priciest pudding made with edible 24-carat gold leaf, Dom Perignon champagne jelly and vanilla beans imported from Madagascar. Edinburgh-based restaurateur Mark Greenaway's rhubarb and Champagne crumble will set diners back £30 for a portion. Mr Greenaway, who previously appeared on popular BBC series Great British Menu, said: 'We got the first of the season's rhubarb in last week and I was playing around with it, trying to think of what to do. The rhubarb and Champagne crumble made with edible 24-carat gold leaf, Dom Perignon champagne jelly, vanilla beans imported from Madagascar and white chocolate with coconut blossom nectar . 'There was some Dom Perignon champagne open and I just decided to mix the two together. 'The fizz of the Champagne and the sourness of the rhubarb means these flavours go together so well.' Innovative chocolatier IQ Chocolate, based in Stirling, was commissioned to create an exclusive white chocolate for the dish, using coconut blossom nectar as a key ingredient instead of sugar. Chef Mark Greenaway created the £30 pudding . The white chocolate sphere contains rhubarb parfait, Dom Perignon jelly and the base is carefully crafted out of pistachio and shortbread, with small rhubarb meringues dotted around the plate. Each dessert takes Mr Greenaway's team between four to five hours to make from scratch. The rhubarb and champagne crumble comes with a glass of Dom Perignon champagne and will be available, pre-order only, Restaurant Mark Greenaway from 7 to 13 February. While Mr Greenaway's pudding might be Scotland's priciest, it certainly isn't the most expensive dish in the world. Norma Restaurant in New York served a $1,000 (£662) frittata  made with potatoes, a pound of lobster and ten ounces of caviar. The most expensive soup in the world, served at Tiato Restaurant in Santa Monica, contains Wagyu beef, white alba truffles, a foie gras broth, hand-raised bean sprouts and noodles made from rare blue lobster meat and will set diners back $5,000 (£3,312). In October last year head chef at London's Honky Tonk restaurant, Chris Large created the world's most expensive burger, a snack costing £1,100 made with caviar, Champagne, gold leaf and lobster. Sushi was luxed up when Phillipines restaurant Angelito Araneta served a 24-carat gold leaf version with 0.2-carat African diamonds. The dish, which cost $2,700 (£1,789) also came with three Mikimoto pearls. New York's Serendipity 3 restaurant created a $25,000 (£16,573) dessert made from a blend of eight cocoas include 14 of the world's most expensive varieties with 5g of edible 23-carat gold and served in a golden goblet lined with 1-karat white diamonds and a gold spoon which can be taken home.","Dessert created by Edinburgh-based restaurateur Mark Greenaway .

"Police searching for missing mother-of-four Samantha Henderson have found a body in a lake. Miss Henderson, 25, vanished from Corfe Castle, Dorset, last week. The body, believed to be that of the young mother, was today found in Ham Common lake, near Poole - eight miles from where she disappeared. Scroll down for video . Detectives searching for missing mother-of-four Samantha Henderson (pictured) have found a body in a lake . Police divers were seen searching one of the lakes yesterday as the hunt for Miss Henderson continued . Tragic: A body was pulled from Ham Common lake earlier today but it is yet to be identified . Her boyfriend Dominic Isom, 27, has already appeared before a judge accused of her murder and has been remanded in custody. Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning last week - nearly 18 hours after she was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at around 3pm. Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Samantha's family with today's development. 'Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. Her children are being cared for by relatives. 'I would like to thank the public for all their help during this investigation and their patience and understanding, in particular the communities in the Corfe Castle and Hamworthy area who have seen a great deal of police activity over the last week. 'I am still keen to hear from anyone who saw Samantha's blue Peugeot 307 estate car with the registration HV04 ZFM being driven in the Lake Pier and South Haven Close areas between 3pm on January 21 and 5pm on January 23 to contact me in confidence. Sighting: Detectives searching for 25-year-old Samantha Henderson from Corfe Castle, Dorset, released this CCTV footage of her the day she disappeared. In it, she is seen shopping in The Sweet Shoppe . Search: Police are continuing searches at the edge of woodland next to the A351 at Norden, in Dorset . Major crime officers and forensics experts have combed allotments, outbuildings in the area as well as the missing mother's home . 'I am urging anyone who saw anything suspicious in this area between the relevant times to get in touch.' The scene remains cordoned off while forensic investigators carry out their examinations, with searches still taking place off the A351 near Corfe Castle. The Dorset coroner has also been informed of the discovery and formal identification is yet to take place. Following the young mother's disappearance, police helicopters scoured the area, with 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combing allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother's home. Detectives seized Miss Henderson's blue Peugeot 307 from her home on Monday night and asked the public to help trace the car's movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday. Dorset Police said she was a 'prolific phone user' but that her mobile had not been found. Appeal: Detectives still want the public's help trace her car's (pictured) movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday . Hunt: Detectives scoured the town of Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she was last seen a week ago . Isom, of Halves Cottages, Corfe Castle, appeared at Winchester Crown Court today where he denied Ms Henderson's murder. He will face trial later this year. He is charged with murdering her on January 21 - the day she was last seen alive. Miss Henderson, who has children aged six, four, two and one, was reported missing at 8.43am on January 22. On Monday, police released CCTV showing the missing mother on the day she vanished. She can be seen in the footage moving animatedly around the shop wearing a pink jumper or coat and light blue jeans. Her long blonde hair is tied up in a ponytail. She appears to buy cigarettes from behind the counter while chatting to the shopkeeper and hesitates at the till as she enters her pin number before leaving the shop.

"Sydney siege hostage Marcia Mikhael has lashed out at the country's bail system for allowing gunman Man Haron Monis to roam free, despite being on charges of accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. Speaking to 7News, Ms Mikhael said was 'upset' and 'disappointed' with the judicial system for failing to imprison Monis, who was also on a further 40 charges of sexual assault. Monis went on to cause the death of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson on December 16 during the Lindt Cafe siege. 'How was he out on bail? If he wasn't on bail none of this would've happened,' Mikhael told Seven. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikael (pictured) has bravely opened up about the moment she 'gave up home' and begged with her captor, Man Monis, to hear . 'How could he be on bail? How can someone so dangerous like him be allowed to be on bail?' 43-year-old Mikhael is the first of the 18 hostages to speak out regarding Monis' criminal record. Her comments come after police revealed today that they wrote a 'strongly-worded' submission urging prosecutors to review Man Haron Monis's release on bail over the alleged murder of his ex-wife but the document was never filed. The Director of Public Prosecutions never received the document, an error expected to be examined at the inquest into the Sydney Lindt Cafe siege which began on Thursday, the Daily Telegraph reported. Marcia Mikhael is carried to safety by paramedics after suffering leg wounds in the Sydney siege shootout. It's rumoured she could be paid up to $400,000 to tell her story . Gunman Man Monis was released on bail on December 12 2013. On December 15 2014 he walked into the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place and took 18 people hostage . A source told the newspaper homicide detectives were 'furious' that the documents were given to an officer who never sent them on. 'They pushed up hard to have his bail refused and they sent up a letter to the executive offices to have it reviewed by the DPP but it never got there,' they said. The inquest will investigate why gunman Monis was out on bail when he took 18 people hostage at the busy cafe in Martin Place on December 15. Monis was on bail on a charge of colluding with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, to murder his former wife Noleen Hayson Pal. On December 12 2013, Monis, 49, and Droudis, 34, who is charged with Ms Pal's murder, applied for bail on the accessory to murder and murder charges. They were both released on bail reportedly because the prosecution case against them for the death of was considered 'weak'. She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead . John O'Brien, the oldest hostage at 82, was also one of the first to escape. He says took a risk because 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out' This is despite the fact that Monis had prior convictions - for writing malicious letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan - and the outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'. Monis then walked in to the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place in Sydney on December 15 and took 18 people hostage. In an upcoming interview with Channel Seven, Ms Mikhael, opened up about the devastating moment 'that she gave up hope' while being kept hostage by Man Haron Monis at the Lindt Café in Martin Place - certain that all 17 captives would be shot dead. Monis, a self-made sheik, made terrifying, calculated threats which made Ms Mikhael certain that she would not leave the building alive. 'He told us, 'For every person that escapes, I will shoot two'. That was when I lost hope,' Mikhael recounted tearfully. 'That's when I asked him if I could call my kids and if I could speak to them.' 'I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.' Selina Win Pe was among the hostages forced to stand up against the Lindt Chocolate Cafe windows and hold up a flag by the gunman during the 17-hour ordeal . One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000 . 'You have 15 minutes'. They are the chilling final words from crazed gunman Man Haron Monis to his hostages, said Selina Win Pe . Ms Mikhael is a 43-year-old mother of three from Glenwood in Sydney's northwest. She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead. 'I told them that I loved them very much and I needed them to remember that,' Mikhael said. 'My eldest son kept telling me 'Mum, stop it, everything's going to be okay' and I kept telling him 'I know, I know but just remember that I love you, I love you so much' and then I had to hang up.' Hostage John O'Brien, 82, has also describes how it felt when on that fateful Monday when the staff and customers at the Lindt Cafe realised that a regular morning at a coffee shop had become a horrifying hostage situation. 'All hell broke loose once he locked the front door,' Mr O'Brien told Seven News. 'He said 'I'll kill you all one by one'. Mr O'Brien was one of a group of three people who managed to escape at 3.37pm when the former tennis player noticed a green button which opened the doors, allowing them to flee. 'I said please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me. I only have my mum, please don't shoot me,' she said, unable to hold back tears . Several of the hostages were forced to record video messages, including Selina Win Pe, who has told her story to Liz Hayes for the upcoming 60 Minutes siege special . The eldest hostage knew that if the plan didn't work he would surely be killed by the gunman. 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out so…' Mr O'Brien's voice falters as he tries to explain his horrific conundrum. Hostage Selina Win Pe also revealed the horrifying moment crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her she had just 15 minutes to live. Monis turned to Ms Win Pe during the height of the siege in the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place, where he took 18 people hostage on December 15, and forced her to beg for her life. 'I said please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me,' she told 60 Minutes in an upcoming special to air on Channel Nine. 'I only have my mum, please don't shoot me. He looked me straight in the eyes and said 'you have 15 minutes''. 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'.

Mourning: Sydney siege hostage Selina Win Pae today comforted by fellow former captives Harriette Denny (right) and Fiona Ma (left) - and Jarrod Hoffman (right) as she placed flowers in tribute to Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson on the day of Lindt cafe manager's funeral . The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.' Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.' It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who was 19 weeks pregnant when she was caught up in the stand-off, could also be featured in the 60 Minutes special. Ceremonies for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson came more than a week after the deadly siege . The Nine Network confirmed that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting on the Sydney siege special, due to air in the next couple of weeks. 'Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story'. Selina Win Pe revealed to her that hostages were told they had '15 minutes' to live . The shootout. The 60 Minutes special will also focus on those last moments when police stormed the building and gunman Man Monis was killed . She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell. Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understands.","Hostage Marcia Mikhael has spoken out against the judicial system .

"Babies have been pulled alive from the debris of a Mexican maternity hospital after a powerful fuel tank explosion that left three dead and dozens injured. A nurse and a baby died in the blast and a second infant died late last night after the blast destroyed most of the Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital in Mexico City. Today it emerged that the driver of the truck, which exploded while gas was being piped into the building, has been detained along with two assistants. More than 70 people were injured including mothers who reportedly used their bodies to shield their children from the huge fireball. Scroll down for video . A nurse and a baby died in the blast and a second infant died late last night after the blast destroyed most of the Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital in Mexico City . Babies have been pulled alive from the debris of a Mexican maternity hospital after a  fuel tank truck exploded leaving three dead and dozens injured . Yesterday, officials said as many as seven had died but today they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries . A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said. Yesterday, officials said as many as seven had died but today they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries. Armando Ahued, the city's health secretary said today that 21 babies in all had been injured, and nine of those and seven adults were in serious condition after being rushed to other hospitals. Several babies were found under the rubble while scores of rescue workers smashed through the concrete and twisted metal in a desperate bid for survivors. The explosion occurred at 7:05 a.m. when a tanker truck was making a routine delivery of gas to the hospital kitchen and the gas started to leak. The blast is understood to have been caused by a leak in a hose carrying gas from the truck to the hospital . The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital . Dozens of people were evacuated after the truck exploded outside the hospital with many of the injuries caused by broken glass . Witnesses said the tanker workers struggled frantically for 15 or 20 minutes to repair the leak while a large cloud of gas formed. 'The hose broke. The two gas workers tried to stop it, but they were very nervous. They yelled for people to get out,' said Laura Diaz Pacheco, a laboratory technician. 'Everyone's initial reaction was to go inside, away from the gas,' she added. 'Maybe as many as 10 of us were able to get out ... The rest stayed inside.' Workers on the truck yelled: 'Call the firefighters, call the firefighters!' said anesthesiologist Agustin Herrera. People started to evacuate the hospital, and then came a devastating explosion that sent up an enormous fireball and plumes of dust and smoke. A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said .

Officials say 21 babies in all had been injured, and nine of those and seven adults were in serious condition after being rushed to other hospitals . The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital and television images showed firefighters trying to extinguish fires throughout the collapsed hospital building. Herrera saw injured mothers walking out carrying babies. Officials said 110 people were inside the 35-bed hospital when the truck blew up. 'We avoided a much bigger tragedy because the oxygen tanks right beside (the area) didn't explode,' Herrera said. The worst hit parts of the hospital were the neonatology, reception and emergency reception units, he said. Passers-by rushed into the building after the blast and made their way to the nursery section, rescuing eight babies, it has been reported. Margarita Palma of Amexgas, a trade association of Mexico's propane distributors, said 80 percent of Mexicans use propane rather than natural gas delivered by mains. Some of the victims were airlifted to hospital as the scale of the explosion became clear yesterday . Several babies were found under the rubble while scores of rescue workers smashed through the concrete and twisted metal in a desperate bid for survivors . A police officer is comforted by a colleague after being injured at the scene of the explosion . People started to evacuate the hospital as the emergency unfolded, and then came a devastating explosion that sent up an enormous fireball and plumes of dust and smoke . Liquified propane, which is highly explosive, is distributed to homes and businesses either by trucks like the one that exploded or in cylinders, she said. Homes next to the hospital were also damaged in the blast, as windows broke and and shingles fell from roofs. Neighbors ran to help evacuate victims from the debris, local resident Carlos Soria Rezendiz said. People seeking information on family members gathered around police lines that were set up to keep bystanders away from the chaotic scene. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter, and aerial footage showed firefighters scrambling over the skeletal wreckage of the building. There were seven babies with serious injuries in intensive care in a nearby hospital, said Dr. Moises Zielanowski, as well as four adults in serious condition. Injuries included burns, fractures and bruises. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter, and aerial footage showed firefighters scrambling over the skeletal wreckage of the building .

He said the company has provided gas to all the city's public hospitals since 2007. The incident prompted tweets from President Enrique Pena Nieto to Pope Francis, who wrote, 'We are praying for the victims of the explosion in Cuajimalpa, Mexico.' According to a government website, the hospital was founded in 1993. It is located in a densely populated lower middle class neighborhood next to a school.","Powerful fuel tank explosion in Mexico City destroyed maternity hospital .

"Roy Keane, 43, is accused of launching tirade of abuse at taxi driver Fateh Kerar, 44, after Mr Kerar told football star to 'smile' A taxi driver who claims to have been subjected to a torrent of abuse during a road rage attack by football star Roy Keane has told how the incident left him 'shaking and terrified'. Fateh Kerar, 44, claims he was targeted by 43-year-old Keane after he saw the former Manchester United captain sitting in traffic, before leaning out of his window and telling Keane to 'smile'. Police are tonight investigating the alleged attack, which happened at around 11.30am at a set of traffic lights in the centre of Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Mr Kerar said the incident began while he was sitting with a female passenger in Hale, where Keane lives, when the pair spotted him sitting in a black Range Rover while staring directly at them. He said: 'We were both saying 'that's Roy Keane' but he was just glaring back at us, looking really angry. I said 'hello' to him, then said 'smile'. 'He drove behind us going into Altrincham and as we got to the traffic lights he stopped beside us and turned to us still looking really angry. 'He got out of his car in the middle of the road, held two fingers up and walked out in front of me. He was pointing and swearing and being very aggressive. 'He shouldn't be allowed to treat people that way. There were lots of people stood around who couldn't believe what they were seeing.' Passenger Hothan Isman, 38, said: 'He was staring aggressively at the driver - I was saying 'wow, he's really staring at you'. He would turn away then turn back and keep staring. 'When we got to the traffic lights he turned and stopped the car. He got out and was gesticulating with his arms and shouting furiously. Scroll down for video . Mr Kerar said Keane followed him in his black Range Rover while staring at him, then climbed out at this junction and began swearing and making obscene gestures . Police say they are investigating the incident which occurred at 11.30am in Altrincham, Greater Manchester . 'The driver looked terrified and was shaking quite badly. I said he should call the police because it was very nasty, unpleasant, aggressive behaviour.' The alleged rant was witnessed by stunned onlookers near the Unicorn pub at the junction of Lloyd Street and Railway Street in Altrincham town. Keane, was allegedly seen swearing and making obscene gestures through the window of the taxi before getting in his car and driving away. Just hours after the incident Keane launched a foul-mouthed tirade at a reporter who tried to ask him about the alleged incident. He said to the journalist: 'What are you talking about?' 'What are you saying? Believe what you want - I can tell what you want from me, you just want a quote. 'Now get the f*** away from me. Get the f*** away from me, now.' A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman confirmed the force is now investigating. She said: 'At 11.30am this morning, Friday 30 January 2015, police were called to Ashley Road, Altrincham to a report that a man had behaved aggressively towards another man. 'An investigation is underway to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident.' Roy Keane quit his role as Aston Villa's assistant manager in November but continued in his position as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team. He represented Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Celtic during a 26-year playing career and made 67 appearances for the Republic of Ireland. After retiring, he managed Sunderland from 2006 to 2008 and Ipswich Town from 2009 to 2011. As a player, Keane injured himself trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds in 1997. Notorious hard-man Keane made 300 appearances for Manchester United as a player, and was once captain. He quit as assistant coach of Aston Villa recently after an alleged bust-up with players . As a player Keane once injured himself while trying to tackle Alf-Inge Haaland in a game against Leeds. Years later, Keane injured Haaland's with a tackle of his own, admitting it was an act of revenge in his biography . Haaland initially accused him of feigning injury. Four years later, Haaland claimed Keane effectively ended his career, after a reckless tackle during a Premier League match in 2001. Keane was again the subject of a major controversy when after arriving in Asia for the 2002 World Cup, he voiced his disapproval of the team's poor training facilities at the Irish camp in Saipan. In front of the entire Irish side, during a routine team meeting, he berated Mick McCarthy, then manager of the Irish side. He was later sent home and played no part in the rest of Ireland's World Cup campaign. Last year there were reports that Keane - following his departure from Aston Villa - had turned up at footballer Tom Cleverley's house to confront the midfielder over claims a bust-up with players led to him leaving the club. The club's manager Paul Lambert later insisted the incident had not unfolded in the way it was reported.","Roy Keane, 43, is accused of launching foul-mouthed tirade at taxi driver .

"A woman who alleges an Uber driver raped her in the Indian capital has sued the online taxi service in a U.S. court, accusing it of failing to provide passenger safety. In her lawsuit, the Indian woman accuses Uber of putting profits over safety, calling the American-based company the 'modern day equivalent of electronic hitchhiking'. The American lawyer for the 25-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Uber was being sued for unspecified damages for 'physical and emotional harm'. Indian police escort Uber taxi driver and accused rapist Shiv Kumar Yadav (center) following his court appearance in New Delhi on December 8, 2014 . 'Despite its self-proclaimed commitment to safety, opening the Uber app and setting the pick-up location has proven to be the modern day equivalent of electronic hitchhiking,' according to the lawsuit filed in a court in California. 'Buyer beware - we all know how those horror movies end,' the lawsuit said, accusing Uber of negligence. The woman's lawyer, Douglas H. Wigdor, had earlier represented a hotel maid who accused former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault in 2012. The San Francisco-based company did not comment on the lawsuit but said 'our deepest sympathies remain with the victim of this horrific crime'. A spokesman said the company was also 'cooperating fully' with authorities to ensure the person responsible for the crime was brought to justice. Uber was banned from Delhi's streets in the aftermath of the December 5 attack on the woman, which sparked new safety fears in a city with a high record of sexual violence. The trial of the accused driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, who allegedly attacked the woman as she was on her way home from dinner, is underway. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, kidnap and criminal intimidation. Uber, which connects passengers to drivers through smartphone apps, last week said it was resuming its Delhi operations, but authorities rejected its request for a licence to operate as a radio-taxi company. Uber has said it is committed to protecting its passengers in India and globally. India is one of the company's key markets outside the United States and operates in nearly a dozen Indian cities. A woman who alleges an Uber driver raped her in the Indian capital Delhi has sued the online taxi service in a US court, accusing it of failing to provide passenger safety .","The Indian woman accuses Uber of putting profits over safety, calling the company the 'modern day equivalent of electronic hitchhiking'

"They are the most famous birds of prey in the world and it seems they are just as vicious with each other as with the helpless animals that fear them. A photographer has captured some spectacular images of two golden eagles locked in a desperate battle in the mountainous region of Utajärvi, Finland. The amazing photos show a female eagle swooping in on a male and attacking after he has ventured into her territory. Scroll down for video . The two golden eagles are photographed in a desperate battle in the mountainous Utajärvi region of Finland . The female is the aggressor, launching a ferocious attack after a male eagle makes the mistake of straying into her territory . The spectacular images capture every moment of the action as the birds tumble into the snow as they are locked in battle . Extreme cold and deep snow throughout the winter months often mean the birds don't eat for days at a time - making them particularly aggressive in the desperate battle to find food. In the dramatic action shots, which manage to capture the attack as well as the intricate details of the scene, the female can be seen swooping straight down onto the male in a relentless ambush. After crashing into its target, the golden eagle was sent tumbling over a rock into a cloud of powdery snow, sparking an epic eight minute brawl. The incident arose when the Finnish region experienced a lengthy spell of cold weather which forced the birds to rest their wings a way to reserve energy. After not eating for days on end, the birds, who are notorious for their short tempers, then become extremely aggressive. The female aggressor shows her dominance against the male in the prolonged attack, which see her dwooping down and crashing into him . Golden eagles are known for their aggression and were thought to have become particularly territorial after bad winter weather forced them into a period of days without food . Israeli wildlife photographer, Vladimir Kogan, was calmly snapping the eagles when the scuffle in the snow suddenly broke out . While clashes between golden eagles are not uncommon, a female attacking a male is a rarer sight for wildlife entnusiasts . Although it isn't unusual for males to fight, females attacking males are not commonly seen in the wild. Israeli wildlife photographer, Vladimir Kogan, was calmly snapping the eagles when the scuffle in the snow suddenly broke out. Vladimir said: 'The golden eagle is a very capricious and aggressive bird at the best of times. 'It had been a pretty cold couple of days, the temperatures were below -25 degrees and when temperatures are that low these eagles try not to waste their energy. 'They sit in tree branches waiting for the temperature to rise up to -10 to -15 degree so that they can fly off in search of food, but can wait for days. The aggressive female can be seen sending the male tumbling into the snow after flying straight into him . Temperatures had reached lower than -25 degrees in Finland when Kogan witnessed the dramatic attack by the female bird . The golden eagles are forced to wait for days in the branches of trees for the weather to warm up by around 10 degrees before they can hunt . Kogan managed to capture the outstanding pictures as the battle raged in front of him, estimating that it lasted around eight minutes . 'Of course after a couple of cold, hungry days the eagles become more aggressive and are easily agitated. 'I was so lucky to witness the moment too furious eagles began to fight with one another, it was a vicious battle and lasted about eight minutes in all. 'Snowflakes started to fall during the fight which really added to the spectacular nature of the photos.'","Female golden eagle swoops down to attack male rival in the mountains of Finland .

"Tory chairman Grant Shapps ruled out making a deal with Ukip after the election . David Cameron will not go into a coalition with Ukip if his party fails to win a majority at the General Election, it was claimed today. Grant Shapps, the Tory party chairman, publicly ruled out a pact with Nigel Farage’s party, saying ‘we are not going to do pacts and deals with Ukip.’ He conceded it would be ‘an incredibly close election’, with the polls showing the Conservative and Labour neck and neck and a high probability of another hung Parliament. The Tories have not ruled out another coalition with the Liberal Democrats if they emerge the largest party, but fall short of the 326 seats required for an overall majority. But recent analysis suggests that even with the support of the Lib Dems, who are set to lose around half their seats in May, they may still fail to win enough seats to form a government. Ukip, who currently have two MPs, could win as many as five or six seats in May, including one for Mr Farage who is standing in the Tory-held seat of Thanet South in Kent. Mr Shapps this morning gave a speech highlighting the ‘chaos’ which would come with a future Labour government, especially if it went into Coalition with the Scottish Nationalists, who are expected to take at least a dozen Labour seats in Scotland. Asked if he would rule out a Coalition between the Conservatives and Ukip, he said: ‘I can rule [it] out, we are not going to do pacts and deal with Ukip, we are looking for an overall majority’ He said the only poll which mattered was on election day, in 97 days’ time, and said there would be many voters still undecided as the public tend to think about an election ‘until the last ten days’. ‘We have seen the polls close and I’m the first to concede this is going to be an incredibly close election’ he said. ‘With the Conservatives you know what you’re getting. ‘You’re getting a competent government who is serious about running the economy, serious about reducing the deficit and eventually producing a surplus. With any of the other choices, you are going to get a large degree of chaos.’ Ukip MEP today dismissed Mr Shapps' claim that the Tories would not go into Coalition or enter into a 'confidence and supply' deal . Mr Farage said last year that he could form a tactical alliance with the Tories or Labour if his party wins a string of seats in May. Under a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ deal, his MPs could agree to support key measures such as the Budget, but the party would not enter into a formal Coalition or hold ministerial posts. Mr Cameron has promised £7.2billion of tax cuts if he wins a second term – by raising the level at which people start to pay income tax from £10,500 to £12,500 and increasing the salary level at which people start to pay the higher 40p rate of tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by the end of the Parliament. The Prime Minister had suggested he would start to cut taxes in his first year, although the deficit will not be eliminated until 2018 at least. But Mr Shapps would not be drawn on this yesterday, saying: . ‘The commitment is by the end of the next Parliament and the timing will of course be dependent on the economic performance of the British economy.’ But he added: ‘It’s absolutely do-able and I think we’ve got the economic credibility to show we can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit in this Parliament and in the next one.’","Tory chairman said ‘we are not going to do pacts and deals with Ukip’

"Jordan has threatened to fast-track the execution of a would-be suicide bomber the Islamic State is trying to free  if the terror group kills its captured pilot, it was reported today. The government has apparently warned that Sajida al-Rishawi and other jailed ISIS commanders would be 'quickly judged and sentenced' in revenge for  Muath al-Kaseasbeh's death. It comes after a deadline for a possible prisoner swap allegedly set by ISIS passed yesterday with no clue over the fate of al-Kaseasbeh or fellow Japanese hostage Kenji Goto. Intelligence sources said ISIS's refusal to prove that al-Kaseasbeh was alive meant any deal with the militants was doomed. Now Jordan has reportedly stepped up its rhetoric by warning  of its intent to retaliate if the negotiations end in bloodshed. Elijah Magnier, chief international correspondent for Kuwait's Al Rai newspaper, told MailOnline: 'I have reliable contact in the Jordanian government who says a message has been passed to ISIS. 'It warns that if they kill the pilot they will implement the death sentences for Sajida and other ISIS prisoners as soon as possible. Scroll down for video . Jordanian F-16 pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh (centre) is captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is threatening to kill him unless Jordan releases a terrorist . Jordan has threatened to fast-track the execution of a would-be suicide bomber the Islamic State is trying to free if the terror group kills al-Kaseasbeh, seen here after being captured in Syria in December . In its latest audio recording, ISIS threatened to kill Muath al-Kaseasbeh if a deadline was not kept for the release of would-be suicide bomber al-Rishawi by dusk Iraq time Thursday - around 5.30pm (2.30pm GMT) 'There are other prisoners in Jordan that ISIS would like to free.' MailOnline has attempted to contact the Jordanian government for comment, but a spokesman has not yet responded. Shortly after reports of the ultimatum emerged, Jordan issued a statement saying they were still waiting for proof that the captured F-16 pilot was still alive. Jordan had agreed to an ISIS demand to free al-Rishawi who failed to fulfil her Al Qaeda mission as a suicide bomber. In return, ISIS said it would not execute the 26-year-old pilot, who was seized in December after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa. In its latest audio recording, ISIS threatened to kill al-Kaseasbeh if a deadline was not kept for the release of al-Rishawi by dusk Iraq time yesterday - around 5.30pm (2.30pm GMT). But it appeared to make no promises to release him, another condition the Jordanian government is demanding. It was not clear from the recording what would happen to Mr Goto if the deadline was missed. Jordan has threatened to speed up the execution of a would-be suicide bomber the Islamic State is trying to free if the terror group kills its captured pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, seen above in a picture being held by fellow hostage Kenji Goto in a video posted by ISIS last week demanding the release of an Iraqi terrorist . The Jordanian government has apparently warned ISIS that Sajida al-Rishawi and other jailed Islamic extremists would be 'quickly judged and sentenced' in revenge for pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh's death . Japan also said it had no new progress to report. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said every effort was being made to secure the release of journalist Kenji Goto. 'We are gathering and analysing information while asking for cooperation from Jordan and other countries, making every effort to free Kenji Goto,' he told a parliamentary panel. Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters repeated Japan's 'strong trust' in Jordan to help save the freelance journalist. Mr Suga said the government had been in close contact with Mr Goto's wife Rinko Jogo, who released a statement pleading for her husband's life. 'I fear that this is the last chance for my husband, and we now have only a few hours left,' Ms Jogo said in a statement released through the Rory Peck Trust, a London-based organisation for freelance journalists. Ms Jogo said she had avoided public comment until the last minute to try to protect her daughters, a newborn baby and a two-year-old, from media attention. Showing the strain: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reacts during a meeting as the country anxiously awaits news of a prisoner exchange with ISIS which was due to take place at sunset in the Middle East . Stress: Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the father of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh who has been taken hostage by ISIS, is seen after meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II following a protest by the pilot's relatives at the entrance to the royal palace to ensure the government does all it can to secure his son's release . An audio message purportedly posted online by IS group said the Jordanian pilot, Lieutenant Muath al-Kaseasbeh, would be killed if would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi was not delivered to the Turkish border by sunset yesterday, Iraq time. There was no mention on whether the pilot or Mr Goto would be traded for her. The authenticity of the recording could not be verified independently but the possibility of a swap was raised on Wednesday when Jordan said it was willing to trade Rishawi for the pilot. After sundown in the Middle East, with no news on the fate of either Lt Kaseasbeh or Mr Goto, the families' agonising wait dragged on. In the Jordanian capital Amman, the pilot's brother Jawdat Kaseasbeh, said his family had 'no clue' where the negotiations stood. 'We received no assurances from anyone that he is alive,' he said. 'We are waiting, just waiting.' Jordan's government spokesman, Mohammed al-Momani, signalled last night that, in any case, a swap was on hold because the hostage-takers had not delivered proof the pilot was still alive. Rishawi, 44, faces death by hanging for her role in a suicide bombing, one of three simultaneous attacks on Amman hotels in November 2005 that killed 60 people. She survived because her belt of explosives did not detonate. She initially confessed, but later recanted, saying she was an unwilling participant. Anticpation and anxiety: People gather at the Akcakale border control in Turkey, one of the possible sites where it is believed the prisoner exchange deal between ISIS and Jordan would have taken place . Dr Andreas Krieg, from King's College London's Department of Defence Studies, believes that a prisoner swap would benefit ISIS in the short-term, for propaganda purposes, but would ultimately weaken them. He told MailOnline: 'The US and the UK government are probably the only governments that have taken an assertive stance towards not negotiating with terrorists. 'A prisoner swap will only have propaganda value for ISIS. 'It is not of any operational significance. But symbolically they will be able to demonstrate to their own people and potential recruits in the West that they have the bargaining power to issue demands to powerful governments. 'Also, ISIS needs this symbolic success as the fall of Kobane is a major symbolic defeat after they poured so many resources in it. 'After all it seems they will not prevail there. It is also a significant blow against the Jordanian government, which as part of the US-led coalition is under significant domestic and external Japanese pressure to do something. 'ISIS would make Jordan look weak compared to local extremists in Jordan and to coalition partners, most notably the US. 'But to be honest, with ISIS urgently in need for new financial resources, I think that a prisoner swap is always better than ransom. 'The initially claimed ransom would have added significantly to their budget (it would have covered 10 per cent of their annual budget). They can't smuggle oil anymore, avenues of extortion have been exhausted. 'So kidnap for ransom is the only significant income they can generate. Not getting the money is a good thing. It will weaken rather than significantly strengthen the organization. 'We can't say much about the swap at the moment. Just that it will be done by intermediaries. But both sides would be stupid to try to use the actual swap at the border to play games. For Jordan it will jeopardise the life of their pilot and for ISIS it would undermine their credibility as negotiation partners in kidnapping cases. 'As I said, ISIS needs kidnap for ransom to maintain their financial self-sufficiency.' A man, believed to be an Islamic state militant, is seen near the northern Syrian town of Tal Abyad as he is pictured from the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where it is believed the prisoner swap may take place . She is from the Iraqi city of Ramadi and has close family ties to the Iraqi branch of al Qaida, a precursor of IS. Three of her brothers were al Qaida operatives killed in fighting in Iraq. Jordan has faced tough choices in the hostage drama. Releasing Rishawi, implicated in the worst terror attack in Jordan, would be at odds with the government's tough stance on Islamic extremism. But King Abdullah is under domestic pressure to bring home Lt Kaseasbeh, who was captured in December after his Jordanian F-16 crashed near the IS' de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria. He is the first foreign military pilot to be captured since the US and its allies began air strikes against IS more than four months ago. Jordan's participation in the air strikes is unpopular in the kingdom and the pilot is seen by some as the victim of a war they feel should not involve the country. Lt Kaseasbeh's relatives have expressed such views and accused the government of bungling efforts to win his freedom. 'They abandoned Muath, the son of the army!' chanted protesters gathered at a 'diwan', or meeting place, in Amman for tribesmen from Karak, southern Jordan. Ms Jogo has revealed that she exchanged several emails with her husband's captors and that in the past 20 hours she received one that appeared to be their final demand. She urged the Japanese and Jordanian governments to finalise a swap that would free both hostages. 'I beg the Jordanian and Japanese governments to understand that the fates of both men are in their hands,' she said. The hostage drama began last week after ISIS released a video showing Mr Goto and another Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa kneeling in orange jumpsuits beside a masked man who threatened to kill them in 72 hours unless Japan paid a £132 million ransom. That demand has since apparently shifted to one for the release of Rishawi. The militants have reportedly killed Mr Yukawa, 42, although that has not been confirmed.","Jordan 'warns it will fast-track executions in retaliation for ISIS bloodshed'

"A group of suspected extremists accused of plotting a terrorist attack on British police officers or soldiers have appeared at the Old Bailey. Tarik Hassane, Suhaib Majeed, Momen Motassim, Nyall Hamlett and Nathan Cuffy all face charges of conspiracy to murder and the preparation of a terrorist act. The men allegedly pledged their allegiance to Islamic State before buying a series of guns and carrying out surveillance on Shepherd's Bush Police Station and White City Barracks in London. Tarik Hassane (top), 21 and Suhaib Majeed (bottom) appeared via video link for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey this morning along with Momen Motassim, Nyall Hamlett and Nathan Cuffy . Prosecutors allege they saved images of Metropolitan Police officers from social media site Instagram and carried out covert meetings and discussions to forge their plot. The charges detail that the group allegedly used code words for money, mopeds and firearms and had downloaded and circulated an extremist fatwa. They are also alleged to have been in possession of extremist material, including a video of the beheading of Islamic State hostage Steven Sotloff, the US journalist. Cuffy, Majeed and Motassim all face further charges of possession of ammunition and firearms with intent to endanger lives. The weapons include a Baikal handgun, a Baikal IZH 79-8 self-loading pistol, an American double action.44 calibre gate loading revolver, a Rossi.38 special calibre revolver, a Victoria 1911.32 automatic calibre pistol and a Jieffeco 1920 6.35mm Browning calibre self-loading pistol.

"The Salvadoran fisherman who miraculously survived 13 months at sea before he was found last January is being sued by his former lawyer for $1 million, his family has revealed. A year after he came ashore on the Marshall Islands, Jose Alvarenga, 38, is also at odds with relatives of the man who died at sea with him, who do not believe his story, NBC News reported. 'Jose has no money,' his brother-in-law, Jorge Bonilla, told NBC. 'As a family, we try to help him by sending money for food and medicine.' But it's not all bad news for Alvarenga, whose family say that he is back to good health at home in El Salvador after more than a year surviving on fish, rainwater and his urine aboard a 24-foot boat. Scroll down for video . New challenges: A year after Jose Alvarenga was found following 13 months at sea, he is being sued by his former lawyer and is at odds with the family of the man who died during the voyage. He is pictured last April . He is even talking about going fishing again, Bonilla said. He is also collaborating on a book - and perhaps a documentary - but his former attorney and family friend, Benedicto Perlera, is not happy at being left out of the deal, NBC reported. The duo had a falling out and the attorney now represents the family of Ezequiel Cordoba, 24, who died of hunger and thirst weeks after he and Alvarenga were thrown off course by bad weather. Perlera said the Cordobas believe they are entitled to profits from Alvarenga's story - even though they are skeptical about his tale. He told authorities that the fish and turtles they caught to eat did not agree with Cordoba's stomach and he died. He denied eating his friend and says he threw the man's body overboard. 'They don't think their son died the way Jose says he did,' Perlera told NBC. Perlera has also filed a $1 million breach of contract suit against Alvarenga after he says the former fisherman dropped him for a U.S.-based law firm. Incredible: He is pictured, left, after he came to shore on the Marshall Islands last January. His companion, Ezequiel Cordoba, 24, (right) died four months after they became lost at sea, he said . Vessel: He drifted on his 24-foot boat for 13 months, surviving on raw fish, birds, turtles and rainwater . 'We would have been very successful together,' he said. 'Jose's story is worth a lot of money.' His new lawyer, Jeffrey Masonek, said a publisher has bought Alvarenga's story. It will be written by Guardian journalist Jonathan Franklin, who wrote '33 Men' about the Chilean miners trapped underground for 69 days in 2010, NBC reported. Alvarenga and Cordoba vanished in November 2012 after they headed out to hunt sharks in Mexico. They were hit by a storm and swept out to sea. Five days after Cordoba failed to return, his family in Chiapas reported him missing and began searching for him, his aunt Lucia Cordoba Cruz said. 'Our family looked for him in the sea, in other villages, always hoping to find him,' she said - but their search ended about three weeks later in December 2012. Astonishing feat: Thirteen months after heading out on a shark hunting trip from Mexico, he came ashore on the Marshall Islands, which are about 5,500 miles from where he set off . Back home: He is pictured arriving back home with relatives after being found in January 2014 . Thirteen months later, on January 30, 2014, a bearded and bedraggled Alvarenga was rescued and told an astonishing tale of how he survived by eating raw fish, turtles and birds. 'I always had faith that I was going to survive, asking (God) every day and every night,' he told the media after he landed back home. 'I never lost faith that one day I would be found.' There was skepticism about his story after doctors deemed Alvarenga to be in strikingly good health, although he was mentally frail, dehydrated and limping. But he stood by his story and survival experts and oceanographers said it was possible. Months after setting foot on land again, he passed a lie detector test. 'I think he is doing fine,' his new attorney told NBC. 'He's very, very grateful to be alive.'","Jose Alvarenga, 38, reached the Marshall Islands on January 30 last year, 13 months after he was caught up in a storm as he hunted for sharks .

"A producer for a conservative radio show in Florida has been arrested in the studio for allegedly having more than 500 'extremely disturbing' child porn images on his computer, police said. Chand Worob, 25, had hundreds of sick images of boys and girls - some as young as five - on his home computer and also distributed them, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. The executive producer was arrested at the WNDB-AM 1150 studio in Daytona Beach after 'The Marc Bernier Show' wrapped up at 6pm on Thursday, the Daytona Beach News Journal reported. 'He knew why we were there,' Chitwood said. 'This is the guy that runs the entire show.' Scroll down for video . Arrested: Chand Worob, 25, has been arrested for allegedly possessing and distributing child porn. He is the executive producer for a daytime talk radio show in Daytona Beach, Florida, right . The producer told officers that he needed to call his girlfriend. Footage of his arrest shared with WFTV shows him being hauled out of a police car and taken to the station on Thursday night. In the video, he is apparently wearing a wedding band. The chief said that the host of the show, Marc Bernier, and other employees at WNDB did not know about Worob's actions. Worob had unknowingly distributed explicit images to a officers during an investigation by a statewide task force called Internet Crimes Against Children. On Tuesday, police obtained a warrant, entered his apartment and confiscated his computer, cellphone and iPad, Chitwood told the News Journal. But when questioned, Worob said he sometimes looked at adult porn, but never child porn. He said if he had come across child porn, he would've deleted it. See more at WESH . Caught: He was arrested at the radio station but didn't seem surprised to see police there, they said. He is pictured being led to the Daytona Beach Police Department following his arrest on Thursday evening . 'I may have seen some images like that a few times, but it would've been an accident,' he told the detectives. 'I don't even like young girls. I am into older women.' When authorities showed him eight files he shared with law enforcement of nude girls between the ages of six and 12, he said they looked like images he had deleted. But authorities found he had as many as 505 files of child pornography in several locations on the hard drive of his computer. Some of the files had names for the underage children, including 'Lolita,' 'Preteen,' and 'Baby J', detectives said. 'Some of them [were] extremely graphic, picturing children as young as five and six years old,' Chitwood told WESH. 'As a matter of fact, graphic is probably a bad term. Disgusting is the best way to describe it. You got to be a real scumbag because you're victimizing children.'

"Aesian Anunique Clay, 20, from St Louis City, Missouri allegedly told her one-year-old daughter to 'say your last goodbye to your daddy' A woman allegedly told her one-year-old daughter to 'say your last goodbye to your daddy because he is going to die today' after a dispute with the child's father. Aesian Anunique Clay, 20, from St Louis City, Missouri was at the girl's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese when she was heard on the phone telling her new boyfriend to 'bring his guns' following an argument, according to a witness. After her boyfriend arrived with two accomplices, a scuffle ensued and the baby's grandfather, in his mid 40s, was shot several times in his lower body and taken to hospital in serious condition, said police. He is expected to make a full recovery. Clay was charged with attempted first degree assault for her alleged involvement and is being held on a $50,000 cash-only bond. Several people, along with the suspect, are being sought in relation to the shooting. The incident occurred on Wednesday evening after Clay became angry with the girl's father because he did not take their daughter on a scheduled visitation day, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Court documents revealed that as the argument continued, Clay told him that she was going to call her boyfriend and that he 'better be strapped' before her boyfriend's arrival. Clay's boyfriend went to the Chuck E Cheese with a man and a woman before a shooting took place in the restaurant. The grandfather was the only person injured. She told police that she had called her boyfriend but would not identify him. Police arrived at the scene at 8.24pm. There were around 40 people  in the restaurant at the time. A restaurant worker said several men were fighting and the gunmen pointed a gun at her manager before standing on a booth and opening fire on the victim. The workers and customers took cover in a locked storage area, according to the St Louis Post Dispatch. Once authorities issued a search warrant for Clay's phone, police found pictures of her and her boyfriend holding a handgun with an extended capacity magazine, but police are unsure if it is the same gun used in the incident. She was heard on the phone telling her new boyfriend to bring his guns to her daughter's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese following an argument with the child's father, said witnesses .","Aesian Anunique Clay, 20, from St Louis City, Missouri had a dispute with her daughter's father during a birthday party .

"They live in the Habala Mountains that straddle Saudi Arabia's southern border with Yemen but take orders from neither government, instead living their lives under the dictates of tribal law. Meet the 'flower men', a tribe of people descended from the ancient Tihama and Asir groupings and whose traditions, most strikingly the garlands of herbs and blooms they wear, date back more than two millennia. But as photographer Eric Lafforgue discovered, they are the source of much unrest in the region, conducting cross-border battles and reacting violently should any outsider stumble into their turf - including to Lafforgue himself. Scroll down for video . Ancient traditions: The flower men of the Habala Mountains are part of a tribal group that has lived in the area for more than 2,000 years . Elaborate: The men wear ornate garlands made from herbs and flowers growing wild in the foothills of the mountains . Beautiful: As well as making the men look and smell nicer, some of the garlands have a medicinal purpose and are used to cure headaches . 'In the past, it was totally forbidden for foreigners to enter the area and the villages,' explains Lafforgue, adding: 'Some hill villages were only reachable with a rope anyway.' That remained the case until the early 1990s when the Saudi Arabian government, keen to boost tourism in the region, built cable cars to the villages and hotels for tourists to stay in. But with many of the flower men forced out of their homes by the development, clashes soon erupted and the area remains volatile - not least because of the turmoil in neighbouring Yemen. 'I had planned to be in the area for a few days but quickly realised it would be very difficult,' Lafforgue revealed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline Travel. 'I had to stop and get a local escort of policemen before I could go into the area. 'The policemen told me some of the local people really hate foreigners, while even Saudi people aren't welcome in some villages.' As a result, when Lafforgue arrived in the village of Rijal Alma, the locals' initial response was to hide. 'There were a few old women about who hid from me as soon as I tried to approach them.' Restorative: Garlands made exclusively for medicinal purposes, such as the one this man is wearing, are less pretty and stuffed with herbs . Intricate: This garland is made from woven marigold heads, although most are made using fragrant wild jasmine and basil . Sweet-smelling: Although cooler than the desert that dominates the rest of Saudi, the mountains are hot and the herbs ward off bad smells . Excitement: The men rarely see outsiders and locals reacted excitedly when Lafforgue first arrived, with this man calling his friends to tell them . Striking: The men, who all live in a small village called Asir, were initially happy to tell Lafforgue about their garlands and pose for photos . Labour: They explained that they go into the foothills of the Habala Mountains every morning in search of fresh herbs for their garlands . Looking good: They told Lafforgue that they all compete with each other to make the most beautiful garlands they can . 'When I arrived in the village, it was market day and a few old women were there. They hid themselves from me as soon as I tried to come towards them.' The men, however, proved more amenable with Lafforgue able to photograph a group of flower-decked men who screeched up in the back of a battered old Toyota. He was fascinated by their garlands, most of which were made using wild basil and jasmine picked in the foothills of the Habala Mountains. 'They do it every day,' he explains. 'They all want to look better than their neighbours.' Not every garland is worn for its beauty, however. 'They use similar herbs as a cure for headaches,' he explains. 'But those garlands aren't so beautiful to look at. They even put herbs up their noses when they have a cold, which doesn't look so romantic.' But their beautiful garlands conceal a penchant for violence, which Lafforgue became all too aware of when he attempted to step into a local restaurant for lunch. Recovering: Not all were for beauty. This man is wearing herbs in the hopes of dealing with a headache. He would use the same for colds . Decisions: Not all of the men wear flower garlands, however. Some, such as the man on the right, choose simple scarves instead . Proud: Despite their colourful garlands, the tribe are proudly independent and have fought for centuries to keep control of their land . Conflict: Many, such as this boy, can expect a future that sees them battle with encroaching tribes coming across the Yemen border . Suspicious: As a result of that and bungled government intervention. the men are enormously suspicious of outsiders . Armed: All carry a ceremonial knife and as Lafforgue discovered during his visit, they are not afraid to use them . In charge: The villages are led by headsmen, usually elderly men such as this man. He has dyed his beard red to show devotion to Islam . Inside, he was threatened with knives by the flower men. 'Those guys are serious,' he remembers. 'The policemen kept telling me that they don't play games and they were right. 'For the first time in my life, I saw policemen with guns terrified of men with knifes.' And they had good reason. According to Thierry Mauger, a French anthropologist who visited the tribe in the 1990s, the flower men even attempted to rape him. Luckily for Lafforgue, the men soon calmed down and he and his increasingly nervous police escort decided to leave. 'The police got nervous after an hour,' he explains.  'Nobody had stayed so long they asked me to leave. I know I was lucky to meet them.' And despite his hair-raising experience, Lafforgue has some sympathy for the men who attacked him. 'It is all down to a lack of contact with foreigners,' he says. 'They have also fought for centuries with other tribes who want to take their land. 'Their villages look like fortified castles with huge towers and walls, and they surround them with rocks for an extra line of defence. You can see that they have had to fight hard to keep their land.' Unchanged: The tribe live in much the same way as their ancestors did. They have lived in the Habala Mountains for more than 2,000 years . Colourful: The streets of Rijal Alma, a village visited by Lafforgue, were decorated with bright graphic patterns in red, blue and green . Detailed: The houses in Rijal Alma were decorated with elaborate chequered patterns while nearly all had balconies (right) Fortress: The people of Rijal Alma have been forced to fight for their land and as a result, many of the homes look more like fortified castles . Protected: Women are kept out of sight inside the houses. During his visit, Lafforgue was only allowed to meet the men . Volatile: As their tower-like homes suggest, the men remain on guard and, at one point, threatened Lafforgue with their knives . Remote: The stunning view of the Habala Mountains taken from Rijal Alma reveals just how remote the flower men's home is .","The tribe live in the foothills of the Habala Mountains in Saudi Arabia's southern Asir province .

"Whether you're using a state-of-the-art SLR camera or toting along your trusty smartphone, a holiday simply isn't a holiday if you're not snapping loads of photos along the way. However, each tool requires different techniques to truly get the most out of your photographs - especially if you're looking to rack up those Instagram likes online. Experts recommend incorporating a human element into landscapes - such as a person or their property - in order to truly illustrate the grandeur of the landmark or wilderness around you. When shooting portraits, keep your subjects at eye level, or elevate them, to ensure the most flattering angle. Time of day will also impact the quality of your snap. Dave Bouskill, founder and photographer of adventure travel blog, The Planet D, recommends shooting early in the morning or late at night.  When the sun is setting, there will be softer light and longer shadows. Plus, if you're shooting at less desirable visiting times, you'll likely be the only one there. And while taking photographs on the beach can often pose problems when it comes to harsh bright light, using the flash is actually recommended - it will help to eliminate any dark shadows cast by hats or sunglasses.

"A mother-of-two fed up of waiting for late buses  invoiced the company £103 for her wasted time and was given £70 back in free day passes. Elizabeth Thomas, 44, said she wasted 11.24 hours waiting for the delayed service to and from her office job in Clifton, Bristol, and was less able to spend time with her children. The single mother from Stoke Gifford complained to First Buses about their late running service on 30 occasions within the past three years, but said she received no response. So she produced an invoice for her time which she worked out was worth £9.19 per hour – resulting in a cost of £103.30 - and handed a bill to bosses at a public meeting. Elizabeth Thomas, 44, invoiced First Buses £103 for her wasted time and was given £70 back in free day passes . 'I don't mind waiting for buses. If I arrive a couple of minutes early at the stop, or if I have to wait between changes, I don't mind that,' she said. 'But it's when they are late or don't show up with absolutely no explanation. 'I've had to start leaving an hour earlier just to be sure I get to work on time, and by the time I get home I'm looking at a 12-hour day most days. 'That's time I should be spending with my children. Is my time not valuable to First? 'It is time I am never going to get back and I believe my time is valuable.' First West of England agreed the company was at fault on six of the 30 occasions and decided to reimburse her with 10 day travel passes worth £7 each. Ms Thomas, whose children are aged 14 and 17, uses two buses each way to make the daily eight mile journey to her office in Clifton and back. First West of England agreed the company was at fault on six of the 30 occasions and decided to reimburse her with 10 day travel passes worth £7 each (stock picture) She uses her Twitter account to document any late or no-show services and decided to go back through it and tot up the total amount of hours wasted waiting. The mother-of-two calculated that since summer 2012 she had wasted 11.24 hours waiting for buses. A spokesperson for First West of England said: 'In line with the terms of our customer promise we have sent Ms Thomas a number of free day tickets for her to use at her leisure. 'These take into account the fact that on some of the occasions she noted the buses she tried to catch did not run as scheduled. 'We're really sorry that she has encountered problems using our services. 'While we will -to some extent - always be hampered by things beyond our control, such as roadworks, incidents and accidents on the highway, we are committed to improving the punctuality and reliability of services, and ensuring that those things within our control run as they should.' Mrs Thomas leaves her home at 6.55am and attempts to get the number 75 or the X75 bus from Bristol Parkway station at 7.12am. She then changes bus at Rupert Street bus stop, in Bristol City Centre, at around 7.30am before getting on a new bus five minutes later. The final bus, which could be any number of buses, drops her off at Whiteladies Road, Clifton, where she works as an operational manager.

"Seventy-five years ago, the government cut 65-year-old Ida May Fuller a check. It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout. Fuller, of Ludlow, Vermont, didn't realize it at the time, but her check helped launch the granddaddy of all entitlement programs. She had only paid three years' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100, she collected $22,888.92 from Social Security monthly benefits. Scroll down for video . Flashback: Seventy-five years ago, the government cut Ida May Fuller, 65, a check. It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout - here she is pictured in 1950 holding a Social Security check for $41.30 . Fuller, who never married and had no children, said that the returns took her by surprise. 'It wasn't that I expected anything . . . but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security,' she's quoted as saying. Fuller went on to secure a place in American history as the first  to receive a monthly benefit Social Security check. She received the check, amounting to $22.54, on January 31, 1940. Today, even as its future lies in financial uncertainty, many consider Social Security one of government's biggest successes. But in its infancy it was hardly a sure thing, and not well understood by many, including Fuller. Fuller was born on a farm two miles outside Ludlow, then a mill town and now a ski town, in the heart of the Green Mountains. Future President Calvin Coolidge was three years ahead of her at the Black River Academy, now a museum. You've got mail: Fuller had only paid three years' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100, she collected $22,888.92 from Social Security monthly benefits (above, in 1966) A monthly check for you: A government poster urging people to apply for their social security account numbers, which features a hand holding a check in front of the Capitol Building . Later, she worked as a secretary for the Vermont law firm of a Ludlow lawyer who had been Coolidge's attorney general. In early November 1939, she passed by the government office in the larger city of Rutland and decided to pop in to ask about Social Security. While there she was urged to apply for benefits, not realizing she'd get the first check. That January  check was for $22.54, a little less than the $25.75 that the agency had been deducting from her paycheck in the previous three years. Near the end of her life, when she was living with a niece, she told a reporter that the payments 'come pretty near paying for my expenses.' And that was the idea. 'It is hard for us to imagine what life was like for seniors and the disabled before Social Security,' said Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, a vocal supporter of the system. New age: Social Security has undergone significant changes since Fuller received her first check, including the addition of disability benefits in 1956 . On the 10th anniversary in 1950, there was six-minute movie made by the Social Security Administration. A 1955 article called Fuller, known around Ludlow as 'Aunt Ida,' 'a kindly, likable, practical and placid woman whose ability to derive deep satisfaction from simple, wholesome living has eased her through life.' In 1960, she received greetings from across the country. She became the subject of more media attention on her 100th birthday shortly before her death. These days, Vermont has a reputation for liberalism, with some likening its generous social safety net to socialism. But back then, it had a reputation as a staunch anti-New Deal state in addition to being the home of Coolidge, a Republican and proponent of small government. In 1936, voters in Vermont and Maine were the ones who didn't support President Franklin Roosevelt for a second term. But a progressive wing of the Vermont Republican Party was beginning to emerge. Mammoth task: Clerical workers sorting Social Security cards in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1936 . Big move: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs the Social Security Bill on August 4 1935 in Washington, DC . Fuller, a staunch Republican, did not support Roosevelt. In 1970, she told The Associated Press that she didn't think there should be any more increases in Social Security payments. 'It's been raised as far as it ought to go,' she said. 'Every time they raise it, they raise the amount taken away from the working people who pay into it, and it's just getting to be too much of a burden.' The Social Security Administration, first led by former New Hampshire Gov. John Winant, insists it was just coincidence that the first check went to a Vermont resident. Social Security has undergone significant changes since Fuller received her first check, including the addition of disability benefits in 1956. Today, 59 million retired workers, spouses, disabled workers and survivors get monthly payments averaging $1,194. The latest overhaul came in 1983, when Social Security was on the brink of insolvency. Congress increased payroll taxes, cut benefits and gradually extended the age when retirees can claim full benefits. The changes shored up Social Security's finances so it could absorb the initial wave of retiring baby boomers. Today, Social Security's trust funds hold more than $2.7 trillion in special Treasury bonds. But unless Congress acts, Social Security's disability fund will run dry in 2016 and the retirement fund will be depleted in 2034, according to projections by the trustees who oversee the programs.","Fuller died in 1975 at age 100, she never married and had no children .

"The wife of hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin is demanding $300,000 a month to pay for around-the-clock access to a private jet, according to a recent court filing in their contentious divorce. Even though Griffin says he has already given his wife Anne Dias $35 million as outlined in their pre-nup, she is demanding $1 million a month for 'child-related expenses', he claims. He outlined her most recent alleged demands in a brief filed in court in Cook County, Illinois on Thursday as he seeks a definite trial date to resolve the divorce, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. As part of the extra $1 million a month, the mother of three is demanding $160,000 a month for vacation rentals, and $60,000 for an office space and staff for the children, according to his filing. Scroll down for video . Messy: Kenneth Griffin (right), who filed for divorce from wife Anne Dias (right) in July, claims she is fighting for $1 million a month for childcare expenses, including a private jet and professional staff . He said she is demanding such high figures because she realizes 'that she might have to start spending some of her own substantial wealth to support herself in the opulent lifestyle she desires'. Dias has already accrued $35 million from the divorce and has a reported net worth of $50 million, according to the Chicago Tribune. But a spokesperson for Diaz insisted that the filing was 'riddled with falsehoods'. It is 'just another vindictive attempt by Ken Griffin - Illinois' richest billionaire - to punish his family and avoid his clear responsibility under Illinois law to maintain his children's lifestyle,' they said. The spokesperson added that the children are being 'penalized' by failing to receive what is theirs. In the pre-nup, Griffin, the CEO of $20 billion Chicago-based investment giant Citadel LLC, agreed to pay his wife $25 million plus $1 million for each year they were married, leaving her with $35 million. Dias Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003. She has argued that the settlement leaves her with no real estate titles or any of the couple's costly possessions, including an extensive art collection. Honeymoon is over: The couple married at Versailles (above) with a performance by Donna Summer . Last year, Griffin hired a lawyer to represent his three children, aged two, four and six, in the settlement. He is trying to ensure his family remain in Chicago, while his wife, who is seeking full-time custody, intends to move to New York. In earlier court papers, Dias claimed she has been banned from the marital residences in New York City, Aspen and Miami, and that she will not longer have control over the Chicago home she was promised half of in their prenup. Among the real estate holdings Dias does not have any claim to, according to the prenup, are a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, four Palm Beach properties worth $130 million, and a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17 million. Furthermore, she says he husband will commit to no financial support 'on paper' but will give her money 'off paper' as long as she is a 'good girl'. Dias claimed that she has been shouldering all the expenses for the couple's three children. 'Kenneth should be required to pay monthly child support to cover all of the children's expenses, fixed overhead expenses for the household, as well as child care, security, household and administrative staff, who should be reporting to Anne and under her control, not Kenneth's,' Dias Griffin said in her filing. Luxe living:  Mr. Griffin has been living in a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago . A rep for Griffin said the money man 'focused on the well-being of his children, and that has guided his every decision.' They then added: 'He has willingly paid all reasonable, and frankly, many unreasonable expenses throughout the separation, including millions in cash to Anne and a $10 million gift to Harvard in Anne's name. But when Anne takes things to a ridiculous level of extravagance and demands things like a $450,000 vacation to St. Bart's, enough is enough.' Griffin's worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion. He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990. Mrs. Dias-Griffin was a prominent name in the financial world herself, starting Aragon Global Management, LLC in 2001, but she left in 2009 to focus on her family. Their wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and  Donna Summer. The couple separated in February 2012 and Griffin filed for divorce in July 2014 while his wife was on vacation in London with the children.","Kenneth Griffin, 45, CEO of $20 billion Chicago investment firm Citadel LLC, filed for divorce from his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias, last year .

"Ed Miliband last night received a £1.5 million donation from left-wing firebrand Len McCluskey’s trade union Unite. The union said it gave the cash to Labour’s general election campaign fund because of fears the Conservatives could be elected in May on a ‘tide of big business cash’. The Tories said the donation would ‘not come for free’, highlighting a series of policy demands made by Unite. All smiles: The donation came as Ed Miliband, pictured with Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy yesterday, spoke approvingly of ‘redistribution’ of money from the better-off to the poor . Proposals approved at its most recent conference included a 400 per cent increase in the dole, the reversal of all spending cuts and the repeal of Margaret Thatcher’s anti-strike laws. The Unite cash boost for Labour came as Mr Miliband spoke approvingly of ‘redistribution’ of money from the better-off to the poor and refused to rule out a coalition deal with the resurgent Scottish Nationalists. On a campaign visit to Scotland, he backed Labour Scottish leader Jim Murphy’s suggestion that a new ‘mansion tax’, largely raised from homeowners in the South East, should fund 1,000 new nurses north of the border. Former Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott has accused him of trying to ‘buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London’. But Mr Miliband said: ‘On the issue of the mansion tax… some of the powerful, the super-rich and the famous are going to protest louder and louder about paying a little more. Firebrand: Len McCluskey is the leader of the Unite union - and a powerful force over the Labour party . 'When homes costing hundreds of millions of pounds pay the same in property tax as homes a fraction of that value, the case for the mansion tax to fund the NHS is getting stronger and stronger by the day. ‘What is the principle at stake here? The principle at stake in this argument about the mansion tax is actually the principle of redistribution and equality.’ Mr Miliband insisted his party can still win a UK-wide majority, and hold all its Scottish seats – despite polls suggesting dozens of Labour MPs will fall victim to an SNP surge. But just days after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls ruled out a post-election deal with the SNP should Labour fall short of a majority, Mr Miliband left the door open. Political football: Alex Salmond has not ruled out a deal to rule with Labour if there is a hung parliament . He would say only: ‘I have one focus, which is a majority Labour government.’ Challenged that he was not ruling out a deal, Mr Miliband replied: ‘I couldn’t be clearer. Jim [Murphy] said we “don’t need, we don’t want and we’re not planning that” and that’s my position too.’ Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who is attempting to return to the Commons in May, suggested last night he was angling for a coalition – and claimed he is more popular in England than either David Cameron or Mr Miliband. ‘There’s every chance of the SNP becoming the third biggest party in the UK in May,’ he told the Buzzfeed website. ‘The political stars are aligning for a balanced parliament. Neither Cameron nor Miliband are capable of or deserve a majority, and that leaves space for a hugely substantial SNP influence. ‘The problem for the Tories, and Labour for that matter, is that I’m certainly more popular than David Cameron and Ed Miliband in England. Definitely less unpopular, anyway – let’s put it that way.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg warned of the dangers of a post-election coalition involving the SNP or Ukip, suggesting it would make the ‘fiercest critics of this coalition slightly more benevolent about it’. The Tories said that almost 70 per cent of donations to Labour under Mr Miliband had come from the trade unions. Between 2010 and the third quarter of last year, they said Labour had received £35.4 million from the trade unions, out of £51.3 million total donations. Unite has donated £12.8 million to Labour – a quarter of all donations received since Mr Miliband became leader in September 2010. Conservative Party vice-chairman Bob Neill said: ‘This huge latest donation from Unite doesn’t come for free. We all know Len McCluskey and Unite buy Labour’s policies, choose Labour’s leader and pick Labour’s candidates. ‘Just three months away from the most important general election of our generation, the choice couldn’t be clearer: between a competent Conservative government that stands up for hard-working British taxpayers and an incompetent Labour party under Ed Miliband who’s too weak to stand up to his trade union paymasters.’ Labour fury at 'Sinn Fein link' Labour has reacted with fury to claims the party approached Sinn Fein over propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street. It followed allegations that senior figures were ‘badgering’ the Irish MPs about voting with Labour in the event it lacked the seats to form a government. The Tories issued a poster showing Mr Miliband on the steps of No 10 Downing Street, with his arm around Alex Salmond, alongside Gerry Adams, prompting a senior Labour frontbencher to accuse the Tories of fighting the election campaign ‘in the gutter’. Anger: Labour has reacted with fury to this 'pro Sinn Fein' poster produced by the Conservative party . Ivan Lewis, the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said: ‘Sinn Fein have said that this story is “pure fiction”, and that no discussions have taken place. ‘Labour’s record as an honest broker in Northern Ireland speaks for itself. ‘The Tories clearly intend to fight this election in the gutter.’ Yesterday there were claims – confirmed by Sinn Fein – that a Tory MP had also approached the party to find out if their MPs might take their seats in the event of a hung Parliament. A senior Labour source denied the party was ‘cosying up’ to Sinn Fein, but refused to rule out a coalition, saying only: ‘We are working towards a majority Labour government.’ A senior Tory source said there was ‘zero prospect’ of a Tory deal with Sinn Fein. One of the key opinion formers during the election campaign will be the BBC. The corporation – accused by the Tories of having a left-wing bias – is bound by its charter to be politically even-handed. The Mail will monitor the service to see if it lives up to its obligations. Under the headline, ‘Care spending cut by fifth in 10 years’, the story led the BBC website and featured heavily on radio and TV news bulletins on Wednesday. It implied that the amount of public money spent on elderly care had been slashed by an alarming 20 per cent in the past decade. But it hasn’t. In cash terms, spending on home and residential care between 2003/04 and 2013/14 actually increased by 20 per cent, from £7.37 billion to £8.84 billion. Even adjusted for inflation it went down by only 6 per cent – regrettable, of course, but hardly a catastrophic fall in a time of austerity. To get to their dramatic 20 per cent cut, the BBC arbitrarily divided the spending totals for 2003/04 and 2013/14 by the number of over-65s in the population for each of those years, to get a per capita spending figure. As the population has risen sharply in the past decade – and with it the number of over-65s – spending per capita was bound to fall between 2004 and 2014. But this per capita figure takes no account of changing care needs and costs, whether the over-65s have become fitter in the past ten years, whether more choose or are able to live at home – with or without social services help – than go into a nursing home, or whether more are being taken in by their families. So is it a realistic calculation, or an interpretation of the statistics most likely to embarrass the Coalition? The BBC replied: ‘We worked with an ONS statistician who was on secondment to the BBC on this analysis, the Health and Social Care Information Centre provided the spending figures and we ran the findings past the Department of Health. No one raised any issues with our approach and we set out clearly in all our coverage what we did and why.’","Firebrand Len McCluskey’s trade union Unite donated cash to Labour .

"Today, she will travel to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to present 10 Squadron with their new standard. Next week, Princess Anne will travel the length and breadth of the UK, starting the week with a livestock sale in Perth and ending it with three engagements in Portsmouth. Yet despite the hours she puts in, the plain-speaking princess gets very little thanks and even less media coverage, all of which begs the question: Why does she do it? Scroll down for video . Hard-working: Princess Anne is the unsung hero of the royal family and carries out a huge number of visits . According to Nikki Jeffries, managing editor at Royalista.com, the answer is a sense of duty - something she has inherited from her hard-working parents. 'The apple never falls far from the tree and Princess Anne has had two very good royal role models in her parents,' she explains. 'None of them has ever craved the limelight, even though they all understand the importance of using their public profile to highlight the causes they support.' In this, plain-speaking Anne has few equals and makes regular, if rare, contributions to public debate, most controversially on the subject of horses. Speaking at the annual conference of World Horse Welfare, of which the 64-year-old is president, she caused outrage when she suggested that 'attitudes towards the horse meat trade may need to change'. Noting that horse neglect is almost unheard of in Poland where horse meat is legal, she added: . Close: Princess Anne is famously close to her parents and insiders say she gets her work ethic from them . Still working: The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured here at the 2012 Olympics, is still working at 93 . 'If that is true then, and they value their horses and they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade, should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases? 'I just chuck that out there for what it's worth because it needs a debate. We have to understand if value has a part to play in how we reduce welfare cases … . 'If it [the horse] has real financial value then you look a little bit further ahead in the way you look after your animals.' Such a practical approach is typical of the Princess Royal, who has a country-woman's clear-eyed view of livestock, all while owning a much-loved herd of horses - among them a former abuse case that she re-homed. The same approach can be seen in her philanthropic work of which she does a considerable amount, albeit mostly unrecorded. 'The power of the Princess Royal’s support is that she genuinely understands the issues we aim to address,' says Gareth Simpson of Opportunity International, an organisation that aims to provide finance to would-be entrepreneurs in some of the world's poorest countries. Close: As well as being close to the Queen, Princess Anne is also popular with her three brothers . Duty: According to royal insiders, Anne, pictured as a baby, takes inspiration from her parents . 'Her knowledge of the difficulties facing men and women living in poverty is impressive and brings real gravitas to our charity. 'She is an important ambassador for our work and supports both what we do and how we do it. It is not  a superficial relationship in any way.' That she puts so much effort into each charity she supports is all the more impressive given that her current list of philanthropic patronages totals 332. These range from the Scottish Fat Stock Society to Acid Survivors International and the Bothwell Parish Church Appeal. Many require travel; the most recent being a flying visit to Ethiopia and Tanzania where she toured projects run by Save the Children, another charity of which Anne is president. 'She has huge knowledge of our history and work, going back to our founder Eglantyne Jebb,' says CEO Justin Forsyth, who has worked with the Princess Royal for many years. 'Over the years she has visited our programmes in some of the remotest and toughest parts of the world from Ethiopia to Mozambique as well as inspiring our volunteers and supporters here at home. 'She passionately believes that all children should have a chance to fulfil their potential and that the cornerstone of the work of Save the Children is our local staff.' Interests: She has a huge range of interests and works with Save the Children among others . Busy: Next week Anne, pictured arriving at the South African embassy last year, will criss-cross the UK . Work: Last week saw her count the IFR International Awards Gala among her many visits . Involved: Nevertheless, those who work with her such as the Carers Trust, say she is very involved . Anne spent much of her Ethiopian tour meeting locals, according to Forsyth, who says her down-to-earth approach never fails to impress. 'Her willingness to roll up her sleeves means she gets a front line view of the challenges children face,' he adds. 'I remember accompanying her on a visit to a slum in Sierra Leone when she decided to jump across open sewers to get to a health clinic and meet our midwives and nurses. 'She also has a special way of not patronising children, asking them serious questions and getting serious answers.' The same easygoing attitude is also characteristic of her many UK visits. 'She has a great sense of humour,' says Caroline Cochrane of The Carers Trust. 'She always puts the carers she meets at their ease and is genuinely interested in their stories and how we can continue to improve support for them.' Amusing: Anne also has a sense of humour, as Prince Harry's reaction (left) proves, and she is close to Zara . All together: Along with Zara, Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn also live on Anne's Gatcombe Estate . Hands-on: Anne is an involved grandmother and has been pictured with one-year-old Mia several times . Loved: Anne is now grandmother to three granddaughters, Savannah (pictured, now four), Isla and Mia . Cochrane, who has worked with the Princess Royal for more than 20 years, says Anne doesn't get the recognition she deserves. 'Her charity work is well known within our field but outside, while people think that Her Royal Highness is hard working royal, they are probably not aware of just how involved she is.' Simpson, however, suspects that what Anne really wants is to get on with her work with as little fuss as possible. 'My personal perspective is that rather than seeking coverage for her work, she enjoys really exploring the issues that the charity is dealing with,' he explains. 'She does not seek personal publicity,' adds Cochrane. 'She should be allowed to also have a life with her family away from the media.' Both of her children, Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips, with whom she shares a passion for all things equine, live on her Gatcombe Estate in Gloucestershire. She is also thought to be a hands-on grandmother to her three granddaughters, Isla, Savannah and Mia, and has been pictured looking after her youngest granddaughter while Zara pursues her own career in eventing. Easygoing: Princess Anne meeting locals in Ghana with Opportunity International . Clever: Anne visits an Opportunity International project involving mushroom farming in Ghana . Supportive: Princess Anne meets a group of full-time carers at a Carers Trust tea party . Nevertheless, her work often takes her away from them for long periods, with Anne criss-crossing the country like a campaigning politician. In the first week of February alone, she will spend two days in Scotland, two in London and one in Hampshire, before visiting various parts of Wales and Leicestershire the following week. Along with spending three days in London, the second week of February will also take her back to Scotland where she will watch a rugby match as part of her role as patron of Rugby Scotland. To those who know her, this seemingly inexhaustible ability to keep on working come what may and regardless of personal inclination is no surprise. 'Anne is the rock of the royal family,' adds Jeffries. 'She's got her feet firmly on the ground, she cherishes tradition and champions solid family values. 'She is never going to be thought of as the most popular but she is the one most people would say is doing a good job. And in my opinion, she is.'","Princess Anne is patron of 332 charities and does up to 20 visits a week .

"A massive outbreak of measles last year was triggered by an Amish missionary coming back from the Philippines, it has been reported. Experts say there were 644 cases of the highly contagious disease across America in 2014 – the highest number in 20 years – with 382 people falling ill in Ohio's Amish country. It has emerged that a volunteer brought the virus back after working in the Philippines – a country that was already dealing with a major measles outbreak. A massive outbreak of measles last year was triggered by an Amish missionary coming back from the Philippines (file picture) 'Patient zero' fell ill on his return to the community and was misdiagnosed with Dengue fever before passing the highly infectious disease on to his friends, according to Vox.com. Jacqueline Fletcher, the public health nursing director for Ohio's Knox County, has described how she was told of a case of the virus in April last year. She immediately feared a 'perfect storm' since many in the Amish community had rejected the vaccine MMR - which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella - amid fears over potential adverse effects. At one point she described a household where six teenage children with measles were sitting in the dark. Experts say there were 644 cases of the highly contagious virus across the U.S. in 2014 – the highest number in 20 years – with 382 people falling ill in Ohio's Amish country (file picture) 'They were covered in the spotty rash that's characteristic of the virus, miserable, and sick. It was a scene from the last century,' she said, according to Vox. The outbreak ended in August last year and although nobody died, nine ended up in hospital with serious cases. Measles is uncommon in many countries because of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination . Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. It is uncommon in many countries because of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination. Early symptoms of measles can be seen at about 10 days after you are infected and include a red-brown spotty rash. This will usually start behind the ears and then spread around the head and neck before moving to the rest of the body, according to nhs.uk. The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children. There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications. According to the World Health Organization, the disease remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. Approximately 145,700 people died from measles in 2013 – mostly children under the age of 5, WHO says. Researchers then launched a study to determine what had caused the sharp increase in cases in the U.S. last year and turned their attention on Americans travelling abroad and returned with the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that of the 288 cases in the first half of 2014, 97 per cent were linked to importations from at least 18 studies. Many of the cases were association with people returning from the Philippines. 'Patient zero' fell ill on his return to the community and was misdiagnosed with Dengue fever before passing the highly infectious disease on to his friends (file picture) Measles, considered one of the world's most contagious viruses, brings on fevers and rashes that can last weeks – but in most cases is not deadly. According to the World Health Organization, the most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Around the world, it is still one of the leading causes of death among young children. More than 90 people have been diagnosed with measles across the U.S. after an infected person visited Disneyland in California . More than 90 people have been diagnosed with measles across the U.S. after an infected person visited Disneyland in California. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged Americans to get vaccinated amid an outbreak that began when the individual visited the theme park in December. On Wednesday, a high school in Palm Desert, California barred dozens of non-vaccinated students from attending school over concerns that a classmate may have contracted the highly contagious disease. Measles was all but eliminated in the United States in 2000 but Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it could still easily be brought in by a traveler from abroad. 'This is a wake-up call to make sure we keep measles from getting a foothold in our country,' she said. Health officials in California say the virus has been reported in eight states and 67 cases can be clearly linked to Disneyland, according to NBCnews. The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. Dr Schuchat called it 'frustrating' that some Americans had opted out of the vaccine for non-medical reasons, saying it was crucial that they be given good information about the safety and reliability of inoculations. Asked if health officials were worried about the possibility that the outbreak could be further spread at the Super Bowl in Phoenix, she said only that people everywhere should be on their guard but declined to label the football game on Sunday as an area of special concern. 'I wouldn't expect the Super Bowl to be a place where many unvaccinated people will be congregating,' she said.

"The adage 'time is money' has proven true for one Canadian man who has spent the last seven years and $100,000 fighting for, what he believes is, his rightful half of a $21.4 million lottery prize. Joel Ifergan's seven-year battle against Loto-Quebec came to a disappointing end Thursday when the country's highest court ruled it wouldn't hear his case, according to The Globe and Mail. Ifergan, of Montreal, has been fighting for half of the May 23, 2008 Super 7 jackpot fortune after a computer delay caused his ticket to print seven seconds after the cutoff time. Fought: Joel Ifergan has fought for the past seven years for half of a $21.4 million (27 million Canadian dollars) lottery jackpot after a seven-second print delay cost him the fortune . Ticket: Ifergan picked the winning numbers. But Loto-Quebec rejected his ticket because it had the following week's draw date printed on the top as a result of the seven-second print delay . Ifergan picked the winning numbers for the jackpot of $21.4 million (27 million Canadian dollars). But Loto-Quebec rejected his ticket because it had the following week's draw date printed on the top as a result of the seven-second print delay, according to the Toronto Sun. Ifergan sued the province's lottery regulator blaming the delay -- and the $21.4 million loss -- on the company's central computer system, according to ITV news. 'The deadline that they advertise was for 9 p.m. –- which I did,' Ifergan told  CTV. Ifergan said the seven-year battle has cost him more than $100,000 in legal fees. On that fateful May night, Ifergan made a last-minute decision to purchase two Super 7 Loto-Quebec lottery tickets during a stop at a convenience store for ice cream, according to TIME magazine. The clock read 8.59pm when Ifergan purchased the tickets, and the cutoff time for the draw was 9pm. Store: On that fateful May night, Ifergan made a last-minute decision to purchase two Super 7 Loto-Quebec lottery tickets during a stop at a convenience store for ice cream . With only seconds left before the clock struck nine, the first of the two tickets popped out, but the second was seven seconds late which led to the new draw date, the Globe and Mail reports. 'I’m really disappointed in the decision, and it’s not because it’s about the money,' Ifergan told CTV . 'My crusade is up, I've done all I can, I spent enough money going to the Supreme Court... it cost me a lot of money, but it also consumed me for seven years.' The Quebec Superior Court ruled against Ifergan in 2012 and the Court of Appeal ruled against him in 2014. Rulings: The Quebec Superior Court ruled against Ifergan in 2012 and the Court of Appeal ruled against him in 2014 . System: Ifergan argued that the company's slow-processing system puts people in Quebec at a disadvantage compared with the rest of Canada . Loto-Quebec spokesman, Jean-Pierre Roy, told CTV that no protocol changes will be made in the future. 'The judgement was clear and convincing that Loto-Quebec procedures were altogether reliable and integrated and were the right ones,' Roy said. But, Ifergan argued that the company's slow-processing system puts people in Quebec at a disadvantage compared with the rest of Canada, according to CTV. 'Had those tickets been bought anywhere else in Canada, I would have been a millionaire seven years ago,' Ifergan said.

"A baby orangutan finally has the strength to sit up and feed himself fruit after being caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life. Tiny Budi stole hearts around the world when his horrific story of neglect at the hands of his owner was revealed by MailOnline. Now donations to the charity nursing him back from the brink of death have now topped £20,000 - many of them from kind-hearted readers. Vets from the British animal welfare charity said he is strong enough to lift a bottle of milk to his mouth and suck the juice from pieces of fruit. He was rescued in Indonesia by a Sussex-based charity from a hellish life as a family pet and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Budi is trying new foods but hasn't learned how to chew. He enjoys sucking the juice from slices of fruit . Strength: The tiny orangutan can now lift a bottle of milk if it is not too heavy and can sit up on his own . Since the baby orangutan's plight was publicised, he has become an international celebrity and his story has prompted the biggest response for an individual appeal ever witnessed by International Animal Rescue, the charity that brought him to safety in his native Borneo. Lis Key, from International Animal Rescue, said: 'When MailOnline reported the story of Budi the baby orangutan on January 22, it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world. 'Budi has appeared on websites, blogs and TV in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and America. 'Celebrities including Fearne Cotton, Joss Stone and Ricky Gervais have tweeted about Budi – and charity International Animal Rescue has received a staggering £20,000 in donations towards the appeal to help treat and care for the little baby. 'The charity is aiming to double that amount in the weeks ahead to cover the costs of Budi's care for what is likely to be six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild. 'And if little Budi doesn't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cope with the costs of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life. 'And the latest news is that, slowly but surely, Budi is on the mend.' The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan. Although he is in a stable condition, he is still not out of the woods and simple tasks exhaust him. Before Budi was rescued, his owner hadn't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him. Her ignorance and neglect were killing the baby slowly and painfully, but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand Budi over. Tasty: Budi sucks the juice from a piece of fruit after living off canned condensed milk for the first 10 months of his life . 'We just hope we got to him in time and that someday, although it will be a long time from now, he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan' Alan Knight OBE, the CEO of International Animal Rescue charity said: 'He was deprived of all the nutrients that are vital to the development of a young baby. 'His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent. 'He was completely unable to move or even sit up on his own. At more than a year old he should have been strong enough to climb and swing: instead he was as helpless as a newborn baby. 'When our team lifted Budi out of his cage in Kubing in Borneo to prepare him for the journey to our rescue centre ten hours away in Sungai Awan, his eyes literally filled with tears and he cried in agony. 'Everyone was distressed beyond words to see how much pain he was in. I don't know how much longer he could have endured so much suffering.' Budi had severe anaemia and months of malnutrition had left his joints swollen and badly deformed. He also had to be treated for a serious metabolic disease that may have caused permanent damage to his bones. The little orangutan could only sit up on his own for short periods and could not move his arms and legs fully. Exhausted: Budi sleeping on a makeshift bed alongside his orangutan and Angry Bird soft toys shortly after his rescue . Helping hand: Budi is being cared for by staff at International Animal Rescue after being saved from the chicken coop . Weak: His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent . Vet Christine Nelson now reports that Budi continues to improve every day. She said: 'Each milestone achieved is a wonder, but we remember that it's all relative. 'The swelling and pain in his body has receded, but this has revealed the misshapen and weak muscles of his arms and legs. International Animal Rescue, based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world. Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries. Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild. International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations. It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect. 'Budi can lift a small bottle of milk to drink on his own now, but only if it's not too full or heavy. 'He is trying new foods all the time, and he is willingly opening his mouth to eat, but we are blending his food because he still hasn't learned how to chew. However he enjoys sucking the juice out of slices of fruit. 'We are excited that Budi can now sit up on his own for short periods of time before dropping off to sleep with the effort. 'The team remains optimistic, as Budi has a strong spirit and is being provided with supplements, vitamins and the care he needs to correct his abnormalities and help him continue to develop. 'We just hope we got to him in time and that someday, although it will be a long time from now, he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan.'

"A retired pensioner has been hit with a tax bill for £4.7billion after Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs sent him a letter demanding £950million a month. Doug Yeomans, 78, from Shardlow in Derbyshire, is fighting tax officials to have the error corrected after he was told he owed £4,742,354,255 in unpaid income tax. The former Grenadier Guardsman, who worked until he was 73, opened the letter on Saturday and was shocked to find the tax office would take the huge sum through a direct debit over five months. Shocked: Doug Yeomans, 78, received a bill from HMRC saying he owed £4,742,354,255 in unpaid income tax . He immediately called staff at HMRC, who told him it 'might have been error'. Mr Yeomans, who spent most of his life working as a builder, said: 'I opened the letter and saw the amount and thought to myself, ""I'd better start cutting down on the food bill then"". 'They must think I'm a footballer or something, but I don't even think that Russian bloke who owns Chelsea could afford that amount.' He added: 'I think I can probably just about afford the £255, but I think the rest might be pushing it a bit. 'I live off a state pension, topped up with what I put aside as a pension after a lifetime of working in the building trade. 'When I phoned the customs people up to tell them about the tax demand the girl on the other end of the phone said to me ""yes, I think in this case there might have been an error"". I think she might just be right. Extortionate: The letter said that the money would be a direct debit of £950million a month for five months . 'She said I needed to speak to a different department and gave me a number which I rang and rang. 'But it seems it is easier to get an audience with the Pope than speak to the right person at Revenue and Customs. 'It's laughable really, comical in fact, but I have recovered a lot of bills and demands from them over the past few months so it does worry me sometimes.' He said he will continue to try and speak to the right person and get the mistake corrected. A spokesman for HMRC apologised and said the government department aimed to correct errors as quickly as possible. Mr Yeomans, who retired aged 73, spent most of his life working in the building trade and helped build the M1 . He said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the problems our customer has had and are very sorry about our error. 'We don't talk about individual cases but when we make mistakes we aim to put them right fast and apologise.' During his working life, the father-of-two, whose wife, Mary, died in 2001, helped build the M1 motorway, East Midlands Airport and Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station. He worked initially as a bricklayer and then a civil engineer and was still doing odd jobs as a maintenance man to the age of 73 when he finally retired. His national service in the 1950s saw him serve in the British Army with the Grenadier Guards, stationed at Windsor Castle and in Cyprus.","Doug Yeomans, 78, is fighting tax officials to have an incorrect bill sorted .

"The owner of a race horse at the center of a cheating storm says he is shaken and upset by allegations his animal was 'buzzed' with an outlawed electrical device. Veteran trainer Danny Pish, 49, says he first learned of the controversy when a photo emerged of jockey Roman Chapa clutching the tiny gadget as he crossed the finish line at Sam Houston Race Park, Houston, Texas, on Quiet Acceleration January 17. Mr Pish insisted he had never seen anyone using a similar device in his three decades in the sport and was appalled to learn it appeared to have been used on his six-year-old gelding, Quiet Acceleration. The married father-of-one who runs a racing stable in rural Cibolo, just outside San Antonio, Texas, told Daily Mail Online: 'This has been really painful to me and my family. Scroll down for video . Photo finish: The photo (magnified to show detail) shot by Jack Coady, shows what officials say is jockey Roman Chapa, 43, using a banned device in a Texas race . Shocking: The device, which officials say is similar to the one pictured, is designed to deliver a shock to the horse in order to cause it to accelerate . Upset: Trainer Danny Pish (right) said that he was shaken by the claims of abusing the horse he has raised since birth but added: 'We are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty.' 'I'm the breeder, I've raised this horse and have had him his whole life. 'If this was used on him - and we are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty - then it would be very upsetting to me.' Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring has been charged with unlawful influence on racing after being allegedly caught in the act of using the device in a photo taken near the finish line. The jockey was running in fifth place in the $50,000 Richard King Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17 when his mount, Quiet Acceleration, pressed to the front of the pack and won by half a length. Track photographer Jack Coady snapped a photo of Chapa just before the finish of the $50,000 race, which Quiet Acceleration had entered at 10-to-1 odds. According to the Paulick Report, the photo accompanied a write-up on the track's website about the day's races. The day after the race, according to a probable cause complaint, Chapa contacted Coady, telling him to take the photo down from the website because 'it was a bad picture.' After being confronted by Texas Department of Public Safety investigator Jeff Green, Chapa first denied having seen the photo, then claimed it was 'photo-shopped and someone was trying to frame him,' the complaint stated. Two days after the race, Texas Racing Commission stewards suspended Chapa, pending an investigation and hearing. Chapa faces a felony charge and that a warrant was issued for his arrest on Tuesday, but authorities have so far been unable to locate him. There does not appear to be a direct precedent for prosecution of a jockey over use of such a device. The horse has earned career winnings of $200,000 Mr Pish said. Mr Pish is a trainer, but has also bred some horses for racing, including Quiet Acceleration. 'He's done well in the past. Of the limited number of horses I've raised as a breeder, he's the best one,' Mr Pish said. 'He's had nine lifetime victories, ten if you include the race in question. 'I don't know how this device works because I know nothing about it. I know they are commonly used in dog training but they are not legal in horse training. 'It's illegal and I would never condone any illegal activity. 'I had no idea about any of this until the photo came out. I felt total disbelief, I just can't believe it's true. Video from PETA . Chapa was running in fifth place in the Richard King Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17 when his mount, Quiet Acceleration, pressed to the front of the pack and won by half a length . Chapa, left, has a checkered past including in 1994, right, when he was sanctioned by Texas officials for using a nail to spur his horse, Silver Sixes, at a qualifying race at the Gillespie County Fair . In action: Roman Chapa on Quiet Acceleration during the race at Sam Houston Race Park which ended in victory - but which he appeared to have won after using a device to shock the six-year-old . Big win: Quiet Acceleration had entered the $50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 . Victory salute: Roman Chapa celebrates victory on Quiet Acceleration but is now facing a felony charge over the use of an electric shock device . 'I've checked him out. His health seems to be good and I don't see any after-effects.' Chapa, 43, is one of a number of jockeys who have ridden Quiet Acceleration to victory, helping the mount amass winnings in excess of $200,000. Mr Pish said: 'Jockeys are free agents. They jump from horse to horse. 'They have an agent and I let him know about possible races and that I'm interested in a jockey. 'I have limited control other than giving suggestions as to how the horse may be ridden. 'Mr Chapa has ridden the horse in the past and he's won on him before. I was aware of his one prior conviction but I never dreamed he would do something like this. 'This sort of thing is not seen as acceptable within horse racing. If he's found guilty he should be punished.' Training ground: The horse's trainer is Dan Pish, who is based at these stables just outside San Antonio, Texas . Chapa's bail was set at $10,000 and he remained at large. In addition to the felony charge, Chapa faces the probability that the Texas Racing Commission will take way his license to race. He has a checkered history as a jockey and has been suspended twice before for buzzing horses. Chapa was sanctioned by Texas officials in 1994 for using a nail to spur his horse, Silver Sixes, at a qualifying race at the Gillespie County Fair. He was suspended from racing for nine months and fined $2,500, though at the time he was still an apprentice. New Mexico racing officials suspended him for five years after he was reportedly caught using an electrical device back in 2007. Chapa was also suspected of using a prohibited device after a Peta investigation in 2014 caught assistant trainer Scott Blasi on tape talking about the jockey using an electric buzzer. 'That silly-a-- Roman Chapa put it in his mouth in New Mexico,' Blasi was heard saying to jockey Gary Stevens and trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 'They came in to shake him down, he stuck it in his mouth, then he spit it out in his wash bucket,' Blasi added. Chapa also received a sentence of 10 days in 2002 for a plea deal on cruelty to animals charges, after police said Chapa 'torture[d] an animal, namely a dog, by beating it with a strap'.","Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring, Texas, was photographed with what officials say is a prohibited electric device used to shock the horse .

"More detached homes are being built now than at the height of the property boom in 2007, an industry body has reported. The National House Building Council (NHBC), which released the figures, said detached homes are making a 'comeback', with 38,113 new build properties of this type registered with it in 2014, which is the highest number recorded for any year since 2004. Across all types of property, 145,174 new homes across the UK were registered with the NHBC last year, marking a 9 per cent increase on 2013 and the highest annual total since 2007 as the economic recovery continues. New home owners are snapping up detached houses according to new figures released today, file picture . Almost 40,000 new detached homes were registered with the National House Building Council last year . Yorkshire and the Humber, Wales, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and the South East are all now outpacing London in terms of the year-on-year percentage growth in the number of new builds being registered. Wales recorded the strongest percentage jump, with registrations up by one third (33 per cent) on 2013. The NHBC said London saw 'exceptional' growth in the number of new builds being registered in 2013, and in 2014 growth in the capital was more in line with that seen in the UK generally. With 28,733 new homes registered in London last year, the number of new builds recorded in the capital was still up by 10 per cent on 2013. Eastern England was the only UK region that recorded a year-on-year fall in new build registrations in 2014, with a 6 per cent fall. The NHBC's registration figures are taken from builders who are responsible for around 80 per cent of homes constructed in the UK. Builders are required to register a house with the NHBC before starting work, which means its figures represent homes that are to be built in the months ahead. The number of detached homes being registered represents a 24 per cent increase on 2013. Detached homes now make up more than one quarter (26 per cent) of all homes being built, with flats and maisonettes still accounting for the biggest chunk of new builds, at one third (33 per cent). In 2008, almost half (49 per cent) of new build homes being registered were flats, while just 15 per cent were detached homes. NHBC chief executive Mike Quinton said: 'It looks like the detached home is making a comeback ... Following an oversupply of flats outside London over the last decade, the growth in detached homes is restoring balance to the country's housing stock.' Some 48,685 flats were registered with the NHBC last year - representing a 5 per cent increase on 2013 but just over half of the 90,221 flats that were recorded during the boom in 2007. The number of new build semi-detached homes also increased on 2013, rising by 12 per cent to 31,650. Meanwhile, the number of bungalows and terraced homes being registered fell year-on-year. Some 26,600 terraced homes were registered in 2014, representing a 2 per cent annual fall, while 2,059 bungalows were registered, showing a 16 per cent decrease. Despite the boost in new build numbers, the NHBC said that 2014's total remains below the average of 153,000 registrations seen per year over the last four decades. Mr Quinton continued: 'We are still building below the levels seen before the economic downturn and below what this country needs. 'With the general election just three months away, it is therefore very encouraging that housing remains a top priority for all the main parties.' Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'Today's figures clearly show how our efforts have got the country building again ... 'We have turned around a broken housing market, including introducing schemes like Help to Buy to help home owners get on the housing ladder and investing billions in affordable housebuilding.' The National House Building Council said the increase in demand for detached housing was addressing a problem with the oversupply of new apartments especially outside the London area .","More than 145,000 new homes were registered by builders last year .

"A Ryanair flight was forced to make an unscheduled landing after a tyre burst while it was taking off from Edinburgh Airport. Passengers reported hearing a loud bang and the flight crew in charge of the Boeing 737-800 decided to abort the journey to Dublin and make an immediate return to the Scottish airport. Despite the blown tyre the plane landed safely shortly after 8am and taxied to a remote part of the airport to be inspected by an engineer. Ryanair flight 813 turned around south of Falkirk and then briefly circled before landing safely . Passenger Keiran Steel, 20, told The Scotsman that he heard a ‘big bang’ moments after the plane’s wheels lifted off the runway. He said: ‘Some people were screaming and there were kids crying.’ Passenger Rami Okasha tweeted a photo of fire trucks which met the twin-engine plane when it returned to Edinburgh Airport about ten minutes after take-off. He wrote: ‘On a Ryanair plane stuck at Edinburgh. Unfortunately a tyre exploded on takeoff and we had to land again rather suddenly. All well.’ Other passengers on flight 813 complained about the delay, which lasted more than seven hours, and a shortage of vouchers to cover lunch costs. Ryanair described the incident as a ‘precautionary air turn back’ and said no emergency was declared . Passenger Tony Gowland was unhappy with Ryanair's customer service while he was delayed in Edinburgh . Jenny Duncan said: ‘Idly wondering if we will get another voucher from Ryanair as I have spent my 3.50 and it’s now lunchtime.’ Tony Gowland added: ‘4.5 hours to replace a blown tyre, and just a £3.50 food voucher to apologise. Last time I fly @Ryanair’. While passengers waited inside the terminal the plane was inspected by an engineer who was sent from Ryanair’s base at Prestwick Airport about 70 miles away in South Ayrshire. Passengers reboarded shortly before 4pm to continue their journey to Dublin. After a lengthy delay passengers boarded a second time and departed for Dublin shortly before 4pm . A Ryanair spokeswoman described the incident as a ‘precautionary air turn back’ and said no emergency was declared. She added: ‘A flight from Edinburgh to Dublin today suffered a burst tyre on take-off from Edinburgh Airport. ‘The aircraft returned to Edinburgh and landed normally, and customers disembarked and were provided with refreshment vouchers. Passengers reported hearing a loud bang and the flight crew in charge of the Boeing 737-800 decided to abort the journey to Dublin . ‘A Ryanair engineer was sent from Prestwick to replace the tyre and the aircraft will depart for Dublin shortly. ‘Ryanair sincerely apologised to all those affected by the delay to their journey.’","Dublin-bound plane was forced to make an immediate return to airport .

"A Romanian man has been arrested after sneaking aboard a Wizz Air flight to Spain to visit his girlfriend. Claudiu-Gabriel Costin's plan was foiled after security spotted the light from his phone flashing as he took selfies inside the cockpit. The 30 year-old man arrived at Cluj international airport in north-western Romania, crept past security, got onto the runway and clambered into a stationary plane that was due to travel to Spain. Claudiu-Gabriel Costin climbed on board a Wizz Air flight in Romania in the hope he would get to Spain . 30 year old wanted to visit his girlfriend but the flashing light from his phone  gave him away as he took snaps . He uploaded the pictures onto Facebook for his girlfriend to see with a song called 'I'd like to get to you' Under the cover of darkness no one immediately saw the stowaway as he boarded the plane. The incident is especially embarrassing for airport officials given that they were on heightened security alert after a dangerous criminal had escaped from a local prison. According to Romanian Times, Costin hadn't been able to book a ticket, so decided to take matters into his own hands. He said: 'I wanted to visit my girlfriend who lives in London but when I tried to book a ticket, they had all sold out. 'I haven't seen her for weeks now and I miss her very much so I decided that no matter what, I would go and see her.' However Costin, who is listed on his Facebook page as a life coach, grew bored of waiting for the flight to take off so started taking photographs. After entering the pilot's cockpit he took snaps of himself, the controls and the Wizz Air flight log book before posting them on Facebook where his girlfriend Aline Haskil, 27, would see them. He also posted a song by Romanian pop-rock band Bere Gratis called 'I'd like to get to you'. Although claiming he wanted to visit his girlfriend in London, Costin had boarded a flight that was bound for Spain. An airport spokesperson said: 'It was an evening flight and he was caught after security noticed his camera flash going off inside the cockpit. Costin hadn't been able to book a ticket so decided to take matters into his own hands . Incident was especially embarrassing for airport officials who were on high alert after an escaped prisoner . Costin denies sneaking into cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who offered him sexual favours . 'When they went to investigate they found the man inside. We are looking into the circumstances and how he managed to breach security, get onto the runway and climb abroad the plane without being noticed. 'There was clearly a lapse in security and this will be addressed and sorted out.' Clearly caught in a tricky spot Costin denies sneaking into the cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who  then inexplicably offered him sexual favours. He told local authorities: 'I was just wandering around when a pilot appeared and told me to get inside the cockpit and he'd do me a favour. I didn't understand what he meant but then he got his penis out. I was really shocked, and decided I was going to leave town and go and live in a hut in the mountains.' The airport spokesperson said: 'This makes no sense and there was no sign of any pilot.' It is, as yet, unclear what penalty Mr Costin will face. Wizz Air has said: 'Wizz Air confirms that Cluj Airport suffered a security breach unauthorized access to parked and sealed aircraft in the early morning hours 27 January. An individual who is understood to have broken into the airport campus and into a closed aircraft, was subsequently arrested. While this is now a matter for the police, Wizz Air welcomes Cluj Airport's full revision of its security procedures. Passenger safety was ensured at all times as all Wizz Air aircraft are subject to thorough inspection before entering service.' Costin managed to evade airport security staff and get onto the runway at Cluj international airport .

"It got off to an uncertain start, with viewers complaining of dull, confusing plot lines. And it seems things have gone from bad to worse for BBC2’s new drama Wolf Hall, after it lost one million viewers in the space of a week. Wednesday night’s episode, which was the second instalment of the Tudor drama, drew an average of 2.89 million viewers, down from the 3.89 million who tuned in to watch episode one. Scroll down for video . Complex: The BBC historical drama Wolf Hall - starring Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell - has lost one million viewers in a week, with many who switched off saying they were left feeling confused by the complex plot and 'snail's pace action' Like last week, many of those who did watch the historical saga, praised the cast, in particular Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damian Lewis who stars as King Henry VIII. But others said the slow pace had sent them to sleep and complained there was too much complex Tudor history to make for entertaining viewing. Praise: While viewers have been left in the dark by the complicated political plot, cast members such as Damian Lewis - who plays King Henry VIII - have earned praise for their powerful performances . University of Sheffield historian Catherine Fletcher used Twitter to share background notes throughout the episode, including: ‘One of Henry’s courtiers, Sir Francis Bryan, really did lose an eye while jousting. It was dangerous business.’ Responding to questions about Henry’s tangerine robes, she wrote: ‘Well Henry did like the colour - ordered more orange garments in 1530s & 1540s.’ However her expertise couldn’t help some of the more confused muddle through. Taking to the social media site, one viewer wrote: ‘Wolf Hall is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep, the Tudors really didn’t say much!’ ‘Cannot understand the love around Wolf Hall. Painfully slow and dull,’ wrote another, while a third posted: ‘Wolf Hall is so confusing.’ The BBC spent £7million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel’s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith’s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII’s court. Taking to the social media site, one viewer wrote: ‘Wolf Hall is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep, the Tudors really didn’t say much!’ ‘Cannot understand the love around Wolf Hall. Painfully slow and dull,’ wrote another, while a third posted: ‘Wolf Hall is so confusing.’ The BBC spent £7million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel’s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith’s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII’s court. Directed by Peter Kosminsky, adapting the text involved condensing nearly 700 pages into six one-hour episodes – helped by a combination of flashbacks and jumps forward. Author: Hilary Mantel, who won the Booker Prize for the novel in 2009 . However, while this might help fit more of Mantel’s vision of Tudor England on the screen, some audience members were left less impressed. And despite becoming BBC2’s most successful new drama for a decade when it began last week, it was met with complaints from viewers who complained the structure was hard to follow. One Twitter user wrote: ‘Thinking about Wolf Hall; know my history, loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing.’ And another said: ‘Wolf Hall? Confusing use of “he” for any 4 or 5 folk at a time, non-linear timeline, stupidly long convos & snail’s pace action.’ Others felt their lack of knowledge of Tudor history left them at a disadvantage when watching the programme. In one sequence, Thomas Cromwell lost his wife and daughters to the mysterious ‘sweating sickness’. The disease, which is still not fully understood, struck England and later Europe in a series of epidemics between 1485 and 1551. Speculation of its causes at the time included people’s sins, spells, and the French. Although the disease does not exist today and is therefore rarely talked about, no time was spent giving audiences this context. One viewer wrote: ‘What is sweating sickness? They weren’t feeling unwell the day before. Must be able to equate it to modern day illness.’ And another joked: ‘A dose of the sweating sickness would have been a blessed relief during Wolf Hall.’","Complicated drama leaves viewers perplexed by political plotline .

"A retired headmaster has been immortalised in stone - as a gargoyle overlooking his historic old school. Dr Richard Shephard was in charge of the Minster School at York Minster for 19 years where the stone caricature was unveiled yesterday.

'To be honest I was astonished when I heard it was being done, wherever it had gone I would have been delighted, but obviously it is very appropriate.'

He was kept in the dark about the carving but admitted he spotted the resemblance to himself as stonemason Matt Hodgkinson worked on it. He added: 'Having oneself immortalised on the Minster as a grotesque may not be to everyone's taste.

"Oregon's governor is facing some uncomfortable questions on Friday, once again over his fiancée, after it was revealed that she was paid $118,000 from an out-of-state company while acting as an adviser to him. Governor John Kitzhaber, 67, is set to explain at a press conference why 47-year-old first lady, Cylvia Hayes, was paid thousands by the Clean Economy Development Center (CEDC) in D.C., for an unspecified role. He was sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term as Oregon's governor on January 12. CEDC, which looks at U.S. policy on clean energy, paid Hayes $30,000 in 2011 and $88,000 in 2012 - a period when she was referring to herself as a clean energy adviser for the Democratic governor. Scroll down for video . Governor John Kitzhaber (left) is set to explain at a press conference why his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes (right), . Governor Kitzhaber, pictured dancing with Hayes who is 20 years his junior, will answer questions on Friday  morning - two weeks into his fourth term as governor - over her undeclared earnings . Hayes admitted in an email to the East Oregonian that she had been paid the money by CEDC. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from CEDC on Friday. The paper also confirmed that she did not disclose $88,000 in tax filings for 2012 - claiming her income  was just over $27,000 from her own business venture, 3E Strategies. The paper reported that since Kitzhaber was sworn in as governor in 2011, his fiancée has pulled in around $213,000 in consulting fees. According to her first lady biography on Oregon.gov, Hayes has 22 years of experience working in clean energy and has served as a member and co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group. Her own consulting firm, 3E Strategies, had led to an ethics investigation, following complaints. In November, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission opened a preliminary investigation into Hayes' consulting work. The commission received three complaints about Hayes' work as a private consultant. The preliminary investigation was to determine whether the commission should proceed with a full-fledged inquiry that could lead to sanctions. The commission also rejected Kitzhaber's request for an advisory opinion about whether ethics laws apply to Hayes, whom he first met in 2002. Officials said the questions asked by the governor's office will be addressed in the investigation. Kitzhaber said Hayes carefully avoided conflicts of interest. Among those who filed ethics complaints were the Republican state party and a Republican state representative. A decision will be made on March 13 on whether a full investigation will take place. Governor Kitzhaber is sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term in Oregon on January 12 this year next to his fiancés, Cylvia Hayes. Several weeks later, he is set to explain her questionable consulting fees . This is not the first time that Hayes has brought unwelcome attention on the governor's office. In October, she admitted that she previously bought Washington farmland that was intended to be used to illegally grow marijuana. She bought the $245,000 property at Colville Indian Reservation, Okanogan in 1997 with her then-boyfriend. This came just months after she was paid $5,000 for a fake marriage to another man, an Ethiopian immigrant, in order to get him a green card. Hayes admitted that she had been paid the money to marry immigrant Abraham Abraham. The couple filed for divorce in 2001. Hayes admitted she never told the governor about the marriage. Kitzhaber confirmed he had known nothing about the marriage - or the farmland for marijuana. The marriage, her third, was uncovered when the Willamette Week newspaper began asking questions. She had previously claimed to have only been married twice. Governor Kitzhaber met Hayes in 2002 and the couple became engaged last year. They live in the governor's opulent mansion . Hayes, who became engaged to her older lover last year, lives with Kitzhaber in the lavish governor's mansion in Oregon .","Governor John Kitzhaber is set to explain at a press conference on Friday why Cylvia Hayes was paid thousands from a D.C. energy company .

"Dr Stephen Frost (pictured) is claiming substantial damages in a whistleblowing claim against the Ministry of Defence . A highly-experienced doctor was sacked by text while on a family holiday after blowing the whistle on a suspected drugs scam at a British Army base. Dr Stephen Frost, who led the campaign for an inquest into the controversial death of Iraq weapons expert Dr David Kelly, was dismissed by the Ministry of Defence after calling for a police investigation. He claims there was a ‘cover-up of criminality’ over the ordering and dispensing of 2,400mg of dangerous controlled drug morphine sulphate for a patient, instead of 400mg. The incident happened before Dr Frost started work at the military camp’s medical centre. But less than a month after telling bosses he believed a crime had taken place, he was sacked by text and email while on holiday in North Wales. Now the doctor, whose ordeal has left him suffering stress, anxiety and depression, has won a legal battle to bring a whistleblowing claim against the MoD. He is claiming substantial damages that could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Mail has long campaigned for the protection of public sector whistleblowers and has revealed how senior NHS doctors have been gagged by their hospitals when highlighting wrong-doing. Last night Dr Frost said: ‘It is a great relief that the judge has allowed my claim to proceed. ‘I have dedicated much of my life to working as a doctor for the Armed Forces and I took my job of treating sick and injured military personnel very seriously. ‘My summary dismissal came as a great shock to me and has seriously affected my health and my family life.’ Shah Qureshi, Dr Frost’s solicitor and one of the country’s leading specialists in employment law, said: ‘Dr Frost believes he was summarily dismissed because he shone a spotlight on potential criminality at a military barracks. ‘Other members of staff involved continue to work for the MOD while my client has lost his livelihood. To this day it is unclear as to whether the matter was ever referred to the police.’ Mr Qureshi said it was of ‘great concern’ the MoD had fought to get the case struck out on a technicality. ‘It is of immense public importance that whistleblowers enjoy maximum protection before the law,’ he said. Dr Frost, a civilian doctor who had worked for the MoD for nearly 20 years, was employed on a six-month contract at Weeton Barracks, near Blackpool, Lancashire, when his ordeal began. In August 2013 – two weeks after he started the job – he was told a pharmacy technician had, a month earlier, mistakenly ordered and dispensed 40 60mg tablets of morphine sulphate, instead of 10mg pills. Dr Frost checked with the patient who insisted the lower strength drugs had been handed out – leading the doctor to conclude the stronger tablets were missing. Dr Frost was employed on a six-month contract at Weeton Barracks (pictured), near Blackpool, Lancashire, when his ordeal began . He believed it was ‘highly unlikely’ the experienced pharmacy technician would have ordered and dispensed the 60mg tablets by mistake and concluded she may have been forced into some form of criminal activity. Suspecting foul play, Dr Frost expressed his concern to members of the practice team and a nurse-led internal investigation and said the matter was so serious the police should be informed. Documents handed to the tribunal said: ‘He considered a police investigation was required because it was likely a criminal offence (blackmail, coercion or threats) had taken place to procure controlled drug.’ On September 6, 2013, while climbing a mountain on holiday, Dr Frost received a text and email out of the blue informing him his contract had been terminated. He was later informed he was barred from working on another military base. Dr Frost led a campaign for a full inquest into chemical weapons expert Dr David Kelly's (pictured) death . He was not told why he had been sacked nor given a chance to defend himself. He maintains he was unlawfully dismissed for whistleblowing about a possible drugs racket. The MoD disputed Dr Frost’s case claiming it did not employ him but only hired him through a health recruitment agency, despite the fact he had worked almost exclusively for the military since 1996. Defence chiefs also sought to strike out the claim on a technicality arguing he was not a whistleblower. Throwing out the MoD’s case at a pre-tribunal hearing, Employment Judge Rebecca Howard said: ‘The basis of the claim is that following Dr Frost's participation in the investigation into incorrect dosage and dispensation of morphine he was summarily dismissed and banned from working as a doctor in the military.’ Dr Frost led a campaign for a full inquest into Dr Kelly's death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police. The chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead in July 2003, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair's Government had 'sexed up' the case for war in Iraq. The Hutton Report later found that Dr Kelly, a member of a UN inspection team sent to Iraq to unearth weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. However, many still believe the 59-year-old scientist may have been murdered by the security services. No inquest has ever been held. A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said the force had not been involved in any investigation at Weeton. An MoD spokesman said: ‘This case is subject to legal proceedings and it would be inappropriate for us to comment.’","Dr Stephen Frost was sacked after raising concerns about suspected scam .

"A leading New Zealand wine brand will begin their upcoming harvesting season by herding an unorthodox new team into their workforce. South Island winery Brancott Estate will employ Wooly Workers, a flock of about 2000 sheep, to pluck leaves from the vine canopy and uncover the ripening grapes in preparation for picking. The breed of Romney/Corriedale cross-ewes create a speedier and more efficient means of preparing grapes to be picked at their prime. Woolly Workers pave the way for harvest at Brancott Estate on South Island New Zealand . The flock of 2000 sheep will pluck leaves from the vine canopy and uncover the ripening grapes in preparation for picking . Patrick Materman, Chief Winemaker at Brancott Estate, told Daily Mail Australia the Wooly Workers'have been years in the making. 'We have been experimenting with a few different methods for years. In 2011 we first realised the sheep could be integral to harvesting juicy grapes,' he said. 'Not only are they quicker and more efficient than human or mechanical leaf-pluckers, they are just the right height to pluck all the leaves around the bunches, without causing any damage to the fruit.' While using tractors to pluck the leaves burns an immense amount of diesel, human labourours are highly cost ineffective. Leaf removal is particularly important for Pinot Noir vines, as the developing fruit needs to be exposed to sunlight to increase flavour and colour in the berries.

"Home-grown fanatics who go to fight with ISIS are ‘w*****s’ who watch porn because they can’t find girlfriends, Boris Johnson has claimed. The London Mayor said British terrorists become radicalised are often ‘badly adjusted in their relations with women’ and turn to extremism to stop them feeling like losers. He said: ‘If you look at all the psychological profiling about bombers, they typically will look at porn. They are literally w***ers.’ Mr Johnson's remarks were blasted by some Muslim groups. But the London Mayor said his claim was ‘not remotely controversial’. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson, attending Norbury Manor Primary School this morning,  said British terrorists become radicalised are often ‘badly adjusted in their relations with women’ and turn to extremism to stop them feeling like losers' More than 600 people from Britain are thought to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadists, with security forces warning returning fighters pose the biggest terror threat to Britain. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond held a terror conference in London this month and warned there was a 'very significant risk' of an attack by extremists. He said ISIS was ‘the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security'. Mr Johnson, speaking to the Sun, said psychological profiling carried out by Britain’s spy agencies had revealed the pathetic reason so many youngsters were signing up to fight with ISIS. He said it was time for Muslim leaders to speak up much more forcefully against Islamist terror. The prospective Tory MP said: ‘They are not explaining how it can be that this one religion seems to be leading people astray in so many cases. ‘They are not being persuasive in the right way with these people. I am not yet hearing it in the way we need to hear it.’ He said the ISIS fanatics tearing across the Middle East were ‘barbaric’ and ‘deserve to be treated as such’. Mr Johnson said the ISIS fanatics tearing across the Middle East were ‘barbaric’ and ‘deserve to be treated as such’ Mr Johnson said: ‘They are tortured. They will be very badly adjusted in their relations with women, and that is a symptom of their feeling of being failures and that the world is against them. ‘They are not making it with girls, and so they turn to other forms of spiritual comfort — which of course is no comfort.’ ‘I fervently think we need to demystify this lot,’ he added. ‘The people most likely to get involved in IS or be radicalised are the same as those most vulnerable to getting dragged into drug gangs or other criminal activity. ‘They are just young men in desperate need of self-esteem who do not have a particular mission in life, who feel that they are losers and this thing makes them feel strong — like winners.’ Despite the remarks, experts have warned that ISIS is using British female extremists to incite other UK women to carry out terror attacks. Experts at King's College London say they have identified a group of around 30 British women in northern Syria, who are encouraging others to launch terrorist attacks in the UK. Around 50 British women and girls are thought to have joined ISIS, with the majority based in the jihadist's stronghold Raqqa and aged between 16 and 24. Cherif Kouachi, left, and Said Kouachi, right, attacked the Charlie Hebdo magazine over anti-Islamic cartoons . The London Mayor, who is running to be an MP again at the next election in the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge, also insisted he had not made a ‘deal’ with David Cameron to succeed him as Conservative leader. The London Mayor revealed he will serve under Mr Cameron when his second mayor’s term ends in 2016. Mr Johnson said: ‘A deal? No, no, no, there is no deal. Genuinely I would tell you. ‘I’m just going to have to disappoint you. The reason for that is because I desperately want him to win. ‘Over the years I have questionably rattled the cage and beaten the drum, and a certain amount of plaster has come off the ceiling. That is part of being mayor. ‘But we are all shooting from the same trench - I do not want Ed Miliband anywhere near government in Britain.’ Mr Johnson is running to be an MP again in the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge.","London Mayor said terrorists 'badly adjusted in their relations with women'

"Researchers from the University of Sydney are conducting a world-first study on newborn babies to investigate whether it is possible to predict whether a child will stutter even before they can talk. Sydney University's Australian Stuttering Research Centre are conducting the study in an attempt to discover the cause of stuttering, using 20 babies with a family history of the disorder and 20 without. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study, after his older sister Zoe suffered from a debilitating stutter from the time she was two years old. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study on the causes of stuttering . 'It got to the point where she refused to speak, she would just point at things,' said Levi's mother, Naomi Crellin. 'She was shy and withdrawn and frustrated, and she didn't want to speak to anyone her age because they couldn't understand her,' Naomi told Daily Mail Australia. 'We didn't want that for Levi, it's just such a formative time and we didn't want him to be disabled by a stutter, so we agreed to be part of the study,' she said. Levi underwent the first of many MRI scans, which will continue over the next six years, just two days ago, under the watchful eye of his mother and researchers at the Centre. 'It's very hard to scan babies because you can't exactly tell a baby to sit still, you have to wait for them to fall asleep, and even then the loud noises from the machine might wake them up,' Naomi said. The researchers will scan the newborns in an MRI machine in order to detect transmission issues in the parts of the brain which relate to speech. Levi's older sister Zoe (left) developed a stutter when she was just two years old . Levi underwent his first scan on the 27th of January, watched by his mother Naomi Crellen (far right) The study will scan 40 babies over a six-year period to gain information about the causes of stuttering . Director of the Research Centre, Professor Mark Onslow, said that the study could revolutionise both diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. 'It will take us a step closer to understanding the cause of stuttering and could potentially lead us to discover more effective early-intervention treatments,' said Professor Onslow. 'This would be a huge breakthrough as stuttering is only noticeable when a child starts stringing words together at two to three-years-of-age and the current window for effective treatment is so small.' Stuttering has been reported to affect one in nine children by the age of four, and approximately 70% of those diagnosed have a family history of stuttering. Naomi said that not only did her daughter develop a stutter, but her father also had the condition. 'We're a bilingual family as well, and there is a link between that and stuttering, so really it was a double whammy for us,' she said. Director of the Research Centre, Professor Mark Onslow (above), said that the study could revolutionise both diagnosis and treatment of the disorder . Stuttering has been reported to affect one in nine children by the age of four, and approximately 70% of those diagnosed have a family history of stuttering . Levi's brain will continue to be monitored through regular MRI scans, in order to provide early information on what the causes of stuttering could be. 'Considering the advancements in medicine, it shocked me that so little was known about the causes of stuttering,' said Naomi. Jim Lagopoulos, Associate Professor at the Brain and Mind Research Institute, said that it was not clear whether stuttering was a cause or an effect of problems with the transmission of information along fibres of the brain. 'We currently don’t know if the structural problems we see in the brain are present prior to the onset of stuttering, or result from stuttering,' said Associate Professor Lagopoulos. 'This is because previous studies have only examined the brains of older children and adults who have already developed a stutter,' he said. Naomi said that she was keen to do anything to help aid the research process. 'After we took Zoe in for treatment, she improved dramatically within three months, and now you wouldn't be able to tell,' she said. Naomi said the study would be important to provide information early to start treating the issue before it became permanent. 'The study will provide a lot of information, and this is the next step in the process,' she said. Levi's brain will continue to be monitored through regular MRI scans .

Catchy: Dan Miller has started mulitple successful internet businesses, so when he decided he wanted to work for Strava, he knew he had to make a splash . 'I'm at a point in my career where I'm looking for an awesome company to work with,' Miller told ABC News. 'I'm so passionate about running already. It seemed like a good idea.' There's no word yet on whether Miller's good idea worked, however. A spokesperson at Strava declined to comment on the hiring. Strava allows people to use a smartphone to track their athletic activity and then view the route they have taken on a map. It has spawned a new craze, as cyclists and runners create their own artwork with the red route line. Examples of Strava art include a giant cat and the logo of the San Francisco 49ers. Another cyclist, Bret Lobree, spent four hours drawing a huge turkey around a 53mile route in California for Thanksgiving. Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis. Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass. The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end. Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track. Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users. Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard. Work of art: One Strava user created this turkey during a ride around San Francisco .

"It was a whirlwind romance, culminating in a sumptuous summer wedding in August last year, but last night Jodie Kidd confirmed that she and her husband David Blakeley were not to be. The former model and polo player revealed the pair had split after just forth months of marriage telling The Sun: 'It is with sadness that David and I have separated. My priority remains my son Indio.' The couple had been together for nearly 18 months and had spoken of their hope that they would spend the rest of their lives together. It is thought that they separated just before Christmas. In happier times: Jodie and David attended an event together in October shortly after their marriage - last night the model confirmed that they have split after just four months . Covering up: Posing with Quentin Wilson there were times when Jodie seemed to make an effort to cover her un-ringed finger . No ring: Jodie was spotted at The Classic Car Show launch today in an all black outfit having removed her wedding and engagement rings. Jodie was then spotted today at The Classic Car Show launch in London having removed her wedding and engagement rings. For mother-of-one Jodie, 35, who was previously married to internet entrepreneur Aidan Butler, it's not her first divorce. Her marriage to Butler lasted just 18 months and she was reportedly blindsided when he decided to split in 2007 - she'd similarly said that she thought she and Aidan would be together forever. Indeed the similarities between the two situations are undoubtedly glaring. When Jodie married Aidan, she described him as, 'the man I am going to spend the rest of my life with.' Then when she tied the knot with author David, 34, Jodie told Hello! magazine: 'As soon as David and I met, I went through a huge 360 in my mind. I thought, ""That's it, we're going to spend the rest of our lives together."" 'Everything has changed in my life. He's given me the confidence to go and conquer the world.' Speaking about Jodie, David said: 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world. With my parents being childhood sweethearts, I wanted to get married. But I did wonder is I was going to ever meet someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.' Wedding day: Jodie and David were pictured arriving at their wedding in August, however their marriage only lasted four months . Happy Families: Jodie and David took her son Indio to the Winter Wonderland VIP launch in December . After her split from Aidan, Jodie admitted that perhaps they hadn't known each other as well as they should have. She said in an interview with FEMAIL in 2008: 'It was the wedding year, then I went, ""Whoa! I don't really know you and I don't think you know me either."" We were complete opposites. And then we got divorced - it was a terrible, awful, awful period.' In today's reports The Sun claimed that the reason Jodie and David decided to go their separate ways was because they had rushed things and hadn't got to know each other well enough either. History repeating itself: Jodie split from her first husband Aidan in 2007, she has previously revealed that she didn't think the couple knew each other well enough to have married . Jodie got engaged to David in January 2014, after a two-month romance, after splitting from the father of her two-year-old son, Andrea Vianini. They then married at the Holy Trinity church in Plaistow, West Sussex, after just 10 months together. She wore a floor-length Grecian style Zaeem Jamal gown whilst David opted for a smart grey suit. Following a church service - where Indio played pageboy - the couple celebrated their nuptials with close friends and family at the 16th century home they lived in. So why is Jodie so quick to fall in love and rush down the aisle? One reason could be that  she is trying to recreate the family unit she lost when her parents Wendy and John divorced in 2007. Splitting in the same year as she and Aidan did, Jodie has previously spoken about how damaged she felt after their break up. Jodie had a son with Andrea Vianini, pictured, getting together with David shortly after their split in 2013 . Liz Cowell, divorce lawyer at Slater & Gordon said: 'Generally when a marriage only lasts four months the court will try and put the parties back to where they were pre marriage when dividing their assets. Unless of course there is a pre nuptial agreement. 'People often think that after such a short marriage they can get the relationship annulled but in England they will have to wait a year before divorce proceedings can be started. 'And unless the marriage is unconsummated there are unlikely to be grounds for annulment. 'It can often take couples married for this short a period more time to officially separate than those who have been together longer who can get a quickie divorce in a matter of months, because they have to wait until they have been married a year before they can start proceedings.' Jodie is the great-granddaughter of Press baron Lord Beaverbrook, and one of three children born to show jumper Johnny and his wife, Wendy, herself the daughter of baronet Sir John Hodge. She revealed she was with her brother Jack, 42, and sister Jemma, 40, at the family home in Barbados for Easter  when their father dropped the bombshell that he had fallen in love with an American stuntwoman almost 30 years his junior. 'Everything imploded. I didn't really know what was happening. When my parents separated, the perfect picture of our family was completely shattered,' Jodie said at the time. 'It was incredibly tough for us, and it affected us all much more than we thought it ever could.' Indeed, it was perhaps the end of her parents marriage - and the failure of her relationship with Aidan -that led her to make the wrong decisions in her future relationships. 'I was shocked, completely and utterly shocked,' she said of the experience of watching her parents split, 'Everything we knew was a lie. 'Suddenly, we were in a different dimension. My parents had always been together, and I was proud of that. As the youngest child, I suppose I never really knew what was going on. 'There had been issues for a while, which I didn't know about. It's only now that I'm really starting to speak to Mum and Dad about it.' Super slim: Jodie was incredibly slim in her modelling days - pictured here in 2004 - and was criticised for looking too thin . She loves horses: Jodie has said she is an adrenaline junkie and loves riding horses, she is pictured here with her brother Jack . And Jodie has faced her own personal battles. She was spotted at just 15 and had an incredibly successful modelling career, starting work at just 16. However in 2008 she lost several modelling contracts after she was accused of allegedly purchasing cocaine and boasting about taking the drug. She has also filled out over the years after being referred to as a 'a sick anorexic giraffe' who criticised her 'heroin chic,' looks. Despite having worked on several lucrative contracts over the years for brands like Lagerfeld and Monsoon, Jodie had always been lampooned for what people referred to as her 'skeletal' size. Jodie is currently preparing to take part in the Channel 4 show The Jump which starts on Sunday. She is up against fellow celebrities such as Chloe Madeley, Stacey Solomon, Ashley Roberts and Heather Mills. She has previously referred to herself as an, 'adrenaline junkie,'  and has an attitude which is perhaps belying of how she likes to live her life. She once said: 'I love fast action.

"This was one of the most poignant moments in modern history. On a bleak January day in 1965, the cranes along the Thames dipped as the launch carrying Winston Churchill’s body passed the giant metal structures on the wharves on its journey from St Paul’s Cathedral. Commentating for the BBC, Richard Dimbleby described the scene. ‘Across the river, even the jibs of the cranes of Hay’s Wharf are being lowered in a final salute, unique, strangely touching, as they bow forward towards the other side of the river where the coffin is going away on its launch upstream.’ Churchill’s grandson and now a Tory MP, Nicholas Soames, was in the family party aboard the launch. He recalled the spectacle of the dipping arms of the cranes, saying it ‘undid us all’. Scroll down for video . The poignant moment the cranes along the Thames dipped during the funeral of Winston Churchill. However, it has now been claimed workers had to be paid to do it due to their anti-Churchill sentiments . The Daily Mail reported: ‘For a week, every detail of the procession arrangements had been written about. And so it was that one gesture, with the added element of surprise, held for many watchers the strongest jolt to unbraced emotions. ‘As the launch carrying the coffin moved upstream, the jibs of cranes dipped in ragged salute. London’s dockers, the last men usually associated with sentimental gestures, expressed their feelings for one who also had a reputation for tough, uncompromising directness.’ But in Wednesday night’s BBC1 documentary, Churchill: The Nation’s Farewell, a docker cast doubt on the spontaneity of the occasion by claiming the workers had to be paid. John Lynch, who was working in 1965, said: ‘They [the dockers] didn’t like Churchill. I think I can speak for most, they didn’t like him. When they were asked to do it, the atmosphere was “no”. They were paid to do it. We didn’t work Saturday afternoon [the day of the funeral], we wouldn’t have been there. ‘There was a lot of arguments and rows about it. The atmosphere was that Churchill wasn’t a working class person. You’d see him with a cigar in one hand and sometimes a drink in the other, he just didn’t associate with us at all.’ Jeremy Paxman, who presented the programme, said he watched the funeral as a schoolboy on television. He said he was conscious of the comment of his mother (who had driven ambulances in the war) about Churchill: ‘We were so lucky to have him, you know.’ He added: ‘As a child I didn’t question the ritual that marked his death.’ But although the lowering of the cranes was universally seen as a ‘spontaneous bowing in respect’ by dockers in recognition of the great man’s role in saving the country from Nazi tyranny, Paxman said it ‘wasn’t anything of the kind’. The flag-draped coffin of Churchill on board the Havengore during his funeral in 1965 . This revelation is a reminder of one of the most shameful aspects of both World War I and World War II: the disgraceful lack of patriotism of many in the Labour movement. Indeed, even in 1965, there were trades unionists who considered Churchill as a class enemy. Some of that hatred dated back to 1910, when Churchill was Home Secretary and he sent troops into Tonypandy to control striking miners. For many trades unionists, the two world wars offered the perfect opportunity to blackmail their employers and the government into giving them better terms and conditions of service, and for expanding union power, with the threat that the country would suffer if the government and their employers didn’t give in. All too often the government did surrender, or pressured private sector employers to do so. This cave-in was partly down to Churchill’s Minister of Labour, Ernie Bevin, who insisted that — with the Nazis about to put their jackboot on Britain’s throat — there must not be a repeat of the havoc wrought during the Great War by militant strikers. Indeed, the Left has a shameful history of unpatriotic and self-interested behaviour during war-time and which was often directed at our war leaders. At the height of World War I, in February 1915, workers in munitions factories on the Clyde had walked out, with industrial unrest spreading to factories in Sheffield and Birmingham. Later in the year, 15,000 Clyde shipyard workers went on strike again in protest at the compulsory deduction of rent arrears from their pay packets. Then, in 1917, 200,000 workers in 48 different towns walked out, mainly over wages, but also over food prices, exemptions from military service and what they termed ‘war profiteering’. Even in 1965 there were trade unionists who considered Churchill (pictured) a class enemy . And so when war came in again in 1939, the many Communists in the Labour movement felt no urge to support the war effort. Their views were articulated by the late Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, a friend of Ed Miliband’s father Ralph, and then a naïve 22-year-old, that since there was a non-aggression pact between Hitler and their hero, Josef Stalin, it was wrong to attack Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, rising to prominence in the union movement at the time was Jack Jones, who went on, as Transport and General Workers’ Union leader, to lead his members out on a series of strikes and who was, after his death, exposed as a paid agent for the Soviet Union. In 1939, he became a full-time union organiser in the car factories of the West Midlands which were being used for the full-time production of tanks, planes and armoured vehicles. Although Jones had been a Territorial soldier, he was a fervent Communist and fought in the Spanish Civil War. While men were dying for their country, Jones was establishing a Communist-approved organisation of shop stewards in the factories of his West Midlands bailiwick. Pathetically, the bosses rolled over and allowed the unions to establish enormous power in their factories — which would linger on after the war and, by the Seventies, effectively kill the British car industry. Overt Communists went further — and refused to abstain from strike action until 1941 and the Nazi invasion of Russia and their beloved Stalin. Even though strikes had been made illegal in wartime, there were at least 900 in the first few months of the war. In May 1940, as Hitler launched his attack on the Low Countries and France, the Stalinist Daily Worker — the newspaper of organised Communists in Britain — described the war effort as ‘the Anglo-French Imperialist War Machine’. Much of the non-Communist union movement, believing their employers were getting enormously rich on the back of the huge armaments programme, saw more and more reason to strike to try to get a bigger share of the money. In truth, however, their employers were having to pay massively increased income tax, corporation tax and taxes on dividends to help finance the war, so the idea of them profiteering was largely illusory. That didn’t stop local union organisers demanding more. During the rest of the war, there were strikes all across the country — in engineering factories, the coal mines, aircraft manufacturers, shipyards, and by bus drivers and conductors. In 1943, workers at a factory in London making tail-fins for Halifax bombers went on strike and more than 16,000 women and some men walked out of the Rolls-Royce factory in Glasgow — where they should have been making engines for fighter planes. A key area of industrial unrest during the Second World War was centered around the docks. Pictured here are strikers at Albert Dock in 1945 . Another key area of industrial unrest was the docks. In December 1943, 1,000 dockers went on strike in Middlesbrough and 1944 was considered to be an annus horribilis in terms of strike action, with lightning walk-outs in many ports at full stretch preparing for the invasion of Europe. There were strikes at docks in the west of England, including Plymouth, in January, over the suspension of 11 men who refused to move to another port and work for less pay. No interest was too selfish to put before the good of the country. And so, it was against this background that the behaviour of the London dockers on January 30, 1965, should be seen and the revelation that they had to be be given money to pay Churchill tribute. To be fair, many trades unionists were disgusted by the way some of their number behaved during the war, and many unions disowned the unpatriotic extremism of some of their brethren. But when one realises the full extent of union militancy in Britain’s darkest hour, bolshy London dockers demanding money to show respect to the great leader who took the country through that grave ordeal is, I’m afraid, all too plausible.","Dipping of cranes during Churchill's funeral a moment remembered by all .

"For most women, having both their breasts removed and putting on 12kg would be a time in their life they would want to forget. But not for 24-year-old Allison Snare. After having a double mastectomy and undergoing five months of chemotherapy Ms Snare, from Launceston in Tasmania, decided it was an experience she wanted to document. 'A lot of women don't want to remember this part of their life but it is part my life and it's shaping who I am today,' Ms Snare told Daily Mail Australia. Allison Snare, 24, had photos taken following a double mastectomy and five months of chemotherapy . In May last year, at 23, Ms Snare was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of breast cancer there is . The Launceston woman decided it was an period in her life that she wanted to document . Ms Snare decided to do a photo shoot in which she bared all – including her bald head and post-surgery chest – in order to show other young women that cancer can affect people of all ages. 'I put on about 12 kilos since my diagnosis, so it was a bit confronting getting topless because of that aspect,' she said. 'I was conscious of my weight but I thought it was more important to get the message out there that young women do need to get checked. 'That's why I wanted to get the photos out there, so people could see it on a young body and know they're definitely not immune.' In May last year, at 23, Ms Snare was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of breast cancer there is. Ms Snare decided to do a photo shoot in which she bared all – including her bald head and post-surgery chest – in order to show other young women that cancer can affect people of all ages . 'I was conscious of my weight but I thought it was more important to get the message out there that young women do need to get checked,' she said . She always knew she was high risk because her mother had breast cancer in her early 30s and ovarian cancer in her early 40s. 'That's what took her in the end unfortunately,' Ms Snare said. 'I was always really conscious of my risks because I saw what Mum went through, and I'd check at the start of every month. 'I knew the risks the closer I got to 30 but I never imaged I'd be diagnosed at 23.' Ms Snare checked herself in April of last year and was fine, but when she checked in May she felt a lump the size of a marble. She got a scan and doctors confirmed that she had stage two breast cancer, and would need to have a double mastectomy. But removing her breasts didn't worry her. She always knew she was high risk because her mother had breast cancer in her early 30s and ovarian cancer in her early 40s . She has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer Bruce Moyle shared them on his Facebook page . 'I basically told my doctor I'm fine with you taking them,' Ms Snare said. 'They were no longer my breasts, they were like ticking time bombs attached to me.' She had discussed taking photos of her body post-surgery with photographer Bruce Moyle, but once she started chemotherapy in July she was too exhausted to go through with it. Then, earlier this month, Mr Moyle got back in contact. She had a breast reconstruction surgery planned for January 22 and so it was 'now or never'. For Ms Snare said there was another important reason she wanted to have the photos – she wanted her future children to understand what she had been through – so she said yes. 'It's one part of my life I'm closing, and I wanted the photos to show my kids,' she said. Ms Snare is pictured with drawn on eyebrows, make-up and a wig during chemotherapy . Ms Snare had 12 embryos frozen before she started chemotherapy, and hopes to start trying for children with partner Dwayne Darcy, 19, at the end of this year . 'I just wanted them to see just how hard me and my partner fought for them.' Ms Snare had 12 embryos frozen before she started chemotherapy, and hopes to start trying for children with partner Dwayne Darcy, 19, at the end of this year. For now she is NED - no evidence of disease - but she knows there is a risk the cancer could return. 'A lot of people think as soon as you're out of treatment you're all better but that's a perception that's not correct,' she said. 'If it does come back that's usually when it has metastasised and it's gone to your brain or liver or bones or lungs or another part of your body, and once it's metastasised it's classed as stage 4 and stage 4 is incurable. 'That's what's so scary about it.' She said her partner had stuck by her side and been totally supportive ever since her diagnosis . .Ms Snare said removing her breasts didn't worry her: 'They were no longer my breasts, they were like ticking time bombs attached to me' But Ms Snare plans to get through life the way she handled her cancer diagnosis – with confidence and a positive attitude. She has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer Mr Moyle shared them on his Facebook page. 'Before Bruce released it I did put a status on Facebook saying a trigger warning, they are confronting images, don't look if you know you'll be affected by it,' Ms Snare said. 'Because my self-esteem is probably at its lowest with no hair, no eyelashes and eyebrows just growing back. 'I wanted to tell people to be kind because I don't think I could take any unnecessary nasty comments. 'But people have been so amazing and so positive. 'I'm glad that I did it.'","Allison Snare, from Launceston, did a photo shoot post chemotherapy .

"Scott Tony Smith, 23, has been jailed after driving erratically with a child in the back seat . A banned driver has been jailed after he flipped his car over a hedge with a four-year-old boy in the back seat during a 97mph police chase. Scott Tony Smith, 23, was spotted driving erratically through his home town of Stanley in County Durham and attempted to embark on a reckless escape after being pursued by officers. But a terrifying video taken on the police car's on-board camera, which was played at Durham Crown Court during the trial, showed how he sped through country lanes before landing in a field. During the sentencing it emerged that the boy was only strapped in with an adult's seatbelt, not a child safety seat. Also with Smith in the MG ZT was a woman who told police she had begged him to stop, saying: 'The bairn's in the car' but he replied ""I know, I'm sorry."" Police began following Smith at around lunchtime on October 29 when he immediately sped up, ignoring the blue lights and sirens, and careered through residential streets. He weaved in and out of traffic, through the villages of The Middles and Craghead, before ignoring temporary traffic lights on red and mounted the kerb as he tried to get away. As the pursuit moved into country lanes, Smith tried desperately to keep ahead of the police car. But after narrowly passing a van at about 80mph on a country lane, his car failed to steady and Smith was unable to negotiate a T-junction, sending the MG through a hedge and flipping it over. The police on-board camera showed the patrol car had to reach 97mph to keep up with the MG and a source said the police driver was stunned that no-one was badly hurt. After releasing the footage last month, Durham Police insisted that the pursuit would have been called off if the officer had known a child was on board. Chase: The chase started after the car, driven by Scott Tony Smith, was seen speeding through County Durham. Officers reached speeds of almost 100mph in their pursuit of the vehicle, an MG ZT . Dangerous: During the sentencing it emerged that the boy was only strapped in with an adult's seatbelt, not a child safety seat . Flipped: After narrowly passing a van at about 80mph on a country lane, his car failed to steady and Smith was unable to negotiate a T-junction, sending the MG through a hedge and flipping it over . Last month Smith admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and a child cruelty offence relating to exposing the boy to such risk. Judge Robert Adams told Smith: 'You could have killed somebody - it is a miracle you did not.' He said the speed of more than 90mph in 30mph zones 'grossly' exceeded the limit. 'The vehicle only came to a halt when you lost control, unable to take a left-hand turn as a result of the speed you were travelling at,' he told Smith. 'It is a miracle nobody was seriously hurt.' Rural: After chasing Smith through a number of County Durham villages, police follow the car on to more rural roads . Reckless: Smith, who was banned from driving, was caught on police dashboard-cam as he weaved in and out of residential streets . Smith fractured a vertebra in the crash but walked unaided in and out of court for cigarettes, keeping his face covered by a hooded jacket. Joanne Kidd, prosecuting, said: 'When the officer approached Mr Smith and arrested him for dangerous driving Mr Smith responded 'It's your fault for putting pressure on me'. 'He was subsequently taken to the police station and when he was cautioned he said 'I will go to jail for this'.' Smith, pictured smoking outside court, was jailed for 12 months and banned from driving for two years . Tom Finch, defending, said Smith, who had been banned from driving in March, made an error of judgment when he set out to the shops and that escalated into the appalling driving shown in court. He suffered from mental health problems and 'is a young man who has limitations', his barrister said. Smith has never had a job and had dyslexia and dyspraxia, the court heard. Mr Finch said: 'He does not have the malice that other individuals that appear before this court with serious driving offences have.' Judge Adams told Smith: 'This is the first time you will lose your liberty. I hope it emphasises the risks you posed to other people.' He jailed him for 12 months and banned him from driving for two years. Outside court, Temporary Sergeant Sam Turner said: 'It was a miracle that no-one was injured in that collision, with the vehicle leaving the road at that speed, somersaulting into the field. 'All three occupants walked away with minor injuries. 'At the time of the police pursuit, the pursuing officer was unaware of the small child in the rear of the vehicle. Had the officer been aware, it is very likely the officer would have pulled back and monitored from a safer distance.'","Scott Tony Smith, 23, was seen driving erratically through his hometown .

"Jeb Bush, the newest front-runner among Republicans seeking their party's 2016 presidential nomination, smoked marijuana in high school – an activity he describes as 'pretty common' at the tony Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He told The Boston Globe in an interview published ahead of Sunday's edition that 'I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover.' Both activities were strictly forbidden at the time – and still are – and could have gotten him expelled. But 'it was pretty common,' he insisted. Bush, once a 6-foot, 4-inch high school senior, was also seen as a bully by some of his classmates, notably one who weighed less than 100 pounds. Another said he was 'a cigarette smoker and ""toker"".' Reactions to the news were varied. A spokesman for potential Republican presidential challenger Donald Trump told Daily Mail Online that 'Jeb put out the least of his substance issues today.' Scroll down for video . UP IN SMOKE: Jeb Bush (2nd from right, in the background) was 17 when this photo was taken as his father the future presdient conceded the Texas governor's race to future vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen . GETS YOU RIGHT HERE: Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, experimented with marijuana at his prep school in Massachusetts . 'THAT WAS THE POINT': Barack Obama told an interviewer in 2008 that he definitely inhaled when he smoked pot, and reminisced about his pothead friends, the infamous 'Choom Gang . News reports of Bush's past pot smoking date back to at least 1998, but his frank admission is new. It's common for presidential hopefuls to 'dump' unflattering news about themselves early in election cycles, in the hope that it will be considered 'old news' by the time heir opponents gear up opposition-research activities. The St. Petersburg Times in Bush's home state of Florida profiled him in October 1998 when he was the state's commerce secretary. 'The academics and the competitiveness' at Andover 'jolted him,' the Times reported. 'He nearly flunked his first year.' 'He began to experiment with drugs, smoking marijuana on more than one occasion and drinking alcohol.' Bush all but admitted the reporting was spot-on at the time. 'I still adhere to the belief that there should be a statute of limitations on behavior,' he said. 'There's got to be some tolerance for our imperfections. I'm imperfect. I was more imperfect when I was young.' Five years later, when he was nearing the end of his first term as Florida's governor, the Washington Post treated Bush's marijuana-smoking days as anything but a bombshell. 'Jeb struggled with his course work' at Andover, the Post reported in February 2003. He 'missed Texas and experimented with marijuana.' Several of the potential 2016 Republican pesidential candidates have admitted smoking pot in the past: . Aside from Jeb Bush, there are at least four. Squeaky-clean moral crusader Rick Santorum, a former Senator from Pennsylvania, awkwardly admitted in 2011 that 'when I was in college ... I smoked pot and that was something that I did when I was in college … It was something that I’m not proud of, but I did.' 'I did and I admitted it,' Santorum added. 'I would encourage people not to do so. It was not all it’s made up to be.' Newt Gingrich said in 1995 when he was Speaker of the House that smoking pot 'was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era.' Former New York Governor George Pataki put his pot experimentation on the record during his first campaign for the office in 1994. And Sarah Palin, the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2008, told the Anchorage Daily News two years earlier during her Alaska governorship that she smoked pot in her pre-politics days. 'I can't claim a Bill Clinton and say that I never inhaled,' she said. College friends of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul have said he joined them in the occasional toke, but he hasn't admitted it. 'Randy smoked pot, [and] he made fun of Baptists,' a former cohort from Paul's Baylor University secret society, the NoZe Brotherhood, said in 2010. Former Preident George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, wrote in 1971 that 'Jebby is going to need some help I am sure.' 'He is a free and independent spirit and I don't want him to get totally out of touch with the family.' The Globe interviewed Peter Tibbetts, a Bush contemporary at Andover,who recalled that he had helped Bush bully another student before he himself was kicked out of school for doing drugs. 'Their target was a short classmate whom they taunted, and then sewed his pajama bottoms so that they were impossible to put on,' the Globe reports. Tibbetts said he is remorseful for participating in making 'cruel' sport of the smaller kid. Bush said he doesn't remember it that way. 'I don’t believe that is true,” he said, referring to others' accounts of his alleged bullying. 'It was 44 years ago and it is not possible for me to remember.' But his classmates remember. 'Jeb Bush was large, physically imposing, and traveled in a crowd that was I guess somewhat threatening to an outsider like myself,' former dormmate Gregg Hamilton said. 'I saw him as a cigarette smoker and ""toker"" and someone that was comfortable being in charge of a group. I was small physically, and small at an all-male boarding school [that], at that time, was a bit of a hostile environment for the kids.' Hamilton recalled the dor, Pemberton Cottage, as a 'sort of a ""Lord of the Flies"" situation, at least as I saw it.' Bush has talked about his Andover years before, casting himself in one Miami Herald interview as 'a cynical little turd at a cynical school.' 'It was a difficult time for me,' he told the Herald. 'I was 14 when I left Houston to go to Andover and it was a very cynical time. The school for all sorts of reasons in the early 70s was cynical, not the same way it is now. It was a very Darwinian place.' Despite the national news a politician with TNC in his history makes, it's nothing new. President Barack Obama famously smoked weed in his youth as part of a group of friends he affectionately called the 'Choom Gang.' Bill Clinton, asked about his pot-smoking past during the 1992 presdiential campaign, admitted that 'when I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale and never tried it again.' The late Christopher Hitchens, who attended Oxford University with Clinton during the future president's Rhodes Scholar year, claimed later that Clinton was partial to pot brownies instead.

'When I was a kid, I inhaled, frequently,' he said in 2008. 'That was the point.' President George W. Bush, Jeb's older brother, reportedly experimented with cocaine during his youth. He never explicitly admitted smoking marijuana, although he hinted at it in discussions with his biographer Douglas Wead. 'I wouldn't answer the marijuana questions,' the 43rd president recalled. 'You know why? Because I don't want some little kid doing what I tried.' President John F. Kennedy tried marijuana for chronic back pain, according to the book 'John F. Kennedy: A Biography,' which drew its account from former Washington Post executive Jim Truitt. 'On the evening of July 16, 1962, according to Jim Truitt, Kennedy and Mary Meyer smoked marijuana together.' Meyer was reportedly one of Kennedy's mistresses. 'It was pretty common,' Jeb Bush said of his pot-smoking days in prep school . FIELDS OF DREAMS: James Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking marijuana . 'The president smoked three of the six joints Mary brought to him,' according to the book. 'At first he felt no effects. Then he closed his eyes and refused a fourth joint. ""Suppose the Russians did something now,"" he said.' Several of America's founding fathers smoked the drug, according to the pot-advocacy magazine High Times. In the late eighteenth and early ninetenth centuries, the hemp plant that yields marijuana was grown widely in the New World for non-recreational purposes including fibers and oil. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison all cultivated hemp. Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking hemp. Presidents Zachary Taylor and Andrew Jackson both wrote letters that mentioned smoking marijuana with American troops during their time in battle. James Monroe openly smoked hashish during his years as U.S. Ambassador to France and, according to one biographer, kept up the habit until he died at age 73.

"A Florida adult entertainment club shaped like breasts is getting a major reduction next month. The city of Winter Park bought the jiggle joint currently called Christie’s Cabaret but nicknamed the 'Booby Trap' for $990,000 this week and they plan on demolishing the structure. Winter Park Planning Manager Jeff Briggs told the Orlando Sentinel that the City Council wanted the 'heinous' structure removed as soon as possible. Bye bye boobies: The city of Winter Park bought the club nicknamed the 'Booby Trap' for just under $1 million and they plan to tear it down next month . Briggs said that buyers have expressed interest in buying the land from Winter Park once the joint is gone and said the city will do what it needs to sell. The club, once known as Club Harem and Club Rio, was annexed by Winter Park a decade ago. Adult entertainment establishments would normally be prohibited on the zoned land, but the gentleman’s club was grandfathered in when the property was annexed into the city in 2004. A man named John Prevatt and his two sisters inherited the land about 50 years ago and leased it to a man who built the 'Booby Trap'. Other land operators tried to make the structure less titillating by painting it white and adding a dome in between the two other structures. Back in December the City Commission voted unanimously to buy the business and then demolish it, despite some who said the city should pursue legal action over land zoning. 'The owner of the property has offered to sell us that property. They were asking for $1 million for it, and we got them down to $990,000,' said City Manager Randy Knight in December meeting. First Amendment rights: The city thought about suing the club over zoning issues but feared that the argument would become about freedom of speech, which the city cannot overturn . Knight said that they didn't want a lawsuit with the club because it would become about the First Amendment rather than about zoning since the business has been operating for years. 'I think we need to be very judicious about why we’re doing this,' Mayor Kenneth Bradley said. 'While some people would think this business in heinous, we also have to support the rights of free speech for other people to do this.' City Commissioner Carolyn Cooper agreed that they should buy the building rather than pursue legal action. The city bought the property for $160,000 more than it was appraised angering a few residents.","Winter Park bought the jiggle joint Christie’s cabaret nicknamed the 'Booby Trap' for $990,000 this week and they plan on demolishing the structure .

It's unclear how much of the house is original; but the laminate kitchen counter-tops and the Marmoleum floors were all recent installations. The colourful house, which has three bedrooms and three bathrooms spread over 1,644 square feet, is on sale for $749,000. The yellow  living room features 1970s throwbacks such as mustard-coloured shag carpets and moulded plastic shelving and furntiure . Fake fires, bold patterns and mismatched furniture were added by the retro enthusiasts in the typical colours of the decade- yellow, orange, green and brown . Shagadelic: The thick shag carpet in the living room was a big feature of 1970s homes as well as the green velour sofa and clear plastic table . The dining room and living room in the colourful house, which is over 1,644 square feet, open out onto the patio outside which has been transformed into a tiki-style area . It's unclear how much of the house is original; but the laminate kitchen counter-tops and the Marmoleum floors were all recent installations . Downstairs both the bright yellow kitchen, with its boomerang formica and vintage stove, and living/ dining room with wonderfully retro shag carpeting, open out onto a patio screened by bamboo. Upstairs, hides a 'secret' rooftop deck featuring a hot tub which is only accessible via a ladder from a bathroom. The hot pink Master Suite with patterned foil wallpaper includes a private balcony and walk-in closet where the homage to the era is taken to greater heights. It is chocked with paisley ties, mustard yellow and green shirts and bold accessories. 'They live like this!' the listing agents told Yahoo! Another new installation, which appears to be of the decade, is the Dishmaster imperial Four, which gives the sink an extra vintage touch . The colourful house features three bedrooms and three bathrooms, as well as a kitchen, dining room, living room, patio area and rooftop deck . The master bedroom has its own private balcony which- of course- is completed with a 1970s-style chair and green flooring to match the walls . The garden  appears to be used as a chill-out area with furniture in a variety of colours shapes and sizes including a sofa, sun bed, garden chairs and table . The patio too is chocked full of plants and accessories while the fencing is painted in bright turquoise and green- with matching furniture . The outside area is completely shrouded by bamboo keeping the colourful and quirky décor a surprise to neighbours and passers by . The patio is not the only outdoor space however as upstairs, hides a 'secret' rooftop deck featuring a hot tub which is only accessible via a ladder from a bathroom . Upstairs is the hot pink Master Suite which includes a private balcony and walk-in closet where the homage to the era is taken to even greater heights . The  patterned curtains, different shades of pink on the walls and moulded plastic shelving, and green in the carpet, draws and chair are indicative of the era which was known for its clashing patterns . Patterned foil wallpaper was scorned after the 1970s but here in the master bedroom it looks surprisingly stylish alongside the patterned bedspread . Each bathroom was decorated in its own unique style and theme, with the pink room (left) featuring a pink toilet with matching patterned wallpaper and towel and the green room (right) with bold green tiles and glassware . The main bathroom appears to have been decorated in more of a modern style with fairly plain walls, sinks and black glossy draws . But even here, touches of the 1970s can be seen creeping in, in the areas of patterned pink wallpaper and clashing green curtains . The walk-in closet, off the main bedroom, reveals that it's not just the interior décor which the owners like to pay tribute to their favourite era, but in their wardrobe too . The closet is chocked full of with paisley or patterned ties and scarfs, mustard yellow and green shirts, bright pink and green dressing gowns and bold gold accessories and handbags . The second bedroom which features a bonus loft accessed by a bright pink ladder is currently used as an office by the retro-loving owners . There are thousands of 1970s details all over the home, such as the wall hanging featuring 'hip' young people dancing to music with the phrase 'In and Way Out' (right) and the pink detailed bead curtain (left) The spare room features a massive collection of Beatles memorabilia, with dolls, pictures and posters as well as a very 1970s orange carpet and inflatable cushions . The inflatable dolls of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr sit beneath quirky artwork, which appears to be homemade . The owners of the house, which is on sale for $749,000, have also amassed a large collection of music as well as other artwork and gadgets from the 1970s . Mounted in front of more foil wallpaper are two hats: a a velvet Soviet military-style one, and a fez which appears to be a sitting upon a speaker . What appears to be a retro red and black barbecue also sits on the green carpet with another of the owner's hat collection sat on top . Finishing the 1970s theme is a collection of boardgames from the era, such as Psychic Paths and Master Mind (right), and a collection of music from such as Dolly Parton .","Loma Vista Place in Echo Park, California, has been restored to its full 1970s glory by its retro loving current owners .

"Smart internet connected sex toys are at risk from hackers, a security firm has warned. Experts say the toys can be easily hacked, allowing people to intercept communications and take control of them. However, the firm behind one of the gadgets said its 'teledildonics' are secure. Scroll down for video . Security experts examined a series of adult toys that link to an app, and are available in male (pictured) and female versions. Several manufacturers now made internet connected adult toys. Most working by interfacing with a smartphone app. The allows them to be controlled remotely, or to download new software from the internet. Some even come with special videoconferencing software so couple can see each other. They also warned that one of the toys even captured video, which could easily be accessed. Joe Bursell of Pen Test partners said the firm decided to investigate the market, which has dozens of products already available and in development. 'Apparently 'cyberdildonics' are set to be the next big thing in sex toys, allowing you to share 'sensations' across the internet, and there is no shortage of products from various manufacturers, and even a social media site where you can get some random who you'll probably never meet to 'drive' your sex toy for you,' he explained. 'If an attacker could intercept the devices communications they could portray their victim as a monumentally inept in the stimulation department, which would be hilarious and tragic in equal measure.' The firm looked at toys from Lovense, which can even use a videconferencing service. 'There was no apparent encryption during the registration process, meaning anyone snooping on the line could get hold of login information,' the firm told Forbes. 'It will clearly be trivial to compromise a user's account and access some quite juicy content, particularly so if the victim is a 'friend' in a shared household using the same wireless access point.' Lovense first launched on IndieGogo, and hit back at the claims. 'There are three layers of security. 'The server side, the way we transfer information from the user's phone to our server and on the client side,' the firm told MailOnline. 'We take our customer's private data very seriously, which is why we don't store any on our servers. 'Having said that, we could do a better job explaining how to responsibly store any recorded sessions, and we plan to do so in the future. 'Encrypting the recorded sessions automatically consumes lots of CPU power and RAM, which as he pointed out is not able to be handled by some Android handsets. 'We hope that when our users utilize the 'record' feature that they are doing so responsibly, just as they would with their naked selfies or videos. The firm currently sells the third generation of female sex toys, under the Lovense brand. 'Using the well-known rabbit design and utilizing mobile technology, we were able to create one of the first long distance vibrators that used smartphones to control it,' it said. However, it has not responded to MailOnline over the security risks highlighted by researchers. Elsewhere, an indiegogo campaign is raising funds for a 'smart' vibrator owners can programme themselves. The firm behind it hopes users will create and share their own code - and can even plug other devices into to to control. The gadget can be completely customised through a 'hacker port' - and can even control other devices. Created by Comingle, the toy is called the Mod - which stands for Multivibrating Open-source Dildo. 'First and foremost, it's a great vibrator, but it is also so much more,' they say. 'The Mod's software platform makes it easy for you to create vibration patterns, connect sensors and controllers, and completely customize how your Mod behaves.' Users can upload new programs to it straight from a special website  with no programming knowledge required. However, they hope that many will create their own custom code for the device. 'If you want to dig a little deeper, you can use our software library to create custom patterns controlled by almost anything you can imagine. 'Advanced hackers will find that everything is fully-documented, giving you full control to build and contribute your own unique experiences from scratch.' The device is controlled from a button on the body, and also comes with a seperate 'nunchuck' for more advanced control. The device has its own built in computer controller, which can easily be programmed. 'The joystick can manipulate power and pulsing patterns,' the firm says. Shaking the nunchuck's accelerometer can modulate the frequency of the vibrations. It can also be linked to a webcam, and analyse the image on screen. The more movement in the image, the more intense the Mod's response. The team has even linked it to a heartbeat sensor. 'A heartbeat sensor lets you feel your partner's arousal in the toy. 'This one is a real favorite — it's super cool to feel the rhythm increase with your partner's excitement.'","Claims that manufacturers need more to improve security .
Devices can even use videoconferencing app - which was also flawed .

"The incredible sounds of an ice‘cracking’ and crashing down into water as an iceberg have been recorded by scientists. In a video, the moment a chunk of ice splits apart from a larger glacier is watched live by a camera and underwater recording equipment. By studying the noises, the team say it will be possible to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice  into the oceans. Scientists have recorded the sounds of icebergs crashing into the sea (still image from video shown). The recordings were made at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway. They used underwater microphones aboard buoys to get the sounds. In a video the 'cracking' of ice is heard before a chunk crashes down . The scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway during three days in August 2013. The recordings were then combined with time-lapse photos of the glacier during the same period. By synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs, the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles, snaps and splashes. Salt water is much denser than fresh water, causing icebergs to float. As they melt in the ocean, their weight distribution can change, causing some icebergs to flip over completely. However, this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface, meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip. When a flip does occur, the consequences can be devastating. For instance, larger iceberg flips can trigger tsunamis that can damage nearby ships. Their research is to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The scientists identified acoustic signatures for three different ways that ice breaks away from a glacier, or calves. An ice chunk falls off the leading face of the glacier into the water below. Then an ice fragment cracks away from that face and slides down it into the water. Or, alternatively, an underwater ice block detaches from the face beneath the water, then pops up to the sea surface. The newly reported findings may give scientists a better understanding of how glaciers lose ice, the study’s authors write, even when icebergs detach underwater - a difficult-to-observe phenomenon. If inexpensive acoustic methods could be used to gain insight into various calving events, they add, that could be important as glaciers around the world continue to crumble and contribute to global sea level rise.
