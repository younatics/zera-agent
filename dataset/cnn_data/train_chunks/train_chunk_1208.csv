"A bin lorry driver was killed by his vehicle after it crushed him against a wall as he tried to stop it rolling out of a car park. The 58-year-old man was pinned against a wall after the waste truck started rolling across the road before it mounted a pavement in South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, yesterday afternoon. The lorry, which is owned by waste management company Biffa, crashed into the back of a Jaguar X-Type before careering through railings and before coming to rest hanging over the edge of a pier. A 58-year-old man was killed after he tried to stop his bin lorry, pictured hanging over the edge of the pier where it came to rest, after it started rolling out of a car park . Staff from a nearby pub rushed to help the driver before emergency services reached the scene to take him to hospital - but the man, who is yet to be named, later died from his injuries. Councillor Norman Work, who represents Edinburgh's Almond ward, said: 'It's a tragic accident. It appears that the driver was trying to prevent the accident from happening. 'It's tragic but could have been a lot worse. We are grateful no one else was injured, because it's a very busy area round the whole promenade. 'Obviously our thoughts go out to the family of the driver.' Waste management company Biffa  said its employees were shocked at the driver's death, adding the firm would carry out an investigation. A spokesman said: 'This tragic incident has shocked everyone at Biffa and we send our heartfelt condolences to the family and close friends. Police investigating the scene of the tragic incident in South Queensferry yesterday after the man was killed . 'Naturally, we will work with the police to try and understand the circumstances behind the incident, whilst also carrying out our own full internal investigation.' A spokeswoman for the Hawes Inn said: 'Our team helped out as much as they could in the moments after the accident happened and contacted the emergency services. 'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation and our thoughts are very much with the driver's family.' Police in Edinburgh are now appealing for witnesses of the tragic accident to come forward. Sergeant Brian Smith, of Police Scotland's Edinburgh Road Policing Unit, said: 'This tragic accident happened as the driver tried to stop his lorry from rolling out of the car park of the Hawes Inn. The bin lorry began rolling across the road, crashed into a Jaguar X-Type (pictured) and through railings . 'He was crushed against the wall by the lorry, which then hit a parked Jaguar car before rolling across the road and mounting the pavement, demolishing a bench and fencing before it came to rest hanging over the edge of the pier. 'Although this is a busy road, with a number of pedestrians in the area at the time, fortunately no one else was injured. 'We are carrying out a full investigation and I am appealing for any witnesses who have not already spoken to us, to call Police Scotland on 101.'","The 58-year-old man was pinned against a wall when truck started rolling .

"BBC workers have been forced to eat with their hands after cutlery ran out in a staff canteen at the corporation's £1billion headquarters. Furious workers have had to eat gammon steaks and jacket potatoes without knives and forks after the implements went missing. Staff have now called for a cutlery amnesty at the BBC's New Broadcasting House (NBH) to put an end to the 'forking ridiculous' situation. 'Forking ridiculous': Workers at the BBC's £1billion New Broadcasting House have called for a cutlery amnesty after being forced to eat with their hands because of a lack of knives and forks in the staff canteen . Writing to BBC in-house magazine Ariel earlier this week, rights manager Martin Freeman said: 'Can the powers that be please issue a BBC property wide amnesty asking for the safe return of all knives and forks at, what would appear to be, all buildings but of most concern to this 'canteen user', the News Café at NBH. 'There appears to be a perpetual cutlery issue in NBH and, by the sounds of it, at other BBC sites. 'Has someone got a waste metal scam going or is it just that everyone is incapable of returning cutlery to a place where it may go back into general use again? Check your drawers, bags and pockets. 'Please god, I don't want a lame excuse, I just want a knife and fork to eat with in the shambles that is designated as the only 'staff only' canteen in NBH - small, badly designed and overfull at most times and sadly lacking in any substantial cutlery (plastic does not count).' The complaint followed a similar plea from BBC worker Dara Maguire. Writing to Ariel in October, he said: 'Could people in W12 please stop taking the forks from the Broadcast Centre canteen? There are never any forks at lunchtime. It's forking ridiculous.' A worker at a BBC centre in north-west London told the Sun on Sunday that the situation was a 'complete joke'. He said: 'A lot of people are burning their hands picking up food and some staff are obviously hoarding cutlery. It's annoying.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Our catering provider is working to ensure that sufficient cutlery is available across all outlets. Staff are encouraged to not remove metal cutlery from canteens.'","BBC staff forced to eat gammon and jacket potatoes with their hands .

"At least 50 sports fans were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament in east Afghanistan. A further 50 people were injured after the bomber blew himself up in the middle of spectators watching an inter-district tournament in Yahyakahil, Paktika province. Paktika provincial spokesman Mukhles Afghan said the explosion ripped through the crowd as they watched the tournament final. Most of the casualties were civilians, he said. Scroll down for video . Afghan children play volleyball: At least 50 Afghan sports fans have been killed after a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in the middle of a crowd watching a volleyball tournament. File picture . 'The suicide attacker was on a motorcycle, he detonated himself in the middle of a volleyball match,' Attaullah Fazli, deputy governor of Paktika province, told AFP . 'A lot of people including some provincial officials and the police chief were there. About 50 people have been killed, and 60 injured, a lot of them seriously.' Mr Afgha told AP: 'There were too many people gathered in the one place to watch the game. Dozens of others are wounded and we have reports that many of them are in critical condition. 'We need urgent help from the central government because we might need to transfer wounded people to Kabul for treatment,' he added. Paktika, bordering Pakistan, is one of Afghanistan's most volatile regions, where a Taliban-led insurgency is waging an intensifying war against the government in Kabul. Today's attack is one of the deadliest so far this year, a time when attacks are escalating alongside a contentious election, the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani in September, and the withdrawal of Western troops. About 12,000 international troops will remain in Afghanistan next year to train and support Afghanistan's security forces. The latest attacks come as it was revealed U.S. President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal. The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed. Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counterterrorism and training mission for the next two years. Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the U.S. and Nato allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country. The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year.","A further 50 hurt after bomber blew himself up in the middle of spectators .

"Distasteful: Meaty Trumps' 'British Nonces' boasts 54 vile child-abuser playing cards . A 'disgusting' Top Trumps-style card game featuring Britain's most notorious paedophiles and child killers and ranking their crimes is available to buy online. Meaty Trumps' 'British Nonces' boasts 54 vile child-abuser playing cards and participants must battle it out comparing attributes such as 'slipperiness' and 'cockiness'. Among the pack are Jimmy Saville, Rolf Harris, Cyril Smith and Roy Whiting -  who was given a life sentence for murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000. Other attributes on which players can out-trump their opponents are 'physical threat', 'offences'. 'nonceoriety' and 'remorse' - for which most score lowly. Each card also includes a small bio giving players a taste of the sick crimes that destroyed many victims' lives - and the game is being advertised as suitable for 14-year-olds. Underneath Cyril Smith's card, it reads: 'Big Cyril', Mr Rochdale, bully MP, glutton, predatory paedophile knighted on 1998, guest lecturer on the QE2, protected by MI5, never charged - organiser of industrial-scale child abuse.' Smith receives a a slipperiness rating of 99 out of 100 and a physical threat rating of 95 - making him a sure winner for any player lucky enough to be dealt his card. The pack features Sir Peter Hayman, a respected diplomat and Army officer who hid a secret life as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange. Hayman also scores highly in the distasteful categories with a 100 out of 100 rating for 'cockiness'.

Among the pack is Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris, above . Also among the British Nonces pack is Max Clifford - jailed for eight years in May for a string of indecent assaults against girls and young women. Clifford is notably scored a zero in the 'remorse' category following his antics during his trial - specifically when he jokingly snuck up behind a Sky News reporter who was reporting on the case outside Southwark Crown Court. When Clifford was sentenced, Judge Anthony Leonard referred to the footage and said: 'I find your behaviour quite extraordinary and a further indication that you show no remorse.' Jill Appleyard - abused by Clifford when she was just 14 years old - has slammed the Meaty Trumps creation. A Christmas advert for the 'British Nonces' game appears on Meaty Trumps' website along with other alternative Top Trumps sets such as 'Tory Scum' The vile Cyril Smith is one of the highest scoring cards in the British Nonces Meaty Trumps pack . She told the Sun: 'It's disgusting, especially selling it to teenagers. I was hoping people would take the subject of child abuse more seriously.' The mother of two, 62, waived her anonymity to speak out about the abuse she suffered at the hands of the former PR guru. Yesterday Amazon removed the game from its website but it is still available for £8 on the Meaty Trumps site and on a website called Brown Cartel. Other Meaty Trumps sets include 'Killer Diseases', 'Recreational Drugs' and 'Tory Scum'. The game's creator Vyvyan Lutyan told The Sun: 'The game is not intended to be fun, it is a grim game which holds up a satirical mirror the British Establishment.'

Other cards that can be matched up feature David Smith (left) and shamed former PR guru Max Clifford (right) Speaking in an interview on the Brown Jewel website, he said: 'There are undoubtedly loads more noncing revelations to come out, I’m sure. 'I did intend to do a pack about the British Royal Family too but I can’t work out a way to make it gel yet. These first two packs really gel.' He also tweeted: 'It is a grim game and a satirical piece of situationist art about the power structures which cultivate & protect paedos.' Several child protection charities have also criticised the card game. A spokesman for Kidscape said: 'The producers of such a disturbing 'game' have reached the depths of bad taste. 'This item does not deserve to see the light of day, as it represents a gross insult to all the victims of child abuse and a complete disregard for their lifelong pain and suffering. 'I would hope that everyone will have the good sense to steer clear of such abhorrent merchandise.'

"'Four or five' terror plots have been foiled already this year, Britain’s top police officer revealed this morning. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there had been marked increase in the number of threats from extremists over the past year. Sir Bernard said there had been ‘a change to the drumbeat’ in the wake of the ongoing civil war in Syria. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the police had foiled four or five terror plots this year alone . The revelation came as the Home Secretary Theresa May admitted the UK faced ‘more diverse’ terror plots than before – amid growing concern over the threat of ‘lone wolf’ attacks by extremists unknown to the security services. Sir Bernard said the police had seen a five-fold spike in the number of terror threats over the last few years. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'We've said on average over the last few years it's been about one a year but this year alone we think four or five and over the last few months again, you'll have seen in the press, we've made some significant arrests which have all been followed by charges. 'We've seen a change to the momentum, I've said in the past that we've seen a change to the drumbeat, we've seen a change to the frequency and the seriousness of the types of plots that we're looking at.' Appearing on the same show this morning, the Home Secretary said many of the groups targeting Britain were ‘self-starting’ and not affiliated to bigger organisations such as al-Qaeda. She said: 'There was a time when people were looking at perhaps just al-Qaeda-related threats that were a long time in the planning. ‘Now the threat is more diverse in terms of the number of groups out there who will be looking to carry out attacks in the West. 'It's also more diverse in that not everybody's affiliated to a particular group, some are self-starting groups and you do have individuals, perhaps the “lone wolves” or the volatile individuals, so we have to look across the board at all sorts of threats that are out there.' Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) were jailed for a minimum of 45 years for murdering soldier Lee Rigby . Home Secretary Theresa May told the Andrew Marr show that the terror threat against Britain was 'increasingly diverse' Mrs May also revealed plans to force give detectives investigating suspected terrorists and paedophiles the power to force internet companies to hand over details of computer-users. She said new laws forcing internet firms to hand over information on IP addresses were ""a step forward"" in the battle against terrorists and paedophiles online. However, she said that police would ""still not be able to identify everybody who is accessing illegal content on the net"". Mrs May said in order to identify everyone, police would need access to the kind of communications data that she had originally planned to include in the Communications Data Bill - legislation that was blocked by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg last year.","Metropolitan police commissioner reveals scale of terror threat .

"Pakistani community leaders in Rotherham were complicit in hushing up the shocking ‘ethnic’ dimensions of the sexual exploitation rather than speaking out, it was claimed yesterday. Parveen Qureshi, director of the United Multicultural Centre in Rotherham, revealed the shocking issue was widely discussed between leaders who were privately ‘trying to resolve the problem’. She refused to name those who kept quiet, but was certain the problem of Asian men abusing white girls was known ‘for a long time’. Scroll down for video . Scandal: A Pakistani community worker claims Muslim leaders were aware of the abuse scandal in Rotherham . ‘Whispering was going on in the community,’ she said. Speaking . to BBC Radio Sheffield, she said: ‘It was discussed, a discussion was . going on in the community with community leaders and organisations and . other agencies who were aware of what was happening and were trying to . resolve the problem.’ No . councillors or religious leaders from the Pakistani Muslim community . have spoken in the media since the report’s publication on Tuesday. Mrs Qureshi works daily at the centre for the significant Pakistani community in the South Yorkshire town. Commenting . on local knowledge about horrific cases of young girls being exploited . by sexual predators, she said: ‘It was not started overnight it was . going on for a long time. ‘It was always discussed in the community.’ Ms . Qureshi later appeared to backtrack on her statement, claiming she . intended to say the report revealed senior council workers evidently . knew about the scandal. Parveen Qureshi, head of the United Multicultural Centre, said the scandal was widely discussed within the Asian community . Some . 3 per cent of the town’s population is of Pakistani or Kashmiri . ethnicity and Mrs Qureshi said it was vital to ‘raise awareness’ with . families. The abuse of at least 1,400 girls at the hands of Pakistani gangs in the South Yorkshire town for 16 years was shrouded in secrecy. Yesterday . Lord Ahmed, who has lived in Rotherham for most of his life, said it . was now up to the ‘mosques and community leaders’ to teach ‘moral and . ethical values’ lost to the younger generation. Bosses at Rotherham Council have tried time and again to stop information about sexual abuse becoming public. After . one report was passed to the media in 2012, senior executives ordered . that ‘document control’ be tightened as they sought to find the leak. The council also considered taking out an injunction against a newspaper, minutes reveal. And . Joyce Thacker, head of children’s services at the council, was . reluctant to disclose reports about the abuse when called before the . Home Affairs Select Committee last year. She only agreed after chairman Keith Vaz insisted his committee had ‘the power to call for papers’. Even former Education Secretary Michael Gove reprimanded the authority in 2012 for ‘unnecessarily’ redacting a review. Lord . Ahmed, a member of the House of Lords who was Rotherham’s first Asian . councillor, said yesterday: ‘I am deeply shocked by these heinous . despicable crimes committed by young Pakistani men. ‘I . do think that there’s a huge amount of responsibility that lies on the . shoulders of the mosques and the community leaders because they are . responsible for teaching ethical values and respect. ‘I . came to Rotherham in 1969 when the first mosque was opened and we were . taught moral and ethical values and mixed with the community. ‘If someone had a call from the police, people would be embarrassed and ashamed.’ He said he was now ‘worried for Rotherham’ in the wake of the child abuse scandal. He . added: ‘The majority of British Pakistani men are stuck between . criminals involved in these problems and a few hundred that are involved . with other issues like terrorism or other criminal activity.’ His comments come amid calls for senior council workers in charge between 1997 and 2013 to resign from their current posts both at Rotherham and elsewhere. The shameless buck-passing between council chiefs continued today even as detectives were urged to finally hunt down the child rapists who they allowed to escape justice for 16 years. Among the officials shrugging off responsibility was police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright, who stubbornly defied demands for his resignation from the Home Secretary. Report: Professor Jay's report revealed 1,400 girls had been abused by mainly Pakistani gangs for 16 years . Under pressure: Shaun Wright (left) and Joyce Thacker (right) are facing calls to step down over the scandal . Even his deputy Tracey Cheetham has now resigned - and urged her boss to do the same. Ms Cheetham said she said she felt 'unable to continue' in the role and added: 'It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign.' It came as Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced that Ofsted would carry out an early inspection of child protection services in Rotherham. Prime Minister David Cameron is among those calling for Mr Wright to quit, describing the report into 16 years of widespread child abuse in the Yorkshire town as 'deeply shocking'. He said: 'I think the Home Secretary [Theresa May] was right yesterday to say, having looked at the report, the fact that the police commissioner was at the time head of children's services, that the right decision would be to resign and take full responsibility for what happened.' And shockingly, the woman in charge of Rotherham's children's services for five years of the child sex abuse scandal tried to downplay the true scale of the offences.","1,400 girls were abused by Pakistani gangs in Rotherham for 16 years .

"Tony Bellew’s next move after taking revenge on Nathan Cleverly will not be in pursuit of a world title but to Hollywood. Bellew put British boxing’s bitterest of rivalries to bed with a convincing victory in front of his home fans in Liverpool. He will now turn his attention to the silver screen after landing a major role in the Rocky spin-off Creed. The film, which will be shot in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, will chronicle the boxing career of Apollo Creed’s grandson Adonis, who will be played by Michael B. Jordan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tony Bellew: I'm off to Hollywood to do a film for Sly Stallone . Tony Bellew throws his hands in the air after beating Nathan Cleverly in their grudge rematch .

Apollo Creed (left) reluctantly allows his grandson to be trained by Rocky Balboa in the new film . Sylvester Stallone will reprise his role as Rocky Balboa, trainer to Creed, and Bellew is set to play an opponent named Pretty Ricky Porter alongside unbeaten super-middleweight world champion Andre Ward. ‘I’m going to Hollywood on December 4 for an assignment,’ said a coy Bellew. ‘I’ve been sought-after for a long time. I hope it’s a speaking part because no-one wants to look at this face if I’m not talking. My life’s going to change. ‘I’ve had the contracts sitting in front of me for weeks because I wasn’t signing them. If this fight had gone wrong I wasn’t signing, I was going home to be depressed. ‘I can’t go into the details but let’s just say it’s big. It will be 40-odd days of filming, I just hope I can do it.’ Cleverly tries to protect his face after Bellew throws a punch in the direction of the Welshman . Bellew’s boxing career might be on the back burner for now but he turned the tables on Cleverly three years after losing their first fight. The build-up to their rematch had been bitter, with both men promising an explosive finish, but it failed to spark. ‘It wasn’t a great fight because he didn’t want to fight,’ said Bellew. ‘I stood there all night and he didn’t want to know. His right hand was superglued to the side of his face. ‘It takes two to make a fight. I’ve given everything. It was so wide and so easy and I wasn’t out of second gear. I didn’t get to show what I can do at this weight, I was at 50 per cent. It was a bad performance.’ Incredibly, one judge awarded the fight to Cleverly. ‘I don’t know what Terry O’Connor was watching,’ said Bellew. ‘I’m going to put a complaint in to the board to get them to tell him to stop smoking whatever he’s smoking. ‘There shouldn’t be English judges for a domestic grudge fight because they see the whole build-up. In their heads, there’s a good guy and a bad guy and I’ve been portrayed as the bad guy. Bellew dodges a punch from Cleverly in the early rounds of the fight at the Echo Arena . Bellew aims a punch at his British rival while Cleverly puts his hand up to block . ‘This was a massive fight and it’s been everywhere. They think I’m a real gobs**** and they come into the arena and expect to judge the fight from a neutral perspective. ‘He obviously made his mind up who was winning before he sat down. ‘You can’t have him winning that fight. When I heard “split decision” I thought, here we go again, my mouth’s run away with itself again.’ Cleverly’s future, meanwhile, is less certain after his second defeat in his last four fights. The Welshman revealed he hurt his right hand and that he struggled to hold Bellew off in the later stages. ‘I caught Tony on the head and I abandoned my right from the third round but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. Cleverly struggled to cope with Bellew throughout the cruiserweight showdown . ‘I’m 25lb heavier at cruiserweight and it’s difficult to carry that for 12 rounds. I slowed in the second half of the fight and Tony used his natural weight advantage. ‘I’m not a true cruiserweight, I’m caught in between weights. Going back down to light- heavyweight is an option.’ Cleverly was keen to hype the possibility of a third fight but in reality this was an attritional bout which was slow to catch fire, and these protagonists may struggle to engage the interest of the public for a decisive third meeting. Cleverly said: ‘A split decision shows how much character I’ve got. Maybe we will have a third fight one day — I’ve been to Liverpool twice so maybe next time it could be in the Millennium Stadium in Wales.’","Tony Bellew edged out Nathan Cleverly via split decision by the judges .

"Nestled in the rolling foothills of the French Pyrenees, market day in the tiny farming community of Bugarach has never been busier. But shoppers aren't there to sample the fresh meat, wine and dairy for which the town is locally famed, they are there to pick up their own piece of end-of-the-world memorabilia. This is because Bugarach - population 176 - has been earmarked by doomsday cults as the only place in the world which is going to survive Armageddon, scheduled for December 21 this year by an ancient Mayan prophecy. Scroll down for video . Mayan teaching: According to prophecy/internet rumour, aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep within the town's imposing Pic de Bugarach mountain and pluck anyone in the vicinity to safety . Modern interpretations of the forecast, heavily stoked by internet rumour, predict that aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep within the town's imposing Pic de Bugarach mountain and pluck anyone in the vicinity to safety. Now, Armageddon tourists and UFO spotters hoping for salvation are swarming to the two-street hamlet to collect a slice of Last Day history. And it is an opportunity the village's shrewd inhabitants are eager not to pass up. Souvenirs include 'authentic Bugarach stones' from Pic de Bugarach's rock-face itself, on sale for €1.50 (£1.20) a gram, and 'natural pyramids of pyrite iron' from underground. Meanwhile, a bottle of water from the local spring, which can apparently cure a range of ailments, costs an eye-watering €15 (£12). One landowner is even offering up his four-bedroom home with close up views of the mysterious peak for £1,200 a night. But for those on a budget, he can offer camping space in his field (tent not included) for 400 euros a night. 'I possess a rare asset, the land of immortality,' he told La Depeche du Midi, the area's local daily.

Ancient Mayans claimed that on December 21 2012, a . 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count supposedly comes to a close. Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, starts counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21. They say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end. Conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field. But Bugarach's mayor, Jean Pierre Delord, is worried about the numbers of New Agers arriving in the town. Police and troops have been drafted in to deal with the sudden influx and stop believers from scaling the mountain. Although many believe this is merely a cover for the investigation of dozens of recent UFO sightings. David, who quit his telecoms job in Tours to move to Bugarach, told The Sun: 'There are serious things going on here - I want to know what these objects are. 'Things exist and people have a right to know.' While David, who would not reveal his surname, said he wasn't sure the world would actually end in three weeks, added: 'I do think the capitalist system is going to collapse then.' But others have expressed anger at the town, blaming it for taking advantage of 'gullible' New Agers. Eric Freysselinard, the prefect of the Aude county which includes Bugarach, said this week: 'I find it really outrageous to abuse the naivety of people and rush into commerce that defies common sense.' The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and will impact on December 21 2012. The French government has even warned of . the risk of mass suicides in the country by people who believe the world . will self-destruct next year. Recent disasters - including the earthquake in Japan - as well as . anxiety over pandemics and economic . concerns - are creating a global climate of fear, which for some are . omens of impending doom. A report published yesterday by watchdog . Miviludes said the picturesque village near Carcassonne should be . monitored in the lead-up to the end of 2012. Miviludes president Georges Fenech said: 'I think we need to be careful. We . shouldn't get paranoid, but when you see what happened at Waco in the . United States, we know this kind of thinking can influence vulnerable . people.' The internet is awash with myths about the hamlet. These . include beliefs that the mountain is surrounded by a magnetic force, . that it is the site of a concealed alien base, or even that it contains . an underground access to another world. Doom: An ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns . Panic: The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and has spread panic across the world . Patrice Etienne, who runs an organic cafe in the village, said there have been an increased number of reports by walkers in the area of cameras jamming when they tried to take . pictures and strange noises rumbling underground. 'We have seen military aircraft, . police and soldiers,' he added. 'It’s like a Spielberg movie. They are looking for . something. There is something in this mountain, definitely.' Meanwhile, panic is spreading throughout Russia at such a rate over the Earth's pending doom, that Moscow’s minister of emergency situations has told its citizens that the world will not end on December 21. Ancient Mayans claimed that is the day a 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count in the Mayan calendar supposedly comes to a close. Many in Russia, where mystical thinking is popular, have taken notice. Some are hoarding everyday items such as sugar, matches and candles, while inmates in a jail are said to have experienced a ‘collective mass psychosis’. The ministry said it had access to ‘methods of monitoring what is occurring on Earth’, and could say with confidence all will be well.

"On trial: Bouchra Bagour, 35, leaves court (file photo) A French court has found a mother guilty of 'justifying a crime' after sending her three-year-old son, Jihad, to school in a T-shirt with the slogans: 'I am a bomb' and 'Born on Sept. 11'. Bouchra Bagour, 35, was given a one month suspended sentence and fined 2000 Euros. Her brother Zayed, who had the T-shirt made, received a two month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 4000 Euros. The case was brought after a teacher at the child's pre-school in Sorgues near Avignon complained about the T-shirt. She and the school's principal were shocked and alerted authorities. Bagour insisted she  had put it on her son 'without stopping to think about it' when he wore it to school on 24 September last year. A few days later the town mayor, Thierry Lagneau of the conservative UMP party, asked prosecutors to investigate. I condemn the attitude of the parents who shamefully took advantage of the person and the age of this child to convey a political message,' Lagneau said at the time. The verdict of an appeals court in Nimes overruled an earlier decision to acquit the pair. Bagour's lawyer Gaele Guenon told AP she was astonished the acquital had been overturned. During her trial Bagour denied the charge of defending terrorism through the T-shirt message. 'I thought it might make people laugh,' she said, according to Le Parisien. The expression plays on the popular French saying 'Je suis la bombe', which translates roughly as 'I am the best'. The back of the T-shirt read 'Born on 11 September,' but Bagour insisted it was only a reference to her son's date of birth. Bagour's brother - who gave the . child the T-shirt was also charged. Zayed Bagour denied trying to promote a message by buying the T-shirt. 'It's the day his birth I wanted to highlight, not the year,' he told the court. In . an interview with the newspaper La Provence in November, Boucha Bagour . said that while she is Muslim, 'there is no message to be conveyed by . the T-shirt — no intent.' Claims: Bouchra Bagour, 35, insisted she had put it on him 'without stopping to think about it' when he wore it to school in Sorgues near Avignon on 24 September . Controversial: A T-shirt similar to the one worn by three-year-old Jihad . 'Bomb' is used in the sense of 'handsome,' nothing more,' she said. However, lawyer Claude Avril said: 'Idiocy is often the best alibi to hide real intentions', reported Sky News. 'The most scandalous thing is that they've used and manipulated a three-year-old child to voluntarily convey the words of a terrorist.' The prosecutor in Avignon previously told the court the family must have known the reaction the boy’s clothing would provoke, reported The Local. 'At some point there must be limits. They are not stupid. They understand the significance of what they are doing,' he said. Josette Pessemesse, from the far-left . Front de Gauche party, wrote an open letter to the court defending the 'right to humour.' It was signed by around 50 people. 'This is the same as qualifying all Muslims as terrorists,' Pessemesse told France Info.","Bouchra Bagour, 35, found guilty of 'justifying a crime'

"The boxer hailed a hero after he tracked down the social media troll who called him a ‘complete disgrace’ was himself suspended from Twitter over a spat with leading boxing promoter Frank Warren. Curtis Woodhouse, a former footballer with Sheffield United, Birmingham and Hull, was investigated by Twitter and had his account blocked on Friday, though it was reinstated on Monday night. Remarkably, Woodhouse has become a troll himself after the effort he put into finding ‘Jimmyyob88’ who attacked him on Twitter after his defeat by Shane Singleton in an English light-welterweight title fight in March 2013. Curtis Woodhouse has had his Twitter suspended over a spat with leading boxing promotor Frank Warren . Woodhouse, upset at being called a ‘laughable joke’, put up a £1,000 reward for information about his troll, whom he located to an address in Sheffield and was about to knock on his door before Jimmyyob88 (James O’Brien) apologised, first on Twitter and later face to face on ITV’s Daybreak programme. And Woodhouse was widely praised online, with Lennox Lewis, Labour party grandee John Prescott and Joey Barton all offering messages of support. Woodhouse, manager of non-League side Goole AFC, admits his football career fell apart because of a drinking problem, including taking to the field against Manchester United at Old Trafford while still drunk. Woodhouse had his Twitter account blocked over a spat with boxing promoter Frank Warren (pictured) The Football League are not too impressed with an ‘unhelpful’ FA selecting December 16 — the date of two Capital One Cup quarter-finals — for their media Christmas drinks. The FA said it was a ‘scheduling issue during a busy time’. Andy Anson, chief executive of England 2018’s doomed World Cup bid, has been conspicuous by his silence since the campaign he led was criticised so strongly by Hans-Joachim Eckert’s widely discredited judgement of Michael Garcia‘s 2018 and 2022 bid corruption report. But Anson has been concentrating on his day job running sports retailers Kitbag, who are in the process of being sold. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is one of many interested in buying. But his ‘pile ’em high’ Sports Direct empire doesn’t seem a natural fit with Kitbag, whose corporate partners include the NBA, NFL, McLaren, Real Madrid and Ryder Cup. Andy Anson, chief executive of England 2018’s doomed World Cup bid, speaks to the press earlier this year . The ridiculous UEFA edict that Slovenia had to travel by bus from their Hilton Hotel next door to Wembley before the England game rather than walk compares with the rather more recognisable Brazil team, including Neymar, making the five-minute journey on foot before their friendly against England. Ed skips Roo’s big day . Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney may have been making his 100th appearance for England, with United legend Sir Bobby Charlton presenting him with a golden cap. But interestingly, Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward chose to spend his day off at Twickenham watching England lose to South Africa. Meanwhile, centurion Rooney’s choice of three favourite goals in England colours seems to change by the day. At the start of last week, they were his first against Macedonia, his first tournament goal v Switzerland at Euro 2004 and a goal v Croatia in the same tournament. But in the Wembley programme, it was the Croatia one, the one against Argentina in a friendly in Geneva and the one against Poland last year. Manchester United Old's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward missed Wayne Rooney's landmark cap . It begs the question why FA chairman Greg Dyke went to the considerable cost of setting up an England Commission to improve the national team when manager Roy Hodgson says after the Slovenia victory: ‘There’s enough players to choose from. I’m not stuck for choice.’ Meanwhile, Hodgson took a dim view that Sky Sports News, granted an interview after asking to talk about his trip to Malmo to receive a special award on the 25th anniversary of his five successive league titles with the Swedish club, never mentioned Malmo until reminded to do so by Hodgson. England manager Roy Hodgson (left) and Rooney face the media ahead of the clash at Celtic Park . Twickenham regulars, whose West Car Park boot parties have been marginalised by an RFU land grab, fear that after the World Cup the whole of the car park will have been commandeered for commercial activity. And they’re also unimpressed about having to go to Kempton Park — not for the horse racing but for the World Cup park and ride that is being tested for the Samoa game at Twickenham on Saturday.","Curtis Woodhouse has been barred from Twitter for posting abusive message to boxing promoter Frank Warren .

"President Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin put on an almost comically awkward show of unity for the cameras today as they made virtually no eye contact and grimaced as the other spoke following a bilateral meeting at the G8 Summit. Obama tilted his chair away from the Russian president who fidgeted with his fingers and tapped his feet. Putin slumped down in his seat, leaned heavily on the arm rests and stared into the distance at the scenic backdrop of Lough Erne. The usually effusive Obama, who is never short of hugs for fellow leaders, did not raise a smile, his shoulders hunched and jaw working hard on a piece of gum. Scroll down for video . Distant relations: President Obama looks grim as Russian president Vladimir Putin stares at the floor during a bilateral press conference at the Lough Erne resort near Enniskillen in Northern Ireland on Monday . Frosty: Obama glances away as he discusses the progress made at the meeting between the U.S. and Russia while Putin fidgeted with his hands . Tough calls: Obama and Putin admitted that they did not agree over the their Syrian conflict as the U.S. arms rebel forces and Russian continues to back President Assad . The palpable tension in the room was evident after fraught discussions between the U.S. and Russia on Syria's bloody civil war. Putin told Obama that their positions on Syria do not 'coincide' but they conceded that they have a shared interest in stopping the violence that has ravaged the Middle Eastern country during a two-year-old civil war. Obama acknowledged in the bilateral meeting that they have a 'different perspective' on Syria but he said that both leaders wanted to address the fierce fighting and also wanted to secure chemical weapons in the country. The words rang out hollowly in the press room as both leaders' body language appeared to show that little progress had been made on the brutal civil war which has left more than 90,000 Syrians dead. Hostile: Obama and Putin's tensions were palpable despite the relative emptiness of the room . Direct engagement: The two presidents have a rare moment of eye contact during the meeting at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland . I'm off! Obama makes a quick getaway while Putin puffs his cheeks and holds his ground following the awkward moment in front of the world's cameras . Obama mostly stared straight ahead while Putin made his remarks, several times closing his eyes or glancing to the side but never looking directly at the president. While Obama spoke, Putin stared into the distance, looked over his shoulder at the scenic view and picked at his fingers. The G8 leaders' joint decision to take a more casual approach and ditch the ties at the summit seemed almost comical when faced with the frosty international relations on show. At times, they mirrored each other's hostile body language. They rounded their shoulders, steepled their fingers and grimaced. Ahead of the tense negotiations, it was reported that Obama and Putin had a stand-off over who would use the gym at the luxury resort - with the U.S. President emerging victorious, according to The Sun. However the Russian leader shrugged off the slight and declared that he would be taking his daily exercise with a macho display of swimming in Lough Erne. Cold shoulder: Obama and Putin failed to cover up the tensions in their political standpoints . The U.S. president said both sides would work to develop talks in Geneva aimed at ending Syria's bloody civil war. With steel in his voice, Obama added: 'We want to try to resolve the issue through political means if possible.' While . Putin has called for negotiated peace talks, he has not urged Syrian . President Bashar Assad to leave power, and he remains one of Assad's . strongest political and military allies. Good talk? Obama and Putin went in for a handshake at the end of the press conference . Shake on it, buddy: Obama and Putin grip hands following the tense display in Northern Ireland . Global tensions: There appeared to be no love lost between Obama and Putin today . The White House did not expect any breakthrough with Putin on Syria during the gathering of the Group of Eight Summit and the meeting further highlighted the rift between the two countries on how to address the fighting in Syria. Obama announced Friday that the U.S. would start sending weaponry, while Britain and France remained concerned that the firepower might end up helping anti-democratic extremists linked to Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. Putin has defended Russia's continuing supply of weapons to Assad's military. Obama's discussions with Putin capped a busy day that included a preview of future negotiations toward a broad trade deal with the European Union and speech in Belfast where he called peace in Northern Ireland a 'blueprint' for those living amid conflict around the world.","Russian and U.S. presidents held bilateral meeting at G8 Summit in Northern Ireland on Monday .

"The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a far-reaching immigration bill - after its chairman withdrew an amendment allowing gay couples to obtain green cards for spouses born outside the U.S. The 13-5 vote clears the bill for a Senate debate expected to begin early next month. Committee approval came after the panel's chairman, Sen Patrick Leahy sidestepped a showdown on the rights of gay spouses, caving to pressure from the White House and others who feared such a vote could lead to the bill's failure in the Senate. Scroll down for video . Heated: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen Patrick Leahy confers with the committee's ranking Republican, Sen Chuck Grassley during immigration bill talks . The much-awaited announcement on Tuesday by the Vermont Democrat clears . the way for passage by his committee of the legislation . offering the possibility of citizenship to millions in this country . illegally. Leahy had been under pressure from gay rights groups to offer the . amendment, which would have allowed gays to petition to bring their . spouses to the United States like straight Americans can. But the White House and other Democrats privately urged Leahy to hold . off as Republican supporters of the immigration bill threatened to . withdraw their support over the issue. In a statement released on Tuesday evening, President Obama said: 'I congratulate the Senate Judiciary Committee on completing its work on S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. 'Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Leahy and a bipartisan group of eight Senators, the legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system.' The controversy over the rights of gay spouses, with the ability to . fracture a bipartisan coalition behind the legislation, has hovered in . the background of the debate from the beginning. Under pressure: Leahy, pictured left with New York Sen Chuck Schumer and Sen Dianne Feinstein of California, sidestepped a showdown on the rights of gay spouses, caving to pressure from the White House and fellow Dems . Solution? An additional surge in immigrant traffic to the U.S. has begun since . immigration reform negotiations began . As drafted by the Gang of Eight, four Republicans and four Democrats . who negotiated the basic provisions of the legislation, gay spouses do . not have the same right to a green card as heterosexual spouses. Sen John McCain, a Gang of Eight member who does not have a seat on the judiciary committee, said: 'It would kill the bill. You'd lose the evangelicals, you'd lose the Catholic . Church, and the issue is wending its way through the courts. 'And so . for the amendment to be included is destructive to this carefully . crafted compromise."" Two people familiar with the deliberations said the White House had . suggested to Leahy that it would be best to put the controversy aside . until the bill goes before the full Senate, and congressional officials . said similar pleas had come from Democratic senators. All said they were . not authorized to discuss the matter on the record and insisted on . anonymity. Leahy's comment to reporters was unlikely his final word on the . issue, and hardly the first time he has demonstrated his independence on . this and other bills. Most recently, he was the sole opponent of an . amendment that passed 17-1 on Monday to make a third drunk driving . conviction a deportable offense for immigrants in some instances. An April 10 rally in front of the U.S. Capitol . brought tens of thousands of immigration advocates, and generated more . subway traffic in Washington, D.C. than on the day of President Obama's second inauguration . Still, a vote on the proposal could create political difficulty for . Democrats on the committee who support gay rights and are also members . of the Gang of Eight, including Schumer and Sen. Dick Durbin of . Illinois. Durbin has told outside groups he will back the change if it . is offered. Schumer hasn't said which way he would vote. All eight authors of the bill have pledged to maintain the essential . outlines of the legislation. A vote to add the gay rights provision . could lead to approval on a party-line vote in committee. On a final day of drafting, the panel also agreed to a last-minute compromise covering an increase in the visa program for high-tech workers. The landmark legislation creates new provisions to bring workers here legally and enforce against illegal immigration, as well as creating a path to citizenship for 11 million here illegally. California is the home of up a large number of . illegal immigrants, including some who protested in front of the office . of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on April 10, in an . attempt to persuade her to support immigration reform legislation . The measure also creates a new program for low-skilled foreign labor . and would permit highly skilled workers into the country at far higher . levels than is currently the case. At the same time, it requires the . government take new steps to guard against future illegal immigration. As the day wore on, opponents of the bill made a final bid to strip . the measure of its signature feature - a path to citizenship that could . take 13 years and payment of fines totaling $2,000 to travel. Sen Ted . Cruz' proposal failed on a vote of 13-5. The rejection was one of numerous ways in which the bipartisan . coalition behind the White House-backed measure demonstrated its command . of the proceedings. Without so much as a roll call vote, the panel adopted a compromise . setting the terms of the expansion of H-1B high tech visas, a deal that . brought Sen Orrin Hatch, R-Utah over to the ranks of supporters. Under the deal, the number of highly skilled workers admitted to the . country would rise from 65,000 annually to 110,000, with the possibility . of a further rise to 180,000 depending in part on unemployment levels.","Far-reaching immigration bill approved by Senate Judiciary Committee - and the Senate will debate on it next month .

"The 2014-15 NBA season started on Tuesday in dramatic style as defending champions San Antonio Spurs beat the Dallas Mavericks 101-100 in the Western Conference. The Spurs, overriding favourites to defend their crown having won it in such a convincing manner last term, needed a late three-pointer from Tony Parker - who scored 23 points in total - to clinch victory. Before tip-off, San Antonio staff and players were presented with their championship rings. The inscription inside the ring was 'Good to Great', which was coach Gregg Popovich's mantra last season.

Coach Gregg Popovich receives his NBA championship ring ahead of the game with the Dallas Maveriks . San Antonio players (from left) Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Parker poses with their championship rings . The Spurs were imperious throughout the regular season last time around, boasting a sensational win-loss record of 62-20. The franchise took this form into the play-offs which culminated in their 4-1 thrashing in the best-of-seven NBA Finals series against the Miami Heat. In coach Gregg Popovich they have someone who understands when to utilise his squad and how to maximise their talents too. Criticisms of Spurs in the past have been that they are an ageing side - but the experience of Parker, Tim Duncan, Parker and Manu Ginobli is brilliantly off-set by Kawhi Leonard. The 23-year-old was the Finals' MVP last season and his qualities on both side of the floor will be a key component to a cohesive Spurs side. Ginobili (right) is experienced and impressed against the Mavericks in San Antonio on Tuesday . Before tip-off the San Antonio Spurs unveiled their latest championship banner . Spurs' likely threats in the West are likely to come from the Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors. The Houston Rockets - who travelled to the Staples Centre to face the LA Lakers on Tuesday - are likely to struggle following the departures of two starters in Jeremy Lin and Chandler Parsons. Over in the East, the Conference is shaping up to be one of the most hotly-contested in years. LeBron James' (right) move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers has made them strong contenders out in the East . All of the pre-season focus has been on LeBron James' move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat. The four-time MVP won successive NBA titles with Miami, in 2012 and 2013, as he formed an unbelievable trio with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. James' return to the Cavs immediately makes them a dangerous franchise to be reckoned with. In Kyrie Irving they have a star in the making alongside James, and the acquisition of Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves only makes them stronger. However, the pressure on Cleveland to deliver so soon is a season premature considering they finished outside the play-off spots last year. Miami Heat will be relying heavily on the talents of Chris Bosh (left) following James' departure . For the Heat, despite the loss of James coach Erik Spoelstra's can still rely on the talents of Bosh and Wade. Miami have contested the last four NBA Finals series and the experience within their squad should see them come at least close to matching that feat again. The additions of Danny Granger and Britain’s Luol Deng means success should continue to roll at the American Airlines Arena. Arguably the team that both the Heat and Cleveland will be most wary of is the Chicago Bulls. Derrick Rose's (left) from two serious knee injuries and the signing of Pau Gasol (left of second picture) make the Chicago Bulls strong contenders for the Eastern Conference title this season . The Bulls finished fourth in the East last season but have been strongly tipped to go all the way in the Conference this campaign. In centre Joakim Noah, they have the current defensive player of the year - and his tough-to-beat traits reflect that of coach Tom Thibodeau’s mindset. The signing of Pau Gasol adds some much needed offense but it is the return of Derrick Rose from injury that has increased expectations at the United Center. After suffering two serious knee injuries the 2011 MVP looks fit once more and ready to lead Chicago back to their Michael Jordan-inspired dominance in the 1990s.

"When it comes to using your smartphone, iPad or laptop to access social media are you a hypersharer like Kim Kardashian, a tinkerer like WILL.I.AM or a  make-doer like Jennifer Aniston? A scientist has researched how we use technology and identified six distinct categories. His work also discovered that as well as Kim, WILL.I.AM and Jen, Blake Lively is a self-improver, Julia Roberts is a typical spectator and Katy Perry fits into the content creator category. Dr Jonathon Hutchinson, a lecturer at Sydney University, conducted the research in conjunction with Microsoft 'because technology is in every part of our lives'. Scroll down for video . Black Eyed Peas singer WILLI.IAM is obsessed with technology and been dubbed a tinkerer . The digital ethnographer started by looking at whether other social scientists had conducted research to dissect what sort of technology types humans are. 'Scientists tend to stray away from that sort of research, it’s a difficult task, it's like trying to dissect a human,' e told Daily Mail Australia. 'I wanted to do this type of research because technology is in every part of our lifestyle, it's connecting between our work and lifestyle. 'I am interested in why people do that. We might be looking at Facebook when we are at work or we might be at home responding to work emails.' The 38-year-old, who is a self confessed lover of Twitter, explained he wanted to know what technologies people are interested in, who the users are and to what capacity they used the technology. Focus groups were set up and they interviewed two groups of 15 people- one group was aged between 22-25 who were full time students and the other set of 33-43 who were full time professionals. The groups were asked seven questions and they included one about if they use technology to create media. Actress Blake Lively is a 'self-improver' using technology to make her life more productive . Dr Hutchinson said that 73 per cent of the younger group used technology and 22 per cent of the older group used it. Australian scientist Dr Jonathon Hutchinson, a lecturer at Sydney University, and set out six different types of technology users . He went on to create six different 'technology types' called the tinkerer, who is someone obsessed with technology like WILLI.IAM,. The music star: 'I'm hands-on creative when it comes to technology collaboration.' A tinkerer is curious about technology and likes to take things apart to find out new solutions and shortcuts. The second type of person is a self improver, a person who uses technology to make life more productive. Actress Blake Lively said: 'I find all my looks for events on this app by browsing all the runway shows. It updates quickly during Fashion Week, I truly couldn't live without this app.' These people are career-focussed and driven to deliver and they carry technology around, which helps them stay connected. The third is the hypersharer - aka Kim Kardashian - who loves to share content. She said: 'I take in excess of 1200 selfies of myself everyday. It ended up turning out so cool that we came up with this idea; a selfie book.' Kim Kardashian loves to share content and takes more than 1200 selfies a day . These people can usually be found pointing their devices at anything they find worth sharing. The fourth personality is the make-doer, someone  like Jennifer Aniston who doesn't care much about the newest trends. The Friends star said: 'I'm really computer illiterate. When I see people on their Blackberrys, working them like some girls work a hair-dryer, I'm just stunned.' Jennifer Aniston is a 'make-doer' branding herself 'computer illiterate' These people have a good personal style, they know what works for them and stick to it. The fifth type is the spectator who knows what is happening in the technology world but isn't fussed, like Julia Roberts. She said: 'Technology is like cotton candy: it looks appealing and you just can't resist getting in there.' These people are normally digital introverts and you might find them watching, reading, listening to talking about great stories. Julia Roberts is a technology 'spectator' she is most likely to be found watching, reading or listening . The sixth and final type Dr  Hutchinson identified was the content creator, like Katy Perry. She said: 'I'm about sharing my life; it's not always me saying 'buy my record, buy my record!' Although I do say buy my record like once, and then I share a YouTube video of a cat.' These people are usually dressed with flair and are working on their next big idea. Singer Katy Perry is a 'content creator' and loves sharing her life . Dr Hutchinson said: 'This is the first time that this type of research has ever been done in Australia. The quiz will be a nice way for people to see what technology type they are. 'I would like to think that I am a will I am but I am a Katy Perry.' Steven Miller from Microsoft told Daily Mail Australia that there's no one size fits all approach when it comes to technology. 'We want to help people find the tech that’s right for them so they can make the most of every moment – as what we want, use and need is so personal to the individual' To take the quiz log onto the Microsoft website. The tinkerer: Technology obsessed, king of tech like WILL.I.AM . The self improver: Uses technology to make life more productive like Blake Lively . The hypersharer: Loves to post content aka Kim Kardashian . The make-doer: Someone who doesn't care so much about the newest and latest like Jennifer Aniston . The spectator: Someone who knows what's happening in the technology world but isn't that fussed such as Julia Roberts . The content creator: They love to create and share and are highly engaged in content discussion just like Katy Perry .","Dr Jonathon Hutchinson is a digital ethnographer at Sydney University .

"The Obama administration's 'Federal Taxpayer Receipt' provides easy example calculations for middle-class earners, but nothing representing what the wealthy pay in taxes. Shown is the calculation for a married taxpayer who earns $80,000 . The administration rolled out a 'tax receipt' web page on Monday so people can see where their taxes are going in state spending, coinciding with the deadline day for Americans to file their annual returns. But while the White House made it easy to see how much -- or how little -- lower-income and middle-class earners pay to Uncle Sam, it made it difficult for ordinary taxpayers to learn how much the wealthy pay toward federal spending. The online receipt was set up to itemized what Americans' income, Social Security and Medicare taxes actually pay for, broken down along a long list of categories. It also provides a handful of example calculations. The White House's typical $80,000 earner who is married and filing jointly, for instance, pays $4,590 in federal income tax. Of that, more than $1,130 is devoted to national defense, another $1,030 for health care-related costs, and $792 to a category that includes food stamps, housing assistance and unemployment insurance. The calculator makes it . easy to see numbers associated with its $80,000 example, along with four . others ranging in income down to $25,000. But . no examples are provided for upper-income earners, despite the President's frequent argument for a 'Buffett Rule' tax that would ensure Americans who make $1 million or more would pay at least 30 percent of their income to the federal government. While taxpayers who . make more than $80,000 per year can consult their own tax returns for the numbers required to operate the calculator, . lower-income earners would need to know how to use several online tools in order to estimate those numbers for someone who earns dramatically more than they do. The National Debt Clock in New York City showed a debt of about $14.4 trillion in July 2011. That number was more than $16.2 trillion as Tax Day 2013 arrived and Americans focused on how much they are paying each year for government spending . President Obama took credit in January for tax legislation that averted much of the damage from the so-called 'fiscal cliff,' but the national debt continues to climb and Republicans argue that the coming higher tax rates will stifle economic growth . It took MailOnline 35 minutes to . calculate the taxes paid by a hypothetical $240,000 salaried earner who . is married and filing taxes jointly with a spouse, using the same . conditions as in the White House's example for an $80,000 earner. That $240,000 salaried employee, would contribute toward every federal program more than 10 times what the $80,000 employee chips in, despite earning just three times as much money. Under the same assumptions as the White House used, his or her $48,287 in federal income taxes would include $11,897 for national defense, $10,840 spent on health care-related costs, and $8,334 for the broad 'Job and Family Security' spending category. The White House website doesn't provide a way to easily determine the tax burden for a given income level, which can depend on several factors including charitable giving, dependent children, tax-deferred savings, and unreimbursed job expenses. 'You deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent,' wrote White House Director of Digital Content Colleen Curtis. But Americans don't seem to deserve to know how the government spends other taxpayers' contributions . National Taxpayers Union spokesman Douglas Kellogg criticized the administration for treating entitlement programs as though they consumed less of Americans' overall tax obligations than defense spending . All the calculations provided by the White House describe national defense as the largest federal government spending program, although Social Security and Medicare entitlement spending is, collectively, larger. Those entitlement programs are administered through payroll taxes, which the White House calculator treats as separate from other tax dollars. The Obama administration is attempting to 'cut data from the spending side, likely to avoid showing how much SS and Medicare take out of the budget,' National Taxpayers Union spokesman Douglas Kellogg told MailOnline, 'with the added bonus of [Department of] Defense spending appearing to be government's biggest expense. 'Workers and business owners who are paying Social Security and Medicare taxes right out of their paychecks are likely not interested in separating them into a special category and pretending they never happened,' Kellogg added. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest (L) wouldn't talk about why the administration made it so challenging for Americans to learn how much wealthy taxpayers contribute toward federal spending programs . MailOnline's $240,000 earning example presumed, as the White . House's did, that the taxpayer set aside 5 per cent of income . in a 401(k) or other qualifying retirement program and did not itemize . deductions. Americans collecting that much in salary do not qualify for the child tax credit applied to the examples on the White House website. Obama spokesmen Joshua Earnest and Bobby Whithorne both declined to respond on the record to questions about why the administration made it a challenge for citizens to learn how much the rich are paying in taxes. They also wouldn't comment on whether the calculator, now in its third year in one form or another, was only intended to help taxpayers generate information on the destinations of their own tax dollars. But in an accompanying blog post. White House Director of Digital Content Colleen Curtis indicated that the administration didn't mean for ordinary Americans to learn about how the federal government spends the money it collects from taxpayers whom the president has excoriated for failing to 'pay their fair share.' Write caption here . 'You deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent,' Curtis wrote. She made no mention of learning how much taxes are collected from earners in other tax brackets, or how that money is applied to federal spending. 'As long as he’s in office,' she added, referring to President Obama, 'every hardworking taxpayer will be able to jump online to see exactly how their tax dollars are being spent.'","Examples provided for $25k-$80k earners, but not for wealthy taxpayers .

"Olympic champion Michael Phelps' girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a shocking admission. In a post on her Facebook, Chandler revealed she was actually born a boy and named David Roy Fitch at birth. As a teenager, however, Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia.

Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties . Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights . Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries. As she explains in a Facebook post, 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.' She then adds, 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' She also revealed how in love she is with Phelps, and how the two clicked after meeting on Tinder. 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says.

It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler posted this image of Phelps to her account as she wrote about how excited she was to see him . Now however, Chandler thinks Phelps may leave her after telling her truth. 'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says.

"Jenson Button is bracing himself for an emotional farewell at the McLaren factory if he eventually learns the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was his last race in Formula One. Button finished his 15th campaign in Formula One on a relative high with a fifth-place finish at the Yas Marina circuit. Post-race, though, Button experienced a range of bizarre feelings as McLaren Group chief executive Ron Dennis has still yet to make a call as to who will partner Fernando Alonso on the Spaniard's return in 2015. Jenson Button drove home in fifth in the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . The former champion waves to the crowd during the drivers' parade ahead of the race at Yas Marina Circuit . No decision is to be made until early December, leaving Button in limbo for potentially up to another fortnight. If Dennis does call time on his 266-race career, Button knows he will have to make one last trip to Woking to sign off in fitting fashion. 'Yes, I will definitely go back,' said Button. 'It will be quite emotional, but definitely it will be the right thing to do. 'They have been my racing family for the past five years and it would be wrong to just walk away from that.'

"Read our brilliant preview to the new NBA season... so, who will come out on top? The NBA should consider playing more regular season games out of America, according to New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire. This season there will be two matches played on foreign soil with the Houston Rockets facing the Minnesota Timberwolves in Mexico City on November 12 before the Milwaukee Bucks host the Knicks on January 15 at London’s O2 Arena. It will be the second time that Stoudemire has played an NBA match in London after being part of a New York side that defeated the Detroit Pistons 102-87 in January 2013. New York Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire says the NBA should play more games outside of America . Stoudemire, who scored 17 points in that victory nearly two years ago, is excited about returning to England but admits a regular recurrence of a trip across the Atlantic with the Knicks depends on commissioner Adam Silver’s decision. ‘I wish we could play in London every single season but again it’s up to the commissioner to come up with that but I do truly enjoy playing in London for sure,’ he said at a teleconference ahead of Friday’s release of tickets for January’s clash. ‘We’re coming to [London] to win I can tell you that much. We’re showing up to win, we’re going to have fun as well and we’re going to enjoy the city of London. ‘We’re going to enjoy the town, the fans and the people there. We’re going to experience the entire experience. The main objective is to win and give the London fans a taste of New York.’ Stoudemire scored 17 points when New York beat the Detroit Pistons 102-87  in January 2013 at the O2 Arena . The two regular season matches follows the NBA Global Games pre-season games in October that featured the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, Sacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs playing a series of games in Brazil, China, Germany, and Turkey. As part of the NBA's effort to connect with its fans globally, its Global Games 2014-15 now includes a total of nine NBA teams playing seven regular-season and pre-season games in seven cities in six countries. On Tuesday it was announced that a record 101 international players from 37 countries will be competing in the league this season too - including Britain's Luol Deng at the Heat. With this devotion to expanding the game, there have been suggestions that the sport could follow the example of NFL and look at the possibilities of having a franchise outside of America – something Stoudemire believes isn’t impossible. ‘I’m sure the commissioners would take a look at that and see how the fans appreciate the game of basketball there and if it continues to grow then I’m sure that the commissioner will would keep a close eye on that. Hopefully if it continues to grow then we’ll see what happens,’ he added. The 31-year-old (right) returned to  action in the Knicks' 104-80 opening day defeat against the Chicago Bulls . Stoudemire has played in the Knicks’ opening two games against the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland after two seasons blighted by knee injury problems. In his absence last year, the Madison Square Garden outfit finished outside the play-offs to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference. Back fit the 31-year-old hopes for a better outcome for himself and his team this campaign despite a tough looking fixture list to begin with as they host the Charlotte Hornets and the Washington Wizards next. ‘My personal goal is to get back to the Amar’e Stoudemire that the world fell in love with. The basketball player that I was able to become as a youth and to continue to improve as a player – I want to get back to my dominant self,’ he said. Stoudemire (left) played 24 minutes in the Knicks' 95-90 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday . ‘There are a lot of individual goals of mine but as a team we are looking to succeed as well. With the combination of both of those attributes I think we should be a pretty successful team. ‘We can’t dwell on the past. We don’t forget it but we do keep it in the back of our mind knowing that we don’t want to repeat that so that fuels us to continue to train harder. ‘We’ve definitely got to try and get a few wins out of that [opening] schedule right there. It’s a tough stretch – all four of those teams are playing well but for us I think we’re still trying to get our identity figured out in terms of offence but I think if we continue to work the way we are then we’ll be OK.’ The Milwaukee Bucks host the New York Knicks at The O2 in London on January 15 as part of NBA Global Games London 2015.

"Being the England coach can be a very lonely place. I can remember times when I just shut the door to my office and had a quiet word with myself. Thankful of a couple of hours to think, I’d repeat in my head: ‘OK, you can do this, keep calm and get the job done.’ It’s an all-consuming job but champions and winners in all areas of life, not just sport, perform at their best when the pressure is at its greatest. England head coach Stuart Lancaster (right)  looks on at his squad as they take part in a team huddle . Lancaster looks very composed during games and trusts his coaching team, according to Sir Clive Woodward . South Africa head coach Heyneke Meyer looks on during Springboks training on Friday . The key to dealing with pressure is to sit down and speak to your team and plan how you are going to react to every scenario. You have to prepare and practise... even how to lose. Do not underestimate the pressure these two coaches are under. Both teams are in a corner and the stakes are huge. Whoever has dealt with that pressure better this week will win on Saturday. From the outside, England appear to have handled it well — something that is epitomised in Lancaster’s consistent selection — and it should carry them home in a must-win match. Stuart Lancaster and South Africa’s Heyneke Meyer act very differently during games. Lancaster looks very composed, trusting his coaching team, but becoming more animated if the game is not going his way. Meyer shouts into his microphone and clearly lives and breathes every tackle. There is no right or wrong, but to make the correct calls you cannot get carried away with the emotion of the game. England’s players will have looked to Lancaster for leadership over the course of this week. The loss against New Zealand will be felt more acutely because England were in a position to win the game and will know they did not perform well in the second half. (From left) Billy Vunipola, David Wilson, Ben Youngs, Jonny May and Courtney Lawes run during training . England fly half Owen Farrell practises his kicking during training at Twickenham on Friday . The players will have looked to see how Lancaster handles the pressure of that defeat. Trust me, players want to know how well their coach can handle the intensity of top-level sport. Lancaster appears to be admired and respected by his players and coaching team, but it is in weeks like this as a coach that you have the opportunity to show your resolve, your strength and lead from the front. Handling pressure when you win is one thing, handling it when so much is at stake is another. I had a chance to catch up with Meyer at the Barclays 02 ATP tennis this week and he and his team were, as usual, great ambassadors for the game and their country. Meyer was on good form, the squad relaxed and philosophical about their loss in Ireland. Meyer really did seem in control of everything. England are by no means in disarray and there is no need to panic. Indeed too often coaches and teams over-react to a loss. But a reaction is needed after four losses on the bounce, and there really is no better game for it than South Africa at Twickenham. Lancaster will have had to take the lead in every session. His voice needs to be the loudest and clearest within the set-up. It’s important that a coach has a couple of people outside the squad who you can trust just to offload a bit. I would confide in the former England and Lions prop Fran Cotton. When I made my debut for England, Fran was one of the senior players and the respect I have for him and his opinion has never wavered. South Africa's stars are put through their paces during the captain's run on Friday . Tendai Mtawarira stretches during the Springboks session on the Twickenham pitch . Bryan Habana passes the ball during the South Africa  captain's run at Twickenham . He could be brutal at times in his assessments but he gave it to me straight. That’s what I liked and that is what I needed. His favourite line after a period of silence was always: ‘Woody — I wouldn’t have done that!’ I hated hearing those words. Things can start to fall apart if you fail to plan for the bad times and just try to make it up as you go along. I hope Lancaster had planned his response to defeat against the All Blacks, it’s his job to be one or two steps ahead of his own team. He also needs to find out exactly who in his squad is prepared to really front up, which players and coaches thrive under this pressure. I’d listen to the media and use any criticism as inspiration and motivation. I would create a siege mentality, knowing the best players would channel criticism and up their performance. ‘England Expects’ is one of my favourite lines from my time as head coach. It really came to the fore in matches like this. The message was simple: no longer were we going to accept the role of the underdog, valiant performances and the occasional victory against the southern-hemisphere nations. Our team, like this England team, was capable of better. The English fans, the media and ourselves all expected victory. And England really can deliver on the expectation on Saturday. This is the perfect game for them — everyone knows what is coming at them today, nothing flash is needed in defence other than sheer guts and bravery. Deliver that and England will win. England players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against New Zealand last Saturday . New Zealand celebrate after beating England  24-21 in an impressive display at Twickenham . South Africa, arguably, have the best and most physical pack in world rugby. They will run directly at you with very few offloads from their forwards. Not only will they try to hurt the tackler, but they are also looking to cause maximum pain at the contact. The gainline is everything to them — it’s in their DNA and part of their macho make-up. Their two powerful centres will look to smash their way across it. I was on the receiving end when I played for the Lions in 1980 and their philosophy hasn’t changed much since. You pay for that physicality in collisions unlike in any other match, but South Africa’s predictability makes them totally beatable. The key is to stretch them. You need to get the ball away from the breakdown swiftly and make at least one more pass after the first receiver and offload wherever possible. The support play has to be through the roof. The back row is crucial here. I’d look for Chris Robshaw and Billy Vunipola to show their handling skills in this regard, keep the ball alive and do not get drawn into their comfort zone. Space is everything — find it, exploit it, kick into it and the raw speed of Anthony Watson and Jonny May will be England’s greatest asset. For England to win they will have to out-think South Africa and be more inventive. England No 8 Billy Vunipola puts his hands out ready to receive the ball during training on Friday . Skipper Chris Robshaw led out his  side for the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday ahead of the match . I want to see new backs moves and for England to be far more creative with their kicking game. I hope to see lots of dummy runners too — because you absolutely know the South Africans will take the contact. They can’t help themselves. I’d like to see kickers at 10 and 12, but in many ways I’m pleased Lancaster has stuck with Kyle Eastmond at inside centre. It shows he’s not being cowed by other people’s opinions. Mike Brown needs to get far more involved as an effective second kicker and allow Eastmond to use his quick feet in the wider channels. England must get the ball to their dangerous runners more often, having failed to do so against the All Blacks. They need to offset the Bok defence and target space. I want to see a tough, aggressive English team take the field and I’d like Twickenham to be more hostile and uncomfortable for the South Africans. I’m concerned that the way the ground is being marketed as ‘the home of English rugby’ makes it too cosy for England and their opponents alike. England are playing the toughest team in world rugby — a home is a warm welcoming place. I wouldn’t be surprised to see yellow or red cards. South Africa have a history of not handling pressure well when they’re backed into a corner. Back in 2002 their entire team lost the plot and we crushed them 53-3. I don’t expect the same on Saturday, but one or two of their players could cross the line. The pressure is on both teams but I feel that England have handled it slightly better. This game will go down to the wire. Who can handle the pressure in the last few minutes will be key. England want this game more and that should see them home — just.","Stuart Lancaster has to show his leadership skills after All Blacks defeat .

"Muhammad Ali's personal doctor has revealed he cannot be sure that boxing contributed to the former heavyweight world champion's Parkinson's Disease. Ali, considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time, has suffered with the neurological syndrome since the mid-1980s and it has often been presumed that blows to the head during his 21-year professional career were a contributing factor to his condition. But Dr Abraham Lieberman, who is the Medical Director of the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Centre, admits that it is not possible to be entirely sure what caused Ali to suffer from Parkinson's. Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali has had Parkinson's Disease since 1980s . 'It's only over the last 10 years that he's had a lot of trouble walking, with falls,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. 'So his course has been more that of typical Parkinson's Disease. If you look at the MRI of his brain it looks pretty good but it's very difficult to factor in what sort of role did boxing play. 'People ask me about this and I tell them: look at George Foreman. He boxed longer than Muhammad did, took many more blows to the head and he's on television selling his cookware. 'I think that he (Ali) has typical Parkinson's Disease. Did the boxing contribute? I don't know. It may have.' Ali's personal doctor said that George Foreman received many more blows to the head and is now fine . Dr Lieberman gave the impression of a happy retirement for Ali - who was known as Cassius Clay before joining the Nation of Islam and changing his name - and stressed that, despite some reports, there is no reason to fear for his health. He said: 'He's had Parkinson's since about 1984, that's almost 30 years, that's a long time in Parkinson's. 'He's in good spirits, he has some trouble walking but overall for having had Parkinson's for 30 years, he's doing okay.' He added: 'Muhammad is now 72 so you can have a heart attack or you can have a stroke. Ali, seen here in Zaire, is in good condition considering he's had Parkinson's for 30 years, says his doctor . 'I don't know that he's more or less at risk than anyone else but anything can happen to you. 'How do people with Parkinson's Disease die? They don't die of Parkinson's Disease, they develop trouble swallowing and they develop pneumonia and he doesn't have trouble swallowing. 'They fall, they bang their head - his family takes extraordinary care of him. 'I could have a heart attack or a stroke and die but I don't see anything immediately that leads me to think he's gong to die in six months or die in a year. I can't say that.'","Muhammad Ali has had Parkinson's Disease since 1980s .

"A naked man went crazy in the San Francisco Subway and began alternately fighting people, assaulting commuters and doing gymnastics. The man ran amok inside the train station frightening passengers including a young woman who ended up falling over in herself in an attempt to get away. Then the naked nuisance takes on a member of BART staff (Bay Area Rapid Transit) as he is chased around the concourse before turning his attentions to an older man who was making his way through the ticket barriers. Scroll down for video... Frightening: This poor woman falls over herself as she rushes to get away from the naked man . Barrier jumper: The man stands atop the turnstiles as passengers rush for the exits . Upside down: Handstands are next as the man jumps across the metal barriers. Some passengers barely stop to notice . In between there are some impressive acrobatics as the man bounced off the turnstiles and the ticket machines of the 16th Street BART station in the city's Mission District. One passenger even kicks him in the butt as he walks his bike along the stations landing whilst another customer is wrestled by the man for no apparent reason. Tussle: A subway worker tried to intervene as the naked man wrangles with an elderly male commuter . Terrifying: The old man is powerless to stop the naked man from jumping on top of him as he tries to leave the station . Squaring up: The subway worker tries to take on the naked man and stop his running around . Restless: Now over by the station ticket machines the man kicks his legs into the air whilst the subway worker looks on helplessly . Some passersby stopped and stared, . others jumped in to help, but the vast majority seemed to do their best . to ignore the unfolding situation completely. Although the man was not carrying any weapons, it's clear from the . screams in the video that most commuters who simply wanted to get to . where they were going, were shocked and frightened by the experience. On the Facebook page of local blog Mission Mission an eyewitnesses provided more details on the incident, . which apparently started above ground where the 'naked man began . shedding his clothes, running around screaming, and jumping on top of . cars.' It took a team of . police officers to shut down the station and eventually wrestle the man . to the ground and wheel him out on a stretcher. After his arrest, the man was taken for a mental evaluation. Preparing to dismount: The man treats the equipment in the subway station as if it were a gymnasium . Back to earth: The man lands on his feet as he looks for his next target . Oblivious: Many commuters simply stroll on by as the man lays face down on the station concourse . Evasive action: Another commuter panics as she wonders where best to run towards . It's not uncommon to see all kinds of weird unmentionable antics on the subways of America's major cities but all of us hope we never have to deal with it first hand. Perhaps more worrying is despite calls for the BART Transit Police and the SFPD being placed during the course of the video, no member of law enforcement is ever seen during the entire three minute altercation. It left plenty of time for more people to have to endure an unpleasant commute through a busy subway station.","Incident happened on May 10th at 16th Street BART station .

"From national security data to secret company information, some of the most sensitive documents are stored on computers that are never connected to the internet. This precaution of keeping such information on an ‘air-gap’ network is popularly considered the safest way to prevent hackers from accessing it. But computer scientists from Ben-Gurion University in Israel have found a way to attack these machines and ‘steal’ the confidential data. Scroll down for video . Hackers from Ben-Gurion University in Israel have found a way to attack computers that are not connected to the internet - as used by many companies to store sensitive data - and steal data. The finding means that some high profile machines may not be as safe from hackers (illustrated) as previously thought . 'Air gaps' currently used to protect important computers could be rendered useless. An air-gap or air wall is a network security measure. It was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the internet or a local area network. The researchers from Israel designed computer software that logs keystrokes. This software transmits these strokes via FM radio signals generated by the computer's graphics card. The data is picked up by a nearby mobile, equipped to pick up radio signals. In the example case, the researchers used a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had to plug in the headphones to get the radio receiver to work. This can be done without being detected by the user, but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place. Since FM radio signals can travel over long distances, the receiver could be placed in another building. A new method of protecting these machines will now have to be found, claimed the researchers. In an experiment designed to highlight the danger facing machines in an air-gap, the researchers assumed that the attacker has already broken into a protected system to sneak out new data. An air-gap or air wall is a network security measure. It was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the internet or a local area network. The researchers from Israel designed computer software that logs keystrokes,  Ars Technica reported. This software transmits these strokes via FM radio signals generated by the computer's graphics card. The signals are picked up by a nearby mobile, equipped to pick up radio signals. In the example case, they used a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had to plug in the headphones to get the radio receiver to work. This can be done without being detected by the user, but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place. And since FM radio signals can travel over long distances, the receiver could be placed in another building. A new method of protecting these machines will now have to be found, claimed the researchers. They demonstrated that a hacker could use it to collect data from devices protected by an air-gap in a paper, which they presented at the IEEE 9th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (Malcon). 'The scenario is that you go to a secure facility and leave your cell phone at the entrance,’ said Dudu Mimran, chief technology officer for the cyber security labs at the university. ‘The virus will send the data to your phone.’ ‘Such a technique can be used potentially by people and organisations with malicious intentions and we want to start a discussion on how to mitigate this newly presented risk.’ Commentators said the AirHopper technique is a refinement of methods used by intelligence agencies since the mid 1980s to bypass machines protected with passwords (stock image) and other measures . Last year, German computer scientists proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans. Using built-in microphones and speakers in laptops, the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft (19 metres) away from each other. They came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘hacker’ machine. The researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a Lenovo T400 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another. Commentators say the AirHopper technique is a refinement of methods used by intelligence agencies since the mid 1980s. It was known that electromagnetic signals could be intercepted from computer monitors to reconstitute the information being displayed. Hackers have turned monitors into radio-frequency transmitters and it is thought that the US National Security Agency has used radio-frequency devices implanted in various computer-system components to transmit information and exfiltrate data. AirHopper has the edge, however, because it uses off-the-shelf components such as a smartphone as a receiver. But the method is still slow, transferring less than 60 bytes a second and only at a distance of between 3ft (one metre) and 22ft (seven metres). This allows someone with a smartphone to steal data from nearby systems and send it to another hacker. 'This is the first time that a mobile phone is considered in an attack model as the intended receiver of maliciously crafted radio signals emitted from the screen of the isolated computer,’ the researchers said in a statement. The university's findings have reignited a discussion about whether air gap networks are still effective and the experts are now working on a way of protecting machines from such a breach. The only measure they know of so far is to lock computers in metal enclosures and within walls that are thick enough to disrupt radio frequencies, stopping the transmission of sensitive data.","Sensitive machines are often protected on an offline 'air-gap' network .

"A Utah soldier has been awarded the fifth-highest combat medal six years after he was hit by a bomb in Iraq that left him with permanent brain damage and unable to return to war. Joshua Hansen, a 42-year-old father of two, was hit a total of nine times by improvised explosive devices during his two deployments to Iraq, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. It was the ninth hit, which happened on March 15, 2007, that knocked him out of the service. As he speaks to a gathering at the Veterans Hospital after receiving a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq, Sgt. Joshua Hansen is embraced by his children Jessie James, age 6, and Trinity Rose, age 9 in Salt Lake City . He was driving the lead vehicle during a . route-clearing mission in Zaidon, Iraq, when an IED exploded underneath . his vehicle. The vehicle was damaged, but he and his squad leader . decided to continue on. 'We were OK, but we knew we needed to get out of there before we were attacked again,' he told the Standard-Examiner. A short time later, the truck ran over three anti-tank mines stacked on top of one another. 'It lifted the vehicle off the ground,' he told the Standard-Examiner. 'I don’t remember anything after that. All I can remember is being on a chopper on the way to the hospital.' Hansen suffered traumatic brain injuries that affected his memory. His mother has been pushing for the government to award her son the Bronze Star in the six years since the explosion. Finally, at the request of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, Hansen was awarded the medal on Tuesday. Deidre Hanse wipes away a tear after pinning the Bronze Star on the chest of her son Sgt. Joshua Hansen . 'By willingly traveling on the most . dangerous and IED-laded routes … Sgt. Hansen saved an untold amount of . lives and military equipment,' wrote his commander, Eric Coulson, then . an Army captain, in his narrative supporting him as a recipient for the . Bronze Star in 2007. Hansen’s 'loyalty, honor and personal courage kept . his soldiers’ motivation high and fears low.' Hansen choked up as he accepted the medal. 'I didn’t serve this country for a medal,' he said, according to the Tribune. 'I served this country for my boys, all the men I served with. 'For my mother, that wasn’t good enough,' he added, referring to his mother's requests for him to receive the Bronze Star. Hansen signed up for the military shortly after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. He served two deployments in Iraq. During his second deployment, he was the team leader for a platoon that cleared roads of bombs.","Joshua Hansen, 42, was left with brain damage by the last IED explosion he experienced .

"A mom who was trapped in her car for 13 hours by enormous snowstorms that hit upstate New York and killed 13 people has told how her struggle to survive became so desperate she wrote goodbye letters to her daughters. Karen Rossi, 47, was trapped under an enormous snowdrift while driving home from work at a hospital around storm-hit Buffalo last week, and feared for her life enough to pen the last messages to her family. Her story comes as the rest of Buffalo and the surrounding areas are prepared for the next bout of challenging weather, as rising temperatures threaten to melt the snow, which fell seven feet deep in places, and trigger devastating floods. Struggle: Karen Rossi, 47, was trapped inside her car in a snow drift for 13 hours. Pictured is a different car stranded by the storms in Buffalo, New York . Trapped: Rossi was stuck for 13 hours until a passer-by rescued her. Pictured is a different snowed-under car . Response: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, right with Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, warned citizens to take precautions against the coming floods . Response: Military police and the National Guard were working to clean snow from roads and open sewers for water to drain into . Rossi's ordeal came in the early hours of Wednesday morning as she drove home from a double shift as a pharmacy technician in Mercy Hospital, South Buffalo. On her journey around 3am from the hospital to her home in Lancaster she got stuck in a snowbank, and was trapped for good when a passing snowplow heaped up even more snow around her, so high she couldn't see out of the car. The snow was packed so tightly that she couldn't open the car door, the Buffalo News reported. Instead, she wound down the window and used a sweatshirt to cover her hands as she dug round to the tailpipe so she could keep the engine running without poisoning herself. She spent 13 hours - from 3am until 4pm - trapped with no way to see the outside. In her desperation she fished a scrap of paper out of her purse and wrote notes to both of her two daughters. Ultimately she was able to summon help by pushing away enough snow to stick a red brush out of the snow and wave it for attention. After hours straining her arm with no idea whether anybody could see her, she was rescued by a passing monster truck driver, who shoveled her out. Shoveling: Her story came as Buffalo resident are braced for severe flooding after the heaped-up snow melts in a coming band of warm weather . Reclaiming: Snow has stopped falling over Buffalo and surrounding counties, after the storm which claimed 13 lives . Rossi offered to show the letters to her daughters, but both have refused for the time being. Thirteen people died in the snowstorms in Buffalo and the surrounding areas. At least one was found dead in their car in a fate similar to the one Rossie narrowly avoided. Others died of exposure or from heart attacks caused while shoveling snow. Two elderly people died during an evacuation of their nursing home. Although the snow is over, a band of warmer weather has stoked fears that the heaped-up snow could quickly melt, bringing devastating floods. More than 650 members of the New York National Guard were in Erie county and Buffalo Sunday to help with snow removal and flood prevention, while hundreds of residents helped dig out houses still snowed in. Rains fell around Buffalo today, soaking snow as temperatures hit 50 degrees. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reiterated warnings at a news conference today, saying: 'Err on the side of caution. You prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and that's what we're doing.' Danger: Falling rain could sink into snow on roofs around Buffalo, making it heavier and putting them under even more strain . Cuomo said evacuation plans and emergency shelters were being readied in case of flooding Sunday night and Monday. As a backup to Red Cross shelters, Cuomo said the state would have shelters at community colleges and state university campuses. Eric Burr, a New York military official, said: 'The focus right now is still snow removal. There's a lot of snow still on the ground and the key is to get rid of snow especially around drains so that water doesn't back up.' Roofs collapsed and some people were stuck in their cars for more than 24 hours when the heaviest snow fall in memory hit areas of New York state along the Great Lakes. On Sunday the National Weather Service posted a flood warning for the area south of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, saying higher temperatures - rising to 50 degrees Sunday and 60 on Monday - could rapidly release 6 inches of water. The NWS said: 'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday. It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns, with the greatest amount of snowmelt occurring tonight and Monday'. the weather service said on its web site. Since the storm blocked drains, roads may flood rapidly, and rivers and creeks could also flood over their banks, the weather service said. Emergency workers had 180,000 sandbags at the ready for flood prevention. 'It is warming up already, it's in the 40s right now and based on the temps we've been dealing with, it's pretty balmy,' Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said Sunday morning.","Karen Rossi, 47, was trapped under snowdrift in near Buffalo Wednesday .

"Ed Miliband's chances of getting into Downing Street have been damaged as he struggled to draw a line under Labour's snobbery row, a senior member of his frontbench warned yesterday. The embattled leader was accused of being out of touch by his own MPs as party figures publicly feuded over his handling of the Rochester by-election crisis. Mr Miliband also faced a series of stinging attacks from his senior colleagues, including claims he had made the situation worse. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband's (left) chances of getting into Downing Street have been damaged by the row over Emily Thornberry's (right) sneering tweet, a senior member of his frontbench warned yesterday . Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the Labour leader had been right to sack his close ally Emily Thornberry – but suggested the row had weakened his election chances. Miss Reeves said the shadow attorney general been 'condescending and disrespectful' when she posted a tweet that appeared to sneer at a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags. 'I think it's right that she's no longer in her job because what she was suggesting doesn't represent the ethos and the values of the Labour Party,' she told the BBC's Sunday Politics. 'I was angry when I saw it because I'm working hard, as are other Labour MPs and activists, trying to get a Labour government back in six months' time and she set that process back.' However, former Labour minister Diane Abbott led the revolt against Mr Miliband, saying he had over-reacted by getting rid of the frontbencher. Former Labour minister Diane Abbott said Miliband had over-reacted and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the row had weakened his election chances . 'I think he made a mistake sacking her because apart from anything else it implied she had said something about the man's house, which she hadn't,' she told Sky News. 'But more important I think it made it a bigger story than it otherwise would have been.' Meanwhile, another senior MP said the episode showed Mr Miliband needed to tear down his 'Berlin Wall' of north London liberal allies and reconnect with normal voters if he wants to win the election. Frank Field said Mr Miliband was right to fire Miss Thornberry, who lives in a £3million home in her Islington South and Finsbury constituency. 'Ed's trying to move us on immigration and welfare and with one blast of a tweet she wrecks that and puts us back to square one,' he told the Sunday Times. Mr Field added: 'It's the north London set we've got to control. They are a Berlin Wall trying to prevent us reaching out to our voters and like the Berlin Wall they've got to be demolished.' Gordon Brown is to announce 'within days' that he is stepping down as an MP at the next general election, sources said yesterday. The ex-Premier is said to be planning to focus on his international charity work. He is a UN Special Envoy for Global Education. Mr Brown is credited with saving the Union by giving a barnstorming speech against Scottish independence the day before this year's referendum. An ally told the Sunday Mirror: 'He wants to go out on a high after salvaging the campaign to keep the UK together. He will focus on his charity work.'

"Arsene Wenger wore that haunted look - even more so than usual. Every picture of the Frenchman on the Emirates Stadium touchline as his Arsenal side were humbled by a vulnerable but voracious Manchester United was a snapshot of inner turmoil and despair. He was riled and restless, pacing up and down like an innocent prisoner thrown into a cell. The arms were locked and folded, a stance that said 'none of you are doing what I told you.' Arsene Wenger wore a horrified expression during Arsenal's surprise home defeat to Manchester United . The Frenchman spent much of Saturday's game stood on the touchline with his arms folded . Occasionally, he tried to make a frantic point or gesture as his team squandered their chances . Wenger cut an aloof figure even on the crowded bench as Arsenal missed chance after chance . Occasionally, his arms would lash out, his fingers jabbing out but the point lost in the cold November air. And when Wayne Rooney doubled United's lead with five minutes remaining, sealing a most unlikely victory, Wenger clawed at his forehead, his face a mask of horror. This was not how it was meant to be. Wenger had waited a hell of a long time to beat United and this was their best chance in years. Louis van Gaal's side were a wounded animal, drained of strength by a nightmare injury list and bruised by bad results that had dented their old confidence. But the beast still had its claws and Wenger's agonising wait goes on. To be precise, it is now 1,302 days since Arsenal last beat United. That last success was on May 1, 2011 - eight meetings ago - when Aaron Ramsey scored the decisive goal and Arsenal beat Sir Alex Ferguson's team. Even that was inconsequential - United still wrapped up the title a week later and Arsenal finished fourth, something they've made a habit of doing since. Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla react as they prepare to restart after Rooney's second goal . Kieran Gibbs is left grounded after an unfortunate own goal gave United the lead after 56 minutes . Wayne Rooney's late second wrapped up an unlikely victory for injury-ravaged Man United . United boss Louis van Gaal set up his team to be tenacious and dangerous on the break, to good effect . And there's a very good reason why they keep coming fourth. It is 1,122 days since they last defeated Chelsea and 838 since they beat Manchester City in the league. Going back to the season after the Invincibles, Arsenal's record against City, United and Chelsea reads: Played 63 Won 17 Drawn 17 Lost 29 For 65 Against 99. This means they have taken 68 points from a possible 189 against the three leading title contenders during the last decade. They simply don't perform in the big games. Taking City out of the equation, they have won just eight of their last 42 matches against United and Chelsea. It is pertinent to mention that fantastic team of 2003-2004 because Wenger still seems to be dining out on it. The decade since has been one of perpetual disappointment and 10 years is a tremendously long time in this game. He simply wouldn't still be in his post at most other clubs. Aaron Ramsey fires home the winner the last time Arsenal beat United back in May 2011 . Jack Wilshere and Laurent Koscielny trudge off after Arsenal's loss at Old Trafford last season . Arsenal's 8-2 loss at United in August 2011 was the most humiliating of their poor results against them . Beating the likes of Burnley and Crystal Palace is all well and good but Arsenal - and Wenger - have failed in the important, season-defining contests for far too long. With 17 points from their opening 12 matches, this is Arsenal's worst ever start in the Premier League and it is remarkable the Arsenal faithful aren't in open mutiny. With Jurgen Klopp, long mooted as Wenger's successor, admitting for the first time this week that he will listen to offers from England, change must surely be afoot. While Wenger retains plenty of loyalists, there is a groundswell of opinion, especially amongst the Arsenal Twitterati, that he can take them no further than fourth and fresh ideas and fresh energy is required. Ideas, or the lack of them, certainly came into it against United. Wenger and Jose Mourinho square up on the touchline during Chelsea's 2-0 win earlier this season . Chelsea's Andre Schurrle celebrates scoring the second of their six goals against Arsenal last season . Sergio Aguero puts Manchester City ahead at the Emirates earlier in the season . Arsenal were humbled 6-3 at the Etihad last season as they failed to compete with Man City . As Wenger said afterwards: 'It was a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it's a long time since we have dominated games against Manchester United like we did today.' True, but why then did they lose? Arsenal were naive in underestimating a well below-strength opposition and horrendously profligate in front of goal. They enjoyed 61 per cent of the ball and created 23 chances, something unheard of against United teams of old. Yet they scored just once, in the fifth minute of injury time when the contest was over. It was painfully evident that Wenger didn't know where to position Danny Welbeck, who had a point to prove against his former club, switching him from out wide to in the middle and then back out wide and then back to the middle - all during the first-half. It was the kind of slapstick that Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of Dumb and Dumber sat in the stands, would have been proud of. Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp has been linked with a move to Arsenal . Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, stars of the film Dumb and Dumber, are interviewed at the Emirates . Danny Welbeck's effectiveness was curbed by continually being switched from the middle to a wide position . Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez should have been tormenting an inexperienced back-line of Tyler Blackett and Patrick McNair but seemed to fade on the big occasion. Jack Wilshere was more effective going forward but could easily have seen red for his sticking his head into Marouane Fellaini's chin. Wenger will pray his latest injury isn't serious. That it took a wasteful Arsenal 95 minutes to breach United's back line said it all. Wenger looked anguished at the final whistle, what should have been a comfortable win ending in a defeat and he knew he had no excuses. That's something that could be applied to his tenure as a whole. He's benefited from a patient hierarchy and plenty of cash, especially of late, and yet Arsenal continue to tread water. The excuses have dried up. The clock is ticking.","Arsene Wenger's record against leading clubs is very poor .

"Former glamour model Peta Todd was left disappointed but unhurt after crashing on the first competitive day of the 2014 World Rally Championship season finale in Wales. Todd, married to Tour de France superstar Mark Cavendish, teamed up with Tony Jardine, the Sky Sports F1 pundit, to take part in the Wales Rally GB. However, after coming through the opening stages in treacherous conditions the Help for Heroes patron's Mitsubishi Evo IX collided with a log pile on the inside of a right corner, collapsing the front right wheel and effectively ending the Prospeed team's race. VIDEO Scroll down for A look at the very best of model and driver Peta Todd on Instagram . Peta Todd posted this picture to Twitter of her looking unhappy following her accident . Todd partnered Sky F1 pundit Tony Jardine to race in the Wales Rally GB . The pair were involved in an accident after their car collided with a log pile but neither was injured . The Prospeed team hope to have the car's front end repaired in time to race on Saturday . Fortunately, neither Todd or Jardine were injured in the incident. The car suffered major damage to the front right corner as well as a smashed front windscreen, and after the fans helped to move the car to safety from the middle of the track, they were towed off the stage. Jardine stressed that the accident was not his partner's fault but had come from his own error. 'It was totally my fault. The stage was drying out and I was trying to go quicker. I took a downhill corner in fifth gear and lost the back of the car. As a result we swung into the logs, which cut into the front of the chassis. But the main thing of course is that Peta and I were unharmed, and the marshals did a fantastic job of getting us and the car to safety. 'It won't be easy, but hopefully the ProSpeed guys can get us back out on stage tomorrow.' Todd tied the knot with  Mark Cavendish, pictured together at the BBC Sports Personalty of the Year Awards,  in 2012 . The car's problems were not diagnosed as terminal, meaning a race against time to replace and rebuild the front end before it can be re-entered tomorrow. Todd was clearly very disappointed after the crash, although she is hopeful that she can get back in contention. 'We're both gutted but the most important thing is that neither of us is injured. Tony took the corner a little tight and clipped a log pile which flung the back end out but he did amazingly well to control the car and prevent us from going in to a huge ditch the other side. 'The damage meant that Tony couldn't open his door and had to climb out of my side. Initially I must admit I thought that was the end of our entire rally, but thankfully the team are hard at work and positive that we will be competing tomorrow. 'We were both a bit shaken up, but if the car's fixed I want to go out again tomorrow.' Jardine, who competed with Amy Williams last year, and Todd will race at the World Rally Championship finale .

"Click here to read Matt Barlow's report from Selhurst Park. Brendan Rodgers admitted he is fighting to save his job after Liverpool’s disastrous 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace. Rodgers admitted he has held talks with his club's American owners over a dramatic slump in form that has left them 18 points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea. Former Liverpool defender and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was scathing in his assessment of the performance and labelled the team ‘mentally, physically weak’, adding that they lack ‘leadership’.

Jamie Carragher was left disappointed as Liverpool capitulated away at Crystal Palace . Click here to read Neil Ashton's ratings from Selhurst Park. Rodgers, who later hinted at issues within the dressing room, admitted: ‘I’m not arrogant enough to think I am safe from anything. ‘Any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results, particularly after the way we have been developing as a club. ‘I have great communication with the owners. We’ve been honest enough with each other and we have to get results. ‘You have to perform. Owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field. ‘Barring this period, our development has been very good and fast. But there's no doubt you have to get results. ‘That will support the confidence to the owners, and you take it from there. I will only ever do my best. ‘The best has seen us develop well. Now I must fight even harder. The full responsibility comes down to me. Martin Skrtel (left) and Raheem Sterling look dejected after Liverpool again blew a lead in south London . Joe Ledley and Dwight Gayle celebrate after Palace took a lead they would not relinquish . The Reds boss hinted at issues within the dressing room after another defeat in the league . ‘Now I have to fight even harder and take the responsibility. As manager, the responsibility comes down to me and any pressure comes on to me.’ Liverpool took the lead inside two minutes when Rickie Lambert, in the team because Mario Balotelli apparently has a groin injury, beat Julian Speroni. Dwight Gayle, who scored twice in the famous 3-3 draw at Selhurst Park against Liverpool last season, equalised for Palace in the first half. Joe Ledley put Palace in front and captain Mile Jedinak scored a sensational free-kick to finish the visitors off. Carragher, who was critical of the Liverpool team after their failure to hold on to a 3-0 lead here last season, was brutal in his assessment. The Anfield legend said: ‘Something's not right, they're getting bullied out of games. At the end of last season, when they came here, we said they were mentally, physically weak - same again. Nothing's changed. ‘No matter the £120million spent on players, [Luis] Suarez has gone - so what? Suarez has gone. They are still mentally weak, there is no leadership on the pitch. ‘As a Liverpool fan, which I am - I don't care about being neutral on TV - what I'm saying is as a fan when you're watching your own team, the worst thing you can ever be throwing at your own team or think of them is they are being bullied or being weak and that's what we've seen today from Liverpool, and not for the first time. Mile Jedinak steps up to deliver the killer blow to Liverpool as the visitors lost 3-1 against Crystal Palace . Martin Skrtel was criticised by Carragher for his handling of Palace striker Gayle late in the game . Rodgers endured another damp ending to a weekend as he watched his side capitulate . ‘It has been going on all season and we're saying, “New players, give them time to adjust” - I'm not a big believer in that. ‘I've never moved club, and when a foreign player comes in it takes a bit of time to adapt but we're getting to the stage now where you want to start seeing performances. ‘Liverpool aren't getting beat by quality, they're getting bullied. They're getting beaten by enthusiasm from Crystal Palace.’ Rodgers faces another massive test in the Champions League this week when they travel to Bulgaria to face Ludogorets before returning to England to face Stoke City at Anfield. He also hinted at issues within the dressing room after the departure of Luis Suarez last summer. The Liverpool manager said: ‘We've been a very close group for a couple of years, but we had to make the changes and bring players in. The group was very thin. ‘We're in another transition phase, but whatever phase it is we have to do better than that. We've brought in very good players.’ The injured Mario Balotelli (second right) spent Saturday night watching the boxing at Liverpool's Echo Arena . VIDEO Rodgers shoulders blame for defeat . Rodgers, who came within two points of landing the Premier League title last season, admitted confidence is low. He added: ‘Palace have a simple game-plan, to concede the ball and play on the counter-attack. What we've got as a model of a football club is to bring in young players. ‘This is a group doing their best, but they're just not quite firing. Their confidence is low. ‘But we need to find a way. They're very talented players, but it's been a new phase this season: a lot of games, a lot less preparation time in terms of coaching, key injuries. ‘It's my responsibility as the manager, ultimately. I put the team out there, the best team to win us the game.' Rodgers also replied abruptly when he was quizzed about Mario Balotelli’s presence at the Liverpool Arena on Saturday night to watch the boxing. Balotelli missed the clash with injury. The Liverpool manager added: ‘He came back from the Italian squad and the groin was still sore. We'll assess that over the next few days. ‘He was obviously free. No issue. He wasn't out too late and he was in for treatment.’","Liverpool lost 3-1 at Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon .

"This is not a picture referee Mark Clattenburg is likely to be sharing with his friends and colleagues. Dirk Kuyt, who has been linked with a return to the Premier League with Southampton, tweeted a picture showing off his Kung Fu skills on Wednesday. And the sight of the flying Dutchman may well have stirred up unhappy memories for Clattenburg.

With a list ranging from former sporting heroes to ITV 2 (or is it ITV BE these days?) regulars, there seems to be plenty of scope to draw in viewers. One such sporting hero is Carl Fogarty, and Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the former Superbike champion . VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Carl Fogarty take part in the snake trial in I'm a Celeb!

Behave yourself. 'Foggy' is a four-time World Superbike champion, dominating the sport in the 1990s with title wins in 1994, 1995, 1998 and 1999. The 49-year-old was also runner-up in 1997 and 1993. Where has he been since the turn of the millennium? Unfortunately, after a promising start to the 2000 season and looking in a good position to win a fifth title on his much loved Ducati, Foggy crashed heavily during the fourth round at Australia's Phillip Island which prematurely ended his racing career. Fogarty won four World Superbike championships in the 1990s as he dominated the sport . Foggy waves the Union Flag after winning the WSB Championship at Donnington Park on his Ducati . I see, very unfortunate. Was his whole career spent winning WSB titles on a Ducati? In between his title wins, Foggy had a year at Honda in 1996 where despite struggling he still managed to win four races. The Brit enjoyed success in other disciplines too, winning Formula One TT championships in the 1980s as well as the World Endurance Championship in 1992 - winning the Le Mans 24 race in the same year (the two wheel version, obviously.) As well as a handful of MotoGP starts where he had a best finish of sixth, he also triumphed in the Isle of Man TT.

The Isle of Man TT?! No wonder he barley flinched when he came up against snakes - it's fair to say he is a celebrated British sporting hero then? You said it. Even before he won his third and fourth WSB titles he was awarded an MBE in the 1998 New Years' Honours list. His abrasive up front character reflects an aggressive approach, but even Foggy has admitted in recent times he is not as mentally tough as many would think. So what's he been up to since? Apart from putting up with Bush Tucker trials and Gemma Collins' snoring? Fogarty started his own WSB team, Foggy Petronas, in 2001 which ran for five years and achieved a couple of podium finishes before folding.

"President Obama made a secret pact with the Clintons where he agreed to endorse Hillary in a 2016 run for the White House - in exchange for Bill's seal of approval during his re-election campaign last year. The explosive revelations are made in an exposé published this week on the Obama administration. It also claims that no love was lost between Bill Clinton and Obama before the deal was brokered. According to campaign sources quoted in The Amateur by Edward Klein, Bill Clinton tried to have Hillary challenge Obama for the presidency during his last term. The pact: Bill Clinton agreed to endorse Barack Obama during his second run for the White House... in return for the same favor for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to an explosive new book . At a meeting in their home town of Chappaqua, New York, Bill complained that Obama was ineffective in the Oval Office, calling him 'incompetent' and an 'amateur', according to the New York Post. Obama returned the hostile sentiment and had already frozen former president Clinton out of the Democratic campaign in 2008. However, the President's tactics reportedly changed when support dropped in 2012 and chief strategists advised that Bill Clinton's endorsement could give Obama a boost with dubious voters. Subsequently at the 2012 Democratic . National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bill Clinton . officially nominated the sitting President for re-election. Frosty: President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012. According to a new exposé, each agreed to endorse each other at strategic points in their political careers behind the scenes . Scathing: The latest exposé on Obama's two terms in the Oval Office . Obama was nominated unanimously by the 5,556 delegates of the convention. Clinton's 11th-hour support for Obama came with the condition that his wife would have the President's support in 2016. However, the book then claims that Obama began to reconsidered this idea - enraging Bill Clinton. The reported culmination of the behind-the-scenes wranglings was an on-camera love-fest nterview with Obama and Hillary Clinton when the Secretary of State stepped down in January. The pair lavished compliments on one another as they gave a rare joint interview. Obama said during the interview that he considers Mrs Clinton ‘a strong friend’ and she described their relationship as ‘very warm, close’. More than anything, their camaraderie and grins appeared to show that time had healed the bitter rift from when they faced off in the Democratic primary leading up to the 2008 election. The ongoing tension between Obama and Bill Clinton has been well-documented. During the election campaign in 2012, Clinton said Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's business career was 'sterling' and criticized the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's background at the private equity firm Bain Capital. Hail to the chief: Bill Clinton bows to President Obama as he walks on to the stage following Clinton's endorsement at the Democratic Convention last year . Best of friends: Clinton's speech saw a boost in voter approval for Obama at at time when his campaign was flagging . Around that time, he caused more headaches for the Obama administration when he said he favored the extension of all of George W Bush's tax cuts. Obama has campaigned on repealing the cuts for the richest Americans. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Clinton made headlines for calling the premise of Obama's campaign, his opposition to the Iraq War, 'the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen'. However, by the time it came to the Democratic convention four years later, former president Bill Clinton delivered a rousing, rollicking speech and an impassioned plea for Americans to vote. The former occupant of the White House from 1993 to 2001 declared that Obama was ‘a man cool on the outside but burning for America on the inside’. He went on: ‘A man who believes we can build a new American Dream economy driven by innovation and creativity, education and cooperation. A man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama.'

"Many long-haul flight times will be dramatically reduced as planes are allowed to take a short cut over the North Pole. Changes in aviation rules, which apply to twin-engine jets such as a Boeing 777, will mean passengers can reach exotic destinations without making a stop. During the flights passengers will be treated to stunning views of the Arctic. Shorter flights: A British Airways Boeing 777 which will be able to take a 'short cut' over the North pole . The decision to allow the flights, dubbed Santa’s short cut, is likely to cut flight prices, open up new destinations and reduce emissions. Until now, regulators have insisted the jets must always be within three hours of a suitable place to land. This is because the failure of one engine on such a plane is potentially far more serious than for one with three or four. However, due to safety improvements the jets can now be five-and-a-half . hours from a suitable landing spot. Travellers boarding flights from .

The changes mean that other routes which have not been flown before can be used. This will reduce the flight time to Anchorage in Alaska from 16 hours to eight because pilots will no longer have to fly via Seattle. As a result, Boeing 777 and 787 ‘Dreamliner’ jets will be able to fly almost anywhere in the world. Sir Richard Branson, president of Virgin Atlantic, said of the ruling by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration: ‘This development really does open up a whole new world. ‘Apart from the stunning destinations on arrival, the Arctic scenery will be just amazing. 'Our new fleet of 787s could well be flying to Honolulu or even Fiji one day.’ As well as the North Pole, many trans-Pacific journeys have hitherto been out-of-bounds for twin-engine planes. Jets with more than two engines have been allowed to fly over the North Pole for  some years. The first airline to take advantage . of the ‘extended operations’ option for twin engines is Air New Zealand . which earlier this month flew from Los Angeles to Auckland. Chief pilot Captain David Morgan . said: ‘What this means is that the aeroplane is able to fly a straighter . route between pairs of cities, and that’s good for the environment. Frozen: An aerial view of the Arctic which passenger carriers will now be able to fly over to exotic destinations . ‘Less fuel is burned and less carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. It’s also good for customers because flights are potentially shorter.’ But not everyone in aviation is happy with the changes. While it is generally accepted that dual engine failure is extremely unlikely, some safety experts expressed concern about cabin conditions during a diversion. One safety manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘It’s all very well being able to make a safe landing, but passengers are likely to be distraught and extremely cold after a five-hour diversion to an airstrip in the Arctic.’ A spokesman for the British Airline Pilots’ Association said: ‘Our members are confident that the safety case for equipment redundancy, pilot training and passenger welfare will be fully satisfied.’ Planes flew over the North Pole during the Cold War in the 1950s to avoid Communist  Bloc airspace.","Long-haul flight times reduced by up to 50% .

"Whether they are hunters or the hunted, these cunning animals are all masters of . disguise who can fool even the most beady-eyed passer by into believing . they are not there. Some hide under lily pads, some dissolve into the bark of a tree while others slip seamlessly into the snow, either to hide from a hungry predator or silently stalk an unwitting prey. But the one thing from which they cannot hide is the all-seeing camera lens of photographer Art Wolfe. He has spent over 35 years roaming the deserts of Africa, the rainforests of South America, the mountains of the United States and snow plains of Canada to capture wildlife at its most invisible. It's white in front of you! A willow ptarmigan in winter plumage, hidden on a brushy slope near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The animals are trying their utmost to fool predators but that's not enough to deceive international photographer Art Wolfe . He has travelled through every . continent in the world in tireless pursuit of more subjects for his chef-d'oeuvre 'Vanishing Act' that dates back to the 1980s. Art said: 'Throughout my career as a nature photographer, I have challenged myself to present new perspectives on well-documented subjects. 'Like most of my projects this collection has been a long time in the making. 'Finding and filming animals on location is an exhilarating and painstaking process. I'm still adding to the project even now. 'Conventional wildlife photography calls for isolating the subject by selective focus, this way the animal is clearly defined.

Can't see the wolf from the trees: A wolf peering out from behind a tree trunk in an autumn Montana forest . Eye spy: A spectacled caiman in Llanos, Venezuela.

Leaf me alone: A Mealy or Blue-crowned parrot disappears like just another leaf in the lush Central American rainforest, Chan Chich, Belize . 'Photographers always want to show off their subject. And yet, is this really the way an animal is viewed by the human eye? Not quite. 'We don't have the isolating abilities that a telephoto lens provides. On most occasions an animal remains somewhat concealed by the clutter of its natural habitat-a necessity of survival for both predator and prey. 'I have basically employed three different photographic approaches and purposely worked to enhance the difficulty to find the camouflaged subject-as difficult as it is in the wild to see animals that do not want to be seen. Snake eyes: A horned adder matches the colour of the sand in the Namib Desert, Namibia, where they bury themselves using a swimming motion to disappear beneath the hot surface . Can you spot me? A Leopard conceals herself in vegetation at the base of a tree in Kruger National Park, Transvaal, South Africa .

Bark and hide: A Great Gray Owl positions itself in front of a similar pattern to take advantage of his camouflage in Oregon, United States . 'Since it is impossible to capture all the distractions to the senses of an entire landscape in a photo, I worked to make it visually challenging by using depth of field, scale and placement and confusing the subject.' Art is also a successful book publisher and television producer. He has published at least one book a year since 1989. The 61-year-old from Seattle said: 'It is in the wild places, where the edge of the earth meets the corners of the sky, the human spirit is fed.'

"The main motorway link between Heathrow . Airport and central London has been closed to all traffic after a crack was found in a 'sensitive area' of an elevated section. The M4, part of the Olympic Route Network, will be vital for transporting visitors . into the city for the Games later this month and it would be a major embarrassment for organisers if the restrictions cannot be lifted in time. Predicted to be shut for five days, the full closure of the motorway began at 8pm last night in both directions between junctions 1 and 3. Queue building: A section of the M4 motorway has been closed in both directions after a crack was found on an elevated section . Blocked: The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2 . The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2. The Highways Agency said yesterday . workers 'found a further crack in a sensitive location which requires us . to keep the viaduct closed until the repair is complete.' It said it expects work to be completed in time for the Olympic Games later this month. Hairline cracks were discovered in some of the steel beams in March and since then restrictions on vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes have been in place. A signed diversion route is in place on adjacent dual carriageways, the A312 and the A4. Problem: The road is shut from the Boston Manor Viaduct to Junction 3 . Transport spokesman for the London Assembly Conservatives, Richard Tracey told radio station LBC 97.3 it could signal a repeat of problems seen at the end of last year on the Hammersmith Flyover. He said: If they don't fix it before the end of July, then of course it would cause a degree of chaos. As Locog and TfL have been telling us, people will be arriving at Heathrow for the Games before then."" In January this year, Hammersmith Flyover in west London was closed due to major structural problems . The cracked and decaying facade on the M4 flyover structure was flagged by workers as unsafe and in dire need of repair . It only fully reopened to all traffic in May following five months of repairs. The thoroughfare, on the A4 at Hammersmith, was closed on December 23 due to water damage that corroded and weakened cables that give the bridge its strength. It partially reopened a few weeks later but lorries had not been able to use it. TfL said engineers said more work will be carried out on the bridge after the 2012 Games.","The M4 motorway closed in both directions between junctions 1 and 3 in west London .

"A Muslim man was jailed for life today for stabbing his devout Christian ex-girlfriend 13 times after they split following bitter rows about him wanting their young daughter to convert to Islam. Esther Arogundade, 32, was attacked by kitchen porter Shola Adebiyi in her own home after she began a relationship with another man. Adebiyi also drank oven cleaner in an attempt to kill himself and phoned Esther's new lover to say he would never see her again before confessing to the killing to a friend. Police broke into the mother-of-two's home in Salford, Greater Manchester, and found KFC worker Esther lying dead on the kitchen floor with multiple stab wounds to her back and front. Jailed: Shola Adebiyi, left, was given a life sentence at Manchester Crown Court for killing Esther Arogundade . Adebiyi was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for a minimum of 20-and-a-half years after admitting killing her. The court heard how Esther began dating Adebiyi in 2007 and that they later had a daughter now aged two but split up last year after a series of rows. Rob Hall prosecuting said: 'These arguments were ignited by differences of opinion over the religion of their daughter - the defendant wanted her to convert from Christian to Islam, but Esther was a church goer. 'There were arguments about expenses, bills and childcare.' Last March Esther, who also had a nine-year-old daughter living in Nigeria from a previous relationship began a friendship with another man named in court as Mr Alabi. While visiting family in Africa Mr Alabi received a sinister phone call from Adebiyi, claiming he would be killed if he returned to the UK. Mr Alabi told Esther about the call and she spoke to Adebiyi but he initially denied it. Mr Hall added: 'Mr Alabi returned to the UK and the relationship took the next step and it turned into a sexual relationship. 'They spent a great deal of time talking and texting on their mobile phones - it may well be that it came to the attention of the defendant.' On June 26, Adebiyi cleared out his locker at work at a conference centre in Manchester then left armed with a large kitchen knife and waited for Esther and their daughter to come home. Throughout that evening there were phone calls between Mr Alabi and Esther and also a child minder who was booked for the next day. Investigation: Police outside Esther Arogundade's Salford home where she was murdered in June last year . But the following morning Adebiyi was said to have made 'frantic arrangements' to get child care for his daughter and handed her over at 9.50am along with her birth certificate and left in her push chair. He then called Mr Alabi, who asked about the whereabouts and welfare of Esther only to be told he would never see her again. He then called a friend and confessed he had killed Esther, claiming it had happened during a fight. The friend went to the house and saw Adebiyi come out wearing a blood-stained t-shirt and holding a large black-handled knife. He saw him throw the knife into nearby bushes. In mitigation defence counsel Michael Lavery said his client had made a 'very genuine' attempt to take his own life by drinking oven cleaner. He added: 'He took the knife to kill himself and his partner. He's lost his daughter as well as a consequence of his own actions. 'It is tragic for the victim of this murder and a tragedy for the daughter and for the father too. It is his own fault, I know, but that is not going to make it easier for her.' Passing sentence Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told Adebiyi it was not clear exactly when he had killed Esther. He added: 'Your relationship had come to an end with frequent disagreements and rows between the two of you. 'She formed a relationship with another man. You resented it, and tried to warn him off with threats. 'She let you know that she no longer wanted to be with you and wanted to pursue a relationship with another man. 'You were most upset at that prospect. She sought friendship elsewhere, including in an affair with another man. You were understandably upset but let me be clear about this. 'Many men and women have to endure the discovery that the husband, wife or partner is no longer content with the relationship they have. Life sentence: Adebiyi was jailed at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) today . 'Many are jealous or unhappy. But what the law cannot and will not permit is the use of violence, which is what you used. 'I am prepared to accept that you were very upset - and indeed distraught - at what was happening to your relationship. 'When you acted as you did you were under considerable emotional strain.' After the case Senior Investigator Andrew Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The biggest tragedy here is that a young girl has now been deprived of both her parents. 'Her mother was taken from her in a vengeful, violent attack and no sentence today can bring her back.'","Esther Arogundade was stabbed 13 times by Shola Adebiyi at her Salford, Greater Manchester, home .

"Roger Federer had a 10-minute row with rival Stan Wawrinka after Federer's wife 'heckled' him from the sidelines during their match. Federer won the match 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 at the O2 in London on Saturday but his victory has been overshadowed by the fallout. It is understood that one of the reasons the Swiss compatriots fell out at their ATP Tour Finals semi-final was because Federer's wife Mirka heckled Wawrinka.

Neither Federer or Wawrinka has responded to the spat yet, although they are expected to play together . Wawrinka, arriving in Lille, will be key if Federer is to pick up the last title he has not yet earned in his career . Federer announced his withdrawal from the ATP World Tour Finals on Sunday after arguing with Wawrinka . Federer's wife Mirka is alleged to have questioned whether Wawrinka could beat her husband in the semis . Wawrinka was left unhappy after overhearing comments from Federer's wife Mirka on Saturday night . Federer (second left) poses with his first Wimbledon trophy in 2003 alongside then-girlfriend Mirka (right) Born in Bojnice, Czechoslovakia in 1978, Mirka Vavrinec began her own tennis career at a young age and turned professional when she was 20. She won three ITF titles during her career and reached a highest ranking of No 76 in the world in September 2001, but a persistent foot injury forced her to quit the game a year later. She met Federer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and married him in 2009. The couple have two sets of twins - identical twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva (born July 23, 2009) and twin boys Leo and Lennart (born May 6, 2014). As well as looking after her children, Mirka often follows her husband on tour and is said to be a major factor in the huge success he has experienced over the last 11 years. In an interview with Inside Tennis earlier this year, Federer said of his wife: 'I think every wife is important. Mine is no different. She's [always] been involved to some degree, but [she was more] involved, midway through our relationship. She came to every practice, every match, spent breakfast, lunch, and dinner together for years. 'It's still very intense today, but we have kids and she's seen 900 matches, I guess. She's OK missing one once in a while and not coming to practices any more. She's been very important in my life, not just as a tennis player, but overall.' Among Wawrinka's complaints is that she made audible comments from his supporters' box – which is at ground level – questioning in French whether he would have the guts to close the match. According to several eyewitnesses, a vociferous argument developed between the pair in the backstage area. Tour officials decided that the best thing was to push them alone into a private room that had been converted into a gym area, as there is no communal locker room at the arena. While the dispute is not believed to have become physical, a heated 10-minute row ensued in which both aired their grievances against the other. In what had been an unusually feisty and high quality semi-final, Wawrinka had four match points and served for the match at 5-4. According to French television, Wawrinka was picked up saying: 'She did the same thing at Wimbledon.' John McEnroe spoke of the dispute on American television, but he seemed unaware of the extent to which it has escalated, according to those Sportsmail has spoken to. Another cause of tension in matches between the two is said to be the presence in Federer's box of Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi, who coaches the world No 2 along with Stefan Edberg. Although doing his best to stay impartial in these encounters, it is not hard to see why Wawrinka might resent his team competition captain siding with his rival when it comes to their head-to-head combat. Ultimately the Swiss No 2 was unable to finish the job off and was denied a place in the final of the prestigious year-end championships, with well-placed sources saying he was furious at the intervention of Mrs Federer.

Federer and Mirka, pictured at Doha airport in January 2006, met at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . Next up for Swiss duo Federer and Wawrinka is the Davis Cup final against France. The three-day team event, which begins on Friday, could see the pair joining forces in a doubles match at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille. Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer are the other members of the Switzerland team. There was no comment from the Federer camp on Monday morning, but the situation is especially delicate because on Friday the two men, who have got on well in the past, are playing for Switzerland in the Davis Cup final against France. It is the only major prize in tennis to have eluded the 17-time Grand Slam champion, and he will be relying on his long-time colleague to help him achieve that last ambition, particularly if they are paired together for a doubles match. They were leaving for Lille on Monday morning where the match will be played inside the city's football stadium. While the undoubted row between the two men is a distraction, it was not the main cause of Federer pulling out of Sunday night's final, although the tension it caused is unlikely to have helped. The Swiss master, drained by the physically and mentally exhausting match against Wawrinka, sustained a pull in his back and clearly did not wish to risk it ahead of the Davis Cup final. Federer usually manages to avoid controversy and his wife says little in public, despite playing a major role in her 33 year-old husband's phenomenal career. Mirka Federer was a tennis player herself but she now supports her husband's career and follows him on tour . Federer, pictured with Mirka at the Laureus World Sports Awards, says his wife has seen over 900 matches . Mirka watches her husband in action at Wimbledon in 2012 with twin daughters Myla Rose and Charlene Riva . Those who know her speak of someone quietly formidable and determined who behind the scenes helps organise the incredibly busy life of her spouse, with whom she now has two sets of twins. A former player herself, when she was known as Miroslava Vavrinec, she reached a career high singles ranking of 76 and met the soon-to-be superstar at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, she had to retire from the sport with a persistent foot injury and has since channelled her energies into helping her husband become the global icon that he now is. Aside from maintaining his fitness and training regime and having four young children, Federer also has a large portfolio of sponsorships and has his own personal charitable foundation that he attends to. Mirka, who married him in 2009, is said to be a key component in making his life run like a Swiss clock to keep the success going. She is also known to have steely side, and it seems that is what has led to the fallout with Wawrinka that could be a threat to Switzerland's Davis Cup dreams.

"A new report says there has been ‘a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families'. File picture . One and a half million working families have been plunged into poverty since 2004 - the year that Eastern European migration began to accelerate, a major new study has found. The majority of the people now living below the poverty line are not dependent on benefits but come from homes where at least one person has a job, the study reveals. Almost half of the families who now count as poor have not one but two people in work, it said. The large-scale study carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008. Instead, it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004. Although the report does not attribute this to migration, the figure began to rise in the same year Tony Blair’s government opened the gates to allow migrants from Eastern European countries the right to work freely in Britain. Since then the Eastern European population has shot up to around a million people, while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside Europe. Many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower-skilled workers in the existing population for low-paid jobs. The report from Rowntree – which is headed by Julia Unwin, a Downing Street adviser when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister – said there had been ‘a dramatic change in who is most at risk of poverty compared to 10 years ago.’ It said there are ‘more people in poverty living in working families, meaning as many are now in working families as workless ones.’ And the report, Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion, added that there has been ‘a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families. ‘The rise occurred mainly in the middle of the last decade, when the number of people living in low-income working families rose from 5.2 million in 2003/04 to 6.8 million in 2008/09 before falling back slightly.’ The majority of the people now living below the poverty line are not dependent on benefits but come from homes where at least one person has a job, the study reveals. File picture . Rowntree also found that 2.2 million children live below the poverty line in working families, while only 1.4 million live in homes where no-one has a job. The Foundation’s economists said the study, which does not try to explain the rise in working poverty, ‘does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty’. They suggested that changes to the benefit system were responsible for the lapse into poverty of a million and a half working people. But a series of figures now points to a link between the arrival of Eastern European workers in large numbers beginning in April 2004 and the falling incomes and status of people who rely on earnings from the least skilled jobs. The Rowntree report said that for the bottom 10 per cent of earners, ‘income at the 10th percentile peaked in 2004/05, well before the country went into recession, and fell quite consistently after that.’ The lowest incomes have fallen by eight per cent in real terms since 2004, it said. The lowest incomes have fallen by eight per cent in real terms since 2004, according to the report. File picture . In 2003/04 there were two million more people who were either living in homes where nobody works, or who were retired, listed as poor than people from working homes. However numbers were equal by 2008/09, and by 2011/12 there were more working poor than poor without jobs, according to the study. The report also looked at overcrowding in both privately rented homes and those rented from local councils or state-financed housing associations. Less than five per cent of such homes were overcrowded in 2003/04, it found, but then numbers started rising, and topped seven per cent in state-subsised housing in 2010/11. The poverty measure used by Rowntree is the commonly-used relative poverty measure, which says a family is poor if they live on less than 60 per cent of median income. In the financial year 2012/13, this meant £130 for a single adult, £224 for a couple without children, £175 for a single parent with one child, and £364 for a couple with two children. The relative measure is often criticised because it means that when average incomes fall, fewer people are said to be in poverty. However, it does chart accurately how different groups of people are doing compared to each other. Since 2004, while large numbers of working families have slipped below the poverty line, the benefit system has buoyed up people who depend on welfare. Benefits continued to be uprated in line with inflation each year until 2011. However, major reforms to the benefit system, such as the introduction of tax credits and pension credit, were introduced by Gordon Brown at the end of the 1990s, five years before large numbers of working people began to slip into poverty. The MigrationWatch think tank said that it was no longer credible to deny the line between immigration and pressure on the incomes of lower earners. Its chief Sir Andrew Green said: ‘Yet again, lobbyists seem to be in denial about the impact of a huge inflow of East European migrants on the lives of some of the poorer sections of our community. ‘It is surely no coincidence that starting from 2004, increases in working poverty and overcrowding in rental accommodation have gone hand in hand with increasing numbers of arrivals from the poorer parts of Eastern Europe. ‘The Government’s Migration Advisory Committee and academic research have already highlighted the impact on wages for the lowest paid. ‘As for jobs, nowhere in the Rowntree report is there a single mention of the fact that in the past 10 years the number of UK-born workers increased by just 25,000 while the number of migrants in work increased by over 2 million, with nearly a million from Eastern Europe.’ Chris Goulden, head of poverty research for the Rowntree Foundation, said that the drop of working families into poverty was linked to the introduction of tax credits by Gordon Brown in 1999. By 2004, he said, the credits were yielding ‘diminishing returns’ in terms of reducing poverty. He said other changes to the benefits system had also changed the balance of poverty in 2004 and 2005. Mr Goulden said: ‘The report shows that pay slowed around 2004 and unemployment started to rise, although pay continued to grow even for low earners, while unemployment stayed low until 2008. It does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty.’ The Home Office Migration Advisory Committee found in a report on the impact of immigration in 2012 that ‘migrants are found to increase wages at the top of the UK wage distribution and to lower wages at the bottom of the distribution.’ A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘Uncontrolled, mass immigration, of the kind we saw under the last government, makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on public services and forces down wages. 'It has both economic and social consequences. That is why our focus remains on reducing and controlling migration at sustainable levels. ‘We are creating a system that is fair to British citizens and those who want to come here legitimately and contribute to our national life, but which is tough on those who flout the rules. Since 2010, we have reformed benefits, healthcare and housing rules to make them among the tightest in Europe and we continue to see an increase in the number of British citizens in work.’ A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The truth is, the percentage of people in the UK in relative poverty is at its lowest level since the mid-1980s and the number of households where no one works is the lowest since records began. ‘The Government’s long term economic plan is working to deliver the fastest growing economy in the G7, putting more people into work than ever before, and reducing the deficit by more than a third.’","1.5 million working families have been plunged into poverty since 2004 .

Using military force to detain the men . might also harm fledgling relations with Libya and other . post-Arab-Spring governments with whom the U.S. is trying to build . partnerships to hunt al-Qaeda as the organization expands throughout the . region. A senior administration official said . the FBI has identified a number of individuals that it believes have . information or may have been involved, and is considering options to . bring those responsible to justice. But taking action in remote eastern . Libya would be difficult. America's relationship with Libya would be . weighed as part of those options, the official said, speaking only on . condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to . discuss the effort publicly. The Libyan Embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Waiting to prosecute suspects instead . of grabbing them now could add to the political weight the Benghazi case . already carries. Wanted: This is one of the five suspects the FBI was seeking for questioning in relation to the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012. The men are now identified . Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . The attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission killed . Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans - information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy . SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - weeks before . President Obama's re-election. Since then, Republicans in . Congress have condemned the administration's handling of the situation, . criticizing the level of embassy security, questioning the talking . points provided to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice for her public appearances . to explain the attack and suggesting the White House tried to play down . the incident to minimize its effect on the president's campaign. The FBI released photos of three of . the five suspects earlier this month, asking the public to provide more . information on the men pictured. The images were captured by security . cameras at the U.S. diplomatic post during the attack, but it took weeks . for the FBI to see and study them. It took the agency three weeks to . get to Libya because of security problems, so Libyan officials had to . get the cameras and send them to U.S. officials in Tripoli, the capital. The FBI and other U.S. intelligence . agencies identified the men through contacts in Libya and by monitoring . their communications. They are thought to be members of Ansar . al-Shariah, the Libyan militia group whose fighters were seen near the . U.S. diplomatic facility prior to the violence. Person of interest: This is one of five men wanted for questioning in connection to the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi . Dangerous: Each of the men in the photos appear to be armed . Republican lawmakers continue to call . for the Obama administration to provide more information about the . attack. The White House released 99 pages of emails about the talking . points drafted by the intelligence community that Rice used to describe . the attack, initially suggesting they were part of a series of regional . protests about an anti-Islamic film. In those emails, administration . officials agreed to remove from the talking points all mentions of . terror groups such as Ansar al-Shariah or al-Qaeda, because the . intelligence pointing to those groups' involvement was still unclear and . because some officials didn't want to give Congress ammunition to . criticize the administration. U.S. officials say the FBI has proof . that the five men were either at the scene of the first attack or . somehow involved because of intercepts of at least one of them bragging . about taking part. Some of the men have also been in contact with a . network of well-known regional Jihadists, including al-Qaeda in the . Islamic Maghreb. The U.S. has decided that the evidence . it has now would be enough for a military operation to seize the men . for questioning, but not enough for a civilian arrest or a drone strike . against them, the officials said. The U.S. has kept them under . surveillance, mostly by electronic means. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and . three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack . on the consulate in Benghazi . There was a worry that the men . could get spooked and hide, but so far, not even the FBI's release of . surveillance video stills has done that. FBI investigators are hoping for more . evidence, such as other video of the attack that might show the suspects . in the act of setting the fires that ultimately killed the ambassador . and his communications specialist, or firing the mortars hours later at . the CIA base where the surviving diplomats took shelter - or a Libyan . witness willing to testify against the suspects in a U.S. courtroom. But Rep Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon, the . Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he is . concerned the Obama administration is treating terrorism as criminal . actions instead of acts of war that would elicit a much harsher response . from the United States. 'The war on terror, I think, is a war . and at times I get the feeling that the administration wants to treat it . as a crime,' McKeon said Tuesday. Administration officials have indicated recently that the FBI is zeroing in. Tragedy: Chris Stevens (pictured in April 2011) became . the U.S. ambassador to Libya in June 2012. He was killed along with . three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on . Sept. 11, 2012 . 'Regardless of what happened . previously, we have made very, very, very substantial progress in that . investigation,' Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers last week. That echoed comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry to lawmakers last month. 'They do have people ID'd,' Kerry said . of the FBI-led investigation. 'They have made some progress. They have a . number of suspects who are persons of interest that they are pursuing . in this and building cases on.' But options for dealing with the men . are few and difficult, U.S. officials said, describing high level . strategy debates among White House, FBI and other counterterror . officials. Those confidential discussions were described on condition of . anonymity by four senior U.S. officials briefed on the investigation . into the attack. The U.S. could ask Libya to arrest the . suspects, hoping that Americans would be given access to question them . and that the Libyans gather enough evidence to hold the men under their . own justice system. Another option is to ask the Libyans to extradite . the men to the U.S., but that would require the U.S. to gather enough . solid evidence linking the suspects to the crime to ask for such an . action.","Each of .

Keane says he wouldn't have missed a drugs test like Rio Ferdinand and Manchester United suffered as a result . Roy Keane has re-opened his feud with former Manchester City defender Alf-Inge Haaland. The Manchester United legend notoriously fouled Haaland in 2001, which his first autobiography claimed was an act of vengence after Haaland had wrongly claimed Keane was playacting after injuring his cruciate ligament when tackling Haaland, then of Leeds, in 1997. Now Keane's new book - published this week, reveals he does not feel sorry over the incident. 'There are things I regret in my life and he's not one of them,' said Keane.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company.

Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better.

"Five-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams swapped the tennis court for the photographer's studio as she stripped down for an Australian lingerie company. The 33-year-old, who has won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, posed for Berlei as part of a new TV advertising campaign. The current world No 1 was in a confident mood after last month's WTA Finals success in Singapore as she stepped in front of the cameras in an unfamiliar capacity. The Current world No 1 posed in a variety of outfits during the photo shoot for Australian company Berlei . Despite the somewhat intimidating prospect of stripping down, Serena told the Daily Telegraph that she felt comfortable in her own skin. 'I'm a normal woman - I can get self-conscious. But I think that is just natural for women to feel that way,' she said. 'I have learned to be proud of my curves and to embrace them. It's important to love who you are and realise that you're beautiful, no matter what society says.' The brand's senior marketing manager Kellie Warwick told Daily Mail Australia that Serena was a natural on set in Miami. 'She was without a doubt a natural behind the camera and was an absolute delight to work with,' she said, 'She is such a professional!' The 33-year-old American star recently won the WTA Finals in Singapore after beating Simona Halep . 'The entire Berlei team loved working with Serena on our latest sports bra campaign, The Bounce Masters. We are delighted to have one of the world's best female athletes representing Berlei Australia.' The ad, which is due to be released in time for Serena's appearance at the Australian Open in January, is the first the 18-time grand slam champion has done for the label after first signing on as a sports bra ambassador in 2013. The reigning Olympic, US Open and WTA Tour champion, it seems, is proving that she can be just as successful off the court as she has been on it.","Serena Williams has had a photo shoot for an Australian lingerie company .

"Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope has spotted a huge eruption of dust around a young star. They believe the dust cloud was the result of a smashup between large asteroids. This type of collision can eventually lead to the formation of planets, researchers say. The  aftermath of a large asteroid impact around NGC 2547-ID8, a 35-million-year-old sun-like star. Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope witnessed a giant surge in dust around the star, the result of two asteroids colliding. The viewing offers a glimpse into the violent process of making rocky planets like ours. Rocky planets begin life as dusty material circling around young stars. The material clumps together to form asteroids that ram into each other. Although the asteroids often are destroyed, some grow over time and transform into proto-planets. After about 100 million years, the objects mature into full-grown, terrestrial planets. Our moon is thought to have formed from a giant impact between proto-Earth and a Mars-size object. Scientists had been regularly tracking the star, called NGC 2547-ID8, when it surged with a huge amount of fresh dust between August 2012 and January 2013. 'We think two big asteroids crashed into each other, creating a huge cloud of grains the size of very fine sand, which are now smashing themselves into smithereens and slowly leaking away from the star,' said lead author and graduate student Huan Meng of the University of Arizona, Tucson. While dusty aftermaths of suspected asteroid collisions have been observed by Spitzer before, this is the first time scientists have collected data before and after a planetary system smashup. The viewing offers a glimpse into the violent process of making rocky planets like ours. Rocky planets begin life as dusty material circling around young stars. The material clumps together to form asteroids that ram into each other. Although the asteroids often are destroyed, some grow over time and transform into proto-planets. After about 100 million years, the objects mature into full-grown, terrestrial planets. Our moon is thought to have formed from a giant impact between proto-Earth and a Mars-size object. In the new study, Spitzer set its heat-seeking infrared eyes on the dusty star NGC 2547-ID8, which is about 35 million years old and lies 1,200 light-years away in the Vela constellation. Previous observations had already recorded variations in the amount of dust around the star, hinting at possible ongoing asteroid collisions. Astronomers were surprised to see these data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in January 2013, showing a huge eruption of dust around a star called NGC 2547-ID8. In this plot, infrared brightness is represented on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal axis. In hope of witnessing an even larger impact, which is a key step in the birth of a terrestrial planet, the astronomers turned to Spitzer to observe the star regularly. Beginning in May 2012, the telescope began watching the star, sometimes daily. A dramatic change in the star came during a time when Spitzer had to point away from NGC 2547-ID8 because our sun was in the way. When Spitzer started observing the star again five months later, the team was shocked by the data they received. 'We not only witnessed what appears to be the wreckage of a huge smashup, but have been able to track how it is changing -- the signal is fading as the cloud destroys itself by grinding its grains down so they escape from the star,' said Kate Su of the University of Arizona and co-author on the study. 'Spitzer is the best telescope for monitoring stars regularly and precisely for small changes in infrared light over months and even years.' A very thick cloud of dusty debris now orbits the star in the zone where rocky planets form. The viewing offers a glimpse into the violent process of making rocky planets like ours. Our moon is thought to have formed from a giant impact between proto-Earth and a Mars-size object. As the scientists observe the star system, the infrared signal from this cloud varies based on what is visible from Earth. For example, when the elongated cloud is facing us, more of its surface area is exposed and the signal is greater. When the head or the tail of the cloud is in view, less infrared light is observed. By studying the infrared oscillations, the team is gathering first-of-its-kind data on the detailed process and outcome of collisions that create rocky planets like Earth. 'We are watching rocky planet formation happen right in front of us,' said George Rieke, a University of Arizona co-author of the new study. 'This is a unique chance to study this process in near real-time.' The team is continuing to keep an eye on the star with Spitzer. They will see how long the elevated dust levels persist, which will help them calculate how often such events happen around this and other stars, and they might see another smashup while Spitzer looks on.","Scientists had been regularly tracking the star, called NGC 2547-ID8 .

"Vets in Ukraine are struggling to identify a 'mutant' animal shot by hunters in a remote area of the former Soviet republic. Locals say it is a mystery 'Chupacabra' -  allegedly sighted a few times in recent years - that preys on rabbits, goats and house animals. Grey in colour and with ‘fangs’ and a longish neck, it has shorter front legs, slightly resembling a kangaroo, while also showing a likeness to a dog and a fox, say those who have seen it. Mystery: The discovery of the strange animal in Ukraine has baffled experts . There were claims that it could be a . 'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it . maybe a hybrid originating from a Soviet plant conducting tests on . animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development. ‘A creature we were not supposed to see has escaped from a secret defence lab,’ said one comment. ‘The . animal doesn't look like a fox or a wolf, or a raccoon,’  Mikhail . Ilchenko, deputy head of the district veterinary service in . Mikhailovskoe, told Komsomolskaya Pravda, Ukraine. ‘It . cannot even be a marten.  I have never seen such animal before. But, . judging by the fangs, I can definitely say that it is a predator.’ Alien: The strange creature resembles a fox but bears features similar to a kangaroo . Speculation: The animal could be the mythical 'Chupacabra' - which is Spanish for goat sucker - is a legendary cryptid rumoured to inhabit parts of North and South America . Local vets took the skinny, short-haired creature to the Zoological Museum of Zaporozhye National University. ‘There is something common with a fox, and a dog,’ said director Alexander Korotya. Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America. Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in Canóvanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed. Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas. ‘But . I cannot identify what kind of animal it is. For example, its canine . teeth are similar similar to a fox, but smaller in size - like a marten. ‘Yet a marten has a . different type of skull. If to compare with an otter's head, then the . ears are too small. It has a wide nose and a stretched muzzle. ‘My opinion is that its most likely a hybrid animal or a mutant.’ Reports of such a creature - but with varying descriptions - have appeared in the Ukrainian media in recent years. One lurid and unconfirmed version is . that it sucked blood from chickens and rabbits and domestic animals . which it killed  in remote villages. It . has been described as orange or grey in colour, with front shorter than . hind legs, and with an ability to jump resembling a kangaroo.

"Fusilier Lee Rigby was brutally murdered in 2013 . A council has decided not to name a memorial at the site of Lee Rigby's death after the murdered fusilier for fear it may offend Islamic fanatics. Campaigners urged Greenwich Council to build a commemorative site for the man who was murdered by two extremists in the street last year. But after agreeing to their demands, officials revealed it would not be named after the 25-year-old for fear it could lead to more religious attacks. Instead, an inscription will read: 'To commemorate all those servicemen and woman who have served or lived in Woolwich and who gave given their lives.' Critics blasted the decision as 'disgusting' last night, urging officials to 'stand up' to violent extremists. 'It's disgusting. People outraged by that day need somewhere to go to think about what happened to Lee and his family,' Cheryl Spruce told the Sun. Lorna Taylor, another campaigner, added: 'The council has feared a Lee Rigby memorial will be attacked. But there will always be extremists and we need to stand up to them.' Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for a minimum of 45 years each for butchering Mr Rigby, a father, in Woolwich as he walked on the street in military uniform. Together they knocked the 25-year-old down in the street then hacked at his body with knives to the horror of by-passers. During an Old Bailey trial the pair spoke of their devotion to Islam and their fight against the west which they said drove them to commit such a heinous crime. The murder sent shock waves across the country and became synonymous with the ongoing struggle against Islamist fanatics. Rebecca Rigby, the widow of Lee Rigby, lays a wreath near the site where he was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in May 2013 . A campaign to commemorate the fusilier with a memorial site outside Woolwich Barracks was launched and taken under immediate consideration by Greenwich Council officials. It was revealed a stone would be placed at nearby St George's Chapel, but that it would not be dedicated specifically to the soldier. Mr Rigby's family welcomed the location of the memorial, with his widow Rebecca saying: 'I know St George's Chapel and it is a peaceful place and I think the memorial proposals will be fitting.' His mother Lyn added: 'I support the council's plans and will feel able to visit the memorial in the chapel.' Earlier this year Fusilier Rigby's son, Jack, placed a poppy wreath at the National Memorial Arboretum where his father's name has been engraved.","Greenwich Council decided not to name memorial after murdered fusilier .

"The heartbreaking story of a baby boy who was found abandoned in a Sydney drain has sparked renewed calls for baby safe havens to be introduced in Australia. Since the shocking incident emerged a woman has now been charged with attempted murder. She has been accused of leaving her son in a 2.4 metre-deep drain in Quakers Hill in Sydney’s west when he was just one day old. Campaigners believe that this is another example of the need for ‘baby hatches’ that allow parents to safely place unwanted babies. Labor Senator for Tasmania Helen Polley, who has been pushing for their introduction in Australia for seven years, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I’ve seen, read and cried over too many babies since 2007, no more.’ Scroll down for video . Found: The baby boy who was abandoned in a drain near the M7 in Sydney last Monday . A baby hatch at Berlin's St. Joseph hospital in Germany. A baby hatch is a place where people can bring babies, usually newborn ones, and leave them there anonymously to be found and cared for . ‘I don’t know the details of this woman but for a lot of younger women, who hide their pregnancy and then deliver in a toilet, they need a lot of help and assistance. I think society owes them that,’ she argued. So is rolling out a nationwide baby hatch scheme the best way to save abandoned children? In Germany, Canada and China parents who do not want their child or cannot care for them because of poverty or their own illnesses - such as post-natal depression - are able to leave them in a safe padded hatch. After two to three minutes an alarm is sounded to notify staff that a child has been dropped off, also giving the parents enough time to walk away anonymously and without fear of prosecution. France has gone so far as allowing a mother to leave her baby in hospital for adoption after giving birth without having to register as the mother. The storm drain, were a baby was found this weekend, was just large enough for the baby to fit through . Lorana Bartels, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at University of Canberra, told Daily Mail Australia that while baby hatches are worth trialling in Australia they should not be ‘a substitute for proper anti-natal and post-natal care and appropriate child protection measures generally’. She pointed out that Australia has its own unique legal system – one that currently criminalises mothers who cannot care for their children – and the country should run its own trials before introducing baby hatches nationwide. * 2013 baby left outside ambulance station in Rockhampton, Qld . * 2013 baby, nicknamed Moses, left outside a family's home in Logan, Qld . * 2011 baby Willow found dead in a Kingston park, Tasmania. * 2007 baby Catherine left outside Dandenong hospital, Victoria . * 2007 baby Joan left on the doorstep of a Sydney church . She warned that the hatches would only potentially be beneficial if they did not cut funding from other services for mothers who are struggling. ‘There is a hypothetical pot of money and if it doesn’t go to counselling it could jeopardise other lives. ‘But if baby hatches could be in addition to other services it is worth trialling. Not nationally yet, that’s overkill, but I would like to see a jurisdiction go ahead with it. ‘They would need an advertising campaign and social media so mothers knew it was available. Then they could evaluate how much it was used.’ Ms Bartels said in essence she is in support of change: ‘In case after case, women are quite overtly calling out for help… one women called parent helplines and said she can’t cope and “I can’t be alone with my child”, then she killed her baby and was convicted of murder. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says there are baby boxes across Europe but Germany has the most with 99 across the country . The hatch features padded walls and a blanket in the German centre . ‘That’s a failure of the system in my opinion, she was ill and she needed help.’ 'We really need to be aware of the fact that the ones we see are the tip of the iceberg. We don’t know what the other cases are,’ she added. Senator Polley goes even further in her belief that Australia needs to change the way it treats struggling parents and unwanted babies. She first heard about baby hatches in 2007 when her youngest daughter was pregnant. ‘She said “mum you have to do something”, she was watching a US show about abandoned babies.’ Since then, Senator Polley has visited hospitals in Germany and Italy and been moved by stories about abandoned babies left in plastic bags and in bushes in Australia. David Otte and his daughter Hayley, 18, identified the baby down the drain and contacted police . Workmen lift the 200kg concrete cover to the drain where the baby boy was dumped . Authorities are investigating the lead that the newborn boy was dropped from the height of 2.4m . ‘In Rome they have on average one baby a month that is relinquished and they have a specially appointed judge who adopts them out to loving families,’ she explained. ‘There was the Angel baby left at a bus station in Victoria who passers-by noticed but thought was a kitten, they didn’t realise it was a little boy. He lay in a morgue for two years before he could be buried,’ she said of the baby she cannot forget. ‘They are never going to take their first step, go to school, ride a bike… these women who are obviously desperate need another option.’ Some fears about baby hatches are that they could encourage women to abandon their children but Senator Polley said there is ‘no evidence that there has been an increase’ in the countries that currently use them. So far no Australian government has supported the hatches because they believe they are already doing enough for parents. People walk past next to a baby hatch named 'baby safety island' at the Tianjin Institute of Children's Welfare, in Tianjin municipality . In China, a parent typically opens a door and places their infant in a small room, rings a bell and leaves before welfare services collect the child . A mother weeps after leaving her child at the Guangzhou baby hatch, one of 25 such hatch facilities in mainland China, spanning 10 provinces and major cities . Senator Polley argued that the scheme would be low cost if they attached the baby hatches to hospitals where the facilities to care for babies already exist. ‘You could have the legislation changed so these baby shoots can be in our hospitals, so there would be not any major costs just a case of changing laws so there are no prosecutions. ‘But we shouldn’t put a dollar figure on a baby’s life. ‘We need to do more… we are a wealthy country and the extra money on baby hatches would be small. We need to reach out to these young girls and stop them giving birth in toilets.’ What both women agreed on is the fact mothers don’t abandon their babies unless they are ‘desperate’. Karen Healy, National President of the Australian Association of Social Workers and Professor of Social Work at the University of Queensland said that this most recent case of abandonment was a highly unusual case. In China, abandonment has been encouraged by the one-child policy and a traditional bias for sons, who support elderly parents and continue the family name, leading to the abandonment of girls . 'Parents abandoning their child is extremely rare in any situation. There would be less than ten cases of outright abandonment across Australia each year, but even among these this is highly unusual,' Ms Healy said. 'Babies are generally left on church doorsteps or at hospitals, in high-traffic areas where the parents know someone will find them and take care of them,' she said. 'Typically, parents will abandon their baby because of a complete inability to take care of their child, and very often they are looking for someone else to care for child but don't want to be investigated.' 'But this is quite a different scenario, and it's clear they wanted the baby hidden. There must be some element of shame, where their families weren't aware they were pregnant,' Ms Healy said. 'It has the hallmarks of mental illness or a serious drug addiction, and I can't think of another case like this.'

"Many of us already rely heavily on technology for everyday tasks, but the very technology we need to get through the day could soon be after our jobs - and the shift could happen much faster than we think. Claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years, office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans. The idea that robots will one day be able to do all low-skilled jobs is not new, but Andrew Anderson, CEO of UK artificial intelligence company, Celaton, said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought. The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform . A study by recruitment service TheLadders has discovered the fastest growing job titles of the past five years. They include: . DevOps engineer . iOS developer . Data scientist . UX designer . Staff accountant . Paralegal . UI developer . Administrative assistant . Android developer . Business intelligence developer . From this list, DevOps engineer, iOS and Android developer and data scientist didn't exist on TheLadders list in 2008. ‘I'm afraid it’s now a reality that most clerical workers will disappear. This has profound implications for jobs of course, but huge technological advancements are being made all the time and artificial intelligence (AI) has now become very sophisticated to the extent that it can think and learn like a human,’ he said. AI, for example, can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically, while the latest models are also capable of making decision that would traditionally be made by humans. Anderson said his company had been assessing the industry and found that the pace of change was accelerating more rapidly than Government bodies and others had prepared for. ‘[AI] can read and understand the meaning of entire documents by learning the patterns of words and phrases in context. It’s this ability to learn - and learn from the natural consequence of processing documents - that is minimising the need for clerical workers to carry out these repetitive tasks. ‘The fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks, but constantly learn how to do it better and faster, means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were.' For example, a machine can recognise . duplicate claims filed to insurance companies by knowing it has seen a . phone number or an address before. More . importantly, whenever human intervention is required, AI learns from . this and therefore further reduces the dependency on clerical workers. A robot developed by researchers from Cornell University uses Kinect sensors, 3D cameras and a database of household task videos to anticipate their owner's needs. For example, it scans the surrounding area for clues and when it spots an empty beer bottle, can open the fridge, pick up a full bottle of beer and hand it to its owner . Robots are also used by the police and military as bomb-disposal experts, for example, pictured . The case is already being seen with many online retailers using automated customer service agents. Earlier this year, technology firm IBM turned its supercomputer Watson into a robot call centre. The artificially intelligent computer system took on the role of a customer service manager called the Watson Engagement Advisor. The service uses IBM's Big Data Analytics technologies to gather data about customers and make sure the answers are best suited to them. Watson can then personalise its responses based on the company, and the type of customer, for future calls too. Robots are also used by the police and military as bomb-disposal experts, for example. Earlier this year, students from Cornell University invented a robot that can fetch food and drinks, do the housework and carry out other everyday tasks. While researchers from Bielefeld University built a robotic barman called Joint Action in Multimodal Embodied Systems, or JAMES for short. But this advantage can come at a . cost. According to a report filed last year by the UK Commission for . Employment and Skills, the greatest loss of jobs between 2010 and 2020 . is predicted for administrative, clerical and secretarial occupations. This is set to amount to 387,000 jobs. Mr . Anderson continued: ‘AI is sophisticated enough to know if a . correspondence is a complaint and then how important it is. For some . people this is difficult to believe which is why we have to demonstrate . it live. Seeing is believing after all. Independent AI expert, Massimo Barbato - who wrote Thinking Beyond Limitation - said by 2025, machines will be able to learn, adjust, exercise judgement, and re-programme themselves. This is already seen in apps such as IBM's Ask Watson app, pictured . ‘The perception of ‘too good to be true’ is diminishing as more companies adopt AI to accelerate and improve profitability, customer service and shareholder value. Anderson added that AI was a ‘game changer’ and although it could affect jobs, there were much greater benefits for the customers. Machines can significantly increase productivity and therefore reduce costs. They can improve customer service, compliance, scale and efficiency. Independent AI expert, Massimo Barbato - who wrote Thinking Beyond Limitation which explores the impact of technologies on everyday life - agreed. ‘While it was once mainly lower-skilled jobs squeezed by new technology, AI could undercut the ‘knowledge’ professional. ‘By 2025, machines will be able to learn, adjust, exercise judgement, and re-programme themselves. ‘The hardest hit would be professionals working in sales, education, healthcare, IT, management, finance and law – knowledge-based jobs, where analytics tools, mobile internet devices, apps or web-based services such as the cloud can be developed to outperform humans.’","Claims were made by CEO of UK artificial intelligence company, Celaton .

"They are called a man's best friend, and for good reason - owners who don't play with their dogs find their pets suffer behavioural problems such as anxiety and aggression, according to a survey. The canines show symptoms such as 'whining and jumping up, as well as pulling on the lead and not coming when called', the study of 4,000 dog owners revealed. And scientists are beginning to agree that play is the key to a dog's happiness. Research by Bristol University found that play was the key to a dog's happiness and their quality of live, according to a survey of 4,000 owners. It also revealed that 'fetch' was a dog's top game (file photo) The research showed just one in five owners played with their dogs six times a day, while half played twice or three times a day with their pets and 10 per cent played just once. Mark Evans, a former chief vet at the RSPCA, told The Sunday Times: 'There is a clear association in the results. Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.' He said the study, carried out by Emily Blackwell of Bristol University, found there was 'a growing acceptance' that the 'frequency of play for dogs is a really good indicator of their quality of life'. The survey, which will be revealed tomorrow on the Channel 4 programme Dogs: Their Secret Lives, also shows that a dogs' favourite game is 'fetch', according to 43 per cent of owners. But Laura Dobb, who took part in the show, said if she throws her rescue dog Nash a tennis ball he will 'throw it up in the air' but won't bring it back. The type of game owners played with their pet was important, according to Mr Evans, who said that owners needed to find out which ones their animals enjoyed rather than 'impose a game'. If owners chose to play tug with their pet, he added that it was 'rubbish' if they felt they had to let their dog win  out of fear the animal would 'dominate your whole life'.","Canines left on own start 'whining and not coming when called': study .

"A man bragged on Twitter after he killed a Royal Marine with a punch and carried on drinking. Reece Kay, 20, knocked Commando Wes Clutterbuck unconscious after the Marine - who had granted home leave to attend a funeral - tried to break up a fight in Rochdale. As 19-year old Marine Clutterback lay dying from head injuries Kay, who had drunk five vodka shots and ‘up to eight pints of lager’, went off to a nightclub and carried on drinking with friends before posting his Tweet at 5am. Kay tweeted: 'Hahaha, . f****** hand is killing me!' Jailed: Reece Kay, 20, pictured left, has been jailed for four years for the manslaughter of Royal Marine Wesley Clutterbuck, 19, pictured right . The tweet: Reece Kay posted this tweet just a few hours after punching Royal Marine Wes Clutterbuck saying: 'Hahaha, f****** hand is killing me!' He later handed himself in when he he . woke up from his drunken stupor to discover thew soldier had been . fatally injured when he cracked his skull against the pavement as he . fell to the floor. Marine Clutterback died later in hospital. His organs were donated to save . the lives of patients on the organ waiting list - with part of his . liver given to a 20-month-old baby boy. Kay claimed he had hit the Marine as he ran at him from behind and gave him 'no chance' to defend himself. At Manchester Crown Court, Kay, from Rochdale, Manchester, admitted manslaughter and was jailed for four years after a judge said he had shown 'genuine remorse'. But Marine Clutterback mother's Sara Whitworth, 38, said the sentence was not long enough. She said: 'This sentence is not long enough at all. A lot of young people have come to see justice done and the law in practice that is meant to protect us. Yet they have just seen that it is all an absolute sham and this sentence says it is ok to go out and punch and kill someone. 'I hope that this man cannot close his eyes at night for what he has done to our son. I will never ever forgive him. 'Wesley was a serving marine and he . would have gone to war for his country to protect everyone including the . judges and solicitors and the legal system. Heartbroken: Wesley Clutterbuck, pictured centre, with his family who today criticised his killer's sentence for not being long enough . 'This is how he is repaid. This is how he is treated, it is a pathetic justice system. He would have gone to war for them and that’s how they have treated an upstanding marine.'The Marine was described by army officers as a 'charismatic and enthusiastic young Commando' joined the Marines in February last year and, after nine months, training passed for duty as an original member of 142 troop. The tragedy occurred on June 29 after the Marine attended the funeral of a close friend before joining fellow mourners for a night out in Rochdale. Mr Justin Hayhoe, prosecuting, said Kay and a friend Jake Johnson had spent the afternoon and evening drinking five shots of vodka and up to eight pints of lager and playing an X Box football game before heading into Rochdale shortly after midnight. Remorse: Reece Kay fled the scene and headed to a nightclub after punching Royal Marine Wesley Clutterbuck, but a court heard that he handed himself into police after discovering he had died . The pair spotted a man and woman having an argument and Johnson told the woman to calm down. The man left but the woman then slapped Johnson - causing Marine Clutterbuck to intervene. Mr Hayhoe told the court the Commando was defending the woman when Kay became involved in the argument. He said: 'Wesley was backing away from Reece Kay who had to be restrained a number of times. 'The defendant was becoming very agitated and one witness saw the victim walk away and told Kay to leave it and even grabbed him by the arm. 'But the defendant wasn’t calming down. He ran over the road towards Wesley at speed and gave him a forceful punch to the face.' Kay fled as onlookers went to help the Marine who was unconscious and bleeding from a wound at the back of his head. Kay then went to Mango’s nightclub for up to 30 minutes before friends said he left because he was 'feeling bad about what had happened earlier'. But the 20-year-old still posted a tweet that appeared to boast about his actions. Kay handed himself into police at 3pm the following afternoon saying: ‘I’m really sorry I have hit him’. My Hayhoe continued: 'He said he was leaving the Yates pub when he saw Jake arguing with a male and should have left it. He said the victim had said something which had annoyed him but couldn’t recall what but was provoked and so he ran after him and punched him. 'He said he had never seen Wesley before. He said Wesley had said something to him and he admitted running off. He said it was spur of the moment and was really angry and not like that normally and didn’t know why he didn’t it. 'He said he just ran over and hit him. He said he swung with his right hand and hit him on the head with his fist clenched, he said it was quite hard. He saw Wesley drop to the flow and ran because he was scared.' In mitigation defence counsel Guy Mathieson said: 'This was a single punch delivered in drunken anger at a perceived insult. 'His remorse is apparent and repeated again and again. He has never sought to blame or cast any sign of the conduct on the late Wesley Clutterbuck. 'It is a stark lesson to young people who get drunk and aggressive how one blow can lead to a tragic loss of life. He would do anything to take that one punch back. He is a thoroughly decent young man.' The family of Wesley Clutterbuck arriving at Manchester Crown Court to witness the sentencing of Reece Kay . Behind bars: Reece Kay was only jailed for four years after the judge found he showed 'genuine remorse' for his actions . Sentencing judge Mr Justice Tim Holroyde told Kay: 'You had drunk more than was good for you and no doubt drink played its part in this crime. But I accept you have genuine remorse for what you have done. 'I accept that the tweet was in retrospect most unfortunate in the morning before you realised your actions had serious consequences. Wesley Clutterbuck was 19, and his young life which was full of promise was needlessly ended. 'His family are left to grieve for him and left with constant reminders what may have been if he had survived.' Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a mindless unprovoked attack which ended in tragedy. It only takes one punch to kill someone and cause so much anguish. 'Wesley’s parents, family and friends were all extremely proud of his achievements; to lose a loved one in this way is totally devastating. Whatever sentence is imposed it will not compensate for their loss.'

"A council worker called for police 'back-up' after he found a dog poo in a park. The Tower Hamlets Enforcement Officer accused Amber Langtry, 35, of not clearing up after her German Shepherd in Victoria Park, East London, as she was walking her friend. Miss Langtry denied the allegation, trying to explain that her dog had not been in the area where the attendant found the faeces, but still offered to pick it up to end the confrontation. Scroll down for video . Amber Langtry was shocked when this council worker accused her of leaving her dog's poo in Victoria Park . He threatened to arrest Miss Langtry and called for police 'back-up' as she challenged him to show her the poo . Miss Langtry here is pictured with her German Shepherd, Olive . The council worker issued her with a ticket, which could result in a court hearing and a £1,000 fine, and called officers to the park on New Year's Day accusing her of 'non-compliance'. Miss Langtry told the Evening Standard that she and her friend, who recorded the incident, had cleaned up their dogs’ mess earlier in the walk. She also said the park attendant refused to show them the poo she was being challenged over. In the ten-minute video the officer is heard accusing the woman of ‘non-compliance’ and calling officers to the scene. He described Miss Langtry’s friend, who was recording him with her iPhone, as ‘aggressive’. At one point, she is heard on the video saying: 'He can't even show us the poo - it's ridiculous!' The council worker issued her with a ticket, which could result in a court hearing and a £1,000 fine . Miss Langtry was told by Tower Hamlets council, in a five-page letter, that it will not be continuing prosecution . Miss Langtry told the paper: ‘I remember thinking, “This is ridiculous. Why does he need police back-up for a five-foot-four woman looking for a dog poo?”’ ‘When the police got here they were as bemused as I was, and they didn't have a problem with me or my dog.' After half an hour, Miss Langtry was shown the poo, which she maintains was not left by her dog. She told Mail Online: 'As I am a reasonable person, and would never leave a dog faeces behind, I picked it up in a poo bag and popped it in a nearby bin.' She was told by Tower Hamlets council, in a five-page letter, that it will not be continuing prosecution, but that the officer has the power to deal with an offence ‘of failing to remove dog faces [sic]’. The Enforcement Officer accused Miss Langtry's friend, who recorded the incident, of being 'aggressive' Waiting: After around nine minutes of recording, the park attendant speaks to police officers who are on their way to Victoria Park, East London, on New Year's Day . Miss Langtry said that while the video is 'funny' to watch now, it was 'scary, intimidating and confusing at the time'. The Metropolitan Police told the paper that no ‘allegation of crime’ was made to officers. A council spokesperson said: 'The council has a long standing policy of tackling the issue of dog fouling. The council can confirm an incident took place on Wednesday, 1 January, where a Tower Hamlets Enforcement Officer (THEO) asked a dog owner to clean up after their dog. 'When the dog owner refused to give their name as the THEO requested, the THEO then called for appropriate back up after explaining the situation fully to the dog owner. 'We take dog fouling seriously in this borough as it is a concern for residents which is why the council took this course of action.'

"Whatever other labels get attached to Malky Mackay, it cannot be said he lacks ambition. That much was obvious on Saturday night in the DW Stadium long after the crowds had gone and a question was asked about Dave Whelan’s threat to quit his role as Wigan chairman. Mackay’s mood in that instant stopped being that of the proud manager whose fresh start had ended with an impressive 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough. Malky Mackay barks instructions during his first game back in management for a year . Mackay's first game in charge of Wigan Athletic ended in a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium . Dave Whelan was seen crying as Wigan fans sang his name before they faced Middlesbrough on Saturday . Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan (left) says he will quit his position if found guilty by the FA . Shaun Maloney opened the scoring with a stunning free-kick that looped over the Middlesbrough wall . He became obdurate, possibly annoyed as talk turned to Whelan’s promise from earlier in the day to resign if the FA so much as suggest he is racist. ‘I’ll talk to you about the game, guys, because you’ve had your pound of flesh from me on everything else,’ Mackay said. On the conversation went: ‘But Malky, doesn’t it concern you that he is even considering stepping down? He’s the owner, he brought you in.’ Mackay replied: ‘I’ll talk all day long about football. If you’re here for different agendas you’re wasting your time.’ With that, it was possible to deduce that he wanted to draw a line under the public discussion of his text messages and the ham-fisted justifications from his new employers. Football talk only, please. Patrick Bamford spoiled Wigan's party with his equaliser for Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium . Bamford celebrates with team-mate George Friend (top) after his goal levelled the scores at 1-1 . Except Mackay is still the subject of a farcically long Football Association investigation and until its conclusions are reached, the suggestion that issues of racist, homophobic and sexist texts — and the consequences of Whelan talking about those issues — should be parked is hopeful in the extreme. Then again, this is football, where serious issues go with the wind if results are right. At least Mackay got that much right on Saturday. Middlesbrough are a top-three side and came in on the back of one defeat in 12; Wigan are bottom three and had won one in 12. But there was no escaping what has gone on. Wigan’s shirts carried a black strip across the shoulders where once was the name of Premier Range, a sponsor that no longer wants the association. A Wigan supporter backs Latics chairman Whelan after a difficult week in which he was branded a 'racist' Whelan looked on without many smiles. The 77-year-old owner was clapped to his seat ahead of the match. He appeared to wipe tears from his eyes. They love Whelan in the stadium that carries his name. As one supporter’s sign read: ‘Dave Whelan is a legend.’ It added: ‘Football is a game, do not mix with politics.’ Only politics has nothing to do with this. It is about views that are unacceptable from anyone, even those who work in football. It would be ambitious to expect that penny to drop any time soon.","Malky Mackay's first game in charge of Wigan ended in a 1-1 draw .

"The 16-year-old Connecticut student accused of killing a classmate who turned down his offer to go to prom, told police after the attack: 'I did it,' court documents show. Christopher Plaskon has been charged with murder as an adult over the death of Maren Sanchez, a friend who was killed last week in a hallway of Jonathan Law High School in Milford. A witness saw Plaskon on top of 16-year-old Maren during the attack and others saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit released on Tuesday. Detained: Chris Plaskon is being charged with murder as an adult over the stabbing of a girl at his school . Victim: Maren Sanchez, pictured with her boyfriend Jarrod Butts, was stabbed to death on Friday morning . Plaskon was dressed in bloody clothes and was being held inside the . principal's office when an officer arrived and asked . what happened on Friday. Held: Plakson, pictured here in his yearbook, is being evaluated at a medical facility . 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according . to the officer. The attack was carried out before the school's junior prom, and police have been investigating whether it was related to Maren's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date. Plaskon was being held at a medical facility, where his attorneys say he is undergoing psychiatric evaluation. He was arraigned Tuesday at the medical facility, but he is to be transferred to the custody of the Correction Department, with bond set at $3 million. He faces arraignment in adult court Friday. Plaskon's family said on Tuesday they . join the community in mourning the loss of life as the town struggles to . understand what led to the crime. 'Words . can only fall short in conveying the depth and breadth of the raw . sadness we are left with by this unimaginable tragedy,' the family . said. 'We join with the . entire Milford community to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of . this most vibrant and exceptional young woman.' His family thanked relatives, friends and neighbors for reaching out to them in what they called their darkest hour. 'We . pray for the wisdom to guide us as we desperately try to pull together . the shattered pieces of our families,' the family said. Tribute: Friends and family release balloons for Maren Sanchez on Monday, at the school's football field . Show of support: A candlelit vigil for Maren is held on Monday evening at the school she and Plaskon attended . Touched: Balloons in Maren's favorite color, purple, are carried into the school grounds during a memorial to the popular student who was stabbed before prom . Attorney Richard Meehan said Plaskon was being held for medical evaluation, which can last for up to 15 days. He said doctors typically order such involuntary commitments in cases where someone in custody is considered a danger to himself. Mr Meehan added that the teenager's family were reeling from the attack. 'His family is devastated not only for him, but the youngster who was killed. It's a terrible situation all the way around,' he said. Mark Robinson, a technical education teacher, said he was walking into the high school on Friday when he saw Plaskon being taken out in handcuffs. He said Plaskon, the third of five brothers, was on football teams that he coached when the teenager had been a freshman and sophomore. Plans: Maren Sanchez, pictured in the dress she had planned to wear to prom, was excited about the dance which was due to attend with her new boyfriend . Heartbreaking: Maren's boyfriend Jarrod Butts holds up the dress that the teenager planned to wear to their junior prom as friends gathered in her honor on Friday at the beach . He said Plaskon has a good sense of humor and the family has deep roots in the community. 'There's no reason to suspect he would have done this. I think that's what makes it harder,' Mr Robinson said. Imani Langston, a student who saw Plaskon being read his rights and taken away in a police car, added that he was known as a class clown and had never been violent. She said Maren and the boy were just friends and had never dated. Maren had been excited about prom and had put pictures online of her posing in the dress she planned to wear to it. The dance has been postponed indefinitely and, instead of going to the dance, the students gathered for a memorial for Maren.","Christopher Plaskon, 16, is charged as an adult with murder .

"Around 20 former guards at the Majdanek death camp in Poland could face charges in Germany, following a widespread probe of the Nazi SS men and women who served there during the Second World War, war crimes investigators said Tuesday. Federal prosecutor Kurt Schrimm, who heads Germany's special Nazi war crimes office, said he expects to turn the cases over to state investigators within two weeks for them to pursue accessory to murder charges. Schrimm's office has no power to file charges itself. Lead investigator Thomas Will told The Associated Press that about 30 suspects were identified and located, but around ten had already died. Around 20 former guards at the Majdanek death camp (pictured) could face charges in Germany, following a widespread probe of the Nazi SS men and women who served there . Seeking justice: Federal prosecutor Kurt Schrimm, who heads Germany's special Nazi war crimes office, said he expects to turn the cases over to state investigators within two weeks . The remaining 20 men and women all live in Germany, he said, but refused to elaborate further. Some 220 others are still being investigated for possible charges but have not been located. The Majdanek probe is the second major review of death camp guards undertaken after Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011 became the first person to be convicted in Germany solely for serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing. Though Demjanjuk always denied serving at the death camp and died before his appeal could be heard, Schrimm's office in September recommended that state prosecutors pursue charges against 30 former Auschwitz guards based on his case. Heartbreaking: Prisoners of Majdanek concentration camp, as they were found by Allied troops in 1944 . The office then started investigating about 1,000 former guards at Majdanek - another death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where some 360,000 Jews and others were killed. While Majdanek was also used as a labor camp - meaning guards theoretically could have worked there at certain times and not been involved in the Nazi genocide - prosecutors focused on guards allegedly present during the killings. The Auschwitz investigation also continues and Schrimm said he expects more suspects will be announced 'in the coming months'. Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi-hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, urged state prosecutors to prioritize the new cases, given the advanced age of the suspects. 'We are very hopeful that the work will be expedited so as many people as possible can be brought to justice,' he said.

"A teenage girl who was dumped by her 'controlling' boyfriend committed suicide by deliberately stepping into the path of traffic on a dark motorway, an inquest heard. Lena Begum, 18, had been wandering around the three lane carriageway for up to two hours during which she recorded a 3am voicemail message for Quzlam Ahmed saying: 'You will probably love me one day the way I loved you, but it will be too late.' Minutes later the dental student was killed after walking in front of a van travelling at almost 60mph along the inside lane of the M65 near her home in Burnley, Lancashire. Lena Begum, 18, died when she walked into the path of a van on an unlit motorway because she was upset by a boyfriend who 'treated her very poorly', a coroner said . The inquest heard that the driver, John Trainer, was . unable to spot Lena until it was too late because the street lights on . the motorway had been switched off by highway chiefs to cut costs. Lena, . who studied at Blackburn College, had met Mr Ahmed, known as 'Kammy', . in October 2012, but he been 'controlling' and treating her 'poorly', it . emerged at the hearing. Her . parents - from a traditional Bengali family - became concerned about . the relationship and had reported Lena missing several times from the . family home in Reedley. After Mr Ahmed hit her on her 18th . birthday and told her he had no longer wanted a relationship, Lena . threatened to self-harm, claiming she was 'not afraid of dying' and that . 'death held no fear for her'. Lena’s . friend, Taslena Alam, told the Burnley hearing how the teenager was . 'mentally obsessed' and 'crazy' about Ahmed, and had even etched the . name 'Kammy' into her arm. She . said Lena would 'drop everything' to meet Mr Ahmed whenever he called, and . as the relationship developed she went from being 'happy and fun' to . 'depressed'. In a statement, she said Lena had told her she would 'go onto a motorway and get herself run over.' Miss Alam said: 'I kept telling her to stop seeing him but she didn’t listen.' Lena was upset about her relationship with a boyfriend who 'treated her very poorly', the coroner said . Lena's mother Selina Begum, pictured above, tried calling her daughter 16 times in the hours before she died . On the night of the tragedy on April 10 last year, Miss Alam said she and . Lena had been at the home of a friend Marcia Khan before heading to a . shisha bar, where guests smoke flavoured tobacco in pipes. Afterwards Lena asked to be dropped . off on a road near the motorway. Miss Alam said: 'All I remember is her . going up some stairs, she seemed happy. She wasn’t saying about hurting . herself, she never said anything.' Miss . Khan said during the evening Lena had confided in her about her romance . with Ahmed. She said: 'Lena was saying how he didn’t love her and she . just wanted him to love her, that she does everything for him and he . doesn’t do anything. 'She was being quiet - before that . conversation she was happy and bubbly. I’d heard a few things that she . had tried doing things in the past but didn’t believe that she had the . ability.' She said at the . end of the evening, Lena had, 'walked up the stairs, turned around and . smiled'. She added: 'I smiled back.That was the last time I saw her. 'She said she wanted to see her friend, and made it sound so realistic.' But . half an hour later Lena was spotted walking down the motorway slip road . and into oncoming traffic, recording messages to loved ones as she held . her mobile phone. Deliveryman John Trainer said he could not see Lena until it was too late because the road lights were off . Scene: The inquest heard that Lena spent up to two hours wandering around the motorway before she died . Tailbacks: Lena was hit by the van shortly before 4am on Wednesday 10 April last year when the road was dark . Driver . Michelle Harris, who was coming off the motorway, said: 'She was not . dawdling, not staggering and appeared to be doing something with her . mobile phone, holding it up with both hands at chest level. 'I thought she was texting. I slowed . and came to a stop and looked in my mirror and couldn’t see her. I . thought she could have broken down.' The . inquest heard that deliveryman John Trainer, 48, was driving his . Mercedes Sprinter van in the inside lane of the motorway at 3.50am when . Lena walked in front of him. His statement read: 'There was no lighting, the area was pitch black. For a split second I caught a glimpse of a person who was walking across . from lane two, almost at the line divider. 'I . pressed the brakes as hard as I could, I swerved to avoid. She didn’t . even look towards me, she just continued to walk across. I couldn’t . avoid the collision. 'I . don’t believe I could have done anything to avoid her, I do believe if . there were motorway lights I would have seen her sooner and slowed down a . lot sooner.' Lena was . pronounced dead at the scene despite attempts to save her. Records . showed she had spoken to Ahmed twice on the phone for around 30 minutes. At 2.05 am she posted a picture to Facebook and Twitter, and earlier in the evening posted messages on social networking sites. Twitter feed: Lena left messages for her friends and family on social media before she stepped in front of a van . One read: 'I just wana say a big thank you ta all my true mates that have been there for me & my family, love ya loads.' The other said: 'Only thing that I would want from ya is ta remember me please more than anything else.' Mr Ahmed, who did not attend the inquest, said in a statement he had last seen Lena four days before her death and had changed his number because she was 'pestering' him. He confirmed he had spoken to her at around 2am on 10 April and she had told him she 'didn’t want to live any more', saying if he 'didn’t want to be with her, she didn’t want to be here'. 'I . pressed the brakes as hard as I could, I swerved to avoid.  She didn't . even look towards me, she just continued to walk across.' Deliveryman John Trainer, 48 . Telephone logs revealed Lena’s mother Selina Begum had tried calling her daughter 16 times between midnight and the time of her death, and police later found Lena had recorded messages on her phone. One said: 'When I’m out of this s***** world and up there, that’s when you will realise.' PC Richard Roberts said of the crash scene: 'Street lighting was inoperative and turned off in 2011 as part of a cost saving scheme. It was very dark.' Recording a verdict of suicide, assistant coroner Mark Williams said: 'Lena had formed a relationship but it did not appear to be any good for her or her well-being. 'In the last few weeks of that relationship he was calling it off and she didn’t want that. She was obsessed by him, crazy for him, she scratched his name into her arm. 'The impression I get is that he treated her very poorly.' He added: 'There was nothing Mr Trainer could do after Lena suddenly appeared in the headlights. 'She has done a deliberate act of walking in front of the van and he was unable to do anything to avoid a collision.' After the inquest, Lena’s mother Selina Begum said: 'She was a lovely girl, everyone loved her. She was my only girl, she had two younger brothers who she looked after. 'As a mother this has been really traumatic.  My life is over, only when I’m dead will this be gone. She was a bright girl studying dentistry, hoping to become a dental nurse. 'She had wanted to do chemistry. Her death hurts so much.'

"Friends and relatives of the innocent man shot dead by an NYPD rookie have revealed he was about to start a new job with the city authority as he prepared to offer his two-year-old daughter a stable future. Neighbors paid tribute to Akai Gurley, 28, telling reporters he was a well-mannered member of the apartment block that never caused trouble. Their words added to mounting pressure on the DA to launch a full investigation into the Thursday night shooting in Brooklyn, which has been described by NYPD authorities as 'an unfortunate tragedy'. 'He was about to start work': Friends have paid tribute to Akai Gurley who was shot dead as he was due to start work with the city authority. The DA has launched a full investigation into the shooting on Thursday . 'Well-mannered': Neighbors said he never caused any trouble and got along with the community . 'He was happy that he was about to go to work, he was relieved,' 28-year-old Dente Crosby, Gurley's friend, told the New York Times. 'He was getting it all together,' a woman who wished to remain anonymous told the paper. 'He was becoming an actor, he was going to school for modeling and he was going to work for the city.' However, aside from a meeting between Brooklyn officials and the DA's office, a full investigation has yet to be launched. Gurley was killed by Officer Peter Liang, whom police say fired his pistol by accident while he was patrolling a dimly-lit staircase at a notorious Brooklyn apartment block. Crowds gathered on Sunday to demand answers from the police force at a protest where Gurley's two-year-old daughter Akaila said she misses her father. 'I miss my daddy': Akaila Gurley, whose father was killed by the NYPD, said she misses him . Explanation: Last night officials said Ballinger was speaking to a psychologist about how to tell Akaila what has happened to her father . Innocent: Gurley was walking down the stairs (right) with his girlfriend's apartment in Brooklyn . Family members including Akai's aunt, sister and Akaila's mother, Kimblerly Ballinger, were at a protest organized by the National Action Network in Harlem today. Akaila gave the heartbreaking message to the crowd via the Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at the event, according to an ABC reporter. Sources from Sharpton's National Action Network have previously said that Akaila doesn't understand that her father has died. It came not long after his sister swore not to rest until she has answers as to why another black man has been killed by law enforcement. Liang killed Gurley while he was was reportedly walking down a dimly-lit staircase at the Louis Pink Houses, weapon drawn. Police say he fired by accident. Protests: Akai Gurley's daughter, two-year-old Akaila, right, attended a protest with her mother Kimberly Ballinger, center, where Rev. Al Sharpton, left, criticized police . Answers: Gurley's family have sworn not to let the killing rest and pursue police . The incident - described as an 'unfortunate tragedy' by NYPD commissioner William Bratton - has prompted protests from Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, which is holding the Harlem rally today. Kimberly Ballinger, mother to Gurley's daughter Akaila, rested the child on her lap before speeches were made calling for a full investigation. Speaking at the event, Sharpton demanded answers for why Liang was walking around with the safety on his weapon switched off, which he called a long-standing problem. He said: 'The issue of police going up dark stairwells with their guns drawn and their safety off is at the center of this... We have raised this question over and over again. ... It is a matter of police policy', according to NBC. Yesterday his sister Akisha Pringle wrote on Facebook, saying: 'I can't believe my Big Bro is actually gone man. He just got out of prison… Him and I was just talking about how we was gonna surprise my mother on Thanksgiving day. 'I'm so broken. He did nothing wrong and now I'll never ever get a chance to see, hug or kiss hear from him… the cops are so dirty, man. 'But best believe this will not rest with my family. We are about to have problems. I'm so sick of innocent black people going down for no apparent reason at all. And now it's my brother.' The complex where Gurley was shot had recently seen a shooting, robberies and assaults. Last night Ballinger and other family members met with New York officials, who apologized for the death. An official from Sharpton's National Action Network said outside the meeting: ''Things are a little tense right now as you can imagine.' The official added that Ballinger was consulting a psychologist to help explain Gurley's death to his 2-year-old daughter, which was 'a very difficult thing to have to explain to a child when you've always taught them that the police were there to be our friends and to protect us.' Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling Gurley's death a 'tragedy,' met with some of his relatives Friday evening. Police Commissioner William Bratton similarly described the shooting as a tragedy and said the 28-year-old man was 'totally innocent' and wasn't engaged in criminal activity when the officer fired his weapon. Notorious: The block of apartments where Gurley was shot (pictured) is a know hotspot for crime . Why exactly Officer Peter Liang had his gun drawn and fired while patrolling the Louis Pink Houses in Brooklyn's gritty East New York neighborhood with his partner late Thursday night wasn't immediately clear. Liang, 26, has been placed on modified duty. Police policy dictates that he must first be interviewed by the district attorney's office, which will decide whether to file criminal charges, before internal affairs officers can question. Police say the officers had descended onto an eighth-floor landing when, 14 steps away, Gurley and a girlfriend had opened a door into the seventh-floor landing. They had just decided to take the stairs down instead of waiting longer for an elevator. The lights were burned out in the stairwell, leaving it 'pitch black' and prompting both officers to use flashlights, Bratton said. Liang was about 10 feet from Gurley when, without a word and apparently by accident, he fired a shot, police said. In general, officers have discretion on whether to draw their weapons based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter, Bratton said. Gurley and the girlfriend, Melissa Butler, made it down two flights of stairs after he was shot, but he collapsed on the fifth-floor landing and lost consciousness, according to reports. Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died. Gurley's stepfather, Kenneth Palmer, said officials called his relatives in Jacksonville, Florida, to notify them of the death. 'He was a peacemaker,' he said.","Akai Gurley, 28, had just been offered a job with the city authority .

"A father, who saved his five-year-old daughter after their kayak capsized on a  dam, has been described as 'selfless' by his church family. Ben Urquhart was a lifelong member of the The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in Bathurst, NSW and news of his tragic death has shocked the congregation. In a statement the church said the 36-year-old had a 'selfless tendancy to help others in need - a quality he employed even in the final heroic moments of his life'. Emergency services responded to reports of two people in trouble at Chifley Dam near Bathurst in the NSW Central Tablelands at about 7.30pm on Saturday. Police were told the kayak had flipped, putting the 36-year-old man and his little girl into the water who were not wearing life jackets at the time. A father drowned after saving his five-year-old daughter when their kayak capsized on Chifley Dam near Bathurst in the NSW Central Tablelands at about 7.30pm on Saturday . A spokesman for the church said the married father-of-three was remembered for his work with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. They added: 'Mr Urquhart was a member of the rapid relief team, a group that offers charity, including in natural disasters. 'The team provided catering and refreshments to Rural Fire Service (RFS) teams during last year's bushfires. 'More recently the Bathurst-based team cooked for rescue teams looking for missing bushwalker Sevak Simonian in the Blue Mountains.' Bathurst Inspector Andrew Spliet told Daily Mail Australia that witnesses helped get the little girl onto their kayak, but her father then disappeared under the water. 'A number of people entered the water and tried to locate the man but it all happened very quickly,' he said. He said there were about 30 - 40 people at the dam at the time as it was a popular spot for water sports, fishing and power boats . Just before 9pm, police rescue officers recovered the man's body a short distance from where the kayak had capsized. Inspector Spliet said it was still unknown how the man drowned but it may have been due to exhaustion after saving his daughter in the water that was anywhere from 3.5 - 5m deep. He urged people to always wear life jackets when heading out onto the water. 'It's confident to say that the man would not be deceased if they were wearing life jackets,' he said. 'Also if you are going to enter waterways ensure you are a competent swimmer who is confident in deep water.' Police will prepare a report for the coroner and are still investigating how Mr Urquhart drowned but don't believe dam conditions were rough or there were strong currents.","Ben Urquhart has been described as 'selfless' by his church family .

"By the time Rory McIlroy has finished you do wonder if there will be any meaningful record left in Europe that doesn’t have his name attached. The bar appeared to have been set forbiddingly high with Sir Nick Faldo’s six majors and Colin Montgomerie’s remarkable tally of eight Orders of Merit, but the Northern Irishman is now so far ahead of the game even these storied records will surely not survive the passage of time. Faldo and Monty were both 30 years old when they first started on their twin pillars of achievement. Rory McIlroy has sealed another Race to Dubai victory with the season's climax still to come . The world No 1 has earned more than twice as many points as his closest competitors on the tour . At just 25, McIlroy is two-thirds of the way to Faldo’s total and on Sunday was formally declared the winner of the Race to Dubai for the second time in three years. The latter is the modern-day equivalent of the Order of Merit but might also have to be renamed if McIlroy keeps winning it before the race ever gets within view of the Emirate. With more than twice as many points as the man in second place, McIlroy actually lapped the field despite not playing for the past six weeks and there’s no reason to think this will not happen again and again over the next decade, just as it did in America with Tiger Woods. One smidgeon of hope for the rest might be if he concentrates on the PGA Tour but his schedule this year suggests the opposite will be the case. Colin Montgomerie (left) and Nick Faldo had set the bar high, but McIlroy looks set to rise to the challenge . Look at what happened. After a year’s absence, McIlroy played in the Dubai Desert Classic in February and admitted it had been a mistake leaving it off his list. In May, his previous ambivalence towards the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth was dismissed with a series of statements where he declared it is the event all Europeans should compete in. The Irish Open is now run by his own charitable trust, while the Scottish Open can surely look forward to McIlroy’s support for the foreseeable future after this year’s event proved such a valuable dry run for his victory at The Open the following week. He also turned up at the Alfred Dunhill Links in Scotland in October. If he continues at this rate McIlroy could dominate Europe the way Tiger Woods did in America . One criticism of the Race to Dubai is that you can win it almost without setting foot in Europe, given winnings from the American majors and World Golf Championship events all count. Well, McIlroy not only won more money than anyone else on the European Tour’s international schedule, he also won more than anyone else if you just counted events in Europe. I’m told it might be nine months before we know the name of George O’Grady’s successor as the tour’s chief executive. Whoever it proves to be, what a stroke of fortune to have a world No 1 on board who is both fully committed to playing his part and set to dominate for years to come. Koepka closes in on Rookie prize . It took 49 years for an American to win the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award on the European Tour. Now, following Peter Uihlein’s success last year, it appears almost certain his great friend Brooks Koepka will become the 50th. Brooks Koepka is almost certain to become the second American in two years to be Rookie of the Year . Koepka’s victory over Ian Poulter at the Turkish Airlines Open on Sunday was the most rewarding part yet of their wonderful three-year road trip. Forsaking the chance to establish themselves in their homeland, the two great buddies set out in 2012 to see the world and earn their playing privileges far away from home. They started out on the Challenge Tour and have graduated so spectacularly they’re now claiming prestigious prizes on the main circuit. Koepka played brilliantly to beat Ian Poulter to last week's Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya . In particular, 24-year-old Koepka (left) looks ready to add his name to the crop of driven young Americans who are going to make the next Ryder Cup an awful lot closer than the last one. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘The last psychiatrist I spoke to recommended taking up golf to relieve stress — and that’s a bad idea. Golf’s more stressful than combat.’ It might sound like a bad joke from a second-rate comic but the eye-catching remarks actually belong to Rob O’Neill, the Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama bin Laden. He was speaking to the New York Post. On Turnberry’s own website, the par-four ninth on the Ailsa course is described as a spectacular par four but it’s clearly not enough for Donald Trump, who recently bought the Open venue on the Ayrshire coast. Donald Trump wants to make the picturesque course even more spectacular by tranforming the ninth hole . The tycoon has declared his intention to turn it into a breathtaking par three. To be fair, from the back tee over the rocks to a green perched just the other side, with the fabled lighthouse adjacent, you can see what he is envisaging. His hopes are naturally understated. ‘It will be the most spectacular short hole in the world,’ he said.","Rory McIlroy has sealed his second Race to Dubai in three years .

A Republican Congressman, Flake and his youngest sons, Taller, 15, and Dallin, 13, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to Biggarenn, in the North Pacific Ocean, without any food or water. Part of the Marshall Islands, the beach front destination offered no amenities, forcing the Flakes to catch and cook their own food, purify their water, and swim with the sharks to procure their meals.

Flake and his two boys lived off the island, eating a unvaried diet of coconuts, crab, and fish, which they captured themselves and cooked over an open fire started with a magnifying glass. The Flakes swam in the ocean and speared fish for their meals. They also brought along a lobster trap, but soon after arriving, it was mangled by a shark who tried to get at the fish caught inside. That was only to be the Flake's first fight with sharks over food. Flake told The Washington Post that one of the most memorable moments of the trip was when he and his 15-year were pursed by sharks, who they had to race back to the shore, after spearing a fish in the ocean. Fishing: Flake and his sons (one of whom is seen here) brought no food with them to the island, but rather speared their own fish from the ocean and cooked it over an open fire . Success: Dallin, 13, shows off a fish that he speared for lunch in the ocean while on a survivalist vacation in the Marshall Islands with his Senator father . The Senator and his son got away unharmed and laughed as they retold the story to a television reporter at KSAZ Fox 10 News. The family lived outdoors during their time on island, sleeping in hammocks under the stars. 'It’s not just a regular Boy Scout camp, it’s more survival,' Flake told The Post. The Flakes didn't even bring any drinking water to the island, but instead had two desalinators, which they had to pump for an hour each night to turn the ocean water into drinkable water. Roughing it hundreds of miles from civilization, the Senator and his sons had very little contact with the rest of the world over the four days. Cooking: Tanner, 15, eats from a roasted coconut shell that he found and prepared on the desert island . The Island of Biggarenn is located between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. The Senator and his boys traveled from their hometown of Phoenix to Hawaii, and from there to the Marshall Islands. They then took a three hour boat ride aboard a small fishing boat to Biggarenn, which Flake told the paper was just 55 to 70 acres wide. The entire trip with travel time lasted a week. However, the Senator did stay connected to his constituents and his wife with a satellite phone, which he brought along at her insistence, he told the paper. Sleeping: Flake and his sons roughed it on their survivalist vacation, sleeping out under the stars on hammocks . Diet: While on the island, the Flakes captured, killed, and cooked their own food, which consisted of a diet of crabs, fish, and coconuts . Dinner: Senator Jeff Flake shows off a big fish that he speared off the waters of Biggarenn island . For entertainment, the boys brought along an exercise ball, which they half buried under the sand and did back flips from. The extraordinary nature of the trip aside, Flake told interviewers that his favorite part of the vacation was just to spend some alone time with his sons. 'I tell ya, for a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no distractions, no texting. Just talking,' he told The Post. Fun: Flake's teenage sons brought an exercise ball to the desert island, which they half buried in the sand and did flips off of to entertain themselves. In this picture 15-year-old Tanner is captured mid-flip . Snorkeling: Tanner and Dallin swim off the coast of the Marshall Islands where the explored the sea life and fished for their meals using spears . The recent family outing marked the Senator's second visit to the Marshall Islands, the first being in 2009 when he went on a similar survivalist vacation for seven days by himself. When asked why travel to a deserted island and not a more popular vacation spot, Flake told Buzzfeed simply, 'Everybody goes to Disneyland.' However, in travel diaries published from his first trip in The Washington Post Flake revealed that the trip had been a long time dream. 'I have the best job in the world, but still the islands beckon,' he wrote. Sharks: The Flakes swam with sharks in the waters surrounding the island. They were even chased by one in pursuit of a fish the family had speared for dinner . Flake published the journals to give the public full disclosure about his time away from service after a scandal emerged in June 2009 exposing then-South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford's secret trip abroad to see his girlfriend. 'My wife said, you know that nobody’s going to believe you were out on the island alone, right?,' Flake told the paper in his recent interview. 'And that’s when I decided to go through the Post and just gave her my journal entries and the pictures I’d taken, and I thought that was better, so people knew more that they wouldn’t assume.' Family vacation: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake took his two teenage sons on an unconventional survivalist vacation to Biggarenn, an uninhabited desert island in the Marshall Islands. Seen here the family poses together on the beach . Home: Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, seen here speaking after his win on election night, took his two young sons (Tanner, left, and Dallin, far left) on an extreme vacation to the Marshall Islands . Flake promised to take his sons back with him to the island after his two-year Senatorial campaign concluded. Both trips were arranged with the help of the ambassador to the U.S. from the Marshall Islands who Flake told the paper is 'a friend.' Flake will release the journals recording his most recent trip soon. Though the island was hundreds of miles away from Washington Flake told the Post he did have one political revelation while on vacation, 'That this ought to be mandatory. We’d all discover that no man is an island.' Watch video here: .","Arizona Senator Jeff Blake took his two teenage sons on a survivalist vacation to Biggarenn, a remote, uninhabited desert island .

"Lukas Podolski wants to discuss his future at Arsenal with manager Arsene Wenger after being left on the bench again during the Gunners' 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United. The 29-year-old has started just one Premier League game so far this season, with the north London side enduring their worst start to a league campaign in 32 years. Wenger's men already find themselves 15 points behind the leaders Chelsea and lie in eighth place in the Premier League after just three wins. Lukas Podolski is all smiles as he enjoys a day out at Winter Wonderland with his family on Sunday .

I want a fair chance. 'I love London, I like the club, but I do not like the situation. I'm not a clown.' Despite Arsenal's on-field problems the German was all smiles as he enjoyed a day out at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park on Sunday, even managing to joke about his current situation. The out-of-favour forward posted a picture of himself at the attraction on Twitter with the message: 'Enjoyed my rainy Sunday afternoon at Winter Wonderland with the family' #hydepark #gunnersumbrella #familytime #dayout #EnjoyLife #Poldi #BreakFromTheBench .

With Olivier Giroud returning from his injury lay-off earlier than expected, Podolski's first-team opportunities are unlikely to improve any time soon. The former Bayern Munich striker has made his feelings clear that he is not prepared to sit on the bench for much longer, refusing to rule out a move away from the Gunners in the upcoming January transfer window. Next up for Wenger's men is a Champions League match-up against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, with a point guaranteeing Arsenal's pathway through to the last 16 stage.","Lukas Podolski was an unused substitute for Arsenal against Manchester United on Saturday .

Lewis Hamilton waved the Union Flag aloft after winning his second — and historic — Formula One World Championship. ‘This is the greatest moment of my life,’ said Hamilton, having become only the fourth British driver to win multiple world championships and the first to do so since Sir Jackie Stewart in 1971. His race victory here was easier than expected after his only rival, Nico Rosberg, had a battery failure, but by then Hamilton was already on his way to the championship, which he claimed by 67 points.

I feel it’s not really happening. ‘My first title in 2008 was special but the feeling I have now is way, way past that.’ Hamilton, who won 11 of the 19 races during the season, was supported by his father Anthony and singer-songwriter girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, who flew over unexpectedly at the last moment. ‘I didn’t sleep last night,’ said Hamilton, 29. ‘I went to bed at about 1am and woke at 5am. I went for a run and a massage. I thought I would be tired for the race but I felt composed. ‘My family came and surprised me at breakfast, which was a really great thing.’ He texted them after qualifying, in which he was beaten to pole position by Rosberg, to say he would like them with him despite originally asking them to stay away so he could concentrate on his task. By the time he contacted them, they were already about to board a plane.

"It was the evening that will forever be remembered as 'Crystanbul.' The collapse from three goals in front with just 11 minutes left that saw Liverpool's title dreams die in a flood of tears. The sight of their distraught talisman Luis Suarez breaking down on the Selhurst Park pitch and being consoled by captain Steven Gerrard went down in Premier League folklore. It was so near and yet so far for Brendan Rodgers and his team. They had made it until the penultimate match of the campaign and still had hope, but that was obliterated by the boot of Dwight Gayle and Manchester City lifted the trophy. Steven Gerrard (left) and Dejan Lovren look dejected after Palace take the lead during the second-half . Martin Skrtel and Raheem Sterling react as Palace go 2-1 ahead through Joe Ledley with 13 minutes left . Brendan Rodgers looks exasperated with his side as they struggled to cope with Palace's pace . Mile Jedinak (second left) celebrates after scoring Palace's third goal with a free-kick late on . CLICK HERE TO READ MATT BARLOW'S REPORT FROM SELHURST PARK . Six months on and Liverpool returned to the scene of their nightmare. The home fans were not in a sympathetic mood, chanting '3-0 and you f***ed it up' in the direction of the away section during the first-half. As if the travelling hordes needed reminding - this venerable old ground will now forever send a shiver down the spine. The Liverpool team that walked out at Selhurst Park this time was similar in composition and yet much changed in confidence. Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Glen Johnson, Joe Allen, Gerrard and Raheem Sterling all remained, joined by a quartet of summer recruits and Philippe Coutinho, who came off the bench back in May. This season's Liverpool have been a pale imitation of the swashbuckling side who challenged for honours last season with such elan and class. Last season's 3-3 draw, in which Liverpool surrendered a three-goal lead, became known as 'Crystanbul' - here, Steven Gerrard consoles Luis Suarez at the final whistle back in May . Palace's Yannick Bolasie tormented Liverpool's Javi Manquillo all afternoon . Bolasie (right) celebrates with Dwight Gayle after the striker brought Palace level on 16 minutes . A close-up of Brendan Rodgers' face as Palace begin to dominate proceedings at Selhurst Park . CLICK HERE FOR MORE STATISTICS FROM THE MATCH IN OUR MATCH ZONE . Their mid-table position is testament to that. No performance has matched those against, say, Arsenal (5-1), Manchester United (3-0) and Manchester City (3-2) last season. They have been nowhere near as good. With Suarez long gone and Daniel Sturridge and Mario Balotelli sidelined, there had been worries about where Liverpool's cutting edge would come from here. However, a goal inside 90 seconds seemed to put those fears to rest. Adam Lallana pinged an exceptional 50-yard diagonal ball over the top to his former Southampton team-mate Rickie Lambert and the striker, who had got beyond former Red Martin Kelly, finished coolly beneath Julian Speroni. It was his first goal for the club and an encouraging sign for Rodgers of a striker trying to prove a point. Unfortunately for the Liverpool manager, that would be their brightest moment all afternoon. Lallana was Liverpool's most impressive player, with every pass he attempted in the first half finding its intended recipient. He maintained the high standards after the break too until he went off for Fabio Borini with 20 minutes left. Rickie Lambert celebrates after opening the scoring for Liverpool just 90 seconds into the match . Lambert was found by an excellent cross-field ball from Adam Lallana . Adam Lallana was Liverpool's best performer with his accurate passing . But the same could not be said of his team-mates. Palace may be in the relegation zone but they dominated the majority of the match, the pace of their rampaging attacking players causing problems. Javi Manquillo was tormented by Yannick Bolasie, who beat him on far too many occasions and was permitted to fire in four shots during the first-half. But his most telling contribution led to Palace's equaliser after 16 minutes. Even more galling for Liverpool was that it was Dwight Gayle, two-goal hero of 'Crystanbul', who scored again. Liverpool's defence panicked when Bolaise attacked them with speed, cracking his shot against the base of the post. Skrtel was painfully slow to react and Gayle followed it in to finish. The entire Liverpool back line made just one tackle between them in the opening 45 minutes, a damning statistic that shows how they struggled to contain Palace's pace. An unsuccessful challenge from Sterling in the centre of the pitch led to Bolasie's run for Palace's equaliser . Bolasie sets off on another forward run at Liverpool's vulnerable defensive line . Bolasie was named Man of the Match after his rampaging performance down the left wing . The stats showed how Bolasie continually got the better of Manquillo . They looked stretched all-too-often and that vulnerability cost them when Joe Ledley scored Palace's second with 12 minutes remaining. Liverpool had actually been enjoying their best spell of the game but when Bolasie left Dejan Lovren for dead wide right to centre, leaving the unmarked Ledley with a simple finish. Mile Jedinak's magnificent free-kick shortly afterwards set the seal on a deserved Palace win that underlined just how far Liverpool have regressed. They dominated possession but looked ineffective with it in advanced areas. The jaw-dropping pace with which they attacked defences last season is absent - Sterling was anonymous all afternoon. Allen and Gerrard registered a high percentage of accurate passes but few could be described as threatening to the Palace back-line. Bolasie got the better of Dejan Lovren in the run-up to Joe Ledley's goal - Palace's second . Raheem Sterling walks off following a disappointing performance at Palace . Sterling's heat map shows his lack of influence during Liverpool's defeat . Rodgers cuts a dejected - and very soggy - figure at the end of the match . But it is that defensive line that is of greatest concern. The summer signings Lovren and Manquillo don't look comfortable and they were dragged out of shape with regularity and ease by a team second-bottom in the table. This was Liverpool's fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions and their slide continues. Just two points now split these two teams. The famously vocal Palace support serenaded them with 'can we play you every week' towards the close. Anyone would fancy their chances against this Liverpool side at the moment.","Liverpool suffered a fourth straight defeat at Crystal Palace on Sunday .

"Ghoncheh Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, London, served 149 days of a one-year sentence . A London law graduate who was jailed after trying to watch a volleyball game in Iran has been freed on bail, her family have said. British-Iranian Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was part of a group of women arrested for 'propaganda against the regime' in June while staging a protest when they were refused entrance. She was released from Gharchak prison in Tehran today, the day before her 26th birthday. Iran's Sharq newspaper said on its Twitter account that she was released after paying bail amounting to £24,000. Her brother Iman, who started a petition against her detention, said: 'A few hours ago my sister was bailed out for her birthday on Monday. It is so good to be home. I finally heard her voice after 149 days. It was a very emotional moment. My mother couldn't stop crying. 'She just needs to recover now. I don't think she realises about the campaign to free her. She needs to come to terms with it all. 'But she is not free yet. Bail is not freedom. 'Yesterday the judge issued the verdict of one year imprisonment and two years prohibition from leaving Iran. Ghoncheh will soon defend her innocence again in the court of appeal. 'We hope she will be vindicated of all charges and be allowed to come back to the UK to continue her studies. 'You have been by our side throughout this difficult ordeal and I thought to share this moment with you. I hope you stay with us until Ghoncheh is free for good.' Mr Ghavami said that his sister's health had deteriorated due to hunger strikes she carried out while in prison. On October 1 she went on 'wet' hunger strike - refusing all food but taking liquid - for 14 days, in protest at the conditions of her detention. Miss Ghavami’s mother, Susan Moshtaghian, wrote on Facebook: 'Ghoncheh returned home from prison. We picked her up at 3pm from Qarchak prison. 'She is bailed out till her court of appeal. We thank all of you that stayed with us and I hope the court accept the complete innocence of my daughter.' Miss Ghavami, circled, was arrested at this impromptu protest outside an international volleyball game which formed when women waiting to go inside were told they would not be allowed to attend . The British-Iranian woman has staged hunger strikes against her detention, while hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition calling for her release . Miss Ghavami was arrested when she, along with a group of women, protested outside Tehran's Azadi stadium when they were refused entranced to a men's volleyball match between Iran and Italy. The law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies, part of the University of London, was released but rearrested days later when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station and officers discovered dual citizenship. Iranian prosecutors since accused her of having links to the opposition. She was yesterday sentenced to one-year imprisonment and banned from leaving Iran for two years. Following that decision, her mother wrote: 'After all this going back and forth and all the troubles we were given in the past month, they finally sentenced you to one year for a crime you never committed. 'I cannot believe one year imprisonment for volleyball protest which they said had nothing to do with your charges. 'Or the photo of the grave of Neda Agha Soltan on your mobile phone or a few seconds of a video of the moment of release of a former prisoner who had served a full sentence. 'They held you in the detention centre for 129 days which forced you to go on hunger strike twice in order to demand your basic rights of being given a court hearing and being issued a verdict. 'My dear Ghonche I am so heavy-hearted. In all these days I tried to keep you strong but I wish you were by my side now and would soothe me and remind me that there is a greater judge who would not let our rights be quashed.' Miss Ghavami’s mother, Susan Moshtaghian (pictured left) wrote on Facebook: 'We thank all of you that stayed with us and I hope the court accept the complete innocence of my daughter' Miss Ghavami, from Shepherd's Bush, has staged hunger strikes against her detention, while more than 728,000 supporters have signed an online petition calling for her release. Andy Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith & Shepherds Bush who has been working with the family for several months welcomed the latest developments. He said: 'It is a tribute to the campaign her family in Britain and Iran have run over the past five months. Support for her has come from around the world: Ghoncheh is a young woman of great courage. ""Though this is an important development we must continue the campaign until charges against her are dropped and she is free to travel outside Iran. 'With the family I will be meeting the Foreign Office Minister this week to discuss what more the UK Government can do for Ghoncheh, who is a British citizen.' It is understood she will stay with her parents in the Iranian capital pending a decision by the Court of Appeal on her sentence. The Foreign Office have confirmed reports that Miss Ghavami has been released from jail. A spokesman said: 'We are aware Ghoncheh Ghavami has been released on bail in Iran. We remain in regular contact with her family.'","Ghoncheh Ghavami was arrested in June for 'propaganda against regime'

"Players can often be seen before a big game nowadays with earphones in as they try to drown out any distractions during their pre-match routine. Sometimes though, it is better to soak it all in.

Wilshere's attention to detail was called into question by Wayne Rooney soon after kick-off when the England captain remonstrated with the Gunner over a careless pass in the early stages. The midfielder recovered, however, and laid on a superb pass for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's opener. Incredibly, it was Wilshere's first assist in an England shirt. He drove on his side from his less familiar deep-lying midfield position - a role which he is growing into for his country - as the visitors won 3-1.

"For LeBron James, the journey begins anew. Right back where it began. Nearly four months since proclaiming 'I'm coming home' and shifting the NBA's balance of power, James will play Thursday night in front of family, friends and the Cleveland fans who had their hearts broken four years ago. This is a homecoming like no other. Lebron James shoots during practice ahead of his keenly anticipated return to the Cleveland Cavaliers . James will play for the Cavs for the first time in four years when he takes on the New York Knicks on Thursday . 'None of us should take this moment for granted,' a relaxed James said following Cleveland's morning shootaround at Quicken Loans Arena. 'This is probably one of the biggest sporting events ever. I don't feel it, but I know it is.' A crowd of 20,000-plus that is expected to include several celebrities will be inside the Q, which was updated during the offseason with a gigantic, fire-spewing scoreboard, to welcome home James, the Akron native now back to his hoops roots to deliver a title to Cleveland, a city that has known mostly sports misery the past 50 years. When James is introduced after new teammates Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love as Cleveland's final starter before the Cavs tip off against the New York Knicks, Cleveland fans will be able to put four painful years without him behind them. This a fresh start for everyone. Four years at Miami brought NBA titles and Olympic gold medals, but James knows this is special . According to the man himself, 'this is probably one of the biggest sporting events ever' James, who has won NBA titles and Olympic gold medals, knows this season opener is a little more special. 'I understand how much I mean to this team to this franchise, to this city and to this state,' he said. 'It's a different feeling, but I'm still as calm and excited at the same time because it's the first game of the season.' As James spoke with reporters, a 10-story-tall Nike banner with his likeness was being readied for an unveiling in the hours leading up to tip-off. James plans to take a nap during the afternoon - a pregame ritual for 12 years - and then plans to check his Twitter account.

"Arsenal stars Per Mertesacker, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have swapped the football pitch for amateur dramatics, appearing in a 'mockumentary' video which sees actors - including Ewen Macintosh of The Office - take on the roles of their fictional relatives. ‘Face to Face with the Arsenal Family’ introduces larger-than-life ‘family’ members of each of the players, telling the story of their journey to matchday at The Emirates. The film has been released by Europcar, the Official Car and Van Rental partner to Arsenal, and begins with champion baker ‘Trudy Mertesacker’ (played by Lillian Schiffer) being introduced by her 'brother' Per. Watch the YouTube video here . Kenneth Wilshere, played by Grant Davis with Jack's face super-imposed, is the Arsenal star's 'uncle' Wilshere jokingly speaks of his embarrassment of his 'uncle' during the mockumentary . Wilshere's 'uncle' is a former schoolboy footballer who now works as a plumber . Kenny travels to The Emirates to watch his nephew in action but secretly harbours desires to play for the club . Trudy always attends matches to watch her famous brother in action but believes that baking is more challenging than football. Then, Wilshere reluctantly introduce ‘Uncle Kenny Wilshere’ (played by Grant Davis). A former schoolboy footballer who now works as a plumber, as well as being a keen poet, Uncle Kenny travels to The Emirates to watch his star nephew in action but secretly harbours desires to play for the club himself. The short film also features ‘Darren Oxlade-Chamberlain’ (played by Ewen MacIntosh), the plane-spotting cousin of winger Alex. Whilst Alex is a confident, outgoing member of his family, Darren is affectionately known as ‘The Shrub’ because he can stand still for long periods of time, key for plane spotting. Trudy, Per Mertesacker's 'sister', is a German baker, played by actress Lillian Schiffer . Trudy, Per's 'sister', produces this cake as a tribute for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger . Trudy always attends matches, but believes that baking is more challenging than football . As well as ‘starring’ in the mockumentary, which follows the players’ make-believe relatives travelling to The Emirates on matchday, the players had input into the scripts and storyboards. And they not only appeared as themselves but also as their ‘relatives’, through their faces being digitally super-imposed onto the faces of the actors playing those parts. The family ‘resemblance’ is therefore easy to see. Talking about the acting experience to create the video, Oxlade-Chamberlain said: 'I enjoyed the chance to do a bit of acting in the video. I did drama at school and had to drop acting for football so quite enjoyed the chance to relive my past.' Wilshere added: 'I’ve done a bit of acting in the past but it’s not something that comes naturally to me. I need more practice but enjoyed seeing the creation of Uncle Kenny.'

Darren is affectionately known as ‘The Shrub’ because he can stand still for long periods of time . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's face was also super-imposed onto MacIntosh's face for the film . Joking about which of the three players was the most natural actor, Mertesacker said: 'Oh that would be me, for sure. I’ve done a bit of acting before but this video was something different, involved more expression and I felt comfortable and enjoyed the experience.”' When asked who the players would like to play them in movies of their lives, Wilshere opted for Daniel Craig, Oxlade-Chamberlain suggested Denzel Washington, but said: 'It would be a bit of a stretch and he would be dropping down a peg or two.' Mertesacker revealed it would require 'a big lad, [NBA champion] Dirk Nowitzki.'

"Almost 500 people will share in the largest food safety settlement in Australian history after allegedly being poisoned by soy milk brand Bonsoy. The popular milk alternative is believed to have contained almost 50 times the recommended daily intake of iodine as a result of ingredient Kombu, a seaweed product which made the substance toxic. Nearly 500 people came forward claiming they had become ill after consuming the soy milk, including several women who are believed to have suffered miscarriages as a result of the iodine levels. Scroll down for video . The lead plaintiff in the case, Erin Downie, was a regular drinker of Bonsoy, and increased her intake after her doctor advised that it may help with l actation problems from giving birth to her daughter Mirayke in 2008 . Bonsoy was removed from supermarket shelves in late 2009 after and was reconstituted before being released to the public again, after 10 people, including a newborn baby, suffered thyroid problems in NSW. Lawyers claim that this is believed to be the biggest food safety class action ever made in Australia, settling for $25 million to be shared among the plaintiffs. Jacob Vargese, class action principal for law firm Maurice Blackburn, told Daily Mail Australia that the dangerously high thyroid levels caused a range of severe problems including thyroid failure. 'There are nearly 500 people we're representing in this class action, and all of them have been badly affected in a variety of ways,' he said. 'The symptoms were quite diverse, as excess of iodine effects the function of the thyroid and a persons metabolism,' 'People have claimed symptoms running from lethargy and anxiety to much more severe metabolic problems including hospitalisation and in some cases even surgery to remove the thyroid,' Mr Vargese said. The 33-year-old, from Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, became severely ill and was rushed to hospital suffering heart palpitations and unconsciousness . 'I’ve been through a lot due to drinking Bonsoy, and so have hundreds of others all over Australia,' Ms Downie said at a press conference on Monday afternoon . Jacob Vargese, class action principal for law firm Maurice Blackburn, told Daily Mail Australia that the dangerously high thyroid levels caused a range of severe problems including thyroid failure . The lead plaintiff in the case, Erin Downie, was a regular drinker of Bonsoy, and increased her intake after her doctor advised that it may help with lactation problems from giving birth to her daughter Mirayke in 2008. The 33-year-old, from Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, became severely ill and was rushed to hospital suffering heart palpitations and unconsciousness. She said her hair began falling out, her gums bled, she had boils over her body, and lost muscle function. She spent the next two years bedridden and said it robbed her of time with her daughter in the first years of her life. 'I wasn't just a little bit sick, it actually ruined the last seven years of my life,' she told reporters. 'I lost the first years of being able to enjoy my only child’s life because of the illnesses I suffered. Instead of hundreds of precious family memories, my memories are of being severely sick,' Ms Downie said. 'I’ve been through a lot due to drinking Bonsoy, and so have hundreds of others all over Australia,' she said. Ms Downie still suffers from chronic fatigue symptoms, is unable to carry another child, and claims she has a lower immune system as a result of her thyroid problems. She said she was relieved and grateful justice had prevailed, and companies had to be held to account for ingredients being put into consumable products. 'I knew someone was responsible for the damage and I made it my mission to hold someone accountable.' 'Today means a lot because we’ve been able to get a result that tells us we were right to stand up to the companies involved, despite it being a long, tough road,' she said. The Australian distributor, Spiral Foods, and Japanese companies Muso and Marusan-Ai Co, have been named as the three defendants in the case, but have not admitted liability. Mr Vargese said that the $25 million settlement still has to be approved by the court, with the next hearing scheduled to take place on the 29th of January. Once the settlement has been approved, a scheme will be developed to distribute the amount between the members of the class act and assess their claims. 'Some are claiming for pain and suffering, some are claiming for damages for lost time at work and lost income,' Mr Vargese said. 'The broader point is that this case demonstrates the power of a class act,' he said. 'No one person could have brought this claim, but by banding together it's become an economic proposition,' he said.

"This will be a season opener unlike any other - one that also brings closure. Part homecoming, part family reunion, part revival meeting and a huge party rolled into one. When LeBron James takes to the court on Thursday night wearing a No. 23 Cavaliers uniform in a regular-season game for the first time in four years, an entire city will be able to wash away a painful past. Any lingering bitterness will give way to forgiveness and excitement about the future. LeBron James shoots during a practice session as Kevin Love and Dion Waiters watch on .

This is the night Cleveland has been waiting for. More than 20,000 fans, some paying more than $1,000 for a ticket, will welcome James back home to where he began his basketball career. He'll again play before family, friends from Akron and the Cavs fans who feared he would never return after he bolted for Miami in 2010 to chase championships. There's never been a night like it in this city's tortured sports history, and it promises to be emotional for everyone, including James. 'It means everything to be able to open our NBA campaign here in Cleveland with these fans. It's going to be a special moment,' James said. 'We can't take it for granted. Moments like this, they don't come around every day.' James, right, pressurises Kevin Durant during a match last season in Miami .

Cavs owner Dan Gilbert said James' impact on the area is immeasurable. It's created new jobs and other growth, giving the city a substantial shot in the arm as it undergoes an urban renaissance.

James, on the other hand, won't be able to enjoy the celebration accompanying his comeback. Not now. 'I wish I could,' he said. 'I haven't had a moment to soak in anything I've done.

Despite his military rank of Marshal and his reported five years officer education at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, Kim wore no uniform as he directed proceedings on a large military chart. His older, uniformed advisors peered intently as Kim outlined his strategy, keeping note of his instructions in small A6 size notebooks.

"Royal Bank of Scotland has apologised for misleading a parliamentary committee over its treatment of small businesses. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, admitted evidence given by two executives was wrong – but insisted they made an ‘honest mistake’ when discussing the controversial Global Restructuring Group before the Treasury Select Committee. Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, said they had been ‘wilfully obtuse’. RBS has apologised for misleading a parliamentary committee over its treatment of small businesses . The row over the bank’s treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, is the latest in a series of scandals for RBS since it was bailed out by the government in the financial crisis. Deputy chief executive Chris Sullivan and Derek Sach, head of the GRG unit, were summoned by the committee in June to discuss claims that it destroyed small firms for profit. They flatly denied that GRG, which is now being shut down, was a ‘profit centre’. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, insisted they made an ‘honest mistake’ when discussing the controversial Global Restructuring Group before the Treasury Select Committee . But Mr Sullivan later wrote to Mr Tyrie to clarify – and Sir Philip has now admitted the initial evidence was wrong. ‘The evidence the bank’s representatives provided was not correct,’ he said in a letter to Mr Tyrie on August 22, made public yesterday. He added that the men ‘did not intend to mislead’. Mr Tyrie said: ‘It was materially incorrect on a crucial point and unacceptable. RBS has done the right thing and apologised.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘How much more is there to come? This is a bank the state owns, having bailed them out, and we are still getting misled.’ A spokesman for RBS said: ‘The bank has apologised unreservedly for any confusion caused. This was not intentional.’","RBS apologises for misleading MPs over treatment of small businesses .

"Crystal Palace inflicted more pain on Liverpool at Selhurst Park with a convincing come-from-behind victory against Brendan Rodgers' out-of-form side.

The flight was grounded on the runway in Las Vegas on Sunday for a total of four hours. Several travelers reported that a woman passed out in the aisle while two others had medical problems.

"David Cameron is preparing a major speech on immigration later this week . David Cameron is set to announce plans to ban European migrants claiming any benefits for two years after moving to Britain, it was reported today. The Prime Minister is expected to use a long-awaited speech on immigration later this week to outline proposals to stop EU workers receiving in-work tax credits. Mr Cameron is also expected to call for a ban on unemployment benefits for new migrants. The Government spends £1.6 billion a year on tax credits which top up low paid jobs for 250,000 migrant workers. Mr Cameron wants to limit migrant workers' access to in-work benefits for between one and five years - with two years seen as the most likely, according to the Sunday Times. Ministers believe banning new arrivals from claiming in-work benefits would make moving to Britain less attractive – helping to reduce the scale of immigration. A report by the eurosceptic Open Europe think tank, set to be published tomorrow, reveals that a single Spanish immigrant moving to the UK to work on minimum wage sees their weekly income rise from £214.07 to £290.28, a gain of £76.21 a week, by tax credits. Pawel Swidlicki of the think tank Open Europe said: 'These benefits — designed to help people from welfare into work — act as an effective government-backed subsidy for EU migrants to perform low-paid jobs which does not exist in France or Germany to the same extent.' Mr Cameron's long-awaited speech on immigration is designed to clear the way for the Tories to make immigration the major battle ground of the next election. It comes after the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith vowed to ban EU migrants from claiming unemployment benefits when his universal credit scheme is up and running after the next election. Mr Cameron has also refused to drop the idea of setting a cap on the number of migrants allowed into Britain each year, despite warnings from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel that she would veto any proposal to end freedom of movement in Europe. Ukip's Mark Reckless (left) and Nigel Farage (right) have dismissed Government plans to cut migration while staying in the EU . The most national insurance numbers handed out last year were to Poles, Romanians and Spaniards . But the Prime Minister is understood to be still considering proposing an 'emergency brake' that would restrict free movement once a certain threshold is passed. At a meeting of Mr Cameron's policy board arch-eurosceptic Peter Lilley allegedly told the PM that 'Britain is full' and called for an emergency brake on EU arrival. But he was branded 'shrill' by No 10 aide Daniel Korski, according to the Mail on Sunday.","PM preparing to outline new crackdown in long-awaited speech this week .

"CLICK HERE to read the full report from the season's final race in Abu Dhabi . I was delighted to see Lewis Hamilton win the World Championship. Without a doubt he has been the fastest man in the fastest car — and he deserved his victory. There is almost no limit to what Lewis can achieve now. It just depends on how hungry he remains. My old team-mate Juan Manuel Fangio did not retire until he was 47, and that was when races had to last more than three hours — twice as long as now. I do not think for a minute that Lewis will compete until he is 47 — drivers drop out in their 30s these days. But he could race for 10 more years and win seven or eight world titles — beating Michael Schumacher’s record in The process — if he has the right equipment. Draped in a Union Jack flag, Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the world championship title . Victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix saw the British driver pick up his second world championship . Hamilton is congratulated by friends and family, including popstar girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger (right) Hamilton got off to a flying start by overtaking his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg= . So how good is Lewis? I cannot rank him alongside Fangio — a quietly spoken gentleman and, in my opinion, the finest driver ever. It is hard to compare people nowadays to my era. I would compete in Formula One, Formula Two, sports cars, touring cars, all sorts in any given year. It was my hobby. Lewis only races 19 times a year. It is not to say he could not race in other series if he wanted to; it is just that’s not what drivers do now. Times change. For example, when Lewis wins a race he has to go to chat up the Vodafone sponsors. When I won a race I went to chat up a damn good-looking bit of crumpet. I would not have dreamed of wearing a pair of jeans, but that is what people want to wear now. We cannot go back. In Hamilton’s era, I would say Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso are two great drivers. They are both fast. I would say Vettel might win in the same car because of his maturity and experience —and he is an immensely fast driver. You don’t get four championships by sitting on the side. Hamilton reclaimed the drivers' championship after fist winning the title in 2008 (above) Stirling Moss, sipping a cup of tea at a pit stop, accepts the sport has changed since his era . Racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio did not retire from the sport until he was 47-years-old . Stirling Moss believes Hamilton could eventually surpass Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles . But Lewis is right up there, and on the top of his form with the fastest car and a superb Mercedes engine. What has impressed me about his driving from his earlier years is how late he brakes. That is the mark of a top-class driver. His car control is second to none. He is pretty flawless, in fact. Nor have I seen him do anything really untoward in the car. Schumacher was not always sporting, but with Lewis I never feel he is going to push anyone off. He’s a really first-class sportsman. I am also pleased he has won the championship with Mercedes-Benz — the greatest team I ever raced for. They still make terrific cars. They also let their drivers race without instructions. Every race is open. It is a tradition they have stuck to this season. Hamilton is showered in champagne by his Mercedes team-mates after his vctory . Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) was gracious enough to join in the celebrations . German driver Rosberg should be commended for showing such dignity in defeat . My only regret is that the final race was not a real fight. With his car problem, Nico Rosberg could not really compete with Lewis. But the outcome of the championship would have been the same anyway. I think Nico has ended up in the right place — just behind the leader. In that sense I feel Rosberg is to Lewis what I was to Fangio: a team-mate to the best driver in the world, without quite being good enough to pass him. Nico has done everything he could and he has behaved very graciously, especially in defeat. I just do not think Nico quite has Lewis’s raw speed. So, to our new British champion I say: ‘Well done, old boy.’","Lewis Hamilton was crowned World Champion after winning Abu Dhabi GP .

"The woman who cheated on Kevin de Bruyne with his Belgium team-mate Thibaut Courtois has revealed that she had the affair after the Wolfsburg midfielder strayed with her former best friend. Rumours about a love-triangle between Caroline Lijnen and the duo first began in April 2013 but she has now spoken out, confirming that she was intimate with Courtois after De Bruyne admitted that he'd cheated on her. Lijnen says she met the giant goalkeeper during a visit to Madrid, where he was playing for La Liga side Atletico Madrid on loan from Chelsea.

Speaking to Belgian publication Story Magazine, she said: 'Kevin cheated on me. I did not say anything for months because I couldn't say anything, as Kevin's parents said they would take legal action if I gave my story. I was under pressure and I could not have contact with Kevin. 'I respected everything. But in his book Keep it Simple Kevin wrote a passage about my affair with Thibaut. So, I decided to remain silent no longer. 'In the summer of 2012, Kevin told me that he had an affair with my old best friend. I gave him the choice: her or me.

With Thibaut, I could talk about anything and everything and he had even prepared me a delicious meal. Kevin never did it for me. 'Kevin had deceived me and I thought ""Why shouldn't I do that too?""' De Bruyne and Courtois, who are both expected to start against Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying on Tuesday night, were also owned by Chelsea at the same time but never played together.

"A stately home in the rolling Welsh countryside has been put up for rent for the first time in its 300 year history - at the same price as a two-bed apartment in London. The luxury mansion, which stands in ten acres of land, can be rented for the princely sum of £5,000 a month. For that price tenants of Tythegston Court can enjoy the house's nine bedrooms, a grand entrance hall and staircase, reception rooms, billiard room, outdoor pool, tennis court, stables and landscaped gardens. Luxury: Tythegston Court in South Wales has nine bedrooms, a grand entrance hall and staircase reception rooms, billiard room, outdoor pool, tennis court, stables and beautiful landscaped gardens . Bargain: The manor house can be rented for £5,000 a month - the same as a two-bedroom flat in Kensington . But for the same money you could rent a two-bedroom apartment in Kensington or a three-bedroom fourth floor flat in west London's exclusive Notting Hill. The estate agents handling Tythegston Court in the Vale of Glamorgan say it will appeal to anyone wanting to quit the city for an upmarket country lifestyle. Angus Harley, of property consultancy Knight Frank, said: 'This is a truly exceptional chance to rent one of the country's most historic houses. Tea in the drawing room? This historic home is beautifully decorated inside and is available just to let . Superior living: The house comes with its very own games room and enough space for a full size snooker table . 'People think nothing of handing over this sort of sum to rent a nice but fairly modest place in London. 'It is a little known fact that at one time many large country houses were let out. As a tenant one enjoys all the pleasures of wonderful lifestyle without any of the concerns that can go with outright ownership. 'After a few years of superior living, you can simply hand it back and walk way.' The Grade II listed property - two and a half hours by car from London, is available for rent between one and five years. Whilst five grand a month gets you a mansion in Wales, it covers much more modest dwellings in London. If you are all about location, location, location a one-bedroom flat near Chelsea’s exclusive Sloane Square is on the market for £4,767 a month. A short walk away on equally flashy Brompton Place, Knightsbridge, a two-bedroom flat will set you back £4,983 – but it does include access to a private terrace. For the same monthly rent, estate agent Curtis Sloane offering ‘Holland Park’s finest properties’ are advertising a two-bedroom flat to prospective tenants near Notting Hill Gate. No gardens, tennis courts or outdoor pools but a W11 post code, which in London is worth thousands. Downsizing: For the same money you can rent a two bedroom flat in Kensington (Portland Road is pictured) Fancy: Tythegston has been in the ownership of the Knight family for 300 years and was renovated in 2000 . Bit of a commute: The Grade II listed property is two and a half hours by car from London . Roomy: A smaller study or office style room would be perfect for family meetings or working from home . The estate agents say it gives Downton Abbey a run for its money in terms of aspirational country splendour. Tythegston Court dates back to medieval times but the current mansion was built in the late 1700s. The new tenant will have access, by arrangement, to the significant 1,200 acre Tythegston country estate for riding and walking. The . details on the property say: 'The interior of the house is grand yet . manageable in proportions, with generous rooms including a magnificent . hall and staircase and the fascinating medieval tower. Spacious: The house comes with its own drive way and turning circle with space for several motors . Gated: The house also comes with a suite of offices which could works as a business headquarters . 'There is a suite of offices which would work perfectly as a private office or low key business headquarters. 'The West Wing of the house consists of a self contained apartment occupied by a caretaker couple. Housekeeping and gardening help may be available by separate negotiation.

"They are often the subject of ridicule and laughter among females - the whinging, whining men who are forever complaining about having a cold. But new research has shown that man flu is not a myth, as a lack of female sex hormones actually leaves males with weaker immune systems. Scientists from Harvard University believe that a lack of oestrogen makes men more likely to succumb to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe that men are more susceptible to respiratory conditions as they have weaker immune systems due to a lack of the female sex hormone oestrogen . Their study, published in medical journal Life Sciences tested the effect of bacterial pneumonia on mice by introducing the infection to their lungs. Professor Lester Kobzik, of the university's School of Public Health, found females were naturally more resistant to the condition. Their increased resistance was linked to the enzyme nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) - activated by the release of the female sex hormone oestrogen. Scientists then took another set of male and female mice and removed the gene responsible for the production of NOS3. They found that deleting this gene meant that the female mice were no longer more resistant to infection. By administering a simple dose of oestrogen to both males and females, they were able to cure both of serious lung infections - clearing the bacteria from their lungs far more rapidly than normal mice. The team hopes that, in the future, this knowledge could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections and prevent flu developing into more serious pneumonia. Professor Kobzik said: 'Ultimately, this work could be especially useful in reducing risk of secondary bacterial pneumonias during seasonal or pandemic influenza. 'We were quite pleased that the work led us to NOS3-targeting drugs that are already available and that can indeed improve resistance to pneumonia in our mouse model.' The Harvard study is not the first to provide evidence offering an explanation for man flu. Research conducted at Durham University last year suggested that men suffer more with coughs and colds because they have extra temperature receptors in the brain and so experience worse symptoms. And dismissing the idea that males are prone to whinging when they are sick, a 2013 survey suggested that it is in fact women who are more likely to complain about having flu symptoms. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that on average, males would play down illness more than females.","Harvard University scientists conducted 'man flu' study using mice .

"England captain Wayne Rooney was presented with a golden cap from Sir Bobby Charlton to commemorate his 100th international appearance before kick-off against Slovenia at Wembley. Rooney received the cap alongside his sons, Kai and Klay, and the Manchester United striker revealed exactly what a special moment it would be to reach three figures in England appearances earlier in the week. 'As a young boy it was always my dream to play at Wembley,' said Rooney, who made his debut at Upton Park 11 years ago against Australia in 2003.

Gary Lineker, 48 goals . 3. Jimmy Greaves, 44 goals . 4. Wayne Rooney, 43 goals . 'So to go out there and receive the cap, in particular from Bobby Charlton, will be a special moment for me. It will be an incredible feeling.' But while Rooney, 29, will enjoy the moment, he is already looking ahead at breaking some long standing England records, such as Peter Shilton's record cap total of 125 and Charlton's record of 49 England goals. 'They are two records that have stood for a lot of years. To be in touching distance of reaching them, which is something I hope I can do, is not something that is really in my mind at the minute,' Rooney said. 'As you get closer to them, you will start to look at them, but at the end of the day if they are going to come, then they will come.'

"A healthy 44-year-old yoga fan in Riverside, California, never knew he would help a renal disease sufferer in Joliet, Illinois, four months later. But Rick Ruzzamenti and Donald Terry, 47, are the start and end of an astonishing 60-person chain of kidney transplants, setting a world record.

His kidney was taken to Livingston, New Jersey, where it was given to a 66-year-old man, whose niece had originally wanted to donate to him. But her blood type didn’t match - so she donated hers to a woman in Madison, Wisconsin, after Mr Ruzzamenti’s gift, and the chain continued. The Good Samaritan went through rounds of psychological and medical tests before he could donate a kidney, reported the New York Times. ‘People think it’s so odd that I’m donating a kidney,’ he told a hospital transplant coordinator. ‘I think it’s so odd that they think it’s so odd.’ The Buddhist man got the idea after a worker at his yoga studio said she donated a kidney to an ill friend she bumped into at a Target store.

"Click here for stats, heat maps and more! As a gauge for Brendan Rodgers to measure Liverpool's regression it might be quite accurate. No better at the back than they were six months ago, much worse up front and utterly devoid of belief. At least, when they somehow converted a three-goal lead into a six-goal draw at Crystal Palace in May, they were in gung-ho pursuit of the goals to bring the title to Anfield for the first time in 20 years. Again they took the lead at Selhurst Park, but it was all downhill after Rickie Lambert had hit the target after 91 seconds, and again they again conceded three, with Neil Warnock reaching for the salt to declare his disappointment at not scoring more.

Dwight Gayle levelled before half-time and Palace's heavily-bearded midfield warriors Joe Ledley and Mile Jedinak scored a goal each in a frenzied three-minute spell near the end of a rain-soaked game. Gayle and Ledley owed theirs to Yannick Bolasie, outstanding on the left-wing, where he tormented ill-protected Liverpool full-back Javier Manquillo, while Jedinak's was a stunning free-kick from 25 yards. Palace danced in delight as they sprang out of the Barclays Premier League's bottom three to within two points of their visitors, who next travel to Bulgaria to face Ludogorets in the Champions League. Rodgers must stop this rotten run of results, even if that means sacrificing principles and making unpopular selection decisions. It will be a real test of his judgment. His team have lost four in a row and have not won in the Premier League since mid-October. Six months ago, Liverpool were fresh, flamboyant and sure to score goals but the sale of Luis Suarez, form dips and injuries have left them looking miles from that standard. Rodgers has lost the balance and rhythm which made Liverpool so entertaining. He has lost the menace in attack but not the vulnerability at the back or the nagging questions about character and leadership, which Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher aired again on Sky TV. Without Daniel Sturridge or Mario Balotelli, Lambert started and scored his first Liverpool goal, when Adam Lallana caught Palace's former Liverpool full-back Martin Kelly napping. Lambert collected it with the outside of his right foot and drove the ball low past Julian Speroni. 'It could have knocked the stuffing out of us,' said Warnock. 'You could see they were determined from the way they started and the way they celebrated that goal. But you can score too early sometimes and we created some good chances. We'd have done most teams today. I'm disappointed we didn't score more, really.' Liverpool were not helped by the fact Joe Allen cut his head and twice needed to leave the pitch for patching up. Gayle equalised during the second of those short spells when the visitors were a man down. Bolasie charged forward, accepting the invitation to shoot from the central defenders who decided not to squeeze out. His effort zipped across the wet surface and thumped into a post.

With his pace and instinct, Gayle was first to the rebound, beating Martin Skrtel in a foot race, and turned it into the net via Simon Mignolet. Liverpool, having held their lead for only 10 minutes, were beset by doubt. Palace detected blood, refusing to allow them time to settle and pass, quickly in position to punish any touch not perfect.

It was an awkward day for goalkeepers, but Mignolet made a terrific save from Bolasie, a drive which skidded up off the wet turf when Gayle might have blocked his view. Manquillo recovered to block from Bolasie after a neat one-two with Jason Puncheon at the end of a sweeping counter-attack after clearing a corner. Bolasie sliced another shot wide before the break after Puncheon slid a pass behind Manquillo. Liverpool dominated possession but without penetration. They rarely got behind a Palace defence which lost Damien Delaney through injury in the first half. Lambert twice headed crosses wide and Steven Gerrard tried his luck from long range, only to find his efforts mocked by the Selhurst crowd. Raheem Sterling contributed little besides a couple of penalty appeals: one when a cross crashed into Kelly's hand from close-range and another when he was manhandled by Joel Ward, but Jon Moss gave neither. There were 12 minutes left in a messy and disjointed second-half, when Mignolet dragged a free-kick into straight touch. From the throw, Bolasie collected a flick, hooked the ball over his own head and muscled past Dejan Lovren. He looked up pulled a cross into the path of Ledley, who finished first time, with his left foot. Selhurst Park was still bouncing when Jedinak curled in the third from a free-kick conceded by Skrtel as he jostled with Gayle. It was a fourth goal in seven games for the Palace skipper and the joy was complete for Palace. The pain deepened for Liverpool.

"Click here to read Matt Barlow's report from Selhurst Park. The first rule of being a Liverpool player is to show pride and honour. The second is to give it everything you have got. On both levels this Liverpool team let down their club at Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon. This was borderline disgrace. They have gone, lost their fight, their desire and hunger to win matches after coming within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League title last season.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers watches his side's sixth defeat of the season in rainy south London . To recover from this, their sixth league defeat of a season that is disintegrating with every passing week, will take something special. In the dugout, soaked through to the skin, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is trying to work out where it has all gone wrong. There is no cohesion and the fabric of the team, established by the hard work and goals of Luis Suarez, has been ripped out of them. They have no response. It was only a couple of weeks ago when Rodgers admitted he was under pressure to find the answers. So far, this Liverpool team has come up short. Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak (second from left) celebrates passionately after scoring a free-kick . Lambert (left) and Raheem Sterling prepare to take kick-off after Palace's equaliser on Sunday . They are no longer playing for each other and the spirit engendered last season, when they ran champions Manchester City so close, has evaporated. The legs have gone and there are long faces all round. At the final whistle, after they had surrendered a one-goal lead, they didn't even look bothered to be beaten again. That takes some doing. There is something seriously wrong at Anfield and over the next few days Rodgers will have to come up with some answers because this boil had to be lanced.

It cannot all be about Suarez, the man who scored 31 times in the Premier League last season, because they spent all the £75million and then some on his replacements. Two of them - Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert - combined to put Liverpool ahead just 94 seconds into this incredible afternoon at Selhurst Park. After that Liverpool collapsed and Palace rubbed their faces in the dirt when Mile Jedinak scored with a beaut of a free-kick from 25 yards to make it 3-1. Jedinak steps up to deliver the killer blow to Liverpool as the visitors lost 3-1 at Palace . Liverpool sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million in the summer . The Premier League table . The problem for Rodgers is that he has spent the two-week international break, when most of his players have been away, trying to work it all out. Here they were back to the beginning, perhaps back to the time when Rodgers took over a team that reached the FA Cup and Carling Cup finals under Kenny Dalglish. The word transition has been used, but this club went too deep into the Premier League title race for that to be bandied around Anfield. These Liverpool players are letting their supporters down, because you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times the team has chucked it in. Here they did just that, paralysed by fear and anxiety after Dwight Gayle equalised for Palace in the first half. After that, Liverpool's collapse here at Selhurst Park wasn't spectacular.

"If Stan Wawrinka really is, as his team-mate’s wife hollered last Saturday, a ‘cry baby’, then he is in for quite some ordeal. In Lille's football stadium he takes on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first match of the most anticipated Davis Cup final for years. In front of 27,000 fans, mostly against him, he will try to give Switzerland its first ever win. His deadly rival from the O2 Arena, Roger Federer, will be his brother-in-arms, but it is expected that his chief provocateur from that emotional night at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals will be absent. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roger Federer training ahead of Davis Cup final vs France . Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka shake hands before training on Thursday ahead of the Davis Cup final . Swiss team-mates Wawrinka and Federer appear to have put their fallout last week in London behind them . 17 time Grand Slam champion Federer will face world No 12 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (left) in the singles on Friday . Federer shares a joke with Switzerland Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi at the final draw on Friday . Event officials were told on Thursday that Federer’s wife Mirka is not planning on making an appearance. Not that she would be trying to put off Wawrinka on this occasion, not when her husband’s hopes of further cementing his legacy depend so much on his compatriot. Wawrinka and Federer were again presenting a united front, putting aside the fractious events in London in finding a common purpose against a better prepared French team. Federer practised twice yesterday on the indoor clay court laid beneath the closed roof of the impressive Stade Pierre Mauroy, which will be one of the venues for football’s 2016 European Championship. After his first outing the world No 2 declared himself fit, despite pulling out of the London final with a back injury, while Wawrinka spoke of the positive atmosphere in the ranks of the Swiss team. Helpfully, they have also found a common enemy for last Saturday’s fracas at the O2 in umpire Cedric Mourier, whom they have both condemned for spilling the haricots in an interview by confirming what happened. Certainly Mirka was not getting a mention. The odd commentator this week felt her conduct last Saturday was a commendable sign of being a strong woman. Others might just regard it as poor behaviour. Regardless, for Wawrinka this final offers a chance to top off a breakthrough year that he began by beating Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal back to back to win the Australian Open. Federer was in good spirits in training for Switzerland as the world No 2 attempts to win his first Davis Cup . The Swiss team pose with the Davis Cup trophy ahead of taking on France for the title this weekend . Federer's wife Mirka is alleged to have called Wawrinka a 'cry baby' and is set to miss the clash in Lille . He will probably need to gain at least one singles point to help Federer win the Davis Cup trophy in what may well be his last chance to do so. In the eternal debate about who is the greatest ever, the appearance of the Davis Cup on Federer’s c.v. would add weight to his claims. His closest modern rivals (Djokovic and Nadal) have long since ticked it off their bucket list. Federer declined to comment on whether he had undergone an injection in his troublesome back and was cautious about his prospects. ‘It’s been a difficult week, but I’m happy with where I am today. We will see, only the match gives all the answers. I will give it a go,’ he said, admitting this was an important weekend for him. ‘It’s a big deal, no doubt about it.’ If he is physically restricted then the telescopically limbed Gael Monfils is not the person he would want to meet on a clay court over the best of five sets. The Frenchman has extraordinary retrieving ability and keeps opponents running, although his mercurial temperament will be tested by the expectation of the massive crowd. Last weekend’s spat between the two Swiss men may not have much material effect, especially as Wawrinka is a genial soul whose relations with Federer have, broadly, been good over the years. And in any walk of life one person can get on well with another while not being mad about their friend’s partner. Federer trained with team-mate Wawrinka and is set to be fit to play on Friday to take on Tsonga . Wawrinka said that coming to Lille and changing scene had been a help after describing himself as detruit — destroyed — by the defeat on Saturday night. ‘Sure it was tough losing to Roger with four match points,’ he admitted. ‘It was a tough loss, but I played well in London, I’m feeling great from that. When I came here it was a new week, a new state of mind. It was easier than I thought.’ Given a clean bill of health and no underlying issues, Switzerland would start this final as favourites, partly due to the unpredictable nature of the two French singles players. Monfils and Tsonga are abundantly talented, but you are never quite sure what you will get. And if anything they are undercooked, having not played for three weeks, while the opposite may be true for the Swiss. The two sets of players greeted each other warmly at yesterday’s draw but then they do have something in common: they all live in Switzerland, funnily enough, away from the clutches of the French taxman.

"Controversial Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss'. She formally resigned from his party this morning and declared that she will not form nor join another party, claiming it was a case of 'once bitten, twice shy'. The Tasmanian Senator, 43, won a place in parliament at the 2013 federal election (September 7) and the 'deal-breaker' for her decision to go it alone was the overwhelming support from her home state and not her disintegrating relationship with Mr Palmer. Scroll down for video . Controversial Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, announcing that Tasmanians, not Clive Palmer, 'are my boss' Senator Jacqui Lambie speaks in the Senate chamber in Parliament House in Canberra. Ms Lambie announced she would resign from the Palmer United Party and continue to serve as an Independent Senator . 'I started thinking about where we were going about a month or 6 weeks ago, it’s all come to a head, I didn’t believe it was in the best interests of Tasmania and was better on my own two feet,' Ms Lambie said. The pair has not spoken since Remembrance Day. Her former party leader launched a broadside in an interview with Fairfax Media, telling them she pre-empted an imminent move by the party against her, by leaving. 'I think you can understand that it's a good outcome for the party because her views are in conflict with what the people who elected her care about,' he said. 'I don't think she'll achieve very much as a senator generally.' Jacqui Lambie took her place as deputy leader of the Senate for the Palmer United Party on July 1 this year but she was stripped of that deputy role in the Senate for PUP last week, following heated words with Mr Palmer. If she runs into her former boss in parliament she said 'I’ll just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do'. Senator Lambie has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to admit he was wrong on ADF member payments and Australians 'will forgive him' Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party, effective immediately. She will stand as an Independent and has said military pay, Medicare co-payments and tertiary overhaul issues are 'non-negotiable' Jacqui Lambie has left the door open to negotiate on issues with Clive Palmer and if she sees him will ‘just smile at him and say hello because that is the polite thing to do’ 'My resignation today will end that damaging speculation and uncertainty,' she told parliament. 'I must be free to vote in the Senate in the best interest of Tasmanians.' Senator Lambie said she had been thinking over her party membership while she got legal advice on leaving PUP. At a media conference she reinforced a determination to negotiate a better pay deal for Australian Defence Force members. 'The Prime Minister has done the wrong thing in this area, it takes a big man to admit he’s wrong,' she said. 'If Mr Abbott rethinks the pay offer for ADF members then I’m sure Australians will forgive him. It’s about our national security, about the morale of people who are putting their lives on the line.' Clive Palmer and Jacqui Lambie have not spoken since a row about Remembrance Day. He's told Fairfax Media that her departure pre-empted a party move against her and insists she will not achieve very much as senator . Once were colleagues. Jacqui Lambie has cut her ties with the Palmer United Party led by mining billionaire Clive Palmer . Jacqui Lambie served in the Australian army for more than 10 years but her first foray into politics came via volunteer work for an Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate in Tasmania. She actually joined the Liberal Party three years ago but then moved into a role with Clive Palmer's team ahead of the 2013 election. Senator Lambie also guaranteed that she would not vote for proposed fee changes to tertiary education and the government's Medicare $7 co-payment plan, insisting they were non-negotiable issues because 'that’s what I promised Australians and my Tasmanians'. She apologised for the ongoing uncertainty over her membership with PUP and that took the decision to resign because she had been prevented from voting in a way which was 'best for Tasmania' As for the war of words between her and party leader Clive Palmer, Senator Lambie added that 'I don't have the time or energy to be drawn into a political conflict'. The PUP leader issued a statement accusing Senator Lambie of establishing the Australian Defence Veterans Party between winning the election and taking up her seat in the Senate for PUP. That party's website says its inaugural meeting was held on January 26, 2014. On Monday it had made no mention of Senator Lambie. Mr Palmer also said the senator had to answer questions about when she was receiving a disability pension. 'That is still in legal dispute, I was not receiving any payments or military compensation payments,' said Senator Lambie, going on to add that she was living off her own finances for several months. The Palmer United Party has effectively held the balance of power in the Senate since July but her resignation leaves the party with two senators in the upper house.","Controversial Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie has quit the Palmer United Party .

"Some people may have dismissed it as pillow talk, but an Ohio furniture and bed company that said it would wipe customer debts if Ohio State won the college championship is making good on its promise. Morris Furniture Company, based in Dayton, declared that if the Buckeyes beat Alabama in the College Football playoff and then won the national championship by at least seven points, anyone who bought $1,999-worth or more of furniture between December 17 and January 1 would get a refund. The firm, which ran the promotion at its 15 Ashley Furniture HomeStore and Better Sleep Shops in Ohio and northern Kentucky, might have thought its money was safe, as Alabama was the No1 seed.

It's understood that around 500 people will be eligible for a refund or gift card as a result of the promotion (file picture) On January 1 the Buckeyes claimed victory - but they were then left facing the favorites, Oregon. On Monday, however, the team and its fans, along with the 500 people eligible for the promotion, celebrated as the Oregon Ducks slumped to a 42-20 defeat at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Morris Furniture won't have to pay up directly, though. Rob Klaben, vice president of marketing and advertising at Morris Furniture, told ABC News: 'We did work with a third-party company that underwrote the promotion. So we're excited to see a win.' He added: 'It's not inexpensive to have this kind of promotion.' Customers can choose between having their debt for the furniture they bought wiped – or the product refunded - or claim a store card loaded with 110 per cent of the total. Mr Klaben revealed that the promotion gave them a huge boost in the normally sluggish sales period in the week before Christmas. Victory: Ohio State beat the Oregon Ducks 42-20 on Monday.

Seattle didn't just win, the Seahawks embarrassed the Broncos in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history. And in a similar promotion, a car dealership in Missouri lost more than $300,000 in last year's Super Bowl. As part of a promotion, the Hutcheson Ford dealership in St. James, Missouri, offered potential customers the deal of a lifetime in its 'Super Weekend Sale': If a player returns an opening kickoff for a touchdown in the first or second half of the Super Bowl, anyone who bought a vehicle between January 29 and February 1 would receive a refund of the purchase price of the vehicle. Unfortunately for the dealership, 12 people bought vehicles between the 29th and the 1st - and one returned the opening kick-off of the second half 87 yards for a touchdown.

"When it comes to making public apologies, politicians have often been criticised for lacking sincerity. But one politician in Japan has taken things to the other extreme after breaking down and wailing hysterically on live TV while apologising over claims he wasted public money. Ryutaro Nonomura, 47, burst into tears and began banging on his desk and jabbering nonsensical phrases during a news conference on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . A Japanese politician has broken down on live TV while apologising over claims he wasted public money . Ryutaro Nonomura, 47, was forced to apologise at a press conference following claims he used public money to travel to hot springs 106 times in one year . 'To change Japan and society, I'm putting my life on the line,' the Hyogo Prefectural assemblyman said in a choked voice. The conference followed a Kobe Shimbun newspaper report that raised questions about Mr Nonomura visiting the hot springs 106 times last year, using public money. Such visits were not illegal and had been reported to the assembly office, but cost three million yen (£17,500). Hyogo legislators get 500,000 yen (£3,000) a month for expenses, including travel, but the spending is supposed to be for official travel, research and other costs related to the activities of elected office. During the apology Nonomura wailed hysterically, banging his desk and shouting nonsensical phrases . The apology has caused controversy in conservative Japan where outbursts of emotion are frowned upon . Mr Nonomura, who does not belong to a major political party, was found to have gone to other day trips, racking up expenses, including visits to Tokyo and the south-western city of Fukuoka. Of his 195 day trips, ones to the 'onsen' hot-springs resort town of Kinosaki, which lies outside his precinct, were the most frequent. The video of his apology has since become an online hit, with nearly 2million views so far on YouTube. However people in Japan have reacted with anger to the apology as public outbursts of emotion are generally frowned upon in the conservative country. Shame: At another point during the broadcast, Nonomura took a deep breath before bowing his head . While the visits to the hot springs were not illegal, they did cost three million yen (£17,500) Last month a Tokyo assemblyman was forced into a humiliating public apology after shouting a sexist remark at a female colleague. Ayaka Shiomura was making a presentation on issues such as infertility and maternal support when hecklers called out 'You are the one who should get married first', 'She must be single' and 'Can't you even have babies?'. Akihiro Suzuki, 51, admitted making the first comment and bowed to Shiomura at a press conference, though insisted he had not meant to offend her.","Ryutaro Nonomura, 47, accused of wasting money on visits to hot springs .

"Damning report: Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis said he 'witnessed the absence of success on virtually every level' A US army officer has accused the American military of painting a misleading picture of progress in the war in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis turned whistleblower and broke ranks with the official portrayal of the Afghan war after he 'witnessed the absence of success on virtually every level.' 'How many more men must die in support of a mission that is not succeeding?' Colonel Davis asked in an article titled 'Truth, Lies and Afghanistan: How Military Leaders Have Let Us Down.' 'No one expects our leaders to always have a successful plan,' he said in the article. 'But we do expect — and the men who do the living, fighting and dying deserve — to have our leaders tell us the truth about what’s going on. In the piece published online in the Armed Forces Journal, which Colonel Davis admitted may cost him his career, he says he believes it is his duty to speak out because he has access to classified material which prove a disparity between what has happened and what the public is told. Rising death toll: The body of Army Brig. Gen.Terence J. Hildner was returned to Dover Air Force Base, Del yesterday. 'How many more men must die in support of a mission that is not succeeding?' Colonel Davis asked in his article . He said that if Americans were able to compare 'the public statements many of our . leaders have made with classified data, this credibility gulf would be . immediately observable.' In the online article discussing U.S. progress in the Afghan war, Colonel Davis made several damning assertions: . 'What I saw bore no resemblance to rosy official statements by U.S. military leaders about conditions on the ground.' 'I witnessed the absence of success on virtually every level.' 'In all of the places I visited, the tactical situation was bad to abysmal.' 'How many more men must die in support of a mission that is not succeeding and behind an array of more than seven years of optimistic statements by U.S. senior leaders in Afghanistan?' 'If Americans were able to compare the public statements many of our leaders have made with classified data, this credibility gulf would be immediately observable.' 'The American people deserve better than what they’ve gotten from their senior uniformed leaders over the last number of years. Simply telling the truth would be a good start.' His comments come as U.S Defence . Secretary Leon Panetta has announced he believes international troops . could end their combat role by the end of 2013, bringing a close to the . decade-long engagement in Afghanistan. Colonel . Davis, joined the army in 1985 and spent most of last year on his . second deployment to Afghanistan working with the Army's Rapid Equipping . Force, a job he says took him 'into every significant area where our . soldiers engage the enemy.' He . says it was this experience in which he spoke to over 250 soldiers, . which confirmed that what he 'saw bore no resemblance to rosy official . statements by U.S. military leaders about conditions on the ground.' He . wrote that local Afghan government officials are failing to serve the . Afghan population, and their security forces are reluctant to fight . insurgents or are colluding with the Taliban. Last week a leaked Nato report claimed the Taliban remain defiant and have wide support among the Afghan people. Colonel Davis' observations have . already been expressed by American and coalition troops, who are often . become frustrated with Afghan security forces. Colonel Davis, cites an example of the lack of progress as a . conversation he had with an Afghan police officer in eastern . Afghanistan in Kunar province less than three hours after an insurgent . attack. Through an . interpreter, he asked the police captain how his forces usually . responded to such an incident and if his squad would go after the . insurgent fighters. U.S. soldiers and Afghan security forces: Colonel Davis' observations have already been expressed by American and coalition troops, who are often become frustrated with Afghan security forces . The Afghan police officer allegedly looked surprised and said: 'No! We don't go after them. That would be dangerous!' The Pentagon says it disagrees Colonel Davis' account but has not suggested any disciplinary action. 'Lieutenant Colonel Davis is obviously entitled to his opinion,' spokesman George Little said, adding that defence secretary Leon Panetta 'has very strong confidence in his commanders in Afghanistan, as they provide assessments of what is happening on the ground in the war.' This week it was announced, that the civilian death toll for the war in Afghanistan reached a record high last year with 3,021 deaths, according to the United Nations. Colonel Davis has reportedly provided a full account . of his findings in a classified report to several members of Congress, . both . Democrats and Republicans, senators and House members. Since 2001, the US death toll in Afghanistan has grown to 1,892 and coalition death figures reach 2,883. Most recently Brigadier General Terence Hildner became the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to die in the country. He passed away on Friday. He had commanded the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command at Fort Hood since August 2010 and left for Afghanistan in December to support the Nato mission there. This week it was announced, that the civilian death toll for the war in Afghanistan reached a record high last year with 3,021 deaths, according to the United Nations. The number killed rose by 8% last year – the fifth consecutive rise – with a further 4,507 civilians wounded, the UN report said. Many were killed by roadside bombs or in suicide attacks, with Taliban-affiliated militants responsible for three-quarters of the deaths.

"A landmark legal ruling banning the tradition of saying prayers at council meetings was denounced last night as an ‘assault on Britain’s Christian heritage’. The High Court controversially backed an anti-religious campaign to abolish official acts of worship. Christians and politicians reacted with dismay after a judge overturned centuries of custom by outlawing a town hall in Devon from putting prayers on the formal agenda. Controversial victory: Former councillor Clive Bone, pictured outside the town council offices in Bideford, won a legal battle to outlaw prayers at meetings - drawing instant criticism from religious groups . It prompted concern that it would . pave the way for Parliament to abandon prayers before Commons and Lords . business, mark the end of hospital and Forces chaplains, and could even . lead to the abolition of the Coronation Oath, pledged by Kings and . Queens taking the throne. The ruling means prayers will not be . allowed at the start of council meetings across England and Wales, . though they may still be said before the official start. It comes as two Christian B&B owners who refused to let a gay couple share a room lost an appeal against a ruling they must pay thousands in compensation to the men. The Court of Appeal told Peter and Hazelmary Bull that they were entitled to express their beliefs, but not if they were incompatible with the rights of gay people. Atheist former councillor Clive Bone . started the case against Bideford town council in July 2010, claiming he . had been ‘disadvantaged and embarrassed’ when religious prayers were . recited at formal meetings. Backed by the National Secular . Society, he insisted that the ‘inappropriate’ practice breached the . human right to freedom of conscience and discriminated against . non-believers, making them feel ‘uncomfortable’. The society claimed council meetings . should be ‘equally welcoming to everyone in the local community’ and . should therefore be ‘religiously-neutral’. High Court: Backed by the National Secular Society, Mr Bone insisted that the 'inappropriate' practice breached the human right to freedom of conscience and discriminated against non-believers . Mr Justice Ouseley, sitting in . London, rejected the human rights and equality challenges. But he ruled . that formal prayers at council meetings were unlawful because of a . technicality in the Local Government Act 1972. He said local authorities had no . power to ‘say prayers or to have any period of quiet reflection as part . of the business of the council’. Acknowledging the widespread importance . of the case, Mr Justice Ouseley gave Bideford council permission to . appeal. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles described the ruling as ‘very illiberal’. He said: ‘The ruling is surprising . and disappointing. Christianity plays an important part in the culture, . heritage and fabric of our nation.’ He vowed to override the High Court . ruling by bringing in the Government’s Localism Act, which would give . councils the power to hold prayers at the start of meetings, as early as . next Friday. Sitting at the High Court, Mr Justice Ouseley, left, rejected the human rights argument but ruled prayers were unlawful because of a technicality in the Local Government Act. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, right, called the ruling 'very illiberal' and vowed to nix it through the Government's Localism Act . Simon Calvert, of the Christian . Institute, said: ‘Prayers have been a part of council meetings for . centuries, and many people, either for religious reasons or cultural . reasons, see them as a positive part of our national life. ‘It’s a shame the courts have taken . sides with those whose goal is to undermine our Christian heritage. It . is high time Parliament put a stop to this assault upon our national . heritage.’ Harry Greenway, a former Tory MP and . ex-chairman of the National Prayer Breakfast, said: ‘If people do not . want to attend prayers of this nature, they can stay away instead of . meddling and busybodying with other people’s beliefs. ‘Non-believers are not harassed in . this way by believers. Why cannot the non-believers show the same kind . of tolerance?’ Mr Bone, who left Bideford council because of its . ‘refusal to adjust’ its prayers policy, said: ‘I’m delighted. I’m not . surprised, I expected to win. ‘This has got nothing to do with . intolerance towards religion. Religious freedom is an absolute right and . so is freedom from religion an absolute right, in my view.’ Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society said: ‘We’re very pleased with the judgment.’ Officials at Parliament said the 1689 . Bill of Rights meant the  Commons and Lords decided their own business, . so a legal challenge would fail.","Town hall prayers banned in 'assault on Britain's Christian heritage'

"Dunga has a tough task on his hands restoring  pride to the Brazilian national team after a disappointing World Cup, but perhaps taking some tips from Jose Mourinho will go a long way to helping. The Brazil coach, a World Cup-winning captain in 1994, travelled to Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday, where he and his coaching staff had lunch with Mourinho. 'There was a long conversation with an exchange of ideas about football, of course, and information about the many Brazilian players with whom (Mourinho) trained in Europe', the Brazilian Football Confederation reported.

'The Brazil coach is here today and shares the same vision as me. He recognises Oscar has reached a different level in his game and also in his personality. 'His intention is always to improve. Is he the kind of kid who can play 12 times in one month? I don't think so. 'But that we analyse the situation, we have other options, other players who can play in his position and his rest will obviously arrive to make sure we don't overload him with minutes of football.' Dunga also chatted to Didier Drogba while he was at the Chelsea training ground on Friday . The coaching team enjoyed a joke with the Brazilian contingency of Chelsea players, while Mourinho looked on . Dunga also visited Borussia Dortmund this week, where he met Jurgen Klopp with his technical committee Andrey Lopes and Gilmar Rinaldi.

The Brazilian coach has a busy weekend of football to look forward to. He will be at Stamford Bridge to watch some of his international players face up against West Brom on Saturday afternoon, before hot-footing it across the capital for the late game of the day; Arsenal vs Manchester United.

"Jose Mourinho has hit back at criticism levelled at Chelsea, chiefly by Sergio Ramos, and suggested there were 'double standards' at play in the club versus country row to have engulfed the Blues' season. Cesc Fabregas (hamstring) and Diego Costa (groin) withdrew from Spain's squad for a European Championship qualifier with Belarus and a friendly against Germany.

'My doctor and the doctor of the Spanish national team, they had the scans and they decided that the player was not in the condition to play.'

"An angry father has taught his disgruntled teenage daughter a very public lesson in respecting one’s elders by shooting her laptop on camera and then publishing the video on her Facebook page. Tommy Jordan, of Albemarle, North Carolina, made the video after his 15-year-old daughter Hannah had apparently written a Facebook post complaining about all of the chores she has to do at home. She was also moaning about how difficult her parents made her life. But when IT worker Mr Jordan found the post he decided grounding her would not be punishment enough and made the video. Scroll down for video . Angry: Tommy Jordan, of Albemarle, North Carolina, reads out his 15-year-old daughter Hannah's grumbling Facebook post in which she complains about having to do chores at home . ‘That right there is your laptop’, he . says in a YouTube video, pointing a camera at a computer lying in a . patch of dirt on the ground. ‘This right here is my .45,’ he says, . moving a pistol into the frame. He cocks the weapon and shoots nine . rounds into the laptop. The video entitled ‘Facebook Parenting: For the . Troubled Teen’ is dedicated to his rebellious daughter. It’s also aimed at ‘all her friends on . Facebook who thought that her little rebellious post was cute, and for . all you parents out there who think your, you know, kids don’t post bad . things on Facebook’. He begins by reading out his . daughter’s post from a computer print-out, explaining ‘since you want to . hide it from everyone, I’m going to share it with everybody’. Aim: Mr Jordan gets out his pistol to shoot the laptop, left, which he has placed in the dirt and grass - before he starts to fire at it, right, shooting nine bullets including one from Hannah's mother . Mr Jordan mocks his daughter for . thinking her parents would not be able to see the post because of her . Facebook privacy settings, ignoring the fact that he works in IT for a . living. 'That right there is your laptop. This right here is my .45' Tommy Jordan . In the post, Hannah says she should be . paid for the chores she does around the home and attacks her parents . for overworking her. Mr Jordan laughs at this suggestion, pointing out what an easy life she gets in comparison to what he had to endure growing up.  She moans about waking up at 5am and go to bed at 10pm. Then after about seven minutes addressing the camera to berate Hannah, he stands up and blows holes through the laptop. Irreparable: He shoots nine bullets into the computer, which he tells Hannah she will have to pay for as well . Winding up: 'I hope you've enjoyed your little fiasco' says Mr Jordan as he sits back down in front of the camera . He rounds off by saying: 'Oh yeah and . after that comment you made about your mom, your mom told me to be sure I . put one in there for her. So…that one's from her.' 'Maybe a few kids can take something away from this,’ Mr Jordan writes in the video description. ‘If you’re so disrespectful to your . parents and yourself as to post this kind of thing on Facebook, you’re . deserving of some tough love. Today, my daughter is getting a dose of . tough love.’ He said he found her hidden Facebook post while upgrading her computer. He completes his lesson by saying: . ‘You can have a new laptop when you buy a new laptop and when you pay me . back the $130 for the software I spent on yours. ‘I hope you’ve enjoyed your little . fiasco on Facebook. I hope it was worth all this.' The video has been . watched around 1.5million times since it was posted just two days ago. Mr Jordan has since written on Facebook that the attention has helped him and his daughter 'deal with it' and insisted Hannah is fine, saying they both laughed about the video going viral. But he admitted: 'I’ll agree that wasn’t a good example of me as a father. I had been reading that post again and again for about an hour, sometimes in tears, other times so mad my hands were shaking. 'I was trying very hard to be civil in my message,' Mr Jordan said, reported Fox News. 'I slipped in that and said a word I shouldn’t have. I deserve a little backlash for that, no doubt.' To my parents, . I'm not your damn slave. It's not my responsibility to clean up your s**t. We have a cleaning lady for a reason. Her name is Linda, not Hannah. If you want coffee, get off your ass and get it yourself. If you want a garden, shovel the fertiliser yourself, don't sit back on your ass and watch me do it. If you walk in the house and get mud all over the floor that I just cleaned, be my guest, but clean it up after you are done getting s**t everywhere. I'm tired of picking up after you. You tell me at least once a day that I need to get a job. You could just pay me for all the s**t that I do around the house. Every day when I get home from school, I have to do dishes, clean the counter tops, all the floors, make all the beds, do the laundry and get the trash. I'm not even going to mention all the work I do around your clinic. And if I don't do all that every day, I get grounded. Do you know how hard it is to keep up with chores and schoolwork? It's freaking crazy. I go to sleep at 10 o'clock every night because I am too tired to stay up any longer and do anything else. I have to get up at five in the morning, to get ready for school. On the weekends, I have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother won't come get me up at six. I'm tired of this bulls**t. Next time I have to pour a cup of coffee, I'm going to flip s**t.

"Rory McIlroy has already secured the Race to Dubai crown but the world No 1 is still putting in the leg work ahead of teeing it up at the season-finale DP World Tour Championship. McIlroy is about to bring the curtain down on his best ever campaign after winning The Open, the US PGA Championship, the BMW PGA Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. There was also Ryder Cup triumph at Gleneagles in September as Paul McGinley's Europeans beat Tom Watson's troops from the United States. Rory McIlroy posted this picture to his Twitter account after enjoying a leg workout in Dubai . McIlroy was working up a sweat with the big weights in his preparation for the DP World Tour Championship . McIlroy, who is paired with Henrik Stenson on Thursday at Jumeirah, has been warming up with some heavy work in the gym and posting pictures on Twitter. He tweeted: 'Great leg workout to start the day.' McIlroy was out for a practice round on Tuesday ahead of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship . Meanwhile, McIlroy believes Lewis Hamilton deserves to win this year's Formula One world title after criticising the sport's controversial double-points system. Whilst McIlroy competes in the final event of the European Tour, 60 miles away along the Gulf coast Hamilton goes head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for F1's glittering prize at the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. The fact McIlroy has already secured a second 'Race to Dubai' title without striking a ball in anger in this week's event has prompted debate the format of the Final Series requires tweaking to ensure a grandstand finale. Lewis Hamilton posing in front of his private jet ahead of the Formula One season finale in Abu Dhabi . McIlroy, speaking in Dubai on Tuesday, insists Hamilton is more deserving of the title than Nico Rosberg . In order to guarantee an end-of-year showdown in F1 it is why double points were introduced this season, yet with 17 between Hamilton and Rosberg, ironically such a gimmick is not required on this occasion. Whilst McIlroy is unconcerned whether golf's rulers change the Final Series format, he does at least feel F1 has taken a step too far. 'I don't think their whole season should be decided on one race with the double points,' said the 25-year-old. 'It makes it exciting for the fans, but I'm sure Lewis doesn't think it's that exciting right now. Hamilton and Rosberg will battle it out for the drivers' championship at the final race of the season on Sunday . Hamilton, pictured after winning the British Grand Prix in July, is bidding to win his second world title . 'Hopefully for him it all works out and he does come out on top because he's definitely the deserving champion of this year.' What double points in F1 has done is afford Rosberg a far greater opportunity to take the championship. Victory for Rosberg, with Hamilton third or worse, will see him claim a crown won by father Keke in 1982. If the current system had continued into the closing race, Hamilton could have finished at worst sixth behind a Rosberg win and still emerge as champion. Given the furore behind the scheme since it was first aired almost a year ago, it is certain to be dropped when it comes up for debate at the next World Motor Sport Council meeting in early December. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, far from a fan with his drivers at the heart of the topic, said: 'My personal view is we have had a big backlash from the fans and many vocal personalities who don't like the system. 'Many within the group of stakeholders of Formula One also don't like the concept. 'I have been a racing driver myself. If I put myself in the situation I wouldn't want to have double points. 'Probably the decision taken together wasn't the right one, and we need to change it for the future. 'It is down to the commercial rights holder and the governing body, and I hope we are going to make the right decisions.'","Rory McIlroy was putting in a big shift in the gym .

"Glenn Hoddle may not have known it, but the former Tottenham and England star has been immortalised in new Holloywood film The Imitation Game. The film, which depicts Alan Turing's code-breaking skills at Bletchley Park during World War II, pays tribute to Hoddle in the form of a personalised number plate. The moment is brief, but as a military vehicle speeds across the screen, a 'Hod 75' number plate can clearly be seen which is a nod to Hoddle's Spurs debut in 1975. The Imitation Game features a nod to former England manager and Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle (pictured) A vehicle that appears briefly in the middle of the film has the number plate 'HOD 75' in a nod to Hoddle .

A member of the film’s art department is a big Tottenham fan.’ It's still unclear as to whether the film's co-stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley spotted the Hoddle tribute.

It will be interesting to see if Maurcio Pochettino's Tottenham team are good enough to make sure that the key moment of a rather frantic game at the KC Stadium  still appears significant several months down the line. A goal down early in the second half on Humberside, Tottenham were seemingly drifting towards another defeat in the Barclays Premier League. To all intents and purposes, they were Liverpool dressed in white. Talented but aimless. Capable but low on confidence. It's a lousy mixture.

Football, though, can offer you opportunity when there seems to be none and Tottenham's came in the shape of the flailing right foot of the prone Hull midfielder Gaston Ramirez four minutes in to the second half. Sent off by referee Craig Pawson on the advice of his linesman, the South American's foot did appear to make some kind of contact with Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen. Still, though, a red card seemed a little extreme as indeed was Pochettino's subsequent assertion that his team would still have won had Hull retained the full complement of players. 'Yes, I think we would have won anyway,' said Pochettino. 'We had a different attitude and mentality in the second half. We were better than Hull and deserved to win.' Certainly the Tottenham manager deserves full marks for positive – if not wishful – thinking. His team had been wretched in the first half and probably should have trailed by more than an early goal from former Spurs player Jake Livermore. Undoubtedly, the red card changed the game. Credit to Tottenham for taking full advantage of it. Hull, meanwhile, perhaps need to understand that losing a player doesn't necessarily need to be the equivalent of a football death sentence. They retreated far too much – both mentally and in terms of territory – once Ramirez went off and they perhaps need to reflect on that a little. In the short-term, however, manager Steve Bruce will feel a little hard done by as he reflects on this game and indeed on a run in the league that now sees Hull with only one win since the opening day of the season. 'It was petulance and the letter of the law says it's violent conduct,' said Bruce. 'But the really top referees use common sense. I think it should have been a yellow. 'Vertonghen is a 6ft 3in centre half but he has gone down as if pole-axed. 'That can't be healthy for the Premier League. It is creeping in and it's disappointing.

Steve Bruce was understandably frustrated at losing this game, which he felt turned on the dismissal of Gaston Ramirez in the 48th minute. Referee Craig Pawson had to send Ramirez off, not because of the petulant reaction to a series of challenges the Uruguayan made, but because his assistant, the vastly experienced Peter Kirkup, advised him to. Pawson had clearly missed the retaliatory flick out by Ramirez and the swing of an arm, neither of which was particularly violent or aggressive, so had to rely on Kirkup's opinion. The decision to dismiss was harsh on Ramirez given the context of how referees are approaching their task this season and given his clear frustration at the attention he was getting from Moussa Dembele, Ben Davies and Jan Vertonghen. The incident clearly affected the players and Pawson himself, who was then tested with a series of incidents - the clearest of which should have resulted in an obvious second yellow card for Jake Livermore for a late, reckless challenge. Bruce's disappointment was keen and reflective not just of the sending off but that Hull should have been two or three up by half-time. Having been brave enough to make six changes to his team after defeat at Burnley, Bruce saw his team play positive, vibrant football in the opening half an hour and they were ahead in only the ninth minute as Livermore reacted first to a clearing header to advance and drive a low right-foot shot across goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and in to the corner.

At this point, and for a good while longer, Tottenham were struggling. They were handy enough in the final third – they have some intelligent players – but poor when they didn't have possession and two opportunities that Hull created midway through the half were indicative of this. First Hull's Robbie Brady was too alert for the Tottenham central defenders, bringing a superb low save from Lloris from 12 yards. Then, moments later, the visiting defence were on their heels again when Lloris pushed away Ramirez's cross shot and Hatem Ben Arfa scooped the rebound over the bar. It looked an awful miss and Bruce subsequently claimed it had taken a deflection. Maybe that would explain it but, whatever the case, it was a pivotal moment. In to the second half and, after the red card, Tottenham certainly were better. From that point on Hulll struggled for possession and conceded the equaliser when a Christian Eriksen free-kick struck the bar and young Harry Kane reacted well to sweep in the rebound. With almost half an hour left, Hull suddenly looked in trouble. Certainly Tottenham could have scored again sooner as Ryan Mason saw a shot saved, Kane headed down and wide from close range, Roberto Soldado was similarly wasteful and Erik Lamela drove in to the penalty area with purpose only to shoot high and wide. A winner did always look likely, though, and it came with a minute left as Eriksen received the ball from Aaron Lennon before finding the corner from the edge of the penalty area. 'This is a cruel league,' said Bruce afterwards. In the circumstances, that was something of an understatement.

"Doctors and nurses have been warned by David Cameron that ‘standards are not good enough' after one in three patients said they would not recommend their local hospital to family and friends. The Prime Minister said the new test would give a single measure for the quality of NHS care across the country. The first set of results revealed patients in 36 hospital wards across England would not recommend them to loved ones. Care: David Cameron said the new Friends and Family Test would expose areas where healthcare is poor . The first wave of the ‘Friends and Family’ test also saw one English A&E department get a ‘negative score’ - at Chase Farm Hospital, part of the Barnet and Chase Farm Hospital NHS Trust, in north London. Patients are simply asked whether they would recommend the hospital where they were treated to their loved ones. Each hospital is then given a score based on patient satisfaction levels - if every single patient says they would be ‘extremely likely’ to recommend the service the ward would receive a score of 100, if every single patient said they would be ‘neither unlikely nor likely’, ‘unlikely’ or ‘extremely unlikely’ to recommend the service, the trust receives a score of minus 100. Mr Cameron, who is on holiday in Portugal, said: ‘I am determined to give patients a far greater voice within the NHS as a way of highlighting the best and worst of care within our hospitals. Health minister Anna Soubry claims the Mid-Staffs scandal could have been prevented if the test had been in place . ‘With the 'Friends and Family' test, we now have a single measure that looks at the quality of care across the country. ‘I want the NHS to put patient satisfaction at the heart of what they do and expect action to be taken at hospitals where patients and staff say standards are not good enough.’ Health minister Anna Soubry suggested that the test could have highlighted earlier the Mid-Staffs NHS scandal, in which up to 1,200 people died needdessly as a result of poor care. She told BBC News: 'We are clearing away some of the smokescreen, some of the systems that prevented people from knowing what's actually happening in their hospitals. 'People in Stafford had known what was happening in their hospital had they been listend to then hopefully some of those people that died wouldn't have died if people had taken proper action considerably sooner.' More than 400,000 NHS hospital inpatients or A&E attendees completed the test during April, May and June. NHS England will now publish monthly updates to ensure patients can regularly give feedback about the care they receive. By the end of next year, NHS England hopes to roll the test out to include GP practices, community services and mental health services. All other services will be included by April 2015. Tim Kelsey, NHS England's national director for patients and information, said: ‘This is the boldest move yet to promote real openness in the NHS and to concentrate our focus on improvement in care. ‘At the heart of Robert Francis's report into the tragedy at Stafford hospital was one basic message: to ensure the NHS delivers high quality care for all, we need transparency of the patient and carer experience. It is the absence of this transparency that often allows poor care to go undetected.’ But Jocelyn Cornwell, director of new patient charity the Point of Care Foundation, said the data are ‘not meaningful’. She said: ‘The way in which the data for the friends and family test is collected varies widely and is open to gaming. ‘People who respond are not part of a random sample, but are self-selecting or, worse, are encouraged to respond by staff. ‘Clearly there is a temptation for staff to encourage responses from patients who they feel will respond positively, especially as a positive result is linked to financial reward.’ Under the new Friends and Family test, patients are asked if they would recommend their ward to their loved ones. The number who give a negative rating is then deducted from the number who give a positive response. This figure is then used to produce a Friends and Family Test Score. NHS England said that in the first set of results a total of 36 out of 4,500 wards had a negative rating. However, some of the hospitals point out that the score can be based on just one rating from a patient.","Patients asked if they would recommend wards to friends and family .

"When Toni Duggan sings the National Anthem at Wembley before England play Germany on Sunday afternoon, it will be the realisation of a dream formed in the gym of a Liverpool youth club, where she played against boys four years older. ‘The fact there’ll be 55,000 people singing it back at me makes you realise how far you’ve come as an individual but also as women footballers,’ said Duggan, ‘It was always our aim to raise the profile of the game and I believe it’s only going to get bigger.’ This is the first time an England women’s game will be played at the new Wembley. Demand for tickets for the friendly far outstripped that for the men’s friendly against Norway in September and there might have been an even bigger crowd were it not for engineering works on London’s transport system putting a cap on ticket sales. Toni Duggan (far right) celebrates scoring her first goal of the World Cup qualifier against Turkey in September . Toni Duggan poses during a fashion photoshoot at Goodison Park . ‘We sold out for our capacity,’ said Duggan. ‘Who knows, in the future if we get invited back to Wembley again it could be a bit higher. ‘I’ve been to Wembley before to watch Liverpool and Everton in the FA Cup semi-final in 2012. I saw the atmosphere there and I didn’t ever think women’s football would be played in front of those crowds in my time.’ Duggan’s love of the game began on the playing fields of her primary school and at her local youth club where she watched her older brothers play and had a kickabout on the sidelines. ‘I played with lads four years older than me,’ said Duggan. ‘It brought me on physically and mentally and challenged me a lot more than when I played with the girls because there weren’t that many girl footballers about. ‘When I was 12 I was told I couldn’t play with the boys any more and I was devastated. I’d recommend for any little girl starting out to play with the boys as long as possible.’ Duggan tackles Sweden's Jenny Hjohlman during an international friendly in August . ‘A lot of the boys I played with went on to play non-League and they come and watch me sometimes. ‘I remember as a kid scouts from Liverpool and Everton would come along and I’d try to impress them and they’d look at me like, “You’re not a boy”. But even at Man City now if someone comes along to watch us train I’ll be putting in the extra 20 per cent to make sure they know women’s football is a good standard. That’s the fight we’ve been fighting all our lives. That’s why the Wembley game is so big — we’re finally winning the battle.’ Duggan, 23, joined Everton as a teenager but last year she was lured to Manchester City, another Women’s Super League side who are at the vanguard of developing women’s football at elite level. ‘If I want to be at the top Man City is the best club for me,’ said Duggan, ‘The women are treated exactly the same as the men, they’ve built a mini stadium just for the women’s team. We train with the under 18 boys. Duggan plays for Manchester City Ladies, and says it is the best club to be at to fulfil her ambitions . Duggan (centre) in action for Manchester City as she holds off a challenge from Arsenal's Shinobu Ohno . ‘That takes me back to my childhood, I get a kick out of that. I see the likes of Sergio Aguero, James Milner or Yaya Toure around the building and they will say they’ve watched our games sometimes.’ Anyone who has seen Duggan’s sweetly struck volleyed goal against Chelsea which was judged FA goal of the month cannot deny the skill level of women’s football. Duggan, who is fond of a pair of fake eyelashes and manicured nails, says people should not be deceived by her appearance. ‘Being feminine and sporty is not mutually exclusive,’ she said. ‘That’s just the way I am and I’m not going to change that because I’m a footballer. ‘I’m a totally different person when I go on the pitch. You can judge me and say I like to look after my nails or I want to wear false eyelashes but it doesn’t mean I’m going to pull out of a 50-50 challenge. I think it’s good that there are a couple of girls on the team who are a lot more feminine and it’s important that girls have different role models. The 23-year-old forward has represented her country 16 times and scored 12 goals . ‘It’s important that people are judged on their footballing ability first and foremost. It doesn’t mean to say because someone else isn’t as feminine they’re not as good.’ Duggan knows there will be no scope for worrying about chipped nail varnish against Germany. The visitors have won seven out of the last eight European Championships, as well as two of the last three World Cups and will provide a stern assessment of Mark Sampson’s side. Germany cruised through the qualifying campaign for the World Cup with 10 wins, including a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro. ‘I wouldn’t want any other opposition for this big stage,’ said Duggan. ‘If we want to be at the top of our game, we need to be playing in front of 55,000 against one of the best teams in the world and people can see how good we are.’","England women's team face Germany at Wembley on Sunday .

"A charity worker drowned in a 3ft deep lake when a policeman and a paramedic were ordered not to try to rescue him. Simon Burgess, 41, was left to float face down as emergency crews watched. Health and safety rules stopped them going more than ankle deep into the lake, an inquest was told yesterday. Tragedy: Simon Burgess, right, feeds the swans at the lake in Gosport, Hampshire, where he drowned a few months after this picture was taken . 'Too deep': Emergency services are pictured here just after they recovered the body from the lake. They had refused to get into the water until specialists arrived because it was 'too deep' According to a doctor, Mr Burgess’s life could have been saved had he been removed from the water quickly. The constable and the ambulance . worker   who volunteered to jump into the lake were given strict orders . not to do so by fire station watch manager Tony Nicholls. PC Tony Jones arrived at the scene on foot shortly after Mr Burgess fell into the water while feeding swans. He told the inquest: ‘When I spoke to . witnesses and found out the body hadn’t been there long I told my . sergeant I was willing to go into the water. ‘He authorised me to do so and I took off my body armour but Mr Nicholls advised me strongly not to go in. ‘I said I would go in anyway and asked . if I could borrow his life jacket but he said “No”, but I was going to . do it regardless. It didn’t sit right with me that no one was going to . get the body or assist the person in the water. ‘The control room was informed I was going in and they sent a message that under no circumstances could I go in the water.’ Wading out: Following the delay, a pair of firefighters make their way into the centre of the waist-deep lake to attempt to rescue Mr Burgess . Probe: Police cordon off the scene following the tragedy. The inquest heard today there was a 28 minute delay before Mr Burgess was pulled from the water after the first phone call was made . Paramedic Robert Wallace told the . hearing he also offered to attempt to retrieve the body from the water . at Walpole Park in Gosport, Hampshire. ‘I’m trained to swim in currents you go white water rafting in, but Mr Nicholls told me he didn’t want my help,’ he said. Mr Nicholls, who is based at Gosport . fire station, told the inquest that he understood the body had been in . the water for five to ten minutes. ‘There were no obvious signs of life so from that I made an assessment it was a body retrieval and not a rescue,’ he said. ‘The officers were trained to go into . ankle deep water, which is level one, so we waited for level two . officers, who can go into chest high. ‘One of the police officers told me he . would like to go in the water and I advised him in the strongest terms . not to. A paramedic told me he was level two water trained, but when I . asked him if he had protective equipment he said “No”, so that was the . end of that. Delay: Control room manager Deborah Coles, left, took the 999 call from . Gillian Hughes, right, at 12.17pm - but it was 28 minutes before Mr . Burgess was pulled from the water . ‘I was under immense pressure from the three witnesses to go into the water but I gave them a short answer. ‘The specialist team arrived and three officers went in and removed the body.’ A witness told of her frustration at seeing 999 workers stand and wait. Although fire crews were sent almost immediately it was 35 minutes before Simon Burgess was recovered from the water. Registrar Dr Bret Lockyer said if he had been pulled out sooner there was a 'slim chance' he could have been saved. The timeline on March 10 was as follows: . 12.17pm: Gillian Hughes rings the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service control room and speaks to Deborah Coles, the control room manager. 12.18pm: Fire engine, water rescue trained crew and a water support unit are sent. Police, ambulance and coastguard are also dispatched. 12.20pm: Fire crews arrive. 12.25pm: They . report to their control room a male is floating down in the water. Around this time, Gillian Hughes says they refused to go into the water. 12.31pm: The water support unit arrive. 12.46pm: They request that the press officer attends the scene. 12.52pm: Firefighters report to their control room that Simon Burgess is recovered from the water. 12.58pm: He is taken to hospital. 1.42pm: He is formally pronounced dead. Gillian Hughes said the specialist . team measured the depth of the water with a pole and even called for a . press officer before recovering Mr Burgess’s lifeless body. This was . almost 30 minutes after the earlier teams arrived. Mrs Hughes, 53, said Mr Burgess fell in while trying to retrieve a plastic bag from the water. ‘He looked like he was swimming and had a smile on his face,’ she said. ‘The next minute he had stopped and . was lying face down. The firemen arrived with the police and I said . “He’s only been there five or ten minutes so if you hurry you might save . him”. ‘He just said “We’re not allowed’ and I . said “But that’s your job”. Mr Burgess was only 20ft away. I thought . they would get him straight away. ‘I believe one of the police went in . to get him but was told he was not allowed. I said to one of the firemen . “Why don’t you go in?” and he said they couldn’t if the water was . higher than ankle deep. ‘I said “You’re having a laugh”. He said “No, that’s health and safety”. ‘After the incident I was unable to . sleep because I kept blaming myself and now I have to live with it.’ Hampshire Fire and Rescue control room manager Deborah Coles answered . Mrs Hughes’s 999 call at 12.17pm on March 10 last year. She told the inquest that a number of rescue teams, including specialists, were sent immediately. Brett Lockyer, a registrar of . histopathology, told the inquest there were signs Mr Burgess had fallen . into the lake because of an epileptic seizure, following unsuccessful . brain surgery to ease his condition. ‘If he had been taken out of the water after ten minutes there is a slim chance he could have been resuscitated,’ he said. ‘The seizure would’ve made it look like he was swimming and explains why he had a grin on his face.’ Mr Burgess, from Gosport, was declared dead at hospital. The hearing, at Portsmouth Coroners’ Court, continues. Firefighters need to be trained to water rescue level two if they want to save someone from drowning in a three foot deep lake, the inquest heard today. The rules are set down in the firefighters own health and safety policy document LSO 34. Under the wording of the rules, rescuers trained to level one can only go into water that is ankle deep - even if someone is in difficulty. During the two-day level two training session firefighters have to go to lectures, conduct exercises and take part in practical demonstrations. Although one of the first responders was 'level two' trained he did not have appropriate equipment with him - so Mr Burgess had to be left dying in the water, the inquest was told. The Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service website sets out the full details of the level two course - as set out below: .

Christopher Roney – aka Cool C - was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting death of Lauretha Vaird on January 2, 1996. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed an execution warrant for Roney on Friday and he is scheduled to be executed via lethal injection on January 8, 2015. Scroll down for video . Christopher Roney - aka Cool C - was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting death of Lauretha Vaird on January 2, 1996. He is due to be executed by lethal injection on January 8 2015 . Roney, now 44, was found guilty of first-degree murder and other offenses in October 1996 and a death verdict was returned a month later in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, reports NBC10. On January 2, 1996, around 8:20 a.m., Roney, Ernest Canty and Warren McGlone had attempted to rob a PNC Bank in Philadelphia. Officer Lauretha Vaird, a nine-year veteran with the 25th District, was the first officer to arrive at the scene. As she entered the bank, Roney opened fire, shot her in the abdomen, according to officials. He and the other two men then fled the scene as other officers arrived. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, left, signed an execution warrant for Roney on Friday. The rapper was in a group called C.E.B. at the time of the shooting in 1996 he is pictured top left along with Warren McGlone, right, who was involved in the same heist . Vaird, a 43-year-old single mother of two boys, died from her injuries. She was the first Philadelphia female police officer to be killed in the line of duty. Roney and his two accomplices were arrested after police received statements from eyewitnesses. He was granted a stay of execution from Pennsylvania Judge Gary Glazer on February 1, 2006 until all post-conviction litigation was resolved. Roney has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeals process, despite the testimony of three eyewitnesses who placed him at the scene of the robbery, as well as ballistic and forensic evidence and surveillance video that linked him to the murder. Prior to his arrest, Roney had released two solo albums as Cool C I Gotta Habit, in 1989, and Life In The Ghetto, 1990, as well as an album with the hip hop group C.E.B. in 1993. He was best known for his hit song Glamorous Life.

"A tech startup worth more than JetBlue and many other brand names might not even be real. High-flying Cynk Technologies has soared 30,000 per cent to more than $18 a share in the last month, raising its market value to more than $5billion. JetBlue, an established brand-name airline, is worth $3billion. Cynk is behind a social networking site called IntroBiz, which markets itself as a way to meet angel investors, celebrities, business owners and more. Off its highs: Cynk Technology hit more than $18 per share but has since fallen from that lofty perch under increased scrutiny . ‘Thru [sic] our marketplace you may both buy and sell the ability to socially connect to individuals such as celebrities, business owners, and talented IT professionals,’ the site boasts. Pictures of many celebrities including Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are shown as ‘recent intros’ on the site’s homepage. It is not clear what has sent the stock literally climbing through the roof from six cents per share to more than $18 a share since June 16, there are signs trouble is afoot. Cynk’s headquarters is in Belize, the company is incorporated in Nevada and its only contact number is in Miami, Huffington Post noted. A MailOnline call to that number was not answered and disconnected after ringing more than 20 times. A filing earlier this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company would not be able to file its annual report this year. ‘The Registrant is unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 within the prescribed time without unreasonable effort or expense because the Registrant and its accounting staff require additional time to complete the financial statements and the notes,’ said the filing. The social marketplace: Cynk promises to connect ordinary people with celebrities, tycoons and others on IntroBiz - but there is little proof to suggest anything is actually done . Video Source YouTube . A MailOnline call to the (800) number listed as the contact for Marlon Luis Sanchez resulted in a phone company message saying the number is unassigned. Sanchez is listed in the filing as the CEO, CFO, CAO, President, Secretary , Treasurer and Director of Cynk Technology. Cynk has only $39 in assets and almost $52,000 in liabilities, according to its most recent quarterly filing available on OTCMarkets.com. The company has lost money for several quarters and has no income, according to annual income statements available on Yahoo Finance. Bubbles come and go, but this company’s valuation defies logic. It is not clear what has driven the company’s shares to unfathomable heights – but a pump and dump scheme could be the culprit. Pump and dumps schemes work when brokers work to sell a penny stock - at six cents per share and trading over the counter, Cynk was a penny stock - to unsuspecting investors in order to drive the stock price up. Straw buyers also take positions in the stock, and sell their shares at a predetermined price where they realize a huge profit. Once they sell, the stock goes back down again and everyone else loses their shirt. Jordan Belfort, known as the 'Wolf of Wall Street' went to jail for a number of crimes including pump and dump schemes. SEC policy prohibits the agency from commenting on pending investigations, and a spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the regulator is looking into the company.","Cynk Technology stock was worth six cents per share on June 16 .

"Arsenal have endured some humiliations at the hands of Manchester United in recent years; notably there was that awful 8-2 defeat at Old Trafford among a smattering of comprehensive victories, as Arsene Wenger’s team have waned from their previous position of power. They have bided their time in north London and have waited patiently for the roles to be reversed, for United to be vulnerable and exposed. And when their moment came, they failed utterly. Worse than that; they presented United with the points. Of all the indignities heaped on this Arsenal side in recent years, Saturday’s defeat ranks as one of the more significant. It is not that Arsenal were bad, as going forward they were exceptional at times. Indeed, had they drawn this game, it would have felt like a missed opportunity. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring his side's second in their 2-1 win away at Arsenal .

Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) - 7 . Even when they raised some late hope, with Oliver Giroud, back from injury, striking an exquisite half volley in added time, it was illusory. The fact that they could contrive to lose to such a weakened United side in a game which they might have had wrapped up within 20 minutes was stupefying. And their sheer absence of ruthlessness indicates just how fragile they have become: a mentally-flawed team that has turned losing games from dominant positions into an art form. ‘It was a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it’s a long time since we have dominated games against Manchester United like we did today,’ said Wenger. ‘But we were not efficient enough in the final third and we made a mistake at the back. We had plenty of chances: their keeper is man of the match and that tells you the story of the game.’ Louis van Gaal’s brazenness is generally characterised as genius; it looked closer to madness in those opening 20 minutes as United flailed in defence. A back three of Paddy McNair, Chris Smalling and Tyler Blackett was encouragement enough to Arsenal and within 15 minutes United had also lost Luke Shaw to injury. Wenger’s side attacked like a team that knew they were in the ascendancy, Alexis Sanchez leading the way, playing with an intensity which was exhilarating. The chances came in a flurry: a free header for Per Mertesacker; a header over from Danny Welbeck after superb play from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain; a shot from Jack Wilshere, after he drove through a vacant United midfield. But principally there was Wilshere’s chance on 15 minutes, created by Sanchez chasing down David De Gea, whose consequent weak clearance reached only Welbeck, who fed Wilshere. Charging through United’s defence again and this time less than six yards out with only De Gea to beat, Wilshere hesitated before shooting into the United goalkeeper’s body: it was a terrible miss. ‘I was not pleased with the way we had played in the first half,’ Van Gaal said. ‘I have to say the first 25 minutes we gave the ball so easily away, it’s not possible for a top team. Arsenal created a lot of chances, but fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper in David De Gea . ‘If Arsenal had score in the first 20 minutes, it would have been another game and then maybe I would have had to respond to all the questions because I had chosen three defenders - but now I can laugh. Danny Welbeck (left) spurned a great chance against his former side in the open minutes when his shot was blocked by Paddy McNair .

Wilshere’s miss proved significant, as United slowly began to settle and Wilshere it was who was un-nerved enough on 30 minutes to butt his head into Marouane Fellaini’s chin. He was lucky to stay on the pitch, let alone not even earn a yellow card. Arsenal started the second half well, with Oxlade-Chamberlain delivering a delightful ball for Welbeck, who found his way blocked again by De Gea. Try as he might, Welbeck could not punish Van Gaal for his lack of faith in his talent. And shortly after Wilshere had to depart with an ankle injury after a terrible challenge from McNair. And yet Arsenal are always only a moment away from calamity. An Ashley Young cross on 56 minutes was directed at a marginally offside Fellaini but Kieran Gibbs and Wojciech Szczesny got themselves in a terrible mess, colliding and knocking each other over. Antonio Valencia fired in a relatively harmless cross, but Gibbs inexplicably lifted his leg while still grounded. With his goalkeeper still struggling, winded and injured, Gibbs diverted the ball into his own net. Worse for Arsenal, Szczesny had to come off immediately after the goal with Emiliano Martinez replacing him. Suddenly Smalling looked a leader, making crucial interceptions and pulling McNair and Blackett into shape. There was a Sanchez header on 63 minutes and a fine Santi Cazorla strike on 69 minutes, but then Arsenal lost the ball on the edge of the United box on 86 minutes - they are never more of a danger to themselves than when on the attack - and Fellaini swept the ball to Angel Di Maria. He advanced it on to Wayne Rooney, who finished with a cool confidence. Wenger was unimpressed. ‘It was just after a corner and we were not cautious enough,’ he said. ‘I don’t know why we had nobody at the back at all.’ It might have been 3-0, Di Maria chipping wide when he seemed sure to score from another breakaway. Giroud then provided his late riposte, but such finery could not disguise Arsenal’s failings. ‘There’s discordance between possession and the chances we create and our results,’ said Wenger. ‘It’s very difficult but we have to keep faith in what we do.’ Rooney (right) jumps for joy in celebration of their opener at Arsenal during their Premier League clash .

"In the Appalachian Mountains rests a medical oddity so unusual that it at first seems a massive hoax. Dating back to the early 1800s, an isolated family in eastern Kentucky - who can trace their roots back to a French orphan - started producing children who were blue. As a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes, intermarriage and inbreeding, members of the Fugate family were born with a rare condition that made them visibly discoloured. Feeling blue: Due to inbreeding and inter-marriage, a rural family developed a rare skin discolouration . The mystery behind the astonishing picture of the Fugates, which has been baffling people for years, appears to have finally been solved. It began when Martin Fugate, a French orphan, settled on the banks of eastern Kentucky's Troublesome Creek to claim a land grant in the early 19th century. He married a red-haired American named Elizabeth Smith - who had a very pale complexion - and their union formed a genetic mutation that resulted in their descendants being born with blue skin. Looking at the portrait, they appear to have been either Photoshopped or made up to mimic characters from children's cartoon The Smurfs, but science proves that the condition is in fact real. Rural: The Fugates lived in an isolated part of eastern Kentucky and had little opportunity to mix with others . Relations: A photo of Lorenzo 'Blue Anze' Dow Fugate and Eleanor Fugate, taken around 1915 . Called methaemoglobinaemia (commonly . known as met-H), the condition reduces the individual’s ability to carry . oxygen in their blood. As a result, their blood is darker than the colour typically found running through people’s veins. The methaemoglobinaemia condition, or ‘met-H’, reduces someone’s ability to carry oxygen in the blood, leaving it darker than the colour typically found in veins. The Fugate family intermarried with a neighbouring family for generations, which led to a relatively ‘pure’ gene pool, often including the met-H gene. But as Kentucky became more populated and more genes came into the Fugate family tree, there were far fewer children born blue. The gene is still around today but has now become statistically insignificant and there are no serious medical problems associated with it. Because . the Fugate family lived in such an isolated part of the Kentucky, they . intermarried with a neighbouring family for generations which led to a . relatively ‘pure’ gene pool where the met-H gene appeared much more . frequently. The family was first discovered in 1958 . when one of the blue men, Luke Combs, who was a descendant of another . branch of the Fugate family, took his white wife to the University of Kentucky . Hospital and doctors paid more attention to him than his wife. ‘Luke was just as blue as Lake Louise on a cool summer day,’ doctor Charles H. Behlen II told the Tri-City Herald in 1974. Aside from the stark discoloration of the carrier’s skin, there are no serious problems associated with the disease. In 1980, a counter-intuitive solution was discovered where the blue person drinks a chemical-filled solution that is itself blue. This then turns the carrier’s blood into a ‘normal’ red hue which is then reflected in a change in skin tone. Methaemoglobinaemia (commonly known as met-H) is a recessive gene (shown by the small r) so only produces 'blue' people in very rare circumstances . Because of the dispersion of fluids, the . solution only lasts for about a day so the carrier would have to drink a . serving every day. 'They weren’t sick; it was just the way they look. They’re normal people - they’re good people' Nurse Ruth Pendergrass . As eastern Kentucky has become vastly more populated than the early 19th century, and as more genes are married into the Fugate family tree, there were far fewer children born with the condition. That said, the recessive met-H gene lingers to this day, but it is statistically insignificant now. ‘They weren’t sick; it was just the way they look,’ said nurse Ruth Pendergrass in the Tri-City Herald article. 'They’re normal people - they’re good people.’","Isolated family in Kentucky started producing blue children in 1800s .

"Ed Miliband’s clique of millionaire advisors are acting like a ‘Berlin Wall’ stopping Labour connecting with ordinary voters, backbench MPs have warned. The Labour leader is facing mounting criticism over his sacking of shadow minister Emily Thornberry over her ‘snobby’ tweet of a family home draped in England flags last week. Former welfare minister Frank Field said the incident was ‘the most serious thing that has happened’ to Labour - ‘because it gives vent to what everybody’s guts are telling them about us’. Labour shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves added that the gaffe had harmed Labour's chances of winning the next election. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband's north London elite which is stopping Labour being in touch with its supporters, claimed Frank Field . She said: 'I was angry when I saw it, because I am working hard, as are other Labour MPs and activists around the country, trying to get a Labour government back in six months time and she set that process back.' It came after Mr Field accused the Labour leader of surrounding himself with a clique of wealthy out-of-touch aides and MPs who did not understand ordinary workers. He said: ‘It’s the north London set we’ve got to control. They are a Berlin Wall trying to prevent us reaching out to our voters and like the Berlin Wall they’ve got to be demolished.' Mr Field added: ‘Ed’s trying to move us on immigration and welfare and with one blast of a tweet she wrecks that and puts us back to square one. The real problem we have is that there’s a whole group of them.’ His remarks came as fellow Labour MP David Lammy - who grew up on a council estate close to Tottenham's infamous Broadwater Farm – said the party had ‘lost touch’ with ordinary voters. He said: ‘By and large, modern Labour politicians come from liberal, professional backgrounds. Barking MP Margaret Hodge also appeared to take a swipe at the Labour leader this morning. On your bike: The Labour MP cycling away from her home last week after being ordered by Ed Miliband to resign from the shadow cabinet . The Labour frontbencher  defended posting the image, claiming she had never seen anything like it . White van man Dan Ware arrived home at his house in Rochester  after travelling to London to confront Labour MP Emily Thornberry . Appearing on the Andrew Marr show, she said politicians ‘entering politics without having a job outside made it hard for MPs to connect with the public’. She said: ‘Alienation from the mainstream political class is huge. And it's not about who we are, it's about our experiences. ‘So coming into Parliament without having done anything outside politics is not a good route to connecting with people. ‘And then it's all about how we do our politics, and I think too often we set the political agenda from Westminster and we go to our constituencies and then pronounce.’ The Barking MP said there were a number of England flags on houses in her constituency and they often expressed support for the England football team. ‘What the England flags are all about are a number of, first of all they are about football and don't forget that. And the other thing is we've recaptured the England flag. The English flag has an important tradition in the past but we may have to make it relevent to the present and the future.’ But former Labour minister Diane Abbott said Mr Miliband had ‘made a mistake’ in sacking Islington South and Finsbury MP Mrs Thornberry. Labour's former welfare minister Frank Field attacked Labour's north London elite . ‘Emily Thornberry is not a snob, she doesn't look down on council tenants,’ she told Sky News' Murnaghan programme. ‘She couldn't hold her seat - which is quite a marginal one - if she didn't do a lot of work with council tenants. She has probably knocked on more council estate doors than many of her critics. ‘What people don't know is that Emily was tweeting all day from Rochester. She saw it as reportage.’ She added: ‘I think he made a mistake sacking her because apart from anything else it implied she had said something about the man's house, which she hadn't. ‘But more important I think it made it a bigger story than it otherwise would have been.’ However, Mr Miliband’s decision to sack Ms Thornberry was backed by shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves. She Ms Thornberry’s controversial tweet of a house in Rochester adorned with England flags was ‘condescending and disrespectful’. ‘I was out on the doorstep on Thursday when I saw that tweet. I was up in Leeds and I saw it and I thought – what is she trying to say? ‘Because actually when I knock on doors in my constituency and around the country a lot of people work incredibly hard for themselves, running their own businesses, patriotic people who care and love their country. ‘And I thought Emily was being condescending and disrespectful of the people actually that I went into politics to serve. ‘So, I think it was right that that she went. What she was suggesting doesn’t represent the values of the Labour party, the ethos and values of the Labour party. ‘Ed was incredibly angry… and I was angry when I saw it, because I am working hard, as are other Labour MPs and activists around the country, trying to get a Labour government back in six months time and she set that process back. ‘So, he was angry, Labour activists and MPs were angry. And I think it is right that she has gone.’ Ms Reeves dismissed comments by Labour MP David Lammy suggesting that the party is ‘culturally adrift’ from the working classes. ‘Well, I just don’t think that is true at all. If you look at recent by-election results, Heywood and Middleton for example, we held that seat. ‘The South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner in very difficult circumstances for Labour, we held that - both traditional Labour areas. And if you look at the polling in some of the key seats that we need to win back in five and a half/ six months time we are ahead there as well.’ Ms Reeves admitted that Labour should have done more on immigration when they were in government. ‘In retrospect we shouldn’t have opened the doors as quickly, so I would go further, not just that we should have made these welfare changes earlier, but we should have had longer transitional controls so we didn’t have the inflows that we had in the 2000s.’ Emily Thornberry’s Islington home is at the heart of the liberal elite’s dinner party circuit. Directly next door is Margaret Hodge, who is expected to seek Labour’s nomination to be the next London Mayor. Ms Thornberry's home is a vast, four-storey Victorian townhouse in an area beloved of lawyers and bankers, where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £2.9 million - £900,000 above the threshold for Labour’s planned ‘soak-the-rich’ mansion tax. Hodge’s likely rival, Tessa Jowell, lives a couple of miles north. If Ms Thornberry ever needs to consult Tom Baldwin, one of Ed Miliband’s key advisers, he is only a short stroll away. Mr Miliband can be found two miles away in a £2.6million townhouse, not far from his staunch supporter and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Notorious Number 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell has himself a £2million property within walking distance, while Miliband’s adviser Stewart Wood is not far away either. Others nearby include Ed’s brother David, Lord Falconer, Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. Ms Thornberry shares her home with Oxbridge educated lawyer husband Sir Christopher, a barrister at Wilberforce Chambers whose specialities included the lucrative field of off-shore trusts (which, among other things, help rich people avoid taxes). The pair bought the property in 1993, two years after they married, and moved in during the same week as another great Islingtonian power couple, Tony and Cherie Blair. Ms Thornberry, a close Ed Miliband ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother David, stepped down from her post as Shadow Attorney General two days ago. The resignation came after she was confronted by a 'furious' Ed following her tweet of a house in Rochester flying three England flags from the upstairs windows, with a white van parked in the driveway. She was branded a snob and attacked for her subsequent comments to Mail Online that she had 'never seen anything like it', after which she protested that she had become a victim of anti-Islington prejudice. Dane Ware, the owner of the house which is worth £119,000, has insisted that Ms Thornberry apologise to him over her remarks, but she has so far ducked any meeting with him. The comments have caused a meltdown in the upper echelons of the Labour party, with one MP branding the gaffe 'horrendous, while others turned on Mr Miliband, saying his reaction had been hasty and ill thought-out. Where the other half live: Emily Thornberry and her QC husband moved into the elite  neighbourhood at the same time as Tony and Cherie Blair . Labour strategists had hoped a Ukip landslide in Rochester would mark the moment that pressure switched on to Mr Cameron and away from Mr Miliband, who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership. But with Ukip’s win narrower than expected, a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their Commons seats after next May’ s election, there was little sign of Tory disunity. Instead, Labour was riven over whether Mr Miliband’s treatment of Miss Thornberry had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working-class vote from Ukip.","Labour leader facing mounting fallout over sacking of MP over flag tweet .

Steve Bruce has blamed the linesman and Jan Vertonghen for having Gaston Ramirez sent off and 'ruining the spectacle' in Hull City's 2-1 home defeat by Tottenham on Sunday. The Uruguayan forward was dismissed after an innocuous clash with Vertonghen ended with Ramirez flicking out a foot at the Spurs defender, with Bruce complaining that the decision changed the game.

"A bus driver who used his vehicle 'like a weapon' to ram a cyclist off the road has been jailed for 17 months. Reckless driver Gavin Hill, 29, swerved into cyclist Phillip Mead after getting into an argument at a roundabout in Bristol. Mr Mead was flung over his handlebars and catapulted 10ft across the road. He suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist. As he lay on the ground in agony, the driver simply straightened up the single decker bus and continued on the journey. Captured on CCTV, bus driver Gavin Hill swerves to the right of the cyclist Phillip Mead as if to overtake him in Bristol city centre . Impact: The bus driver cuts back in sharply and collides with the cyclist who is seen in this picture going flying over the handlebars . Hill pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 17 months at Bristol Crown Court yesterday. Judge Mark Horton said his action 'was not an accident' and added: 'You used the bus as a weapon to bully and intimidate Mr Mead.' The court heard how Hill got into a heated exchange with Mr Mead at the St James Barton roundabout in central Bristol at 8.30am on April 5 last year. Mr Mead is said to have tugged at one of the bus's windscreen wipers before they both moved away from a set of traffic lights. Mr Mead tumbles onto the ground in a heap as the bus towers menacingly over him. He suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist in the road rage ramming . Mr Mead lies on the ground in pain after the attack but as can be seen from the CCTV the bus driver straightens up the vehicle and continues towards the traffic lights . In a CCTV clip shown to the court, the cyclist is shown riding in front of the Bugler Coaches vehicle before the bus pulls out to overtake him. Jailed: Hill was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the attack . But the bus then suddenly swerves to the left - knocking into Mr Mead and sending him sprawling across the road. Mr Mead, a father of two, spent two weeks in hospital and had operations to repair his left knee and wrist following the incident. He spent six weeks in plaster and was not allowed to cycle for four months but is now back on his bike and commuting to work. The computer programmer, who lives in of St Anne's, Bristol, with wife Samantha, said: 'I think he meant to brush against me and give me a fright. 'I don't think he set out to break my bones, or at least I like to think not. I remember losing my balance and rolling over a couple of times. 'I tried to stand up and could see that my bike was under the bus between the front and back wheels. 'It doesn't matter to me what sentence he gets, it won't change what has already happened. For me what is important is that he has acknowledged what he did.' Hill, who had been a bus driver for ten years, described the incident as a 'moment of madness'. He was told he would serve half his sentence before being considered for release on licence, but he was sacked by Bugler Coaches following the incident. Gerald Creed, managing director of Bugler Coaches, said: 'We were deeply shocked when we heard of this incident and once we had established what had happened Mr Hill was immediately dismissed as we did not want him driving one of our buses ever again.'","Gavin Hill swerved the bus into cyclist after traffic argument at roundabout .

"It was always going to be unwise naming a restaurant that glorifies unhealthy food the Heart Attack Grill. And on Saturday the inevitable happened when a customer suffered a cardiac arrest in the chain's Las Vegas branch. An onlooker captured video of paramedics wheeling the unidentified man, thought to be in his 40s, out of the fast-food diner. He was midway through eating a 6,000-calorie Triple Bypass Burger when he began experiencing chest pains. Scroll down for video .

He denied the incident was an elaborate publicity stunt. Mr Basso told Fox News: 'The gentleman could barely talk. He was sweating, suffering. 'I actually felt horrible for him because the tourists were taking photos of him as if it were some type of stunt. 'Even with our own morbid sense of humour, we would never pull a stunt like that.' The Heart Attack Grill sells calorie-laden fare with names such as Quadruple Bypass Burgers and Flatline Fries. Controversial: The restaurant, which promises free food to the obese, is located on Sin City's Fremont Street . Meals can exceed 8,000 calories. The recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men. The Triple Bypass Burger contains three slabs of meat, 12 rashes of bacon, cheese, red onion, sliced tomato and the Heart Attack Grill's own 'unique special sauce'. And that's before taking into account the accompanying 'Flatliner Fries', cooked in pure lard, and a giant soft drink. Accentuating the medical theme, waitresses dressed as nurses deliver the artery-clogging food. A sign at the entrance to an Arizona restaurant reads: 'Go away. If you come in this place, it’s going to kill you.' But the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers.

"Manny Pacquiao achieved a points victory of extraordinary dimensions  in Macau but not the first knock out in six years which he so mightily desired. The six knock-downs he inflicted on a road-runner in reverse called Chris Algieri thrilled the packed south-east Asian crowd in the CotaiArena but were not quite enough to finish off the American. New York’s holder of degrees in medicine and nutrition looked after his health through 12 rounds spent going backwards so fast and so far that if they had taken out the ropes he would have backed himself into the car park of the Venetian casino. Manny Pacquiao  dominated his fight with Chris Algieri from the first bell and won convincingly . Pacquiao was on top of Algieri from the first bell but was unable to stop the fight early . Mere survival is not enough in a world title fight. So perhaps Algieri’s real achievement was that of preventing the PacMan from sending him so far into oblivion that it may have frightened Floyd Mayweather from ever agreeing to the richest fight in ring history. Team PacMan had considered carrying Algieri a few rounds so as not to look too devastating on television back in Mayweather’s home town of Las Vegas. As it transpired, Algieri did that job for him by being fit enough to run a marathon while facing the wrong way and - well, yes - brave enough to keep getting up every time Pacquiao bowled him over. So when he was asked if him against Mayweather might finally happen, the PacMan was able to say: ‘Yes, I want that fight and the fans deserve it.’ He praised Algieri for regaining a vertical position once in the second round, twice in the sixth, twice more in the eighth and once again in the ninth. His fabled trainer Freddie Roach disagreed with that assessment, saying: 'All he did was run. He showed none of the guts that got him off the canvas to win his light-welter title against Ruslan Provodnikov.' Algieri was stripped of that belt the second the first bell rang here, for accepting this catch-weight fight for Pacquiao’s world welterweight title. Where he goes from here after a performance trying to smother the life out of a major television event is anybody’s guess. But Pacquiao is still on course for a date with destiny and a large share of a potential one-billion dollars purse in Las Vegas, Money Mayweather agreeing. Even though Algieri refused to join the party, Pacquiao was able to demonstrate that his punching power is almost regenerated to the level which destroyed our own Ricky Hatton in 2008. The heaviest knock down was the first of the two in the sixth. Somehow Algeiri made it to the bell even though it could easily have been stopped then by the referee, his own corner... or one more blow of that magnitude from Pacquiao.

Algieri sits on the canvas after being put down by Pacquiao and takes the count from the referee . Algieri gets to his knee as he takes the count from the referee in Macau . Reminded that he had questioned the power of the PacMan, he graciously conceded: ‘He’s a great fighter. He does everything well.’ As for himself, he did so little that I concurred with the judge who gave Pacquiao every round, in addition to the knock-down deductions, on a 120-102 card. The two other judges scored it 119-103. The crowd did not care either way. Inside the arena they squealed to the rafters every time the Filipiino idol landed. Outside, the thousands waiting to see Pacquiao roared their approval. And it was still lunchtime here as we all emerged into the sunshine of another PacMan victory. Pacquiao entered the ring to the strains of Queen's ‘We Will Rock You.’ Once he had knelt to pray in a corner and announcer Michael Buffer had told us to get ready to rumble, the roars of ‘Manny, Manny’ filled the packed CotaiArena. Then began his pursuit of the American, who was clearly intent on backpedaling behind his naturally longer jab. VIDEO Pacquiao delighted with performance .

Despite his five-inch height advantage, however, Algieiri was not landing with that jab and Pacquiao caught up with him often enough to win the round. Algieri was in full flight as Pacquiao stepped up the pace, although when he found the canvas early in the second he claimed it was slip. But referee Genaro Rodriguez ruled a knock-down. Still the medical graduate from New York’s Long Island had not landed a punch of note as the PacMan took the second 10-8. Roach had predicted that Algieri would run and he was being proved right. The American was surviving but showing no sign yet of trying to win the fight as he slipped four points behind by the end of the third round. Algieri was able to land some punches - but not enough to put Paquiao in any danger of losing the fight . Pacquiao takes a shot from Algieri on the chin but did not come close to losing the fight . Algieri was blocking a proportion of Pacquiao’s punches but, despite his height, was mostly out of reach the few he threw himself. He was also beginning to look even more apprehensive as one or two heavier shots landed. It takes two to tango and Algieiri did take a couple of tentative steps forward at the start of the fifth. But once he was hit by a left he went on the retreat again, covering up and crouching whenever Pacquiao cut off his space. One punch he did get through with was low. He was warned for that and for wrestling. Algieri was using his right hand almost exclusively to protect himself against Pacquiao’s deadly left hook. But the first big one got through and down he went again. A third knock-down followed, this time from a wicked right straight through the middle of his guard but he survived the round. Pacquiao is congratulated by his team after the final bell after beating Algieri on points . Pacquiao celebrates his victory over Algieri in Macau after a dominant points win . Algieri is the ring’s self-nutritionist and was certainly a fit enough athlete. But you can’t escape everything the PacMan throws and he was rocked by a crisp right as even the faintest chance of winning on points disappeared completely. As well as going into reverse, Algieri bought more time by complaining about imagined illegalities. The referee was having none of it but, Pacquiao, ever the gentleman, kept giving him a few seconds to recover, en route to winning yet another round. What was becoming a tedious exercise in frustration exploded with a trade-mark left from Pacquiao which put Algieri flat on his back. He staggered back to his feet only to be floored again. Arguably it should have been stopped as Pacquiao went for the kill but the reeling challenger made it to the final bell.

Algieri’s corner sent their man back out to take more punishment. He was fighting – or rather not really fighting – in a fog now and down he went again from another of those lefts. Despite his total dominance, time was running out for Pacquiao to deliver the first knock out in the six years since he demolished Hatton – and which he was desperate to give his south east Asian fans. Blows which would have finished anyone who came to fight were just about ridden by Algieri as bac-pedaled. And so towards the finishing tape which Algieri was so anxious to reach – even though he was losing by as enormous a margin as there has ever been in boxing. Survive he did – but at a cost to his own reputation. The delusional state of Team Algieri is revealed by quotes from his old kick-boxing now world- title- boxing trainer, Tim Lane, overheard in the corner between rounds: .

End of round 10: ‘Chris,I’m letting you out of the cage.’ End of round 11, at 17 points behind with one round to go: ‘Hit him in the body and stay on his ass.

"Lewis Hamilton said this was the most important race of his career. It turned out to be a moment more fleeting. The most important fragment, perhaps. The most vital fifth of a second. That was the time between the encouragement of the final go light and Hamilton’s Mercedes car making its move. And soon after that, it was all over. There are moments in sport, cameos and no more, that define history and remain in the memory. Hamilton’s race to the first turn in Abu Dhabi was one such act. Whatever marvels the rest of his time in Formula One contain — and he is now one short of equalling Jackie Stewart’s total of three drivers’ championships — he will be remembered for this, his duel in the fading desert sun. The total eclipse of his team-mate and rival, Nico Rosberg. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the epic Hamilton vs Rosberg trailer for the F1 season finale . Lewis Hamilton is drenched in bubbly after posing for a team photo with his Mercedes crew the Abu Dhabi . Hamilton was brave yet emphatic in Abu Dhabi... there was only one winner after turn one . Hamilton is paraded in front of the world's media after celebrating his second world championship triumph . 1. Lewis Hamilton -  384 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . 3. Daniel Ricciardo 238 points . With everything to lose and from second place on the grid, Hamilton destroyed Rosberg before the first bend. Usain Bolt and Olympian sprinters aside, no momentous sporting achievement was ever over in more of a flash. The best part of 55 laps remained when Hamilton hit the front — but technical disaster aside, the race was done. As it was, misfortune befell Rosberg, not the man hurtling through clean air. A mechanical failure saw him lose horsepower and precious seconds, tumbling back through the field, finishing forlorn in 14th place. The double points that may have been his friend instead served only to underline the true pecking order at Mercedes Benz. Hamilton has won 11 races to Rosberg’s five this season and the 67-point winning margin now emphasises that. Rosberg on pole, Hamilton flying past him: the sight of that little triumph seemed to encapsulate the story of the season. Hamilton leapt out of his Mercedes and ran to his family and girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger . Hamilton celebrates with his the full Mercedes team in the pit lane following the victory . VIDEO Hamilton secures title in Abu Dhabi . Australian rules football coined the concept of the March champion. A young player, good at the start of the year, who fades as the campaign progresses. Rosberg has been a Saturday champion this season. He has made pole more times than Hamilton, only to get blown away 24 hours later when the race begins. That is what happened on Sunday. With one lap to go, Rosberg was lapped by Hamilton, the ultimate humiliation. After taking him all the way — despite the travesty of double points, even had conventional scoring been applied, there would still have been a way that Rosberg could have won on Sunday — it was a pity that the German could not at least share some of the reflected glory on the podium. It seemed rather incongruous for the man who has helped drive the excitement not to be present. There are a thousand technical details that contribute to speed from the grid but, deep down, one couldn’t help but feel that in the most old-fashioned sense, Hamilton just wanted it more. The lead he had established within seconds of the race starting was unnatural, considering Rosberg started ahead and has the same car. Hamilton ended the season with a win which sealed him the second F1 Drivers' Championship of his career . Hamilton hit the front with an almost animal ferocity at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . There will be small degrees of separation, drivers’ individual preferences on torque and bite, but the main difference between the Mercedes cars is the human within. Hamilton’s sheer will and daring eclipsed German efficiency. He hit the front with an almost animal ferocity, transcending the cold mechanics and creating something visceral, like a punch. A frozen image of the two Mercedes coming out of the turn showed Hamilton a good five car lengths clear of Rosberg. There can be various explanations for Rosberg’s slow start. A technical glitch, a lack of grip — certainly Hamilton was careful to hand the lion’s share of the praise to his backroom team, playing down his own part. Yet amid talk of clutches and feeding the throttles, it was impossible not to consider the man, enclosed in his cockpit, thinking of everything that could go right and so much that could go wrong — and deciding to remove all obstacles from his path as early as possible. Hamilton said he arrived on four hours’ sleep, unable to rest until 1am, up again at 5am, waiting until it was light before going for a run. It is in the wee small hours that the doubts crowd in; the knowledge that a lead that would have been commanding in any other year had been rendered vulnerable by Formula One’s bizarre double points finale. Hamilton knew the correct strategy, the one that had delivered 10 race wins already this season, but the blinking light of an F1 cockpit tells of a sport wide open to the vagaries of random failure. ‘I could go into the race and something could happen to the car and that would be the championship done,’ said Hamilton. ‘I was just thinking of all the negative things and working so hard to bring the positives into it. ‘That start — very little of it is me. Obviously, there is a sequence we have to go through and we have to perform at the right time, preparing the clutch, preparing the tyres. 'I work very closely with my clutch engineer. He came to my room and asked how I wanted to approach it. I said, “The same as every time, no more and no less.” ‘When the pre-start goes, when you do the formation lap, you get a feel for how good the clutch is. You have to guide them, give them feedback. And we hit it spot on. Hamilton celebrates on the rostrum with  Felipe Massa, Toto Wolff and  Valtteri Bottas . Nico Rosberg embraces his Mercedes' team-mate after Hamilton's world championship victory . The second part — when you let it out and feed the throttle, that’s when the driver comes into it. It felt like the best start I had ever had. For sure, it was phenomenal.’ Read between the lines and the answer is in there. Hamilton is nothing without that perfectly tuned clutch; but it still needs flesh and blood to create the surge — and under the most intense pressure, too. That was Hamilton’s masterwork in Abu Dhabi: under the greatest stress of his career, he produced his absolute best. The finest athletes perform at precisely the moment required. And this was Severiano Ballesteros from the car park, Botham’s Ashes, the last-minute intervention of Sergio Aguero or Jonny Wilkinson. It was a man at the top of his game. Hamilton celebrates on the podium in typical fashion by spraying the bottle of champagne . Despite the fear of technological failure, ultimately it was friend, enabling Hamilton to take on Felipe Massa and win the race. Once it became clear that Rosberg’s car was failing, Hamilton no longer had to worry about pushing too hard. With the German out of the points, the title was his and he drove like it, with a freedom and confidence not greatly obvious this week. Hamilton insists he was not uptight prior to racing but mistakes had crept in during qualifying and his demeanour was not that of a man taking a chequered flag for granted. His decision not to extend invitations to family was real, although thankfully ignored, and ultimately father, brother and partner Nicole were all present in Abu Dhabi, making a surprise arrival at breakfast. Hamilton looks less than impressed as the Rosberg lifts the trophy after winning in Monaco . Rosberg grins as he prepares to pick up the Brazilian Grand Prix title, with Hamilton finishing second . Hamilton appeared genuinely touched. ‘I knew how intense it was going to be and I didn’t think I’d be able to give any of them my time,’ he said. ‘I was here to work. I wasn’t out at restaurants, having a good time.’ He can do that now. At 29, he has enough time to match Stewart’s three titles and maybe even surpass them. This is a strong Mercedes team  and is expected to challenge again in the next campaign. Hamilton will be emboldened by this, too. It was an emphatic win, a mature win, a brave win. He was right. He didn’t need to fight dirty or be naughty to win; he didn’t need mind games or skulduggery. This was a victory for pure racing. Coming out of turn one, he was free. From that moment, there was only one champion.

"Having beaten testicular cancer earlier in November, Jonas Gutierrez has marked overcoming the disease by having a tattoo inked onto his arm. The Newcastle winger was  discharged from hospital, having revealed two months previously that he had been battling testicular cancer for a full year. And with the Argentine poised for a sensational return back to St James' Park, the 31-year-old has decided to have a tattoo featuring lyrics from an Eminem song. Having beaten cancer, Jonas Gutierrez revealed his new tattoo on Twitter which feature Eminem lyrics . The words 'I'm alive again. More alive than I had been in my whole entire life. 03-11-14' are inked onto Gutierrez's arm and come from the rapper's 2010 track 'No Love'. Gutierrez first discovered he had the disease after being assessed following a challenge from Bacary Sagna in the Toon's Premier League clash with Arsenal in April last year. But Pardew is now ready to welcome back the popular Argentine to his squad. ‘We had a response from his surgeon to say that in about a month's time he can cope with professional training,’ said Pardew. Jonas Gutierrez has beaten cancer after a year-long battle against the disease . Newcastle's Gutierrez found out he had cancer after a challenge from Arsenal's Bacary Sagna .

Colo (Fabricio Coloccini) tells me he is in good form and we are looking forward to seeing him. ‘It's massive news for the squad because he is a much-loved figure here.’ Gutierrez had a testicle removed in October of last year. However, he has been receiving chemotherapy since the summer after a check-up revealed inflammation in his groin.

"Roger Federer has sought to play down his spat with Stanislas Wawrinka by tweeting a conciliatory message with his compatriot on Monday night. Federer and Wawrinka had a 10-minute row on Saturday, after the world No 2's wife 'heckled' his opponent from the sidelines during their match. But the Swiss stars, who will play together this weekend in the Davis Cup final, appeared to have settled their differences just 48 hours after the dispute.

Wawrinka was left unhappy after overhearing comments from Federer's wife Mirka on Saturday night . Federer (second left) poses with his first Wimbledon trophy in 2003 alongside then-girlfriend Mirka (right) Born in Bojnice, Czechoslovakia in 1978, Mirka Vavrinec began her own tennis career at a young age and turned professional when she was 20. She won three ITF titles during her career and reached a highest ranking of No 76 in the world in September 2001, but a persistent foot injury forced her to quit the game a year later. She met Federer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and married him in 2009. The couple have two sets of twins - identical twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva (born July 23, 2009) and twin boys Leo and Lennart (born May 6, 2014). As well as looking after her children, Mirka often follows her husband on tour and is said to be a major factor in the huge success he has experienced over the last 11 years. In an interview with Inside Tennis earlier this year, Federer said of his wife: 'I think every wife is important. Mine is no different. She's [always] been involved to some degree, but [she was more] involved, midway through our relationship. She came to every practice, every match, spent breakfast, lunch, and dinner together for years. 'It's still very intense today, but we have kids and she's seen 900 matches, I guess. She's OK missing one once in a while and not coming to practices any more. She's been very important in my life, not just as a tennis player, but overall.' The pair are in Lille ahead of the team event against France which begins on Friday, and could see Federer win the only major tennis trophy that has so far eluded him. Federer, who arrived in France on a private jet after pulling out of the ATP Tour Finals final on Sunday, tweeted: 'It's great being with the boys again,' alongside a picture with Wawrinka and the rest of his Swiss team-mates. And the Swiss No 2 tweeted the same picture just minutes later, in what looks like an attempt to smooth over the dispute. Federer won Saturday's match 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 at the O2 in London but his victory has been overshadowed by the fallout. It is understood that one of the reasons the Swiss compatriots fell out was because Federer's wife Mirka 'heckled' Wawrinka. Among Wawrinka's complaints is that she made audible comments from his supporters' box – which is at ground level – questioning in French whether he would have the guts to close the match. According to several eyewitnesses, a vociferous argument developed between the pair in the backstage area. Tour officials decided that the best thing was to push them alone into a private room that had been converted into a gym area, as there is no communal locker room at the arena. While the dispute is not believed to have become physical, a heated 10-minute row ensued in which both aired their grievances against the other. In what had been an unusually feisty and high quality semi-final, Wawrinka had four match points and served for the match at 5-4. According to French television, Wawrinka was picked up saying: 'She did the same thing at Wimbledon.' Mirka and Roger, who first met in 2000 and married in 2009, have two sets of twins together .

The three-day team event, which begins on Friday, could see the pair joining forces in a doubles match at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille. Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lammer are the other members of the Switzerland team. John McEnroe spoke of the dispute on American television, but he seemed unaware of the extent to which it has escalated, according to those Sportsmail has spoken to. Another cause of tension in matches between the two is said to be the presence in Federer's box of Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi, who coaches the world No 2 along with Stefan Edberg. Although doing his best to stay impartial in these encounters, it is not hard to see why Wawrinka might resent his team competition captain siding with his rival when it comes to their head-to-head combat. Ultimately the Swiss No 2 was unable to finish the job off and was denied a place in the final of the prestigious year-end championships, with well-placed sources saying he was furious at the intervention of Mrs Federer. While the undoubted row between the two men is a distraction, it was not the main cause of Federer pulling out of Sunday night's final, although the tension it caused is unlikely to have helped. The Swiss master, drained by the physically and mentally exhausting match against Wawrinka, sustained a pull in his back and clearly did not wish to risk it ahead of the Davis Cup final. Federer usually manages to avoid controversy and his wife says little in public, despite playing a major role in her 33 year-old husband's phenomenal career. Mirka Federer was a tennis player herself but she now supports her husband's career and follows him on tour . Federer, pictured with Mirka at the Laureus World Sports Awards, says his wife has seen over 900 matches . Mirka watches her husband in action at Wimbledon in 2012 with twin daughters Myla Rose and Charlene Riva . Those who know her speak of someone quietly formidable and determined who behind the scenes helps organise the incredibly busy life of her spouse, with whom she now has two sets of twins. A former player herself, when she was known as Miroslava Vavrinec, she reached a career-high singles ranking of 76 and met the soon-to-be superstar at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, she had to retire from the sport with a persistent foot injury and has since channelled her energies into helping her husband become the global icon that he now is. Aside from maintaining his fitness and training regime and having four young children, Federer also has a large portfolio of sponsorships and has his own personal charitable foundation that he attends to. Mirka, who married him in 2009, is said to be a key component in making his life run like a Swiss clock to keep the success going. She is also known to have steely side, and it seems that is what has led to the fallout with Wawrinka that could be a threat to Switzerland's Davis Cup dreams.

"Campaign: Angela Merkel's conservatives want the German language used more regularly in European institutions and treated on a par with English and French . Angela Merkel's party wants the German language used more regularly in European institutions and  treated on a par with English and French. The German chancellor's Christian Democratic Union party want to increase the use of German in Europe if they are re-elected when the country goes to the polls in September. It is not the first time Merkel's . conservatives have called for a strengthening of German in Brussels . However, given Germany's growing economic power within Europe since the outbreak . of the eurozone debt crisis just over three years ago, the demand is likely to annoy other countries. 'German is the most frequently spoken native language and one of three working languages of the European Union,' a draft programme from Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), reads. 'We will push for a further strengthening of the German language in Europe. Our goal is that it is treated in the same way as English and French in the European Parliament, the (European) Commission and (European) Council.' English and French have been the dominant working languages of the EU in the past few decades, although French has declined since 2004 as the bloc expanded from 15 to 27 members, most from eastern Europe where English is a more common second language. But there are differences depending on the institution. German is rarely used day-to-day at the European Commission, but is heard frequently at the European Parliament, which has a German president and is made up of more Germans than members from any other state because of the country's large population. Volker Kauder, leader of Merkel's conservatives in parliament, caused a storm back in 2011, when at the height of the crisis he boasted that 'Europe speaks German'. In their election programme, the CDU and CSU also hail the imposition of 'German-style debt brakes' across Europe and Berlin's role in firming up EU budget rules and ensuring that structural economic reforms are being implemented in its euro partners. Frustration: It is not the first time Merkel's conservatives have called for a strengthening of German in Brussels. But given Germany's growing economic power within Europe the demand is likely to annoy other countries . They also trumpet their opposition to common euro zone bond issuance and a Europe-wide deposit guarantee scheme. 'This would mutualise risks, forcing German savers to guarantee the deposits of other countries,' the draft programme, which is due to be approved this weekend, reads. The parties hold up Germany's balanced economy and robust industrial base as a 'worldwide model'. 'These successes are bringing us global recognition. A survey by the British broadcaster BBC shows that Germany is the most liked country in the world.'","Angela Merkel's  Christian Democratic Union party issued plea .

"1. Lewis Hamilton -  384 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . 3. Daniel Ricciardo 238 points . Lewis Hamilton is King of the Track again. Under the dark sky of Abu Dhabi, fireworks greeted the 29-year-old Stevenage boy turned global superstar as only the fourth Briton to win multiple Formula One world titles. The fourth in line to another throne, Prince Harry, went to the pit wall to tell Hamilton over the radio: ‘Lewis, thank you very, very much for not making the British public sweat. You are an absolute legend. Well done, mate.’ The team then came on to tell Hamilton he was Mercedes-Benz’s first champion since a chap called Juan Manuel Fangio, in 1955. Fangio was the greatest of them all, but Hamilton is hardly a slouch. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg: Awesome to fight with Lewis until the last race .

Would Hamilton hold on to his lead of 17 points, or would Nico Rosberg spoil his day? But it was, as HRH observed, all in control long before the 55th and concluding lap. So much so that Rosberg, suffering battery problems, was lapped by Hamilton on the penultimate circuit. Hamilton took the victory, with Rosberg 14th, and the title by 67 points. Double scoring, the great pre-race fear, was immaterial. And when it was over, Rosberg sought Hamilton out and held him, congratulating a friend who has turned into a bitter rival in the course of a captivating nine months. It was a typically gracious gesture from the vanquished man. As for Hamilton, his name can be added to Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Sir Jackie Stewart in the pantheon of British double title winners. Six years separate Hamilton’s first and second championships, but now the greatness he promised as a rookie of prodigious gifts has been rewarded as richly as his talent warrants. The race had been set up perfectly by Rosberg searing to pole position by 0.386sec. Saturday has been the German’s day for most of the year. But it is Sunday that counts and Hamilton took little more than a blink of an eye to roar into the lead. Rosberg trundled off the grid. Hamilton powered ahead, swept to his right in front of his colleague and flew through the first left-hand corner. By the time Rosberg came round it, Hamilton was virtually in Dubai. Or another planet. All weekend Hamilton had exhibited tell-tale jitters, given exasperated answers in press conferences and issued false protestations about being cooler than a cucumber in a tumbler of Hendrick’s.

All those worries were dispatched to the file marked ‘i’ for irrelevance in one faultless move. From that moment, the outcome seemed inevitable. And that is rare with Hamilton, a man who has produced more drama over the years than ITV. Still, how must it have felt for Hamilton’s family who were late, surprise arrivals in Abu Dhabi. His father Anthony paced up and down, as his wont. His pop-star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, step-mother Linda and brother Nic, in a Mercedes top, were all in the garage, their eyes fixed on the timing screens. But before the sun had set, in the twilight of this dusk-night race, Hamilton had established a comfortable lead. By his first stop, 10 laps in, his advantage was 2.7sec. Rosberg stayed out a lap longer but it did him no good on rubber that was only getting worse. Rosberg’s engineer Tony Ross came over the radio to explain their remedial strategy: ‘Keep the gap to him (Hamilton) manageable and we’ll go long.’ Rosberg had a race to forget as he lost the lead on the first corner of the race and then suffered with a power failure . Hamilton takes the lead on the very first corner of the race after overtaking Rosberg who started on pole . Hamilton got off to the best-possible start as he overtook Rosberg on the first corner and saw his car home to win the grand prix . But within minutes, the German veered off track. That was nothing compared to the problems he was about to suffer with his energy recovery system (ERS). ‘It’ s failed,’ he said over the radio. That was costing him 160bhp and three seconds a lap. He started to slither down the field. Hamilton came in for new tyres as his own time was briefly dipping — Scherzinger’s bottom lip quivered — but he only needed to be re-shod. He came out and zoomed straight past Rosberg, who had yet to pit again. Both men were totally fair and clean. Hamilton was away. Now Rosberg had just one chance: namely, to score heavily enough to take the title if Hamilton were to stop. ‘Just get me into the top five or six as safely as possible,’ he said. Actually, he would have needed fifth to have had a hope in hell. ‘How am I looking?’ he inquired, while lying seventh and fading. ‘Not good at the moment,’ he was told. ‘What the hell does that mean? What do I need to do?’ ‘Just drive flat out.’ It was truly the most pathetic exchange of the season. But it was not the last of its sort. ‘Hey guys, what’s going on?’ he asked. ‘The car switched off and now the throttle is all over the place. Get my brake pedal back now please.’ Rosberg was told to retire, but vowed to drive on regardless. Felipe Massa tried hard to catch Hamilton but he had to settle for second, a place ahead of his Williams team-mate Valtteri Bottas. So the glory went to Hamilton, and who can say he did not deserve it? He is an extraordinary British sportsman at something like the peak of his powers. His 11 wins to Rosberg’s five is a fair reflection of his superiority. He can be moody. His jewellery is not to everyone’s taste. But there is no denying sheer ability when you are privileged enough to see it. He has also worked hard, carving through the field after the bugler had sounded the Last Post at the end of several qualifying sessions. A mark of Hamilton’s achievement is that he beat Rosberg, who, through dedication and willpower, made his talent go even further than nature intended. But, as in their karting days, it ended up with Lewis Hamilton P1, Nico Rosberg P2.

"It's not unusual that the newborn found dumped in a Sydney stormwater drain was able to survive days without fluid or food, experts say. Sydney obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Andrew Pesce said babies have evolved to be able to live for days without feeding. 'If it had been a really sickly child at birth it probably wouldn't have been able to survive,' he said. 'If it has underlying good health, they're evolved to be able to withstand malnutrition in the first few days.' Scroll down for video . This newborn baby was discovered in a drain in Quakers Hill on Sunday. His mother has been charged with attempted murder as police believe she left the baby in the 2.4m deep stormwater crevice for days . Long way down: The baby's mewling was heard from this 2.4m deep drain in Quakers Hill on Sunday . The abandoned boy, who was found wrapped in a blanket, was in a stable condition on Monday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Westmead Children's Hospital told Daily Mail Australia. For most mothers, milk will 'come in' - increase in quantity and begin the change from colostrum to mature milk - between days two and five, said Dr Pesce, the former president of the Australian Medical Association. 'It's quite normal for a baby to lose up to 10 per cent of its birth weight in the first few days after birth because of this. 'That's why a baby - that would otherwise seem to be very vulnerable - is actually quite robust in a situation where it's not getting fluid or foods.' If the baby boy was dropped down a 2.5 metre drain, a combination of naturally soft bones and the blanket would have protected him from serious injury, he said. 'I'm not saying they can't get other injuries, to their liver or spleen, but the fact it was wrapped in a blanket probably protected it to an extent,' he said. Cyclists discovered the baby in this drain along the M7 Motorway in Quakers Hill . Attempted murder charge: Family of the accused arrived at court to listen to the proceedings today . Associate Professor Kei Lui, of the University of NSW, said the baby was extremely lucky that the weather was warm in recent days. 'Hypothermia is probably the biggest killer of abandoned babies,' he said. 'It was extremely lucky in this situation. 'We've had quite warm days so the temperature has been maintained - it hasn't been too cold or too hot.' In addition, leaves or rubbish may have served as a buffer to the baby's fall, he said. 'If it's true the baby was dropped from 2.5 metres - it needed to have a soft landing for it to survive.'

"It was billed as ‘the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen’, complete with an enchanted forest and unforgettable visit to Santa’s grotto. But the ‘Magical Journey’ winter wonderland attraction was shut after just one day – after rude staff, a sweary Father Christmas and elves that ‘sat around smoking’ left children in tears. More than a thousand parents complained about the experience at the Belfry Golf Club in Warwickshire, which costs upwards of £50 for a family of three. Scroll down for video . The Magical Journey in Warwickshire closed on Sunday after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction, created by designer Laurence Llewlyn-Bowen . The ride was closed today as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience . The attraction, designed by flamboyant TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, was deemed ‘tacky’ and ‘unsafe’ by families, who complained of cheap presents, rubbish everywhere and no decorations or festive music. Others raised health and safety fears after spotting elves having to push a ‘faulty Father Christmas Express train’ up a hill. Parents also claimed some of the Father Christmases swore, were ‘grumpy’ or ‘far too skinny to be believable’. Bosses were forced to close the attraction yesterday morning following the barrage of complaints. The Magical Journey – the latest in a long line of Christmas attractions which fail to live up to expectations – was sold to parents as a ‘magnificent immersive theatrical version’ of Santa’s grotto. At its media launch on Thursday, interior designer Mr Llewelyn-Bowen boasted that it would be ‘perfect’ and that a visit to Santa would ‘never be the same again’. Parents, however, were quick to disagree. Melanie Cooke Brzonkalik, 46, who was one of the first to visit the attraction when it opened at 10am on Saturday, said: ‘It shatters the magic somewhat straight away when you see elves standing around smoking and moaning that they were working until 9pm.’ She paid £140 for tickets and travel from Gloucester – a three-hour round trip – with her children Noah, five, Tegan, 13, and Sam, 15. She wrote on Facebook: ‘Disappointed and shocked that someone I respected would think this debacle was good enough. ‘It was a complete joke ... half-finished, not magical in any way, workmen everywhere, tacky, unfinished sets, no snow – just bags of it stacked up at the entrance!’ The site was closed after complaints that the Father Christmas express train broke down during the day . Organisers said the attraction should not have delayed its opening because of the rain affecting preparations . Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open . Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations . The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations . What disgruntled visitors are saying online: . Lindsay Adele: ‘Best train journey ever in the whole world? A tractor pulling a gloried golf buggy in my opinion isn’t a train ride.’ Rich Day: ‘I had to explain to my kid that Santa doesn’t usually smoke and drink, and neither will he use foul language when he visits us on Xmas eve.’ Simone Freeman: ‘Father Christmas asked my daughter if she wanted the ripped present or squashed one!’ Natalie Craig: ‘It has definitely been falsely advertised. The journey was nothing like it was advertised and the staff were rude twice to me and my son.’ Caroline Samuel: ‘My youngest has been counting down the days to go ... had a lot of tears this morning.’ Mother of two Clarissa Morrall, 24, travelled to the attraction from Leicester. Her four-year-old daughter, Leraya, was given an unwrapped baby’s rattle as her gift from Santa. Miss Morrall, a nursery nurse, added: ‘It’s not magical and so overpriced. They make you spend ages walking around outside trying to find a “lost reindeer” then at the end you don’t find it.’ Tickets cost between £10 and £15 for adults, and £17.50 and £22.50 for children depending on what day of the week they visit. Paul Dolan, the event’s director, apologised and admitted it had experienced ‘teething problems’. He confirmed it would remain shut until Wednesday so the team could ‘implement improvements’. He added that work on the attraction had been ‘severely hampered by torrential rain’ and denied that the elves had been smoking. Parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children's Christmas .

"One day Roger Federer will stop writing tennis history but, at 33, there is absolutely no sign of it yet. His huge list of tennis achievements already reads like some kind of biblical scroll lengthwise, and on Sunday he helped Switzerland to win the Davis Cup title for the first time by defeating France 3-1 before a world record crowd. Of course it had to be Federer himself to strike the winning blow, finding himself charged with clinching the 114 year-old Cup when walking out to face Richard Gasquet amid the feverish atmosphere of the Stade Pierrer Mauroy. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch highlights of Roger Federer winning the Davis Cup . Roger Federer drops to his knees after beating Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 6-2 in Lille to win the Davis Cup . Federer hugs Switzerland coach Severin Luthi after his superb display secured the team tournament title . Federer looked overcome by emotion in the immediate aftermath, after this rare new new experience for him . He duly did so with a minimum of fuss, dispatching the Frenchman – a late substitute for Jo Wilfried Tsonga – 6-4 6-2 6-2 to put the outcome beyond any doubt. To 17 Grand Slams, 302 weeks as world number one, an Olympic gold medal (in doubles, but let us not split hairs), winning every different Slam and a multitude of other things add the sport's premier team competition, claimed this year in the company of Stan Wawrinka. It was only this time last week that the scale of the two players' argument at the Barclays ATP World Finals in London was becoming apparent, after the calling out from courtside of his wife Mirka during their Saturday semi-final. Seven days and one repaired back on from there he was in scintillating form, taking the pivotal doubles point on Saturday and then finishing the job off in solo combat against the unfortunate Gasquet. Federer and Luthi are joined by  Stanislas Wawrinka as the World No 2 struggles to contain his emotion . Wawrinka was the first onto the court to celebrate with his team-mate and their coach . Wawrinka and Federer put aside their high-profile row last week to come together and win the trophy . The pair are all smiles, just a week after falling out in London, with their trophies in hand .

Roger Federer celebrates winning a point during his Davis Cup final victory in Lille . If anything was going to galvanise Federer it was his highly polished status taking something of a knock from the events of the previous weekend. He disappointed fans at the 02 Arena when pulling out of the final and then got caught up in the fallout from his argument with his old friend/rival/team-mate. Mirka was not there to witness this redemption, having stayed back at home in Switzerland to avoid any distraction. On Friday he had looked somewhat immobile in being hit off the court by Gael Monfils, although by the end of that match he was moving better, a trend that continued in the doubles and inexorably on Sunday. The Swiss star, who had won everything in the sport bar the Davis cup before this, completed the trophy set . The Swiss World No 2 was back to his imperious best after a difficult Friday to swat away Gasquet . 'Not for me, this is for the boys. I have won enough in my career that I don't need this to complete my everything – ticking off the boxes. We put in so much hard work. I am happy I was able to stay calm and play a good match,' he said in the emotional aftermath. We may never know how bad his back really was, and it was certainly transformed from the final's opening day, which increasingly looks like it was a practice session for the second two matches he was to play. Andy Murray mischievously tweeted afterwards: 'Amazing how long a couple of days is in sport…' It seemed Wawrinka thought the same. As the Swiss celebrations got into full swing the Swiss No 2 later joked 'Roger I still love you'. Whatever, Federer clearly trusted his back completely against a player he knows he should beat, having amassed at 12-2 career record against the talented but introverted Gasquet, who is not known as the fiercest competitor. Jo Wilfried-Tsonga (right) who was dropped for this match, and Gael Monfils, can only look on during the final . Gasquet, a late replacement for Tsonga, was unable to prevent Federer's comfortable win . It was not entirely clear why Gasquet was promoted over Tsonga to try and keep the final alive. Conflicting accounts from the French team and their officials had him being plain dropped or nursing an injured elbow. But in truth, neither he nor Gasquet would have been expected to beat Federer in fully restored fitness and on this form, with the Swiss having ended the season as the world number two by force of results rather than any accident. His mountain of big match experience was bound to serve him well in the bear pit atmosphere that greeted him, with his every shot in the warm-up greeted with a boo. Federer was stretched occasionally, but he had more than enough to see off Gasquet and secure the win . Switzerland coach Severin Luthi celebrates as his No 1 produces a brilliant display to seal the trophy . Once it got going he always looked the winner, by virtue of him doing the same things as Gasquet does but a bit better, aided by the fact that he remains quicker around the court than the man five years his junior. He broke for 4-2 in the first set, and broke twice more to forge ahead to 5-2 in the second set. British umpire James Keothavong had his work cut out controlling the excitable French Captain Arnaud Clement, who protested about several line calls, but Federer remained serene. Another couple of breaks saw him serve out for the match and he finished it in glorious style with an exquisite drop shot, before falling onto the clay face forward and being hugged by his team-mates. Federer looked overcome by emotion at the end, after this rare new new experience for him. He is a remarkable athlete for our times. Having drunk some champagne with his teammates Federer later said 'On Monday or Tuesday I thought there was no way I could play three days this weekend, it was after Friday's match I felt more confident.' He would not commit to whether or not he would help defend the title next year.","Roger Federer beats Richard Gasquet in straight sets to seal win .

"Buffalo was  bracing itself on Sunday for devastating flooding as weather forecasters predicted only the second white Thanksgiving in New York City in 75-years. The snow, due to strike on Wednesday, would be the first time the city has seen the white stuff on Thanksgiving in 25 years, with the last being in 1989, weather expert Dr Roy Spencer, said. Upward of six inches could fall in areas that are west of I-95 - and New York City, as well as Washington, D.C., and Boston, are among them, Accuweather reported. The severity of a storm along the East Coast during the middle of this week will be based on its proximity to the coast, the weather source reported. On the shores of Lake Erie, warming temperatures began to melt up to seven feet of snow that struck upstate New York in a series of deadly snowstorms. In a message to locals, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned those in flood-prone areas to move their valuables out of the basement, pack bags and prepare for the possibility of evacuation. 'Err on the side of caution,' he said at a news conference in Cheektowaga today. 'You prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and that's what we're doing.' Gov Cuomo described the predicted flooding as 'phase two of this battle with Mother Nature', adding that officials have dozens of boats, pumps, and a huge 176,500 sandbags at the ready.

The ratings are 'occasional', 'likely', 'chance' and 'small chance' Struggle: Earlier today, it emerged that Karen Rossi (pictured with one of her daughters), 47, was trapped inside her car in a snow drift for 13 hours. The stricken mother wrote goodbye letters to her daughters . Shoveling: Shovel Brigade Mob volunteers Brett Lawton (front) and Chris Golino (back) remove snow . Reclaiming: Snow has stopped falling over Buffalo and surrounding counties after the storm claimed 13 lives . This graph shows the weather forecast on Sunday, Nov 23, with rain and snow expected across the States . More than 775 members of the New York National Guard are currently in Erie county and Buffalo to aid with the wide-scale snow removal and flood prevention efforts. With help from hundreds of volunteers, they are clearing snow-covered roads and digging out homes and vehicles buried in snow following the record storms that killed 13 people. Roofs collapsed and some people were stuck in their cars for more than 24 hours when the heaviest snow fall in memory hit areas of New York state along the Great Lakes. Earlier today, it emerged that a mother who was trapped in her car for 13 hours wrote goodbye letters to her daughters as her struggle for survival became increasingly desperate. Danger: Rain could sink into snow on roofs around Buffalo, making it heavier and putting them under strain .

In a state of shock: Risk: More than 775 members of the New York National Guard are currently in Erie county and Buffalo to aid with the snow removal and flood prevention efforts. Above, Tami and Mike Diestler . Karen Rossi, 47, became stuck in a snowbank while driving home from work at a Buffalo hospital last week. She was trapped for good when a passing snowplow heaped up even more snow around her, the Buffalo News reported. The stricken mother wound down the window and used a sweatshirt to cover her hands as she dug round to the tailpipe so she could keep the engine running without poisoning herself. She spent 13 hours - from 3am until 4pm - trapped with no way to see the outside. In  desperation, she fished a scrap of paper out of her purse and wrote notes to both of her two daughters. Ultimately she was able to summon help by pushing away enough snow to stick a red brush out and wave it for attention. The brush was seen by a passing monster truck driver, who shoveled her out. Rossi later offered to show the letters to her daughters, but both have refused for the time being. The November storm system, dubbed the 'Knife Storm,' lasted for three days. Thirteen people died in the snowstorms. At least one was found dead in their car in a fate similar to the one Rossie narrowly avoided. Others died of exposure or from heart attacks caused while shoveling snow. Two elderly people died during an evacuation of their nursing home. The National Weather Service said roads could flood quickly from snow melt since the storm blocked drains, and issued warnings for potential flooding of four rivers and creeks.

Concern: The pair chat as they look around the area following the deadly snowstorms in New York last week . 'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday,' the weather service said on its website. 'It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns.' Eric Burr, public affairs director for the Division of Military and Naval Affairs for New York state, added: 'The focus right now is still snow removal. 'There's a lot of snow still on the ground and the key is to get rid of snow especially around drains so that water doesn't back up.' Flood warnings were in effect as the NWS said higher temperatures - rising to 50 degrees  on Sunday and 60 on Monday - could rapidly unlock up to six inches of water. As the dinner hour set in, no flooding had been reported, Erie County spokesman Peter Anderson said in an email. 'Resources are being staged for quick deployment and all eyes are on the creeks,' he said. 'The weather is warmer and snow is melting, but creeks are flowing well.' Ellen Przepasniak, spokeswoman for the Erie County emergency operations effort, said sandbags would be quickly deployed to cities and towns that report rising waters. The state has provided some 3,000 tons of sand to fill the bags, Anderson said. Inmates from the Erie County Jail holding center were filling sandbags in a parking lot, as New York city firefighters loaded boats into the backs of pickups and dump trucks.

"Receiving an insulting letter on Valentine's Day could be enough to dent any young lady's confidence. Brittany Molina, a 21-year-old student at Brigham Young University, was handed an anonymous letter last week by a young man at her college, telling her that her dress sense 'had a negative effect' on those around her. Miss Molina then posted the handwritten note and picture of the outfit she was wearing at the time - a modest ensemble of a knee-length dress and leggings - on Twitter. Since the nasty note went viral, she has received flowers, chocolates and anonymous love notes...along with a modelling job. Model student: After receiving a derisory note from a young man at BYU, Brittany Molina has received messages of support, flowers and the chance to model for Utah designers Cris & Kate's . Designer Cris Pulsipher, co-owner of Cris & Kate’s clothing line, told MailOnline: 'Brittany had been through a discouraging time after receiving that note and we wanted to turn a negative into a positive, so we got in touch with her. 'She is such a humble and positive person. We thought Brittany was perfect for what our brand stands for - being able to dress well, not feel anxious about what you are wearing and be comfortable in clothes all day.' Ms Pulsipher runs the clothing line with business partner Kate Erwin which is available in boutiques across Utah.

"England captain Wayne Rooney has been Photoshopped on to the body of historical leaders Horatio Nelson, Winston Churchill, Henry VIII and the Duke of Wellington. Bookmaker William Hill decided to create the portraits after Gary Lineker said Rooney, who will win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday, deserves to be recognised as one of the nation's greatest players. Lineker, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, said: 'He has to rank right up there in the pantheon of English football's finest.' Wayne Rooney has been re-imagined as a number of historical British leaders including Horatio Nelson . Rooney is Photoshopped on to the body of former  Prime Minister Winston Churchill . A team of Photoshop artists went as far as matching skin tones to the England striker before engraining him in the oil paintings of the legendary figures. William Hill spokesperson Joe Crilly said: 'Rooney is nearing the appearance record and with plenty of years in hand, not only is it likely that he break the record but in all likelihood will smash it. 'Rooney has the ability to enter England’s Hall of Fame and perhaps become one of the country’s greatest leaders.'

"Enough is enough, Wenger out, read one banner at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. The poster was unfurled in the moments after Wayne Rooney had given Manchester United a 2-0 lead. It wasn’t big, probably the size of an A4 sheet of paper. Its message, however, was significant. Some Arsenal fans vented their frustration at Arsene Wenger holding aloft the banner 'Enough is enough, Wenger out' during the game against Manchester Untied on Saturday . Gibbs looks crestfallen at the full-time whistle as his own goal contributes to Arsenal's defeat . The disgruntled fan immediately had the sign confiscated by a steward, so as not to incite angry exchanges with those who remain pro-Wenger. The Frenchman’s job, despite their desperate start to the season, is safe. The only way Arsene Wenger leaves Arsenal is if he walks. Like it or not, Arsenal fans have at least another two-and-a-half years of him. Arsenal had nine players in front of the ball when Manchester United broke and scored a decisive second through Wayne Rooney at the Emirates on Saturday evening . Manchester United have won 11 and drawn three of their last 15 matches against Arsenal. But what can Wenger do to halt the gradual sea change in opinion of those who used to worship the ground he walked on? Sorting out his side’s leaky defence would be a good starting point. At the moment, Arsenal are susceptible to counter attacks; Wenger knows it. So, too, does Louis van Gaal. When asked if he felt Arsenal were vulnerable to being caught on the break following Manchester United’s win at the Emirates, their Dutch manager replied: ‘That’s why I played this formation. Yes, it was a risk but I was sure Arsenal wanted to attack and to press us. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring his side's second in their 2-1 win at Arsenal . ‘Then, you know that Arsenal is giving a lot of space away and then Per Mertesacker and Nacho Monreal have to defend. 'That’s why I put Di Maria against Mertesacker and Van Persie against Monreal. That’s why I brought on Wilson for more pace.’ Van Gaal’s comments are likely to have Arsenal assistant manager Steve Bould clenching his fists in frustration. A rival manager pinpointing Arsenal’s defence as a weakness won’t sit well with the former Gunners centre half. Injuries to key defenders Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy haven’t helped.Nor has the fact Wenger failed to replace Thomas Vermaelen, who left for Barcelona in the summer. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger brought on Olivier Giroud - his first appearance since August due to injury - but despite scoring the Frenchman couldn't prevent the Gunners falling to another defeat . But throwing men forward in search of goals has cost Arsenal in three consecutive games — two of which they were winning. How can this team show such indiscipline with Bould’s wealth of defensive knowledge at their disposal? Perhaps it’s time for Wenger to dilute his attacking principles and work on resolving the defensive deficiencies that are ruining their season. And who better than Bould, who made 372 appearances for Arsenal, to help right the current wrongs?","Arsenal lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United on Saturday evening .

"Residents of a Spanish town are to vote on changing its name because it contains the phrase ‘kill Jews’ – which is a local expression used to describe drinking lemonade. Castrillo de Matajudíos situated in León, Spain, will convene its 60 residents at a town hall meeting to discuss the possibility of changing the name to something less controversial. In parts of Spain, many residents use the term ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) to describe the tradition of drinking lemonade spiked with alcohol at city centre festivals over Easter. Castrillo de Matajudíos situated in León, Spain, will convene its 60 residents at a town hall meeting to discuss the possibility of changing the name to something less controversial . The name of Castrillo de Matajudíos currently translates to 'kill Jews' - which is a local expression used to describe lemonade . The town’s name originates from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes be publicly executed in show trials over the Easter period. However, Mayor Lorenzo Rodriguez, who submitted the proposal, has now suggested changing the town’s name to Castrillo de Mota de Judios, which translates to ‘Castrillo of Jews hill’. In Leon, Spain, ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) is a slang term which refers to the drinking of lemonade which has been spiked with alcohol. There are several theories as to when the term was coined although it almost certainly came from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes be publicly executed in show trials around Easter. Some theories suggest it was born out of the relationship in the area between Christian residents and Jewish residents. It is one belief that the term was related to the charge of Jewish deicide which suggested that Jewish people as a whole were responsible for the death of Jesus Christ. Castrillo de Matajudíos’ town mayor, Lorenzo Rodriguez, said the town was given its name following the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478. Today, the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition lives on in the country with the terms ‘matar judíos’ and ‘matajudíos,’ both used in reference to the inquisition. The term, which means ‘kill Jews’, also appears in colloquial language and place names, as well as some family names. It is more commonly used by locals in reference to 'drinking lemonade', especially over the Easter period when residents populate city centre squares to drink lemonade spiked with alcohol as part of annual festival celebrations. He said it was the town’s original name but it was changed during the Spanish Inquisition. The town has discussed changing the name before but no official move had been taken until the mayor put forward the firm proposal in writing. Residents will decide on April 19 what the town’s name will be changed to – if at all – and a vote will be taken, with the majority verdict signalling the decision to be taken. Mayor Rodríguez told Spanish daily newspaper Diario de Burgos: ‘The majority decision will be respected, even if it is only by one vote.’ He also explained that the town changed its name to ‘Matajudíos’ after the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478. Castrillo is situated adjacent to the larger town of Castrojeriz, which had one of the earliest Jewish communities in Spain. According to the town’s website, equal rights were given to Jews and Christians in the town in 974. Rodríguez said after a massacre of Jews in Castrojeriz in 1035, many fled to nearby Castrillo. There was later another massacre in Castillo in 1109. Maria Royo, a spokesperson for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) phrase comes from medieval times. It is a term which is widely used in Spanish circles and there is even a ‘Mata Judios’ fiesta to be held on Good Friday where organisers estimate 40,000 gallons of lemonade will be sold. Ms Royo said: ‘Regrettably, this type of expression exists in Spain in ceremonies and parties. ‘The people saying it are mostly unaware of the history. It is a complicated issue that is ingrained in local culture.’ Mayor Lorenzo Rodriguez, who submitted the proposal, has now suggested changing the town's name to Castrillo de Mota de Judios, which translates to 'Castrillo of Jews Hill'","Residents of Castrillo de Matajudios will vote to change name on April 19 .

Liquid fantasy is another name for GHB, a colourless, odourless, bitter or salty liquid, that is known for being used in date rape cases. It is an anaesthetic-type drug that renders the victim physically incapacitated. It is usually swallowed but is also sometimes injected . It’s depressant drug that slows down the messages travelling between the brain and body. Effects last for around three to four hours and can include feelings of euphoria, increased sex drive, lowered inhibitions, memory lapses, drowsiness, clumsiness, dizziness or headache, lowered temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, tremors, nausea, diarrhoea and urinary incontinence. It’s very easy to take an overdose - especially when used with alcohol - and when that happens symptoms also include hallucinations, seizures, blackouts and death. GHB is typically consumed by the capful or teaspoonful at a cost of $5 to $10 per dose.

"Radiation from an earthquake may be responsible for the mysterious Turin Shroud image many believe to be a depiction of Jesus Christ, scientists claim. An Italian team at the Politecnico di Torino, a well respected Italian University, claims the powerful magnitude 8.2 earthquake, which occurred in Old Jerusalem in the year 33 AD, would have been strong enough to release neutron particles from crushed rock. The flood of neutrons may have imprinted an X-ray-like image onto the linen burial cloth by reacting with nitrogen nuclei, say the researchers. According to scientists from Politecnico di Torino, radiation emissions caused by an earthquake may have confused carbon dating tests conducted in 1988 which suggested the cloth was only 728 years old, and therefore likely to be a forgery. The first, hotly debated, documented reference to the Shroud of Turin dates back to the 14th century when a French knight was said to have had possession of the cloth in the city of Lirey. Records suggest the Shroud changed hands many times until 1578, when it ended up in its current home, the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. The 14-foot long herringbone woven cloth appears to show the faint imprint of a man bearing wounds consistent with crucifixion. In 1898, a lawyer named Secondo Pia took the first known photograph of the cloth. His negative revealed new details, including striking facial features that were hidden to the naked eye. In addition, the radiation emissions would have increased the level of carbon-14 isotopes - atomic strains of carbon - in the Shroud. According to the scientists, this may well have confused carbon dating tests conducted in 1988 which suggested the cloth was only 728 years old, and therefore likely to be a forgery. 'We believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the Shroud's linen fibres, through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei, and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating,' said Professor Alberto Carpinteri, from the Politecnico di Torino. The new theory is published in the journal Meccanica. Other scientists have previously suggested that neutron radiation may have been responsible for the ghostly image of a crucified man with his arms crossed. However, no plausible explanation has been offered for the source of the radiation. Some have proposed that it came from the body itself, or was generated by an event inside the tomb, pointing to a divine origin linked to the resurrection. Neutron radiation is usually generated by nuclear fusion or fission, and may be produced by nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. Prof Carpinteri's team believes earthquake-induced high pressure waves in the Earth's crust may be an overlooked natural source. The face of Jesus? Other scientists have previously suggested that neutron radiation may have been responsible for the ghostly image of a crucified man with his arms crossed. However, no plausible explanation has been offered for the source of the radiation until now. The scientists base the idea on research into piezonuclear fission reactions which occur when brittle rock is crushed under enormous pressure. During the process, neutron particles are released from atoms. A powerful earthquake could achieve the same effect, generating neutron radiation from stresses in the Earth, it is claimed. Mark Antonacci, a leading expert on the Shroud and president of the Resurrection of the Shroud Foundation, is currently petitioning Pope Francis to allow molecular analysis of the cloth using the latest technology. It is hoped that such an investigation will be able to confirm or rule out the radiation theory. The first, hotly debated, documented reference to the Shroud of Turin dates back to the 14th century when a French knight was said to have had possession of the cloth in the city of Lirey.

"Arsenal clash with United didn’t serve up the quality we hoped for but it was still an intriguing game. Arsenal will feel their performance deserved better but how many times are they going to lose goals from attacking positions? They have conceded 24 goals in all competitions so far this season and eight of them — exactly a third — have been let in on the counter-attack. They are naive at the back and you don’t need to have played football to realise their defence is weak and they are crying out for a defensive midfielder. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wenger's defence of Arsenal's philosophy . Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring for Manchester United away at Arsenal on Saturday evening . Kieran Gibbs cut a dejected figure during the defeat against the Red Devils at the Emirates Stadium . 1 - Jack Wilshere has got through just one 90 minutes in the league in the last nine months. Jack Wilshere has staked a claim but he has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League only once in the last nine months. That is an incredible statistic. He has had a lot of injuries but for that role you need to be consistent and robust. In the same period Nemanja Matic has started 23 league games for Chelsea and been subbed just once. Like centre backs, defensive midfielders are hard to find but Calum Chambers could be their best option. Whether Arsene Wenger would be prepared to leave out his captain Mikel Arteta, though, is another matter. Arsenal need a defensive midfielder but captain Mikel Arteta's place in their engine room appears secure . ROONEY'S RENAISSANCE . People say Wayne Rooney plays better when he’s angry, but I’ve never subscribed to that theory. The responsibility of being captain of England and Manchester United seems to be making him more disciplined and controlled. He looks comfortable in himself and he was excellent at the Emirates. At the start of the season there was a question as to whether he or Robin van Persie should be captain. At the moment, there’s no comparison. It’s been a good week for Wayne, winning his 100th cap and scoring goals, and as our table below shows, this is his second best start to a season.

Toure  has been heavily criticised but I hope he now takes the season by the scruff of the neck. He took his goal well, as our graphic below shows. It was the kind of surging Toure run that we’ve become so used to. If Man City want to retain their title they must keep that fighting spirit.

It’s time Brendan Rodgers gave his players some home truths, but I’m not sure he’s the type of manager to do that — he likes to protect his players. But since losing to Chelsea at Anfield last season, they have lost seven of their last 15 league games. That’s not good enough. Yannick Bolasie put in one of the best performances of the season, but any winger would have fancied their chances against Javi Manquillo.

It was only a matter of time before Danny Ings started to bang in the goals in the Premier League. For some there is an inferiority complex when they step up, but Ings now looks right at home. He scored 26 last season and will get even more when Sam Vokes returns from injury — they scored 47 between them in 2013-14. In Sean Dyche they have one of the most positive people I have ever met to lead them, and back-to-back wins shows they are not just here to make up the numbers.

"It was a hilarious but expletive-filled Bushtucker Trial for viewers of ITV's 'I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here' on Monday evening after Jimmy Bullard was elected by viewers to take on the eerily named Tunnel of Terror. Before the challenge, Bullard's fellow camp-mate and former World Superbike champion Carl Fogarty joked 'if he comes back with nothing I'll kick his head in'. Arriving at a clearing to find out his fate, the former Wigan and Fulham midfielder was instructed by presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly that he must descend a ladder into a dimly lit underwater tunnel. VIDEO Scroll down to Bullard's underwater challenge . Jimmy Bullard finds out his fate as he is greeted by presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly . Ant and Dec look on from a distance at the hatch that leads to the underwater tunnel swarming with critters . Bullard was less than impressed to discover what was in store, but was happy with retrieving the four stars . Ant and Dec can't help but laugh at what they are seeing as the former Wigan man struggles through the task . What awaited was a narrow perspex corridor containing five separate tanks filled with various creatures. Bullard was told he would be given 10 minutes to collect the six available stars. Spending three of the 10 available minutes in the first compartment, which contained water dragons, Bullard was finding it particularly hard to keep his language clean. Moving apprehensively through each part of the task, Bullard was confronted by numerous eels, crocodiles, crustaceans and finally water pythons. It was the final stage where Bullard's language was its most colourful, when he was met by one particularly defensive reptile that lunged towards him. Bullard has a face-off with a very defensive water python that even lunged to bite him as he screamed . The former Premier League player scrambles across a tank full of eels as he seeks out a star . After a speedy exit from the tunnel following his trial, Bullard had amassed four stars and was given the choice to convert them into meals or forfeit them to release someone from so-called Celebrity Slammer. It was a tough decision, but the former footballer chose to release 'Allo 'Allo star Vicki Michelle from the pretend prison. Speaking about witnessing the trial presenter Ant McPartlin said: 'I haven't laughed so much in ages'.","Jimmy Bullard takes on challenge in underwater Bushtucker Trial .

"Someone at the White House clearly needs to go back to elementary school. Press credentials given to members of the media travelling with President Obama across the West Coast this week had a glaring mistake. A map incorrectly identified Wyoming as Colorado in an embarrassing error that will leave someone at the White House with a very red face. Wrong: A map incorrectly identified Wyoming as Colorado in an embarrassing error that will leave someone at the White House with a very red face . President Obama was travelling to Washington, California and Colorado over a three-day period to help his bid for re-election next year. The mistake was probably made because the two states are next to each other and are both a similar size and shape, reported CNN. Colorado is seen as an important state for President Obama's re-election chances, reported Yahoo News. He spoke in Denver, Colorado, on Tuesday about his proposed jobs bill in an attempt to garner public support and media coverage in the state. Correct version: This is how the map should have been highlighted to show President Obama was travelling to Washington, California and Colorado . The three states he was visiting were . highlighted in white under the words: ‘The trip of President Barack . Obama to the American West’. Colorado Republican Party chairman Ryan Call seized upon the White House’s mistake in an interview with Fox News. 'If the White House can't even find .

"A woman who died after being overcome by fumes as she slept in her car between her four jobs had been desperately saving money to support a former boyfriend she met online and his three children. The body of 32-year-old Maria Fernandes was found in her car in Elizabeth, New Jersey in August, after she became overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container. She worked four jobs, including two shifts at separate Dunkin Donuts and she apparently left her car running while she tried to rest while going between her jobs. Richard Culhane the ex-boyfriend of Miss Fernandes, who he met online, pictured with his sons Dorian, left, and Jareth, right, during her funeral service earlier this year. Miss Fernandes had been working to support Mr Culhane and his children . Friends and family leave flowers on the casket during a funeral service for Maria Fernandes, 32, in Linden, N.J. Now it has emerged that in 2012, Miss Fernandes met former boyfriend, Richard Culhane online and persuaded him to move from New York to Newark after he lost his job in construction. Mr Culhane says she found him an apartment and paid his first month's rent before the pair moved in together. And when they did begin to live together she would pick up the $600 a month rent, nearly double the price of her previous accommodation. Mr Culhane adds that she then bought a tent and explained that it was for a homeless man she saw near work. She even bought suits for him and his three sons from a previous marriage when Mr Culhane's mother died for the funeral. It has now emerged that Miss Fernandes was paying the rent for her ex-boyfriend Richard Culhane after meeting him online . In 2011, the couple's landlord filed eviction papers when Miss Fernandes fell behind with the rent, although she was able to work out a restitution plan. He said a state youth protection worker told him that if he wanted custody he needed a bigger apartment. He and Miss Fernandes then found a three-bedroom for $1,100 a month and she took on a second job — supplementing pay from a bakery with earnings at a Dunkin' Donuts — to cover bills, he said. When she quit the bakery, she picked up hours at a second Dunkin' Donuts and then a third. Co-workers said all her jobs paid at or just above the minimum wage — which New Jersey raised by $1 earlier this year to $8.25 an hour. Maria Fernandes, left, pictured with new boyfriend Glen Carter, who she started a relationship with earlier this year and his daughter Hannah Wilson on a trip to Pennsylvania. The picture was taken just three weeks before her death . Miss Fernandez, pictured in 2001, worked four jobs, including two shifts at separate Dunkin Donuts . 'I told her over and over, 'Quit one. You're working too much,' Mr Culhane said. 'But she said, 'No, I'm used to it now.'' The couple eventually split up in 2013 but even then she continued to buy toys for the children and often stopped by with video games for them. 'Before she left, she was paying almost all of it,' Mr Culhane said of the couple's bills. 'She was like, 'I'll take care of you,' he said. Earlier this year, Miss Fernandes entered a new relationship after creating a profile on a dating website, Gothscene.com calling herself 'Clueless.' Her self-description as an animal lover interested in the supernatural and nostalgic for the 1980s caught the eye of Glen Carter, a 33-year-old Army veteran working at a Pennsylvania company that builds animal rescue vehicles. 'We were on the phone constantly from day one,' Mr Carter said. 'I wasn't expecting, you know, to have any serious relationship with her. It's just I was talking to her and the more I talked, the more we connected.' As the summer began, they agreed to be a couple. Mr Carter, in the process of a divorce and having trouble making alimony payments, said he encouraged Miss Fernandes to visit and consider moving to Pennsylvania. But the idea was cemented when Miss Fernandes took three days off from work in early August and they met for the first time, taking Mr Carter's daughter Hannah to Hersheypark. However, after returning to Newark, she continued to keep up her busy working life. But three weeks after the trip, and after finishing work, Miss Fernandes tilted back the driver's seat, leaving the engine running, the windows up and the doors locked, to catch up on much-needed sleep but she never woke up. Miss Fernandes was found near this Wawa shop with her car's engine still running and a strong chemical odor filling the air . She was found with the windows and the doors to the vehicle shut, and when emergency workers burst in they reported a chemical odor. Hazmat was called to the scene upon determining Fernandes was dead. The Star-Ledger notes that Miss Fernandes was only one of tens of thousands of New Jersey workers employed at multiple jobs. 'These are folks who would like to work full-time but they can't find jobs,' Carl Van Horn, director of John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, told reporters. 'They wind up in these circumstances in which they are exhausted. More commonly it creates just an enormous amount of stress.' At least 7.5 million people nationwide are working multiple jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For those who lost their jobs in the recession of 2008, many now working multiple positions still make less than their full-time wages and with little or no benefits. 'The average person who lost their job took a 10 per cent pay cut, (after returning to the workforce),' Van Horn said.","Maria Fernandes, 32, of Newark, was allegedly overcome by mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gas can .

"Malaysia's defence minister has sparked outrage after agreeing the tragedy of missing MH370 flight was a 'blessing in disguise'. It is the latest in a series of blunders by Hishammuddin Hussein as the international search continues almost a month after the Boeing 777 went missing. He has been criticised for withholding information from relatives, and failing to stop two Iranians who boarded the plane with stolen passports. Blunder: Hishammuddin Hussein received a barrage of complaints after his 'insensitive' tweet about MH370 . He received a tweet from Kuala Lumpur journalist Ismail Amsyar and his response caused outrage . Last night, a Kuala Lumpur-based journalist Ismail Amsyar tweeted the minister saying: 'MH370 is a blessing in disguise for all of us. I understand now the beauty of unity, the sweetness of having each other.' In a response which has caused international uproar, Mr Hussein said: 'Right u are :)' Outraged Twitter users hit back attacking the 'inappropriate' tweet, which has since been deleted, as families continue to fight for information on the mystery. Mr Amsyar, who received death threats following the exchange, this morning apologised 'from the bottom of [his] heart' for the comment. The minister, here with US secretary of defence Chuck Hagel, has borne the brunt of criticism over MH370 . Apology: Ismail Amsyar was sent death threats following the exchange and has since apologised profusely . He apologised to Mr Hussein, who has since deleted the tweet and not commented on the incident . Mr Hussein has yet to comment on the incident. It is widely believed the controversy over MH370 has scuppered his chances of succeeding his cousin, Malaysia's prime minister, as leader of the ruling party - with some claiming it has tarnished his entire political career. He came under fire when once asked to defend the 'disorderly' plane search, as he retorted: 'It's only confusion if you want it to be seen to be confusion.' Relatives of missing passengers have lashed out at Mr Hussein, blasting his 'disorderly' handling of the tragedy . Search continues: Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak today met to discuss the ongoing search almost a month after the Boeing 777 went missing . Days later, he lashed out at a journalist for posing the same question, claiming it was 'irresponsible' to make the allegation. He said: 'I have got a lot of feedback saying we have been very responsible in our action.

"A woman sentenced to two days in jail was locked up for 154 days after a judge forgot to sign the order for her release. Destiny Hoffman, 34, was given two days on August 22 by Clark County Circuit Court Judge Jerry Jacobi in Indiana for diluting her drug screen results, violating her court-appointed treatment program. The judge ordered Ms Hoffman, from Jeffersonville, held without bond 'until further order of the court'. However it then slipped the judge's mind to issue that order for five months. Destiny Hoffman, 34, was given two days on August 22 for an unknown charge in Clark County, Indiana . Judge Jacobi was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline due to the ongoing investigation and an official at Clark County Circuit Court refused to make any further remarks on the matter. According to newsandtribune.com, Judge Jacobi ordered Hoffman sent to jail without a hearing or legal counsel. It is unclear why Ms Hoffman did not let prison officials know that she was being held for an undue length of time. Clark County Deputy Prosecutor Michaelia Gilbert began investigating Hoffman's incarceration last Wednesday while reviewing old case files. She entered a motion seeking an immediate status hearing, writing that Hoffman's civil liberties were violated by the term of her incarceration. Indiana Special Judge Steven Fleece described the incident as a 'big screw up'. Hoffman's attorney, Nathan Masingo, said he was not even aware he client had been jailed and may file a lawsuit against county officials alleging she was unlawfully incarcerated. Two drug court program employees were placed on unpaid leave on January 7 after the mix-up came to light.

The tight building conditions and regulations associated with this unique project means designers had to come up with clever solutions in order to maximise the use of space. Designers have managed to squeeze three floors of retail space into the lofty wings of the cathedral by installing a freestanding and temporary structure. It can be removed at a later date so that the church can be returned to its original purpose.

"For most animal lovers, the fleeting dream of owning their very own wolf pup will never become a reality, but one U.S. artist may have come up with the next best thing. Pictured in a range of poses, artist Lee Cross, 21, creates frighteningly realistic handmade animal cubs that are so lifelike they have even fooled people into thinking they are real. Inspired by the Alaskan wildlife that surrounded her childhood home, she turns some of the cutest creatures around, such as wolf pups, baby otters and baby pandas, into bizarre looking dolls. This baby panda sculpture has painted beads for eyes and synthetic fur wrapped around a flexible skeleton . Once completed, the baby animal sculptures are then sold on Lee Cross' ebay account for hundreds of dollars . A close up of one of Lee Cross' baby fox sculptures, for which she receives hundreds of requests a day . A baby wolf pup pictured in a lifelike pose. Lee Cross' creations have attracted Hollywood design studios . Wolf pup sculptures such as this normally sell from anywhere between $800 (£475) and $5000 (£3000) Having never attended a single art class, she is entirely self taught and combines sculpture, synthetic fur and stuffing wrapped around a posable skeleton to produce the bizarre-looking soft toys. She also paints white beads to make the eyes as true to life as possible, hand dyes the fur and even adds weights to create the sensation of holding a real life animal. After spending the last eight years perfecting her craft, she has now started a worldwide phenomenon and receives hundreds to thousands of requests from people wanting to buy her sculptures everyday. In an effort to keep up with demand, the creations are auctioned on her aptly named 'eBay Auction Adoptions' page, where fans pay anything from $800 (£475) to $5000 (£3000) to purchase their very own creepy critter. She said: 'Since I grew up in the woods of Alaska, I would see wild animals every day. A white lion cub, sculpted into a curled up stance - much like a real cub when being nurtured by its mother . The sculptures initially took weeks to make but are now created much quicker. Pictured is a baby otter . Demand for the sculptures - such as this wolf pup - has skyrocketed with orders coming from across the world . The animals are available for purchase from Lee Cross on what she has aptly named 'ebay Auction Adoptions' 'Whether it was a family of eagles nesting right outside my window, wild swans that lived on our lake that became so used to me being there, they would come when I called and let me pet them or even the moose that would eat the carrot noses off my snowmen. I wanted to sculpt the animals I was seeing. 'This is what inspired me to create animals as realistic as I experienced them in life. 'Each animal varies on how long it takes to make, when I first started it took weeks and weeks working all day. 'But it does not take as long now that I've made over 400 animals, it's become muscle memory. 'However, because every single animal is made with such care and attention, it still takes a very long while. 'I had no artistic ability at all until I turned 13 and I've never had any lessons of any kind. A baby cheetah pictured being carried like a puppy. The sculptures have added weights to feel more realistic . Lee Cross realised there was a demand for her baby animal creations when her first sculpture won an art competition and then sold the very same day. Pictured is a baby cheetah .

Lee Cross, 21, originally from Alaska, pictured working on her latest baby animal creation.

'This was when I made my first animal sculpture, it didn't have the synthetic fur or posable skeleton but it won in an art contest and even sold the same day. 'I receive hundreds to thousands of commission requests every day, and due to the mass, I only sell these creatures through what I call 'eBay Auction Adoptions' where I let the people decide what each one-of-a-kind animal is worth. 'When I first started making these animals purely for my own delight, I had no idea they would erupt practically over night as a world wide 'must have', I was so shocked and it was a little overwhelming. 'My animals have also been noticed by the film company Stan Winston's Studios, who are the makers of the Jurassic Park movie, as well as the film company Weta Workshop who are the creators of Lord of the Rings, Narnia and The Hobbit.

"Gruesome stash: Dr Michael Berkland, a former medical examiner, kept human brains, lungs, hearts and tissue in a storage unit in Florida for years . A former medical examiner stashed human brains, hearts and lungs from more than 100 people in soda cups and food containers inside a storage unit, authorities have said. The remains, which included tissue samples and 10 brains, were found in a unit  in Pensacola, Florida that had previously been rented by Dr. Michael Berkland. A man made the grisly discovery when he bought the contents of the unit at an auction last week after Berkland stopped paying his rent - but he immediately called police after opening its doors to a pungent smell. Investigators found formaldehyde, which is used to preserve bodies, leaking from a 32-ounce drink cup with a cracked . lid - and opened it to find a human heart inside. No charges have been filed against Berkland but officials are trying to determine if he broke any laws regarding biomedical waste and the storing and disposing of human remains. Medical Examiner Dr. Andi Minyard told the Pensacola News Journal the remains appear to be from private autopsies Berkland performed at local funeral homes between 1997 and 2007. 'It’s a horrible thing to know that your uncle’s brain is sitting in some storage shed that got sold at an auction,' Dr. Minyard said. Berkland worked at the medical examiner's office from 1997 until 2003, when he was fired for failing to complete autopsy reports. He also conducted private autopsies in the area. Jeff Martin, director of the Medical Examiner's Office, added: . 'How horrible it is for the families of these deceased to think that . someone's loved one's organs are basically rotting away in a storage . unit somewhere.' The medical examiner's office is now cross-referencing names in their database during that time period to try to locate exactly where the organs came from, Martin said. Scene: The organs were discovered when Berkland's unit at Unlce Bob's Self Storage, pictured, was auctioned off. The new renter noticed a pungent smell inside and called authorities . Minyard added there is a good chance . that none of remains are from cases that Berkland handled as a medical . examiner as the numbering system he used was not the same as their . office. Officials are also trying to find relatives of the victims, but admit they could struggle. 'The unfortunate thing is several of the . tissue buckets and several of the brains don’t have any labels on them . at all, so we have no idea who they would have belonged to,' she said. It is not known why Berkland was storing the organs there; Martin said it is unlikely he was selling them as they were so crudely preserved. Some were in Tupperware containers and 'a lot of those containers were emptied because they had cracked through so all of those caustic chemicals were leaking out somewhere,' Martin said. Uncle Bob's Self Storage, the company that runs the unit, said Berkland claimed he would use the space to keep household goods and office furniture there. 'We never had any indication that . anything was out of the ordinary, nor did anyone on our management team . ever notice anything amiss during daily property checks,' Diane Piegza, . vice president of corporate communications, said. Unsettling: The organs had been stored in formaldehyde solution, as seen in this file picture, but in many cases it had leaked out of the food containers. Officals are now trying to identify the victims . State Attorney Bill Eddins added: 'We’re in the process of reviewing the . facts and researching the law to determine whether a crime has been . committed. We do intend to talk to Dr. Berkland - it is my belief he is . still local - and learn his reasons for keeping body parts there.' Florida was not the only place Berkland ran into trouble over his work. In 1996, he was fired as a contract medical examiner in Jackson County, Missouri, in a dispute over his autopsy reports. Berkland had incorrectly stated on the . reports that he had taken sections of several brains to be preserved as . specimens for medical conferences and teaching purposes, AP reported. He claimed they were 'proofreading errors' and the Missouri attorney general's office found they did not jeopardize any criminal cases. Berkland complained the actions against him were unfair because he was unable to present evidence in his defense. His doctor's license was ultimately revoked there.","Hoard of organs found after man bought contents of unit in Pensacola, Florida and opened the doors to foul stink .

"For Francois Hollande, it would be fair to say the proverbial has hit the fan this week. As if allegations the French president had a secret affair with an actress were not enough, several tonnes of horse manure have been dumped at the steps of his nation's parliament. Gendarmes apprehended a protestor before he could finish unloading a white articulated lorry full of dung outside Paris's National Assembly today, witnesses said. Dung: The protestor was stopped before he could finish unloading the truckload of manure in central Paris . Steaming: A message on the side of the articulated truck - which was parked outside the National Assembly in downtown Paris - read: 'Out with Hollande and the entire political class. Long live the Sixth Republic' Now it's really hit the fan: The dumping came after a tumultuous week in French politics which saw claims of a presidential affair. Police had to stop traffic and apprehended the driver of the dung-laden truck . On the side of the truck was daubed a slogan: 'Out with Hollande and the entire political class. Long live the Sixth Republic.' The present-day Fifth Republic was founded in 1958 with Charles de Gaulle its first president after France lost much of its colonial power after the Second World War. The pungent demonstration happened today outside the Bourbon Palace, a 16th Century monument next to the river Seine in central Paris which houses France's lower house of parliament, the equivalent of the House of Commons. Witnesses said the man was apprehended by police, who have since begun a mass clean-up. The French magazine Closer published a seven-page report last Friday on Mr Hollande's alleged affair with the actress Julie Gayet. Political muckraking: A slogan called for France's Sixth Republic. The fifth began with Charles de Gaulle in 1958 . Dirty protest: The size of the dump required a large-scale clean-up operation. The National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament equivalent to the House of Commons, is housed in Paris's Bourbon Palace . Who was that? President Hollande frowns during an engagement at the nearby Elysee Palace today, right . Ms Gayet, 41, is seeking 50,000 Euros in damages from the magazine after saying the report, which included photos of Mr Hollande apparently leaving a Paris apartment where he met her on a scooter and wearing a full crash helmet, invaded her privacy. French privacy laws are far stricter than those in the UK and French media traditionally ignore politicians' private lives. Mr . Hollande told reporters his 'indignation is total' over the magazine . story, calling it a 'violation that touches a personal liberty.' He did not deny the claims made in the article. Meanwhile France's first lady, Mr Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler, remains in hospital where she was taken after the affair was revealed. Her . spokesman Patrice Biancone said: 'I can tell you Madame Trierweiler is . still in the hospital, and her doctors will determine when she can . leave... She has six days of rest behind her - that counts, after all. Affair: French magazine Closer has alleged the premier, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler in October, had an affair with the actress Julie Gayet. Ms Gayet is suing the magazine for breach of privacy . The president reportedly arrived at a Paris apartment on his scooter to meet actress Julie Gayet (pictured) 'All visits have been forbidden ... except for the family - and even then, just her son.' Mr Hollande's approval ratings are among the lowest of any French leader. He has acknowledged 'painful moments' in his relationship with Trierweiler, and said the question of who the country's first lady is would be clarified before a state visit to the United States next month. It is not the first protest using farmyard produce. More than 2,500 angry farmers covered the streets of Brussels with milk and manure - bringing their cows with them - in protest at EU agricultural laws in 2009. And comedians Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubinstein tried unsuccessfully to deliver a truckload of dung to Britain's Houses of Parliament last year for the BBC series The Revolution Will Be Televised - claiming politicians had 'run out of bulls***' and needed some more.","Pungent protest blocked the streets outside the National Assembly in Paris .

While there is a more limited capacity attendance at the ‘Jackal’s Den’, a heated atmosphere is expected after a tension-filled pre-fight press conference yesterday, while additional pressure is on Framton’s shoulders as the fight marks the return of world-championship boxing to terrestrial television on ITV/UTV Ireland. Carl Frampton looks on during his pre-fight press conference in Belfast on Thursday . Barry McGuigan (centre) looks towards Frampton's opponent Chris Avalos (right) on Thursday . When asked to compare the first defence of his world featherweight title, against American Bernard Taylor 30 years ago, to the challenge facing Frampton, the ‘Clones Cyclone’ pointed to similarities in expectation, but differences in styles. McGuigan stopped the then-undefeated Taylor in eight rounds, three months after his famous title win over Eusebio Pedroza at Loftus Road, and he believes Frampton can also record a knockout in his first defence. ‘You’re definitely buoyed by that [winning the title],’ said McGuigan. ‘Carl’s going to be fired up because he knows this guy is going to be a tough fight for him. He enjoys guys who come and fight with them. ‘It’s interesting. My first defence was a situation where I had to put pressure on a guy. He’s in a situation where he’s probably more dangerous and he’s going to come to him. Carl needs to respect his power, be switched on from bell to bell every single round and just perform well.’ Barry McGuigan celebrates after becoming world champion at Loftus Road in 1985 . McGuigan, who turns 54 on Saturday, is hoping for the ideal birthday present from his undefeated protégé, but emphasised that a shot at superstardom is on the line for Frampton as he takes on the 25-year-old Chris Avalos. The Californian has suffered two losses on points in a 27-fight career and has recorded as many knockouts as 28-year-old Frampton has had fights. ‘Carl’s a bright kid, a smart kid, he knows what’s on the line here,’ said McGuigan. ‘He knows the risks, he knows the potential of a unification fight. He knows that doesn’t happen unless he performs really well on Saturday night.’ The pre-fight press conference takes place ahead of Saturdays's IBF super-bantamweight title bout . A colourful back-and-forth at Thursday’s press conference saw Avalos and his manager, Mike Criscio, challenge Frampton to wager some of his purse on the fight result, with the invitation following reports that they have already bet around £10,000 with Belfast bookies on victory for the Californian. ‘I wouldn’t like to take your money off you,’ Frampton told Avalos. ‘You’ve had the same tracksuit top on your for about four days. Every time I’ve seen you, you’ve been wearing that coat so I wouldn’t like to take your money off you.’","Carl Frampton defends his IBF super-bantamweight world crown .

"It is a noise that only two per cent of people can hear, but this low droning sound would be enough to drive anyone mad. Scientists have been left baffled because they can’t figure out what causes a phenomenon called The Hum, or why it affects so few people. Sufferers have identified common factors: the humming is only heard indoors, it is a low, rumbling noise, it is louder at night, and is more common in more rural areas, reported The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Irritating: Leeds is one of the most recent laces in the UK where the hum has been reported . In the UK, the noise has been heard in Leeds, Bristol, and Largs, Scotland, but has been reported as far as Taos, New Mexico, and Bondi Beach in Sydney. A 2003 study by acoustical consultant Geoff Leventhall, from Surrey, shows that one in 50 people who live in a Hum-prone place hear the noise, and that most of these people are aged between 55 and 70. Katie Jacques, from Leeds, told the BBC: ‘It's a kind of torture; sometimes, you just want to scream.‘It's hard to get off to sleep because I hear this throbbing sound in the background.  You're tossing and turning, and you get more and more agitated about it.’ Those who hear it can experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, nosebleeds and sleep disturbances, and the BBC reported at least one suicide as a result of the noise. Annoying: Bristol was one of the first places in the world to record the noise. It was heard by approximately 800 people in the 1970s . Unidentifiable: The noise has even been heard in the town of Taos in New Mexico. They were unable to identify the cause . Often sufferers otherwise have perfectly normal hearing, and The Hum goes away when they leave a certain area. The ‘Bristol Hum’ was one of the first reported in the world. Around 800 people said they could hear the noise in the 1970s. It was eventually blamed on traffic and local factories. In Taos, New Mexico, a group of researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of New Mexico, were unable to identify the source of The Hum in the early 1990s. One resident of Bondi beach in Sydney told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It sends people around here crazy — all you can do is put music on to block it out. Some people leave fans on.’ Unsolved: People in the Scottish seaside town of Largs have reported the mysterious Hum too . Surf's up: One resident of Bondi beach in Sydney told the Daily Telegraph that it sends people around the area crazy . Some suggest that the noise is in fact tinnitus, a condition that makes the sufferer hear noise that isn’t there, but it is thought that the noise is in fact real. Suspected sources are industrial equipment, gas lines, power lines, and wireless communication, despite few cases being linked to them. Others suggest that it is a result of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation or seismic activity such as microseisms that are only perceptible to a select few. Although, some experts have suggested sufferers turn to cognitive behavioural therapy to help deal with the noise. But, it is unlikely The Hum will be solved any time soon. Leventhall told the BBC: ‘It's been a mystery for 40 years, so it may well remain one for a lot longer.’","The Hum has been heard in isolated places around the world .

"With his trademark cowboy boots, cute waistcoat and red neckerchief, little Woody from Toy Story hardly looks like an imposing figure. But the cowboy doll was apparently branded a terror risk at Heathrow Airport – because it was holding a miniature six-shooter. A bemused air traveller has claimed on a social networking site that the figure was examined at Heathrow by security staff - who then subsequently confiscated the doll’s tiny firearm. A doll of Woody from Toy Story was apparently branded a security risk at Heathrow Airport because of the gun . The Reddit user claimed he was stopped at security for bringing the doll through . The traveller, who backed up their claim by posting online a photo of Woody being impounded, said: 'I have travelled the world with Toy Story’s Woody, taking pics for my son. 'At Heathrow, security just confiscated his ""weapon"", keep the world safe boys'. Woody does not normally carry a gun, so it is unclear where the weapon came from . The photo has caused hundreds of comments on the Reddit website, with many users branding the security services as overzealous. One user, called Groonz, commented: 'I'm just imagining what it would be like if he tried to hijack an airplane with that small gun. People squinting looking at his hand.' Another person, with the username dudeinsha, wrote: 'Pathetic. What happened to common sense?' And Reddit user Spiritol Jaguar, referring to Woody’s famous catchphrase about snakes when someone pulls his string, added: 'Did they find the snake in his boot?' The dolls are not normally sold with a gun, so it is unclear where the weapon originated. Heathrow Airport refused to comment on the matter and but said that security rules are drawn up by the Department For Transport. A spokesperson for the Department For Transport said: 'We do not comment on specific incidents or details of our security regime. 'Airports and airlines can use their discretion to remove any item being carried in hand luggage when they believe it may be perceived as a threat.'","Cowboy doll was apparently branded a terror risk at Heathrow Airport .

"These giant symbols etched into the desert are a welcoming message to aliens from Tom Cruise's deeply secretive church of Scientology. The religion, which believes a sinister extraterrestrial being called Xenu brought billions of people to earth in spaceships similar to DC8 airliners, operates a giant underground base hidden deep within the New Mexico desert. BBC reporter John Sweeney, who famously clashed with Scientologists during a Panorama report in 2007, travelled to the site dubbed Scientology's 'alien space cathedral', to research a new book. Welcome to earth: The huge symbol etched into the desert in New Mexico next to the Scientology base dubbed the 'alien space cathedral' The strange symbols sit on top of a rock formation in New Mexico where the . church of Scientology has built an enormous underground bunker . Hidden some 30 miles from the nearest town, the base is reportedly home to a huge underground bunker, built in the 1980's and strong enough to withstand a nuclear holocaust. Deep inside its vaults sealed within titanium caskets, are the original texts of founder L Ron Hubbard on gold discs - the religion's most sacred scriptures. A report in the Sun newspaper tells how Sweeney visited the site, known as Trementina Base, and interviewed former members of the church of Scientology for the new book Church of Fear. Mr Sweeney,who the church has previously described as 'a bigot, a liar and psychotic' said: 'I'd alway wanted to visit Trementina because when you go to the church they always deny this talk of Xenu and space aliens. 'When I spoke to Kirsty Alley and Juliette Lewis in 2007 and asked them 'who is Xenu?' they'd say ""John, you're crazy"". 'But if I'm wrong about the church believing in aliens, then why have they built these giant symbols in the middle of the desert that can only be seen from outer space? 'I think there is something very strange about a church which builds an enormous cathedral but then hides it away from everyone. 'What concerns me is that Scientology says it wants religious status in the UK. But our rules state religions must be open and honest about their beliefs and I think these are good rules. 'This place is physical proof that they do believe in aliens. I'd like to see Tom Cruise and John Travolta explain why they hide this from people.' The . symbols, which consist of two interlinking circles with diamonds in the . centre, are reportedly there to guide Scientologists returning to earth . after fleeing to outer space to escape armageddon. Follower: Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise, left,  has been a Scientologist since the early 1990s and, right, Scientology leader David Miscavige,  addresses the crowd during the opening of  a new church in London . Mr Sweeney was accompanied by a former Scientologist Marc Headley, who claims to have been 'audited' by Cruise and then beaten up by the church’s leader David Miscavige - incidents which the church strongly deny. After travelling many miles along a dirt road, the pair made it as far as a set of huge steel gates guarded by two security cameras, where they were turned away. He writes: 'I press an intercom button. A voice says “Hello” in what sounds like a Scandinavian accent. I announce that I’m John Sweeney and ask nicely for a tour. 'We are not invited in and the intercom simply spouts white noise. We drive back to civilisation, wondering what kind of religion builds a space alien cathedral underground.' The reporter claims he received two . mysterious phone calls to his hotel room at 1am that night for which he . believes Scientologists were responsible. Mr Headley, who was brought up inside the church from the age of six, has written the book Blown For Good: Inside the Dark Curtain of Scientology. In it he reveals how the church's E-meter devices, which are used to measure the static electric field around a person, cost just $40 to make but are sold for $4,000 (£2,400). And church leaders reccomend everyone should have two in case one breaks. In . a piece published in the Mail earlier this year Mr Sweeney recounted . the incident in 2007 when he lost his temper at two Scientologists who . had been trailing him across America. BBC reporter John Sweeney, who famously clashed with Scientologists . during a Panorama report in 2007, travelled to the Trementina while . researching a new book . He said: 'Five years ago, I spent weeks at the centre of the church’s attention. Private investigators who, I believe, were working for the church chased me around the streets of Los Angeles, invaded my hotel at midnight and put me under surveillance. Strangers spied on my wedding and knocked on the doors of my neighbours. 'In the end, I lost it on camera, doing a good impression of an exploding tomato. 'In the 21st century, everyone has a right to believe in anything, or nothing. But not everything that claims to be a religion is a religion. It could be, for example, a brain-washing cult. 'For a start, a religion must be honest about what it believes in. Scientologists believe in a space alien satan called Xenu — but if you ask them, their spokesmen deny it.' A spokesman for Scientology said the giant markings are merely the corporate logo of the Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) which are used to help pilots find the airstrip. The Scientology website describes CST as 'a California nonprofit religious corporation formed in 1982 to preserve and archive the Scientology scripture and so ensure its availability for all future generations'. The spokesman said: 'The facility in New Mexico is one of the archival storage sites containing preservation copies of Mr. Hubbard’s writings and lectures. 'The symbol carved in the hillside near the facility is CST’s corporate logo. Because the facility is in such a remote area the only way to it is by way of a nearby airstrip.' John Sweeney's book, The Church of Fear — Inside the Weird World of Scientology, is published on January 7 by Silvertail Books, paperback £12.99 and ebook £3.99.","Secret New Mexico base is built to withstand a nuclear attack .

"A 15-year-old described by a neighbour as a 'nice young boy' walked into a police station in rural Arkansas and told officers he had shot and killed his sister at home. Franklin County prosecutor David Gibbons says he plans to . charge the boy as an adult 'because of the nature of the crime' and a judge set his bail at $750,000. The boy . hasn't been identified because of his age, and his court hearing was . closed to the public. The judge even forced the boy's aunt and uncle out . of the courtroom, leaving the boy to stand alone before the judge, . Gibbons said. He was appointed a public defender, and his next court . date is March 1. Horror: A 15-year-old walked into a police station near his home in Ozark, Arkansas (pictured), and told officers he had shot and killed his sister at home . Police found the 16-year-old girl's . body in a bedroom of the house near Ozark while the teens' parents were . out grocery shopping, Franklin County Sheriff Anthony Boen said last . night. Sheriff Boen said he . did not believe the girl's death was accidental, although her brother . appeared remorseful and had tears in his eyes when he turned himself in. Authorities are treating the death as a homicide. Sheriff Boen said: 'He just said that he had just shot and killed his sister. He didn't give a motive.' The boy was in custody in nearby Sebastian County because Franklin County is not set up to house juveniles. He is expected to appear before a judge later today, although no charges have been filed yet. The teen is thought to have killed his sister sometime after 8am on Sunday, when his parents left to go grocery shopping in Fort Smith, about 40miles away. He turned himself in at the sheriff's department about an hour and a half later. Deputies had never been called to the home before and there weren't any reports of trouble with the teens, Sheriff Boen said. A neighbour described the family as 'nice and quiet' and the boy as a 'nice young boy'. Donna Sheppard, who lives next to the family's home, said her grandson knew the boy from school. She said: 'It's the most shocking thing I could have ever imagined.' Mrs Sheppard said she did not hear any gunshots before she left for Sunday school a little after 9am, and learned about the shooting when she came home from church that afternoon. The girl's body has been sent to the state crime lab, and preliminary autopsy results are expected sometime this week. Investigators confiscated multiple guns from the family's home and vehicle and were trying to determine which weapon had been used in the shooting. Sheriff Boen said: 'Both the dad and the son were avid hunters.' The Arkansas State Police are investigating the case, but spokesman Bill Sadler refused to comment.","Boy, 15, said to have killed his sister at home in Ozark, Arkansas, while their parents were out shopping ."
"With his half-shaved head and slicked-back Mohawk, Carl Lentz is not your typical pastor. His Hillsong Church NYC holds at least six sermons every Sunday in a ballroom-style concert venue that has hosted such bands as U2 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. People squeeze into whatever space they can find and take notes on iPhones as Lentz marches across the stage, peppering his sermon with Bible verses, jokes, pop music lines and street slang. ‘If you’re new to our church, we love you,’ says the 34-year-old Lentz. ‘Don’t be alarmed by the craziness you see. One time somebody said, ‘Y’all are crazy in your church,’ and I said, ""You ever seen you dance drunk? Don’t be judging us up in church.""' Today's preacher: Carl Lentz is not a typical pastor and his Hilltop Church NYC is not the typical church . After a little more than two years, Hillsong estimates it draws 5,500 people to Sunday services each week. Crowds lining up are a regular weekly scene at Irving Plaza near Manhattan’s Union Square. Hillsong often has to add additional evening sessions, which could last well into the night. ‘I’ve gotten used to seeing bar stools and club stuff in the place that we have church,’ Lentz said, adding ‘that’s church to me now.’ Steve Dagrossa, a 31-year-old who says he is a recovering heroin addict, attended all six sermons on a recent Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. He has even styled his hair his hair like Lentz. 'I¿ve gotten used to seeing bar stools and club stuff': Lentz's church space has played host to rock groups like U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers . ‘It’s unconventional but we’re not a conventional city,’ Dagrossa said. ‘This isn’t the Bible Belt. This is New York.’ Meredith Anderson, a 27-year-old church member who also works as an assistant to Lentz, said she ‘went from being a drug addict party animal to becoming a Christian living a full, healthy life.’ ‘If it was a church that was all buttoned up, you know, what everybody thinks about when they think about church … that’s not necessarily something that would speak to me,’ she said. ‘But because it’s young people, because there are young people there, I feel more comfortable.’ The church is a branch of the popular Australian-based Hillsong Church, the Pentecostal church which draws more than 21,000 weekly to its services. Hillsong is best known for its concert-type settings where they play Christian rock and praise music, which often appeals to a younger demographic of churchgoers. Rockin with Jesus: Lentz's unique take on church draws around 5,500 to Sunday services each week . Much of Hillsong NYC’s success can be attributed to its unorthodox leader. Lentz is a hyperactive, self-proclaimed insomniac who would rather stand than sit. His gift for gab lends itself to creating hype for the church. He loves hip hop music and often calls getting the word of God out ‘a hustle.’ At one service, he broke out Coolio lyrics. At another he called the biblical Saul the ‘LeBron James of Judaism.’ He is an avid basketball fan and player, and is a fixture at New York Knicks games. Even celebrities like Justin Bieber have jumped on Lentz's bandwagon. 'At lunch talking about our savior Jesus Christ,' writes the Biebs . Lentz has established himself as his own brand. He has more than 67,000 followers on Twitter and 59,000 on Instagram, where you can find pictures of him standing next to Jay-Z and NBA star Kevin Durant. Justin Bieber posted a picture of himself eating lunch with Lentz, ‘talking ’bout our savior Jesus Christ.’ Hillsong is far from the first church to attempt to win over a young demographic, but few have been able to pull it off as successfully as Hillsong, according to Carnes. Concert-like atmosphere: It is clear why the demographic for Lentz's flock of the Australian-based Hillsong Pentecostal church skews young . Still, Hillsong is just as susceptible to the downfalls of any modern progressive church, and there is always the danger that the trendy concert culture could overshadow the message, Carnes said. ‘This church is always only about Jesus. … It’s always, it’s only about Jesus.’ Lentz said in a recent sermon. Casual: Jeans and tattoos are the norm for a Hillsong gathering . Lentz declined to discuss same-sex marriage, a polarizing issue that young evangelicals have said in repeated surveys that they do not want to be a focus of church. Many evangelical pastors starting churches in New York avoid addressing the topic from the pulpit, a decision that has drawn criticism from evangelical leaders who consider the issue one of the most important for traditional Bible-believers. Lentz said he enjoys having critics. ‘They give me fuel for the fire,’ he said. On his critics: 'They give me fuel for the fire'",Carl Lentz may be unconventional but his Hillsong Church is a big hit in New York City .
"The criminal mastermind behind a notorious armed robbery in which a policewoman was killed dynamited himself out of a high-security prison today. Redoine Faid, one of the most feared armed robbers in France, broke out of Sequedin jail, near Lille. The 40-year-old is armed and dangerous, and police have issued an all ports alert which includes the Channels one from which Faid could reach Britain. Redoine Faid used explosives to blast through five prison doors and break free in the northern town of Sequedin . Members of the ERIS Police service stand guard in front of the destroyed door of the Sequedin prison . Faid took four prison wardens hostage early on Saturday morning and then blew up five heavy doors. Police believe that his wife may have smuggled explosives wrapped in handkerchiefs into the prison. Once . outside, Faid released the guards and was driven away at high speed in a . car which was later found burned out near the town of Ronchin. French criminal Redoine Faid who masterminded an armed robbery, broke out of prison using dynamite . Detectives were trying to trace a second vehicle which Faid is thought to have jumped in to. 'It . all happened very quickly,' sad a prison spokesman. 'The escape was . clearly very well organised - we are still busy trying to work out the . facts.' Faid was . named as the chief suspect for the organising of a botched armed robbery . in 2010 in which Aurelie Fouquet, a 26-year-old policeman was killed. Some 27 people were arrested in a sting operation following the murder, but Faid escaped. He was finally arrested in June 2011 and sent to prison for eight years. He is also notorious for his brazen attacks on cash-in-transit vehicles. Etiene Dobremetz, a prison warden union official at Sequedin, said the four men taken hostage had all been 'deeply traumatised'. It was Mr Dobremetz who accused Faid's . wife of supplying the explosives, but the criminal's lawyer, Jean-Louis . Pelletier, denied this, saying she had not even visited the prison . today. Mr Dobremetz said he . was 'not at all surprised' that his client had escaped, adding: 'That a . prisoner should escape is, in principal, not particularly surprising.

"When the Rotherham child abuse scandal exploded last year the nation hoped that the sordid story was a horrifying one-off. But in the wake of the revelations came allegations of more Asian gangs sexually abusing white girls - some as young as 12 - in cities across the north of England. For Katie Taylor (not her real name), the sickening tales of sexual abuse came as no surprise, because as a 13-year-old, she too had been a victim of predatory gangs. Harrowing: Katie Taylor tells her story from behind a screen to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield . In a brave appearance on ITV breakfast show, This Morning, she revealed that she had first been approached by a handsome man named 'Sam' at just 13 years of age. 'I first noticed him when he began following me home from school but I didn't think anything of it at first,' she said from behind a screen. 'He said he couldn't be seen with me in public because I was white and he was Asian.' but to all intents and purposes, she added, 'we were boyfriend and girlfriend.' For a while things seemed fine. Katie, the product of a broken home and the victim of bullying at school, revelled in Sam's attention but things soon took a turn for the worse. Hitherto gentle and kind, things turned violent when, one day, Katie refused to have sex with Sam. 'He wouldn't let me go,' she remembered. 'He stood in front . of the door and I tried to open it but there were three locks on the . door... I just couldn't get out. To get out, I had to have sex, yes...' Worse was to come. She was taken to meet two men named Wadi and Tali after a chance visit to a corner shop. Both swiftly started to abuse her. Horror: Katie's terrible tale left both Willoughby and Schofield looking visibly saddened at times . Expert: Kama Lamy, a legal expert in the field of child sex abuse, was on hand to comment on Katie's story . At the meeting that followed, first Wadi, then Tali forced themselves on the 13-year-old girl. But shockingly, Katie was by now so conditioned to Sam's behaviour that she didn't realise anything was wrong. 'I just thought they were my boyfriends . because they were always nice to me, they were always giving me things . and they always said I was special and they loved me, so I just thought . they were my boyfriends,' she said. As the abuse escalated, more and more men became involved, including 'Zeb', who bombarded her with texts and calls before driving her to his home, where she was forced to perform a sex act on him. Things went from bad to worse, eventually culminating with a disgusting sex party, during which Katie was drugged and raped by several men. 'He [Zeb] gave me vodka and coke and I didn't . think anything of it,' says Katie. 'He asked me to stand up and I just fell to the . floor. My vision was blurry and the voices were echoing in my head. I . just couldn't feel my own body. 'I remember before I was . taken upstairs, there was only Zeb and two other guys there. They took . me upstairs. 'It was dark in the . room but I can remember three figures laid on the bed. After that, all I . can remember is being sick and passing out and when I woke up, I was on . the floor and all of my clothes were off, and when I went back . downstairs, I can't remember the number, but there was more men there . that weren't there before... 'When I woke up I . felt sore everywhere and I knew what had happened because they were . there and obviously they wouldn't have taken my clothes off for nothing. I know that they did something...' Delicate: The police were anxious to raise the topic of race with Katie during the investigation . Katie has since written a book about her experiences which was referred to by Schofield during the show . And still her nightmare continued, with Katie eventually hitting rock bottom the following month, when she discovered that she had become pregnant as a result of the gang rape. Sickened and demoralised after being forced to have an abortion, the final straw came when Zeb said he wanted to pimp her to his friends and insisted that she start taking cocaine. Bravely, Katie plucked up the courage to tell a social worker what had happened and the police were duly involved. Although the police were determined to prosecute Zeb and his gang, Katie was horrified to be asked early on about the racial politics surrounding the case. 'The police really did want prosecutions . but it was ridiculous because early on they brought up the issue of . race, and I didn't even know why it mattered after what they'd done, but . they told me they had to be careful how they dealt with it in case they . were called racist,' she explained. Turning to Kama Lamy, a legal expert in the field of child abuse, presenter Philip Schofield then asked whether this meant that abuse of the sort that Katie suffered was a racial issue. Not so said Lamy. 'We have to remember, of course, that the . vast majority of child sexual abuse takes place within the home and is . perpetrated by white males and not Asian groups,' she told Schofield and fellow presenter, Holly Willoughby. 'Tragically, Katie's . story is not completely unfamiliar to those of us who work within the . criminal justice system, but it is rare and unusual and we have to bear . that in mind.' She added: 'By taking children as young as Katie who . don't have enormous experience of the world or sexual behaviour . beforehand, they're [gangs] able to absolutely normalise what is child sex abuse.' Katie, who has written a book about her harrowing experiences called Stolen Girl, was then asked what she would say to anyone currently in the same situation. 'I would say to them obviously come . forward,' she said. 'I'd say the moment someone says to them, ""don't tell anyone, . this is our secret"", tell some one straight away because you know . something is wrong.' Stolen Girl by Katie Taylor costs £7.99 and is available from Amazon .","Katie Taylor was raped hundreds of times between ages of 13 and 15 .

"Senseless: Delbert Belton an 88-year-old veteran of World War II was beaten to death outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane, and police have arrested two teens in connection with the murder . A second teenager accused of taking part in the deadly beating of a World War II veteran in Washington state has been named following the arrest of his alleged accomplice. Thursday night, police arrested Demetrius Glenn, 16, in connection to the slaying of 88-year-old Delbert Belton, who was savagely beaten with flashlights in the parking lot of his regular bar in Spokane on Wednesday. Belton, who was shot in the leg during the pivotal battle of the Pacific campaign, passed away from serious head injuries Thursday at Sacred Heart Medical Center in the city. Friday afternoon, authorities named a second suspect in the killing, identified as 16-year-old Kenan Adams Kinard. He currently remains at large. Police told Belton's daughter-in-law, Bobby, . that he was beaten with heavy flashlights in the assault which left him . bleeding 'from every part of his face'. Witnesses to the attack said that Belton, who was going to play pool, was outside the Eagles Lodge at around 8pm when two male suspects set upon him. A friend said the veteran had just pulled up and was waiting for a female friend so she didn't have to walk in alone. Suspects: Demetrius Glenn (left), 16, was arrested for the murder of Delbert Belton; his alleged accomplice, 16-year-old Kenan Adams Kinard (right), is on the loose . Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested after a four day man-hunt . Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer . 'It . does appear random. He was in the parking lot, it appears he was . assaulted in the parking lot and there was no indication that he would . have known these people prior to the assault,' Spokane Police Major . Crimes Detective Lieutenant Mark Griffiths said. On Thursday evening, police released surveillance photos of the two suspects, Glenn and Kinard. Adams-Kinard's attorney objected to him being placed in adult prison . Glenn faces a first-degree murder charge and one count of robbery. The local station KHQ reported that he will be tried as an adult. The teen has an extensive juvenile . criminal history, which includes malicious mischief, fourth-degree . assault, driving without a license and riot with a deadly weapon . charges. Adams-Kinard also has had a few run-ins with the law, The Spokesman Review reported. He was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June. Police . Chief Frank Straub said Adams-Kinard should be considered a threat to . the community and should not be contacted. He urged anyone who sees him . or has information on his whereabouts to call 911 at once. Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his attorney just before 10pm Thursday. Officers noticed that the teen had an abrasion on his right hand, according to an affidavit. While being questioned by police, Glenn was asked to stand up and show what he was wearing. 'These are not the shorts from the video,' Glenn said, according to the report, apparently referring to the surveillance footage. Glenn, who spells his first name as 'Demetruis' on social media sites, described himself on his Twitter account in this manner: 'I Play Foot-ball,Run Tracc [sic],Get Money Do What i do,im a guy but i like the show keeping up with the kardashians.' Delbert 'Shorty' Belton was taken to the Intensive Care Unit of Sacred Heart after the assault at the Eagles Ice-A-Rena near Lidgerwood, but succumbed to his wounds. Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects . Suspect Number Two: Police caught the two teens who assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night . Family members were today grieving for the widower, who is survived by one son Bill, 65, who is currently in hospital himself. Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton told KREM-TV she received the police call and had to break the news to her ill husband. 'They used those great, big heavy flashlights,'' she said. 'The doctor said he was bleeding from all parts of his face. 'You expect older people to die but not in that way. You just don't do those kind of things' His sister Alberta Tosh told the Spokesman Review: 'He was a good guy who would help anybody if they needed help,' she said. His great-nephew Allen Hills told KHQ that the veteran took him in and put him back on his feet when he hit rock bottom. 'It seems trivial, but he really did save my life. He made it possible for me to get a job and find work,' he said. 'He wasn't just my great-uncle. He was a great person, and he didn't deserve to die like that.' Devastated: Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton, pictured, told of her grief at the brutal killing . Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . Friends were left equally outraged that the serviceman would die in such a callous way. 'He put his life on the line for our country to come home and 60 years later? Get beat to death?' his closest friend Ted Denison told the Review. 'That’s not right.' Denison who knew Belton for 23 years regularly played pool with the former soldier who went on to be an aluminum worker. He worked at Kaiser Aluminum’s Trentwood rolling mill until his retirement in 1982 but remained a skilled member of the Steelworkers Union. His wife died several years ago. 'He went up there and played pool, met with some of the guys he used to work with at Kaiser Aluminum,' he told CNN. 'It's really depressing. Seems that all there is is bad news.' Police said that Belton had just arrived with a lady-friend to play pool at the lodge when he was set upon. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'Those . people to me are cowards,' said Denison to KXLY.com. 'They are cowards when they . beat old people that are defenseless.... They need to be caught. Period. Because that's senseless. Beating an old man, what kind of person does . that? But a wimp to me.' 'He was always there for me when I needed him,' he added. 'We'd joke . back and forth. We were always having fun, some sort of fun.' Their outrage was mirrored online. On Twitter a campaign titled Justice for Delbert Belton was spreading this morning. Actor James Woods was one high profile supporter. 'Don't let him die without anyone caring,' read one of his many posts on the killing. The police are looking for two male suspects in the attack, with one described as heavy set and wearing all black clothing and the other as 6 feet tall and 150 pounds.","Delbert Belton, 88, was set upon in the parking lot of the Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Washington on Wednesday night .

"Some of the world's largest and most spectacular kites filled the air at the Bristol International Kite Festival this weekend. Now in its 26th year, the festival continues to be a popular and colourful attraction that attracts guests from all over the world. Giant 3-D creatures such as a dragon, a pouncing tiger and a massive whale joined action-packed 'rokkaku' kite fighting battles, synchronised stunt routines, and even parachuting teddy bears. Scroll down for video . Mid-leap: A tiger takes flight at Bristol International Kite Festival this weekend. The event has been running for 26 years and attracts thousands of people . Fearsome: A huge dragon looms over the crowds (left) while a trio of brightly-coloured primates take flight with the help of a plane (right). The festival is known for the painstakingly-crafted kites . Over the years the festival has welcomed guest flyers from America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Malaysia, China, Israel, and many countries in Europe, as well as a regular contingent of the best of British flyers and supporters. This year it featured the official Guinness World Record holder for the world's largest kite - a colossal 3D Kuwaiti flag the size of an Olympic swimming pool. When laid out flat on the ground the kite measures 42m x 25m and has a lifting area of 1,019 square metres. This extraordinary kite was commissioned by the Al Farsi family of Kuwait and made in New Zealand by kite maestro and regular Festival guest Peter Lynn. It is made from over 2,500 sq m of specially woven, high performance rip stop nylon and took 750 hours to build.

Bristol International Kite Festival was the brainchild of three friends, Martin Lester, John Peyton, and Avril Baker. Lester and Peyton were designers and kite enthusiasts who had worked together at Bower Ashton College of Art & Design, in Bristol and Avril was working in public relations and marketing. Following a successful flying display they put on for a local council event the three decided to stage a proper kite festival. The first event had a budget of £300. It is now one of the region's biggest events and hosts thousands of visitors. The event also raises money for the Great Western Air Ambulance Charity and is currently trying to generate £250, 000 for a new helicopter. Diaspora: A few of the odder and more risque creations .

"Nude pictures of former French first lady Carla Bruni were used to break in to the computer systems of dozens of diplomats, it emerged today. The shocking security breach was first discovered at the G20 summit in Paris in February 2011 and may be ongoing. ‘To see naked pictures of Carla Bruni click here’ said a message sent to those attending, who included finance ministers and central bank representatives. Hacked: Nude pictures of former French first lady Carla Bruni were used to break in to the computer systems of dozens of diplomats, it emerged today . Ms Bruni, a former supermodel who became President Nicolas Sarkozy’s third wife in 2008, was well  known for taking her clothes off in her early career. This prompted many to open an attachment which turned out to be a ‘Trojan Horse’ with an embedded virus, although all recipients could see were the X-rated photographs. Once accessed, it infected the computers of senior officials as well as forwarding the offensive email on to others. Ms Bruni, a former supermodel who became President Nicolas Sarkozy's third wife in 2008, was well known for taking her clothes off in her early career . ‘Almost everybody who received the email took the bait,’ said a government source in Paris, saying that this included representatives from the Czech Republic, Portugal, Bulgaria, Hungary and Latvia. Mr Sarkozy was first embarrassed by nude pictures of Ms Bruni surfacing shortly after their marriage, while they were staying with the Queen at Windsor Castle during a state visit to Britain. Ms Bruni, who still uses her maiden name in her career as a pop singer, later changed her image from a Paris sex kitten into a demure politician’s wife. The so-called phishing attacks are thought to have originated in China and were aimed at extracting information. The attacks are still being investigated, and nobody is yet sure what information was extracted. America is thought to have been the main target of the scam. Ms Bruni, who still uses her maiden name in her career as a pop singer, later changed her image from a Paris sex kitten into a demure politician’s wife . The cyber attack on the Paris G20 summit took place before the 6th G20 summit in Cannes, in the south of France, which involved heads of government. There have been a number of similar attacks in France, leading the country to be proactive in cyber defence. A recent White Paper on Defence and National Security proclaimed cyber attacks as ‘one of the main threats to the national territory’ and ‘made prevention and reaction to cyber attacks a major priority in the organisation of national security’. The cyber attack on the Paris G20 summit in Paris took place before the 6th G20 summit in Cannes, in the south of France, which involved heads of government . This led to the creation of the French Agency for National Security of Information Systems in 2009. Mr Sarkozy, a conservative, lost the presidential election to the Socialist Francois Hollande in 2012 and is now dealing with a range of corruption charges. Despite all this, his supporters insist he may challenge to become head of state again in 2017. Ms Bruni is continuing with her career as a singer.","Security breach was first discovered at the G20 summit in Paris in 2011 .

"A  leading Labour MP has raised the prospect of cuts to pensioner benefits. Piling pressure on both David Cameron and Ed Miliband to accept reductions in handouts for wealthy pensioners, Dame Anne Begg said it would make sense to reform the welfare system so that more generous benefits are paid to fewer people. Her intervention is significant because Labour politicians tend to defend the principle of universal welfare payments such as winter fuel allowance and other perks such as free bus passes and television licences for the elderly. Reduction: Suggestions are piling pressure on both David Cameron and Ed Miliband to accept reductions in handouts for wealthy pensioners . Changes: Dame Anne Begg Said it would make sense to reform the welfare system . The Prime Minister has ruled out any move to means-test these  benefits before the general election in 2015. But a growing chorus of Tory voices, privately supported by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, and the Liberal Democrats have said it is unfair to cut working-age benefits while rich pensioners continue to get state handouts. Asked if the benefits system should evolve so that more generous payments are paid to fewer people, Dame Anne told the Today programme on Radio 4: ‘Yes. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. The biggest growth in welfare spend is on people who are over pension age. ‘Because of the demographics, there are more of them and they’re living longer, and that’s where a lot of the costs have come in.’ Asked whether cutting pensioner benefits should be on the table to save money and reform the system, Dame Anne, a disability rights  campaigner, said: ‘The problem is in the debate. ‘We forget that the pensioners are part of the welfare system. Pensioners don’t like to think that their state pension is a benefit. But they  are part of the overall cost of the welfare system.’ One third of state spending goes on welfare payments, and around half of that budget goes on pensioners. Dame Anne said: ‘The statistic about one in every three pounds  that the Government spends going on welfare includes all of the  money spent on people over pensionable age.’ Asked whether she would like to see a Labour government limit the scope of pensioner benefits, she said she did not have ‘the seniority’ to ‘be able to make policy’ for the party. But for someone who has campaigned against benefit cuts for some people of working age to even voice the idea that some pensioners should get less suggests a growing consensus that wealthy elderly  people are likely to be targeted after the election.","Piling pressure on both David Cameron and Ed Miliband .

"In a technology-led age the smartphone is considered one of life’s essentials. But the cost of paying for these mini mobile computers is plunging thousands into debt, it has been revealed. The Money Advice Trust (MAT) dealt with 17,766 calls to its National Debtline about telephone debt problems last year. A charity has blamed the rise of pricey smartphones for soaring debt. Pictured: The new iPhone 5s and 5c . This represented a three-fold increase from 2007 – the year the iPhone was launched. The national charity is on course to deal with record calls this year with 13,389 between January and August, a 15 per cent increase on the same period a year ago. Costly: But customers refuse to be put off by price. These people queued for hours for the new iPhone in London's Covent Garden in September last year . And phone debt is the reason behind 11 per cent of all helpline calls, compared to 4 per cent six years ago. According to Ofcom around two-fifths of UK adults own a smartphone. The highest monthly rates for the latest and most expensive iPhones are around £57 and the phones sold on their own can cost more than £500. A family-of-four could easily be paying at least £140 a month for mobiles, more than the average energy bill, said MAT. Chief executive Joanna Elson said: ‘Smartphones have in many ways revolutionised our lives, but we’ve certainly been made to pay for the privilege.’ The advent of the iPhone saw a revolution in high-performing and increasingly expensive phones, which for 42 per cent of people is their sole internet access point. MAT said 15 per cent of those in telephone debt using their advice service owed more than £1,000 on their phone bills. Miss Elson said: ‘Smartphones are sold without contracts for upwards of £500, which would prohibit many from getting one. ‘But with a contract the upfront cost all but disappears, to be replaced by a monthly fee incorporating much of the phone’s usage costs as well. ‘When people fall foul of that fee, they can find themselves with a growing debt problem. The figures suggest this is happening with more people taking out expensive smartphone contracts.’ She said consumers should only take on what they are ‘able to afford’ and creditors have a ‘duty of responsible lending to make sure that borrowers in financial difficulty are treated with understanding and forbearance’.","Money Advice Trust had more than 17,000 calls - threefold rise since 2007 .

"David Cameron's chances of winning significant EU reforms suffered a blow tonight after the new Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker rejected limits on immigration. The nominee to be the next European Commission president met MEPs from Nigel Farage's eurosceptic group in the European Parliament ahead of his coronation next week. Mr Juncker was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the EU. According to UKIP MEPs at the meeting, he replied: 'No.' Mr Juncker also raised the prospect of 'harmonising' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in Westminster. Jean-Claude Juncker was grilled by MEPs from Nigel Farage's group in the European Parliament tonight . William Dartmouth, a Ukip MEP for the South West of England, asked whether Mr Juncker agreed that free movement of people was a founding EU principle and ‘non-negotiable’. He had barely finished asking the question, when Mr Juncker – who earlier joking asked chain-smoking Mr Farage if he could have one of his cigarettes – interjected to say ‘yes’. Mr Farage said afterwards that the exchange would hasten Britain’s exit from Europe. The UKIP leader said: ‘We are very pleased that Mr Juncker chose to come and speak to the most Eurocritical group in the European Parliament which says something about him as a person. ‘We had a polite exchange of views but Mr Juncker made it absolutely clear that on the question of the free movement of peoples across the European Union, there was no question of any negotiation of that position. He showed himself to be completely out of touch by saying migration within the EU was a ‘marginal issue.’ In saying this, he will take the UK closer to the EU exit door.’ The new president faced down a question from an Italian MEP about Europe being undemocratic, claiming ‘there is no such thing as a European people’ and that direct democracy at a European level ‘does not work’. However he did open the door to national governments taking further action to restrict migrants access to benefits saying that abuse of the system of free movement is ‘for nation states to tackle’. Mr Juncker's remarks tonight came after he earlier insisted he would not block British attempts to claw back powers from Brussels - despite his public battle with Mr Cameron for the EU's top job last month. The former Luxembourg Prime Minister insisted he wanted Britain to stay in the EU and said any proposals from Westminster would be 'taken under consideration'. Mr Cameron, who has promised to offer an in-out referendum in 2017 after renegotiating Britain's relationship with Brussels. The Prime Minister last month warned that keeping Britain in the EU had 'got harder' because of Mr Juncker. He described Mr Juncker’s nomination as a 'bad day for the EU' and pledged to wage a 'long, tough fight' to reform Brussels before campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU in the in-out referendum he has promised to hold in 2017. But, speaking to MEPs, Mr Juncker said that he is ready to begin talks with the UK to return 'competences' – EU jargon for powers – back to the UK. In leaked remarks, published in the Telegraph, Mr Juncker told MEPs at a meeting in Brussels: 'I would like Britain to stay as an active constructive member of the European Union. If Britain puts forward a proposal it will be taken under consideration. 'I am not in principle saying that no kind of repatriation can take place. If Westminster wants to recover competences, OK. If the others agree it shall be done.' Mr Juncker insisted he was not a 'federalist' - backing ever closer union between European states - and claimed there was not a single European people . The nominee to become the next European Commission chair was widely described in Westminster as an 'arch federalist' and Brussels insider who was not suitable for the EU's top job . Mr Juncker, who is expected to be confirmed as European commission president during a vote of MEPs on July 15, replacing Jose Manuel Barroso, added: 'I've never opposed the idea of a well-structured, well-organised, profoundly negotiated repatriation of competences from Brussels to national parliaments. 'I don't want the EU without Britain. Britain is an essential element of policy making in Europe because the British are a common sense and down-to-earth people.' Mr Juncker also denied wanting a United States of Europe - despite being widely described in Parliament as an 'arch federalist. The Brrussels insider denied being a federalist in favour of ever-closer EU, according to the Telegraph, telling MEPs: 'I don't think the European Union will become a state. I would fight against that.' But Mr Juncker risked controversy after responding to an attack on Mr Cameron by a Labour MEP with a thumbs up gesture. Glenis Willmott criticised the Prime Minister's 'incompetent' attempt to block him, and added that Labour were working hard to unseat him in next year’s elections.","Proposed new EU chief says he will not block UK bid to claw back powers .

"I was walking down the street in Notting Hill in broad daylight and getting into my car when two Moroccan guys approached me. One of them said he was leaving Britain the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home. I stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took  a picture. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell. Scroll down for video . Politician: George Galloway was left with a broken rib and bruising when he was assaulted by a man in street . He laid into me and was effing and blinding about the Holocaust. He looked like the type who works out and moved very fast. He punched me so many times I kept thinking, ‘When is this going to stop?’ But it didn’t. I went into what  boxers call ‘peekaboo style’ like American heavyweight Floyd Patterson when he fought Muhammad Ali, covering my face and eyes. He got frustrated his punches weren’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb. I lost my footing and staggered backwards, crashing into a grille on a Moroccan delicatessen I had eaten at a few hours earlier. I was on the ground thinking ‘this man is going to kick me to death’. Battered: Mr Galloway, pictured after the assault, said the man moved toward him like 'a bat out of hell' Tweet: The Respect Party tweeted this comment with the above picture of Mr Galloway following the assault . He was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw. I felt a terrible crack and sickening thud. It went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you. Luckily, the two Moroccan guys pulled him off. My attacker calmly walked across the road and I drove up the road behind him. I was in a bad way but I was determined he wouldn’t get away with it. I called 999 and described him to police. He knew I was behind him. I slowed down and the police told  me to stop following him. I pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street. While I was talking to the police, he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop. Scene of the crime: Mr Galloway was attacked in Golborne Road (pictured) in Notting Hill, West London . At this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it. Three were women.  It was like Cagney and Lacey. I shouted, ‘He is getting on the No 23 bus’ and the police drove into the middle of the road to stop it. The policewomen bravely piled on to the bus, and brought a man out with handcuffs on. I have no idea why it happened, though I suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme Right-wing group. Regardless of his motives,  I have no regrets about speaking out on issues like Israel and the Middle East. We live in a democracy, and as someone who has been elected as an MP on six occasions, I have a right to voice my opinions. And like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks, I am entitled to receive a degree of  protection from the State so I can continue to do so. Even though I have just turned 60 years old, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I didn’t land a single blow. But I am not ready to stop fighting for what I believe in yet. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","George Galloway was left with broken rib when he was assaulted in street .

"The number of birds and hedgehogs in the UK has fallen dramatically as a result of climate change and extreme weather, according to a new report. The hedgehog population has dropped from 36million in 1950 to just one million today meaning the species is facing the same rapid decline as the tiger. During the last 50 years numbers of birds have also fallen by 44million. Warmer winters have affected species including hedgehogs and dormice, causing them to come out of hibernation at the wrong time of year. Populations of wildfowl birds including Berwick’s swans, which winter in the UK, have also declined, while the Peak District’s golden plover is vulnerable as warmer conditions reduce the crane flies available for chicks to feed on. In decline: Hedgehog numbers have dropped from 36million in 1950 to just one million today . Thousands of puffins starved to death this year after the coldest March on record for 50 years. A new report by Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) has drawn together the latest evidence to provide information on the impact of climate change on the countryside now and in the future. Many spring events, from frog spawning to leaves appearing on trees, bird eggs hatching and flowers blossoming are happening earlier, with the danger that the life-cycles of dependent species are becoming out of sync, the ‘terrestrial biodiversity climate change impacts report card’ drawn up for the government said. The report also revealed many dragonflies, butterflies and woodlice are moving their ranges north, while new species of insect have colonised the UK from Europe. And mountain plants which are adapted to colder conditions are at risk from a warming climate, as warmth-loving species colonise their habitats in response to higher temperatures. But higher winter temperatures in the past two decades have contributed to higher survival rates among some breeding bird species, the report card said. Climate change is also responsible for new pests and diseases which are having a major impact on the UK’s trees. Too early: Changing temperatures are causing dormice to come out of hibernation at the wrong time . Trees are being hit by dangers such as the oak processionary moth, which can cause breathing problems in people. And the UK’s climate will become more suitable to invasive pests and diseases, including those which have an impact on a wide range of native plant species, the report said. Dr Mike Morecroft, from Natural England, who led the development of the overview, said: ‘This report card shows strong evidence from a large number of different scientific studies that the natural world has started to respond to climate change over the last few decades. ‘It also shows the range and complexity of these changes: some species and habitats are much more sensitive than others. ‘This is a challenge for conservation and we need to adapt our approach to reduce the risks and take advantage of any opportunities. ‘It is also another wake-up call about the seriousness of tackling climate change.’","UK bird numbers have also dropped by 44million in the last 50 years .
