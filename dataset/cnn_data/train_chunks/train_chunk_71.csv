"(CNN) -- Anuradha Koirala is fighting to prevent the trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepal's women and girls. Since 1993, she and her group, Maiti Nepal, have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 victims. Below are her thoughts on being chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero. Q: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Anuradha Koirala: The day I found out that I'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero, I was in Delhi, India. I'd had meetings with Indian and Nepalese government officials, police officers and [nongovernmental organizations] that are partnering with us regarding rescue and repatriation of Nepali girls. I also went to meet Nepali girls at a government remand home in Delhi. We had four girls rescued last week, so I was talking to all the children. The police officers were very positive, but one lawyer was acting very ""smart"" [about not wanting the girls to return home to Nepal]. I said to him: ""We are all working for the benefit of the children. So legal things are one part, but when there are girls, you have to send the girls back to their own country. That is all I want."" So the whole morning and afternoon, I had been fighting. I was very excited and thankful to get the news. I have a big family, about 2,000 children and girls. This was a moment for us to cry, hug and remember how we started, what we have gained and where we are today. Q: What does it mean to you to have been selected by the Blue Ribbon Panel? Koirala: It means they have given priority to this heinous crime against humanity. We have to fight against this crime and protect the children from this. Q: What do you want people to know most about the importance of your work? Koirala: I would like to urge all the human beings around the world: Please close your eyes and imagine these girls are your daughters, and you will feel the pain of being trafficked.","Anuradha Koirala and her group, Maiti Nepal, have helped more than 12,000 escape sex slavery .

"(CNN) -- Japan's Kimiko Date Krumm has failed in her bid to become the oldest-ever winner of a WTA Tour event, losing in the final of the Japan Open to Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn. Date Krumm, who at 40 would have beaten the record set by Billie Jean King who won a tournament in Birmingham, England, aged 39 years, seven months and 23 days, was defeated 7-5 6-7 6-1 in a marathon match lasting over three hours. The Osaka victory gave 33-year-old Tanasugarn her fourth career title, following her victories in 2008 and 2009 at 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands and in 2003 in Hyderabad, India. Date Krumm, who had beaten top seed Samantha Stosur and third seed Shahar Peer en route to the final, told the official WTA Tour website: ""I just tried my best and fought as hard as I could. ""Nobody wants to lose, so I tried everything. Now I will play some ITF events followed by the Asian Games -- so I will be continuing to play tennis for the rest of the year."" Meanwhile, former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic claimed her first title in two years after defeating Patty Schnyder to win the Austrian Open in Linz. The seventh-seeded Serb, who had failed to win a tournament since she triumphed at the same event in 2008, proved a class above the Swiss to claim a 6-1 6-2 win in just 47 minutes. Schnyder has also now gone two years without a tournament victory -- and this defeat means she has now lost three finals in Linz following reverses in 2005 and 2007.","Kimiko Date Krumm fails in her bid to become the oldest winner of a WTA Tour event .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Germany has indefinitely closed off access to the general public to the cupola and the rooftop terrace of the Reichstag parliament building, the parliament's press office said Monday. Accredited groups of visitors can still access the building, as can visitors to the restaurant on the roof. A cupola is a dome-like accent, normally located on the top of a building. The Reichstag cupola is multi-storied providing views of the Berlin landscape and also the main hall of parliament below. The German Bundestag is the only parliament building in the world to house a public restaurant, according to its operators. The press office said access to the building was limited due to security reasons, but did not elaborate. On Saturday, German police denied a news report that said terrorists may have been planning a strike on the parliament building, saying no specific attack threat exists. ""We have no firm lead on a specific location of a potential attack, or names or groups,"" said Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Criminal Police Office. Der Spiegel, a German weekly magazine, reported earlier Saturday that members and associates of al Qaeda were planning an attack on the building in Berlin. The building is a top tourist destination. The magazine did not identify its sources, which reportedly said the group would seek to take hostages. ""What Der Spiegel wrote is to be seen and understood in context with the overall assessment of potential targets being possibly highly symbolic places, buildings, venues,"" said Ziercke. ""We investigate some specific persons, but we cannot yet make connections to specific threats on specific locations or type of attacks. Der Spiegel is speculating."" The magazine reported that information about the planned attack came from a ""jihadist"" who wants to abandon the group. According to the tipster, the terror cell is made up of six people, two of whom are already believed to be in Berlin, Der Spiegel said. Earlier this week, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said concrete evidence had emerged of a possible attack planned in Germany, but he did not offer specifics. The United States issued a general travel alert for Americans in Europe last month amid concerns that al Qaeda or related groups might be planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai.","Der Spiegel reports an attack may have been planned on the Reichstag building .

"(CNN)  -- England striker Wayne Rooney has changed his mind and signed a new five-year contract at English Premier League side Manchester United, the club announced Friday. Rooney said on Wednesday that he wanted to leave the Manchester giants, after complaining they lacked ambition, but has now agreed a deal which ties him to Old Trafford until at least June 2015. The shock development comes after a day of talks Thursday between manager Alex Ferguson, the club's chief executive David Gill and Rooney's representatives. Ferguson, admitted he had been ""shocked and disappointed"" that his star forward wanted to leave the club, but said the club would now ""get behind"" Rooney after his change of heart. How CNN pundit correctly predicted U-turn . Rooney, who has struggled for form this season after lackluster displays for England in their dismal World Cup campaign, explained his jaw-dropping U-turn. ""In the last couple of days, I have talked to the manager and the owners and they have convinced me this is where I belong,"" he told the club's official website. ""I said on Wednesday the manager is a genius and it is his belief and support that have convinced me to stay. ""I'm signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history -- which is the reason I joined the club in the first place."" Ferguson was delighted he had persuaded Rooney to stay after he looked set to exit Old Trafford in the January transfer window. Ferguson shows his genius in Rooney affair . ""Sometimes, when you're in a club, it can be hard to realize just how big it is and it takes something like the events of the last few days to make you understand. I think Wayne now understands what a great club Manchester United is,"" he said. ""I'm pleased he has accepted the challenge to guide the younger players and establish himself as one of United's great players. It shows character and belief in what we stand for. ""I'm sure everyone involved with the club will now get behind Wayne and show him the support he needs to produce the performances we know he is capable of."" United urge fans to be patient over Rooney . Rooney, who injured his troublesome ankle in training Tuesday, will be out of action for up to three weeks, and could make his return against arch-rivals Manchester City. A move to cash-rich City looked the most likely as Rooney decided his future, a prospect which angered fans of the Red Devils who protested outside the striker's Cheshire home on Thursday night. Little did they know that Rooney had changed his mind, after the club had put out a holding statement earlier in the evening, urging fans to show patience. The 24-year-old's original deal was due to run out at the end of next season, but his agent Paul Stretford told United on August 14 that Rooney wanted to leave the club he joined from Everton in 2004. Ferguson eventually broke the news of Rooney's apparent departure only last  Tuesday after intense media speculation.","Wayne Rooney signs new five-year contract at Manchester United .

"London, England (CNN) -- It is one of the most iconic moments in tennis history. A young Pat Cash clambers into the stands at Wimbledon to greet his loved ones after winning the men's singles title. Plenty of players have followed in his footsteps since, snaking their way up to greet their family and friends above the famous SW19 scoreboard, but Cash was the first. And now thanks to CNN, you can put your questions to one of the most recognizable faces in the game. Why not quiz him on why he decided to embark on the 'Cash dash' or the feeling of winning Wimbledon -- the only major he managed to win during his 15-year career? Home hopes distant at U.S. Open . Or maybe you'd like his take on the modern game. Is Roger Federer's crown slipping? Can Rafael Nadal dominate tennis like the Fed Express did before him? When will Andy Murray win a major? And what does he think of state of the women's game ? All you have to do is leave your question at the foot of the page and Cash will reveal all on Friday's 1530 GMT edition of World Sport. Cash turned professional in 1982 and the following year, at just 18, became the youngest player to participate in the Davis Cup final, winning the decisive rubber to secure the title for Australia. At the U.S. Open in 1984, Cash lost in the semifinal to Ivan Lendl after a five-set thriller, on the same day as an epic women's final between Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. With John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors also contesting another five-set classic, it is regarded as one of the greatest days in tennis history and became known as 'Super Saturday.' Cash also made the final of the Australian Open in 1987 but lost to Stefan Edberg in a five-setter, but his moment of destiny was to come at Wimbledon later that year. He knocked out Mats Wilander and Connors en route to the final, where he beat Czech Lendl to seal his first grand slam title, and give birth to that famed celebration. Cash was forced to retire in 1997 through injury but still occasionally turns out on the Champions Tour, as well as commentating on several tournaments throughout the year.","Your chance to quiz 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised South Korea's bid to host the 2022 World Cup on Monday and said that the sport had the power to unite the divided northern and southern halves of the country. The hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be announced by FIFA on 2 December, with Australia, Japan, Qatar and the U.S. also competing to host the 2022 competition. ""There is no doubt that Korea should be ready to organize a good World Cup,"" Blatter told reporters at a joint press conference with South Korean president Lee Myung-Bak in the capital Seoul, after being awarded the country's Order of Merit for Sports. ""Football is more than a game, as it has a socio-cultural impact and can therefore connect people all over the world."" South Korea were joint hosts of the 2002 World Cup with Japan, and the country's team became the first from Asia to reach the semifinals of the tournament that year. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa they reached the last 16 for the first time away from home, while North Korea took part in the event again after a 44-year absence. President Lee agreed with Blatter and said he believed football could bridge the gap between the North and South of the penninsula, which have been separated by a fortified border since conflict ended in a truce in the 1950's. The chairman of the country's bid committee Han Sung-Joo has also expressed his desire for North Korea to be involved in the bid, should it prove successful. ""FIFA and football play a very important role in fostering peace and friendship across the world,"" Lee said. ""Football is the only common link which can unite the people of the two Koreas. Organizing the FIFA World Cup would bring a message of hope and peace not only to the Korean peninsula, but also to the world.""","Sepp Blatter said Korea's bid to host 2022 World Cup could unite the divided North and South parts of the country .

"(CNN) -- Two F-16 fighter jets briefly took to the sky over Washington on Monday after a small passenger aircraft violated the capital's airspace restrictions, according to military officials. A portion of the White House grounds was briefly evacuated during the incident. The passenger plane -- a Cessna 182 -- was intercepted by the F-16s at 2:19 p.m. EST, a statement from the North American Aerospace Defense Command noted. The plane was escorted to an airport in nearby Manassas, Virginia, where it landed at 2:32 p.m. EST.

"(CNN) -- China will host the World Athletics Championships for the first time in 2015, when Beijing will become the fourth Asian city to stage the biennial event. Beijing, which hosted the 2008 Olympic Games, will follow in the footsteps of Japan's Tokyo (1991) and Osaka (2007), and South Korea's Daegu -- which will host next year's 13th edition. ""To help build up our sport and the culture of athletics in a country of 1.6 billion inhabitants is a great opportunity,"" International Association of Athletics Federation president Lamine Diack said in a statement on Saturday. ""As we sometimes say, China is not a country, it's a continent. So this is a fantastic opportunity for our sport and for the sport in China."" China, which hosted the 2006 World Junior Championships in Beijing, has targeted top athletics events since the 1980s. ""This is the most important sporting event for China since the 2008 Olympic Games,"" Beijing's Vice-Mayor Liu Jingmin told the IAAF website. ""We thank you for your trust. We will deliver a high standard event in Beijing which will open a new chapter in the Championships' standards."" Meanwhile, China continued its dominance of the Asian Games it is hosting in Guangzhou on Saturday, extending its gold medal tally to 138. South Korea remained second with 52 golds, while Japan has 29 ahead of Iran on eight and Hong Kong and Thailand (both seven). China completed a clean sweep of the seven table tennis titles, with No. 1 Ma Long coming from behind to beat compatriot and defending champion Wang Hao 9-11 11-8 11-7 11-3 4-11 12-10 in the men's final. Li Xiaoxia won the women's gold, beating her doubles partner and defending champion Guo Yue after saving a match-point in the sixth game. Wang Shixian won the women's badminton singles title in another all-Chinese final, upsetting top-ranked Wang Xin. But China was denied gold in the men's snooker, with Hong Kong's Marco Fu beating two-time defending champion Ding Junhui 4-2 in the final. And its women's football team will not contest Monday's title match after losing 1-0 in the semifinals to Japan, with Shinobu Ohno scoring an extra-time winner.

"(CNN) -- Canada, which is ending its combat mission in Afghanistan in July, on Tuesday announced ""a new role"" to play in the war-torn nation, with a focus on security, diplomacy, human rights and development. ""Building on strengths and accomplishments over the past years, Canada is committed to helping build a more secure, stable and self-sufficient Afghanistan that is no longer a safe haven for terrorists,"" said Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon. The government says the estimated cost from 2011 to 2014 ""is $700 million (US $694.5 million) a year over three years, although final costs will not be known until after 2014."" ""The combat mission will end in 2011,"" Cannon said in a statement. ""As we continue to work alongside the Afghan people and the international community, Canada will continue to play an important role in supporting efforts toward a better future for all Afghans."" Based in the Kandahar area, Canadian forces have been one of the major troop contributors to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. There are more than 2,900 troops at present, ISAF said, and 152 Canadian service members have lost their lives in the conflict, according to a CNN count of the fatalities. After next year and until March 2014, Canadian troops will continue training Afghan security forces and will provide up to 950 military trainers and support personnel. ""Since this mission began, Canada, along with our international partners, has helped to train and mentor about 50,000 Afghan troops. The post-2011 non-combat training mission will further contribute to the goal of preparing Afghans to assume responsibility for their own security,"" said National Defence Minister Peter MacKay. Canadians will work to improve the lives of Afghan women and back the G-8 Initiative on Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. Canada also will help with other humanitarian efforts. ""The future of Afghanistan resides in the hands of women, children and youth,"" said International Cooperation Minister Beverley Oda. ""Thanks in part to our investments, we have achieved significant progress in helping improve life for women and children, but more progress is required, especially in Afghanistan's education and health sectors. Canada will continue to place an important focus on women in its development work in Afghanistan."" Canada also will work in the area of regional diplomacy, continuing its efforts in areas such as border cooperation. ""Canada will continue to facilitate dialogue and advance concrete activities to improve cooperation among the countries in the region, in particular between Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" the government said.

"(CNN) -- AC Milan moved four points clear in Italy's Serie A with a 1-0 win at home to Fiorentina on Saturday night, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic was again the hero. The Sweden forward scored the winning penalty in last weekend's derby clash with Inter, and he settled this match with a spectacular effort in first-half injury-time. He flicked the ball up and hooked it over his shoulder into the far corner to give Milan a ninth win in 13 league games, and put pressure on second-placed Lazio to win at Parma on Sunday. Milan, who travel to French club Auxerre in the Champions League on Tuesday, earlier had the ball in the net through Robinho but the Brazilian forward was ruled offside. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri omitted Ronaldinho from his starting line-up, having been angry that the Brazilian was pictured out partying late at night during the week, but brought him on as a late substitute. Fiorentina stayed in 12th place on 15 points after a sixth defeat this season. Roma claimed third place in the table with a 2-0 win at home to Udinese, despite having Nicolas Burdisso sent off with 10 minutes to play. Young French winger Jeremy Menez gave the capital club a 24th-minute lead with a fine solo effort as he took the ball from just inside the visitors' half, beat two opponents and curled a shot past goalkeeper Samir Handanovic. The 23-year-old then provided Roma's second goal in the 56th minute, finding Marco Borriello inside the penalty area -- and the Italy striker beat the Slovenian at his near post. Roma coach Claudio Ranieri took off both goalscorers with half an hour to play, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit by Bayern Munich. Argentine defender Burdisso was sent off after an altercation in the penalty area, and Udinese's Chile midfielder Alexis Sanchez then hit the post before teammate German Denis had an effort ruled out for offside. The defeat left Udinese in eighth place on 17 points. On Sunday, fourth-placed Napoli host Bologna in the late match, fifth-placed Juventus travel to Genoa in the early kickoff and defending champions Inter visit Chievo.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores winner for leaders AC Milan for second game in a row .

"Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki is the new women's world number one after reaching the quarterfinals of the China Open. The 20-year-old overtook Serena Williams in the WTA world rankings following her comfortable 6-3 6-2 success over Czech Petra Kvitova on Thursday. The top seed knew that reaching the last eight in Berlin would ensure she becomes the first Dane to top the world rankings when the new list is released on Monday. Williams missed the tournament because of the foot injury she suffered following her fourth Wimbledon victory in July.

"(CNN) -- A Stone Age door in ""exceptional condition"" has been found in the heart of the Swiss city of Zurich, a city official said Friday. The artifact -- thought to be more than 5,000 years old -- was recovered during an archaeological excavation before the construction of a parking lot for the Zurich Opera. ""It is one of the oldest doors ever found in Europe,"" said Niels Bleicher, Zurich Monument Preservation Department's chief scientist. He said the door remains on the ground and workers will try to pull it up next week. It will then be stabilized, preserved, and probably put into a museum, he said. Bleicher said the door, about 1.5 meters high, hails from the Horgen archaeological culture and dates to the late 4th millennium B.C. ""It is made from poplar wood. The technique and design are solid,"" he said. ""The door is in an exceptional condition. Even the wooden handles are preserved.""","It's possibly one of the oldest doors found in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Punctuating the scenes of heroic rescue and devastating death in Haiti is another drama: moments of connection. A man in Haiti identifies a woman he sees on the street as the missing person whose photo is posted on CNN's iReport. A husband reels off the names of missing college students and a stranger hundreds of miles away confirms they are safe. It is a scenario being played out again and again. Somehow, desperate pleas relayed mouth-to-mouth, through the Internet, on television and in text messages become fodder for celebration with the confirmation: They're alive. iReporter Wolin Delerme sent in a frantic video about her sister who had left for Haiti on Monday, a day before the 7.0-magnitude quake struck. Minutes after her plea aired on CNN, a man in Haiti contacted her. ""He saw my sister not too far from where he's standing,"" Delerme said. Watch Delerme describe the amazing connection with her missing sister . Choking back tears, she said, ""I am very overwhelmed, and full of joy in my heart. There's just no words that can explain it. I am just so happy."" She has since spoken with her sister. Kristy Springer sought information on her mother and several church members who were in Haiti on a missionary trip. ""I am here waiting for you mom. You need to be OK,"" Springer told iReport. Her mother sent a text message at 1:30 a.m. Thursday. Everyone was ""at least safe for now."" See how Springer found her mom . iReporter Darius Hyworon found similar good news. His wife, Mariah Levin, was with a group of Tufts University students in Haiti at the time. In the quake's aftermath, he scrambled to learn their fate. The U.S. Embassy was able to tell him everyone is OK. Read Hyworon's words of thanks . ""Thank you for those who helped in the effort,"" he said. ""Please pray for the millions of people who are affected by this tragedy."" iReport: Are you looking for loved ones? Much of Haiti's infrastructure crumbled during the quake, knocking out power and other communication networks, further hampering people's efforts to get word of missing relatives and friends. Mark Frohardt is heading to Haiti with two ""radio suitcases,"" mobile communication devices with a range of about 30 miles that can tap into radio waves. A veteran of disaster efforts in the 2004 tsunami and the 2008 Pakistan quake, Frohardt hopes to disseminate critical information about humanitarian efforts over the radio in Haiti. As of Friday, 13 radio stations were up and running. ""Part of that is 'family tracing,' "" he said, ""working with organizations and radio stations on getting the word out -- who's alive and getting messages back to loved ones."" iReport: I'm alive -- messages from Haiti . There is no confirmed death toll from the earthquake. Bodies litter the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and barely functioning clinics are overwhelmed with injured. Survivors wander the streets. For loved ones seeking information on the missing, the wait is anguishing. Sometimes the answers that come are not reliable. Len Gengel and his wife have endured a parent's worst nightmare. Their daughter Brittany was visiting Haiti with a group of students from Lynn University in Florida. The parents were initially told their daughter survived. Upon reaching South Florida for what they thought was going to be a reunion, the parents learned the original information was wrong. Brittany was still missing, along with three other students and two professors. On Monday, Gengel spoke to Kenneth Merten, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti, on CNN ""We need American soldiers up there rescuing our children now,"" Gengel said. ""Time is of the essence. I beg you."" Merten said he would do all he could. Read an iReporter's list of people reported to be safe . The International Committee of the Red Cross has set up a Web site for people trying to find information on the fate of relatives in Haiti. However, inside Haiti, the Red Cross has not been able to collect and publish identities and whereabouts of survivors. Frohardt, a vice president for Internews Network, hopes to help change that. ""The focus,"" he says, is ""connecting the community so they know where all their loved ones are.""","Family connections are sometimes made with breathtaking speed .

"(CNN) -- World number two Novak Djokovic continued his impressive form with a straight-sets victory over Ivan Ljubicic on Wednesday, sealing a 6-3 6-3 success at the Shanghai Masters in China. The Serb defeated his opponent in 81 minutes, and was rarely threatened en route to his 50th win of the season. The second seed said he is feeling confident and full of energy at the moment, speaking to the official ATP website, Djokovic said: ""I definitely am satisfied with the performance, satisfied with my game, physical state [and] my condition. ""I'm playing well, moving well, motivated mentally, and full of energy. I'm hoping that it's going to stay that way.""

"Editor's Note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is VICE's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Four Corners region of U.S. (VBS.TV)  -- Earlier this fall, VBS.TV went to the Four Corners region of the United States to hang out with indigenous cowboys of the Navajo (Diné) tribe. These riders were all from the Triple B Association -- a bronc-riding, bull-riding and barrel-racing league catering to the Native American community of the U.S. Southwest. Given the difficult economic circumstances under which most of these cowboys and their families live, it's an unusual portrait of Americana in the 21st century. Early this year, it was reported that more than 56 percent of Navajos live below the poverty line, one of the highest rates in the U.S., even among the traditionally marginalized indigenous communities. Add to that a frightening unemployment rate climbing above 50 percent --disconcertingly higher than the national rate, which hovers around 9.5 percent --and the picture is extremely bleak. Many of these families throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado also lack electricity, running water or telephones. Still, theirs is a spiritually rich culture, based on family-operated, small-scale farming and ranching. See more of this story at VBS.TV. Though the professional rodeo circuit offers a slight opportunity for some of the best riders, by and large members of this community are relegated to the Navajo league. The best many can hope for is a berth at the Indian National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nevada, each year. The winnings are not high and neither is the exposure compared with many of the larger stadium rodeo events. Triple B, like several other rodeo associations, provides young riders with an opportunity to sign up and compete against each other from March to November each year. The cost to enter can be high, and if you don't win, you have to find a way home, struggle to get back in the circuit in upcoming weeks and somehow find the resources to feed the livestock that await back home. The Navajo riders have managed to get a degree of mainstream exposure over the years, mostly because bull and bronc riding are becoming a big-bucks industry elsewhere in the U.S. Over the course of a week, we tailed several of the group's riders all across the region, accompanying them during training and traveling with them to and from assorted events. Over that time, we came to know their families, witnessing as they coped with personal struggles and sharing in occasional successes.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Four English football fans were attacked in Italy on the eve of a game Thursday between Liverpool and Naples, Naples police told CNN. Two were stabbed and have been hospitalized with serious but not life-threatening conditions, police said. Two were beaten with sticks and one is hospitalized in serious condition, they said. The other one, who was attacked in a different incident, is not badly hurt. Three men have been arrested. Police blamed the attacks on ""football fanaticism"" and are looking for the other attackers, they said. An Italian restaurant owner also was attacked Wednesday night after confronting masked men who were harassing British tourists eating in his restaurant, police said Thursday. Tempers already were running high in Naples because tons of uncollected garbage is piling up, a result of landfills in the region being full. Police said security for Thursday's match pitting Liverpool against Serie A side Napoli is tighter than usual because of the garbage crisis.

"(CNN) -- AC Milan reclaimed second place in Italy's Serie A with a tempestuous 2-1 victory at Napoli on Monday night which saw the home side reduced to 10 men for half the game before a near-brawl erupted late in the match. Milan reduced Lazio's lead to two points after eight rounds thanks to a goal in each half from forwards Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, putting Massimiliano Allegri's team two clear of third-placed city rivals Inter. Napoli, who were left in sixth place, had midfielder Michele Pazienza sent off in first-half injury-time for a second handball offense but managed to reduce the deficit with 12 minutes to play with an ingenious effort from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi. Milan went into the match hoping to capitalize on defending champions Inter's 1-1 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday, and made the perfect start when Robinho opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. The Brazil star, starting in place of injured compatriot Ronaldinho, calmly sidefooted home a left-foot shot from the edge of the area following a fine cutback from substitute Massimo Oddo. Oddo, who came on for defender Luca Antonini, had found space down the right with Napoli down to 10 men as Christian Maggio received treatment for a head injury suffered in the collision that saw the Milan player leave the field 10 minutes earlier. Maggio was then replaced by Algeria international Hassan Yebda, and matters got worse for Napoli when Pazienza was sent off in the first minute of time added on. However, Lavezzi almost equalized before the halftime whistle blew with a superb header that required a flying save from Milan keeper Christian Abbiati. Abbiati was again called into action on the hour mark when he denied a fierce effort from Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik as Napoli continued to press forward, but Ibrahimovic made it 2-0 in the 71st minute with his third league goal since returning to Serie A from Barcelona. The Sweden striker bulleted in a powerful header from another Oddo cross that keeper Morgan De Sanctis could only deflect into his net. But Napoli hit back seven minutes later when Lavezzi picked himself off the floor following a goalmouth scramble to scoop a delightful flick over Abbiati and in off the crossbar. Tensions boiled over in the 83rd minute when Salvatore Aronica appeared to catch Robinho in the face with a flying arm, resulting in Kevin Prince-Boateng racing in with a rash challenge on the Napoli midfielder before confronting him. Aronica and the Ghana midfielder were both booked along with Napoli's Argentine defender Hugo Campagnaro as players piled in from both sides, including Ibrahimovic -- who appeared to be sent off after encroaching on the pitch following his earlier substitution. Napoli forced two corners in the five minutes of time added on but could not level despite De Sanctis joining in the attacks, giving Milan a morale-boosting win ahead of this weekend's clash with fifth-placed Juventus. Meanwhile, promoted Real Sociedad moved up to 11th place in Spain's La Liga after a 3-0 win at home to struggling Deportivo La Coruna on Monday night. Striker Joseba Llorente opened the scoring in the 17th minute from from Alberto de la Bella's cross, and 19-year-old French winger Antoine Griezmann made it 2-0 with 20 minutes to play with a second headed strike before a bizarre celebration which saw him jump behind the wheel of a car parked on the side of the pitch. Striker Imanol Agirretxe sealed the victory in the 86th minute after being set free by fellow substitute Jeffrey Sarpong to leave 1999-2000 Spanish champions Deportivo languishing second from bottom in the table.","AC Milan move above city rivals Inter with a 2-1 win at 10-man Napoli .

"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Getting a 4-year-old to eat his lunch of pizza and applesauce on a recent Saturday afternoon wasn't exactly what Sam and Diane McMutrie thought they'd be doing after their three kids grew up. The couple, in their 50s, are raising Fredo after his birth mother in Haiti gave him to an orphanage. ""In so many ways he's changed us,"" said Diane McMutrie. ""I'm glad that he's here, I'm glad that we can make a difference in his life."" ""He makes us smile everyday, he makes us laugh, he says the cutest things and he's just now the love of our life."" Fredo arrived in Pittsburgh six months ago -- just a week after the January 12 earthquake devastated his home country and destroyed his orphanage. The McMutries' daughters played a key role in getting Fredo out of Haiti and into their parents' lives. About two years ago, daughters Jamie, 30, and Ali, 22, were working at an orphanage in Haiti when they called with an unusual request: They wanted to know if their parents would be willing to adopt Fredo. It was the beginning of a long process -- and the McMutries didn't go into it with any illusions. ""I don't consider ourselves special,"" said Sam McMutrie. ""We just happen to be adopting a Haitian boy who our daughters love and thought it would be great for us."" Sam McMutrie admitted he needed some convincing, but in the end, both he and Diane knew what they were getting into. ""It changes your life, just like when you're first married,"" he said. ""It's an adjustment, but it's an adjustment you make that's important."" He and Diane, who have been married for 33 years, look at their grown children as examples of how to live life with passion. Jamie started traveling to Haiti to volunteer in 2002 and in 2006 the two sisters moved to the island nation to work at Brebis de Saint-Michel de L'Attalaye (BRESMA) orphanage in Port-au-Prince. ""My kids have taught us about what it means to sacrifice and help someone because that's what you're supposed to do,"" said Sam McMutrie. ""To live your dream means more than anything to me. I'm so thankful that we allowed them to do what they wanted to do."" After the earthquake ravaged Haiti's capital and damaged the BRESMA orphanage beyond repair, Jamie and Ali had 54 kids with nowhere to go. They refused to leave Haiti without the children in their care. Back in Pennsylvania, the McMutries and their son, Chad, 27, started calling local politicians pleading for a humanitarian waiver that would allow the children to come to the United States and be placed with other families across the country. A week after the earthquake, their calls were answered. Jamie, Ali, and the 54 kids from the orphanage flew to Pittsburgh on a trip organized by Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and U.S. Rep. Jason Altmire. Among those children, was their new little brother, Fredo. ""We are so excited about our parents' adoption, we really couldn't be happier,"" Jamie wrote CNN in an e-mail from Haiti. ""Actually getting to be with Fredo and watch him grow and develop, and seeing the love and happiness he has brought to our whole family is so special for us. Our parents are completely in love with him, and he's the best little brother in the world."" The other kids from the orphanage, like Fredo, have been matched with families across the United States and most are in the process of being adopted. Jamie and Ali have since started their own nonprofit organization, Haitian Orphan Rescue, in hopes of building a new orphanage. The McMutries, who had expected Fredo to arrive later this year, are still working out the details of the adoption process. That doesn't mean he won't be able to keep his ties to his family in Haiti, they said. ""We already told his mom that when he's old enough and if he wants to go back to Haiti, that we would not hold onto him,"" Diane McMutrie said. ""We'll do what we can for him and then when the time comes, we'll let him make his decisions."" Fredo now speaks English and has recently begun talking about Haiti and the earthquake. ""It just happened one day when we were in the car,"" said Diane. ""I am so glad he's starting to get it out. He's young enough to be traumatized, but also young enough to work through it.""","Two years ago, Diane and Sam McMutrie decided to adopt 4-year-old Fredo from Haiti .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota Motors said Wednesday it's halting shipments to Iran following international moves to put financial and commercial pressure on Tehran to curb its nuclear ambitions. ""It is true that Toyota has stopped exports of vehicles bound for Iran,"" Toyota spokesman Keisuke Kirimoto said in Tokyo. The company says the hold on shipments of its popular Land Cruiser, and other cars and trucks is indefinite at this point. ""We plan to continue to closely monitor this sensitive international situation,"" Kirimoto said. The world's largest automaker made the move in light of U.S. and United Nations sanctions slapped on Tehran in June. The move is largely symbolic. Toyota exported just 222 vehicles to Iran through May of this year, and a similar number in all of 2009. Toyota doesn't have any factories in Iran, and says it stopped shipping vehicles to its Iranian-owned distributor there in June. That move coincided with the United Nations Security Council decision that same month to impose more sanctions on Iran. That package included measures to restrict financial transactions and tighten an existing arms embargo. Iran has consistently denied U.S. and other international claims that its atomic energy program is aimed at producing nuclear weapons.","The company says the hold is indefinite at this point .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has successfully test-fired a new version of its Fateh missile, which has a longer range than previous models, Iranian news agencies reported Wednesday. The Fateh-110 was designed by Iranian scientists and is also more accurate than older versions, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, Iran's defense minister, told state-run Press TV and the semi-official Fars news agency. It wasn't immediately clear whether the Fateh-110 is a short- or medium-range missile. Press TV reported it is 9 meters (29.5 feet) long and weighs 3,500 kilograms (7,716 pounds). Vahidi claimed that the production of the missile was ""another victory in the field of defense and technology, and was another example of busting the sanctions and getting rid of them,"" Fars quoted him as saying. He also denied that Iran's implementation of the Fateh missile was linked to the recent purchase of U.S.-made Patriot missiles by Kuwait, according to Fars. ""Kuwait is not a threat to us because we have friendly relations with Kuwait ... however, there was no need to have that system (Patriot) in Kuwait,"" the minister said. The test-firing of the missile came days after Iran unveiled the first long-range military drone manufactured in the country, state media reported. On Saturday Iran also began fueling its first nuclear energy plant in the southern city of Bushehr, according to the nation's state media. Press TV said the effort would help the country create nuclear-generated electricity. But some Western nations have questioned whether the nuclear fuel will be used solely for electricity, suggesting that Iran would eventually try to enrich uranium on its own, providing material for nuclear weapons. The United States has questioned Iran's motives in continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. The five permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany offered Iran a deal last October: send the low-level uranium out of the country to be enriched elsewhere in exchange for fuel for its reactor. Tehran did not accept and instead made a counteroffer: make the swap a simultaneous one and carry it out on Iranian soil. The U.S. State Department called the Iranian proposal a stalling tactic and said world powers would not ""front"" the fuel to Iran. A stalemate ensued. The United States is now seeking support for expanded sanctions, saying Iran is unlikely to negotiate unless sanctions are in place. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","The new version of the Fateh missile has a longer range, Iranian news outlets say .

"(CNN) -- France have secured their place in the Davis Cup final after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in their semi-final against Argentina in Lyon on Saturday. The win came courtesy of Michael Llodra and Arnaud Clement who defeated U.S. Open semi-finalists Horacio Zeballos and Eduardo Schwank 6-4 7-5 6-3 in two hours and 28 minutes. France were 2-0 ahead overnight thanks to singles wins by Llodra who defeated Juan Monaco, and by Gael Monfils overcame David Nalbandian in four sets. The nine-time winners haven't been in a Davis Cup final since 2002. ""I am very excited and I am very, very happy because the crowd was unbelievable,"" France's team captain Guy Forget said, DavisCup.com reported. ""The emotions are here, the spirit is here, the quality of the players is unbelievable. I am so proud to lead a team like this one. They have gone through a lot of things together... They struggled a bit last year but to see them on the court celebrating emotionally is very strong,"" Forget added, DavisCup.com reported. But Argentina's captain Tito Vasquez was stunned by the defeat. ""I never thought the result would be so bad. We always thought we could win it,"" Vasquez said, AFP reported. France will face either last year's runners-up Czech Republic or Serbia -- who have yet to reach a Davis Cup final -- in December's final. The Czechs are 2-1 ahead after Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek defeated U.S. Open runner-up Novak Djokovic and partner Nenad Zimonjic 3-6 6-1 6-4 6-1. But there is all to play for on Sunday. Djokovic is favorite to beat Berdych in the first reverse singles.

"(CNN) -- Arjun Atwal's narrow victory at the Wyndham Championship secured a slice of golfing history as he became the first Indian-born player to win on the PGA tour. The 37-year-old from Calcutta sank an eight foot par putt on the final hole to win by a shot from American David Toms, and become the first qualifier to triumph on the Tour in 24 years. Atwal lost his Tour card in July but shot a final round 67 at Sedgefield Country Club to finish on 20-under-par and scoop the top prize of $918,000. ""I told my caddie, 'We've got nothing to lose this week. Just go out there and try and win it',"" Atwal told the official PGA Tour website. ""Guys are going to be out there trying to secure their FedExCup spots or whatever. We've got nothing. I don't have a card. I don't have anything. Just go out there and free-wheel it, and that's what I did this week. ""I'm pretty sure it's going to be huge back home,"" Atwal added. ""My in-laws called my wife Saturday and said the coverage was just unreal with me leading. I know there were a lot of people in India and Dubai that watched me play. I've had a lot of messages."" Atwal started the final round three shots clear of the chasing pack but his lead was gradually whittled away until he was briefly locked in a seven-way tie. But a vital birdie at the 16th saw him regain control. He then recorded par on the final hole by firing his second shot towards the spectators' tent at the back of the green, taking a free drop and getting up and down in two for the win. His victory gives him a two year Tour exemption and a place at the 2011 Masters at Augusta. ""That was huge,"" Atwal said after his landmark victory. ""I was really nervous over that [last] putt. My heart rate was probably 150."" Atwal used to be a practice partner for world number one Tiger Woods but lost his Tour card last month after slipping too far down the money list when his minor medical exemption ran out. Three years ago Atwal was questioned over an incident in which the driver of a car who was allegedly trying to race him down an Orlando street crashed and died. He was cleared of any wrongdoing after a year-long investigation. Atwal has won on the European, Asian and Nationwide tours, but his first PGA victory was warmly greeted back in his home country. ""I am delighted that Atwal has this great victory on the PGA Tour,"" Sports Minister Manohar Singh Gill said in a statement carried by AFP.

"(CNN) -- Sevilla moved into sixth in La Liga after beating ten-man Valencia 2-0 at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Spain. Goals from Alvaro Negredo and Alejandro Alfaro sealed victory for the hosts -- a task that was made much easier when Valencia midfielder Mehmet Topal was shown a straight red card. Sevilla's fifth win of the season took them above Real Sociedad and into the European places on 17 points, nine behind leaders Real Madrid. Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano wasted two good early openings for the home side while at the other end Juan Manuel Mata forced Javi Varas into a smart save. But the game turned on 25 minutes when Mehmet Topal flew into a challenge on Martín Cáceres and got his marching orders. The ten men of Valencia held on until halftime despite almost constant Sevilla pressure, but the deadlock was finally broken on 54 minutes. Negredo found the bottom corner of the net with a left footed shot from a tight angle after a quick counter attack. Minutes after that Fabiano hit the bar before Negredo headed wide from inside the area. But it was 2-0 on 77 minutes when Alfaro headed home Mouhamadou Dabo's cross from close range. There was still time for Diego Capel to hit the post with a fierce shot in stoppage time as Sevilla completed a comfortable win.","Sevilla beat Valencia 2-0 to go sixth in the Spanish Liga .

"(CNN) -- Scotland's Andy Murray will face Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masters on Sunday after both men eased past their semi-final opponents in straight sets on Saturday. World number four Murray powered past Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in 85 minutes at the Qi Zhong center to reach his second straight final at a Masters 1000 event. Murray broke Monaco's serve early in the first set to open up a two game lead, but the South American refused to lie down, and when Murray double-faulted to squander his service game in the ninth game, it looked as though the Scot might drop his first set of the tournament. But the 23-year-old didn't panic and broke back instantly to secure the opening set 6-4. It was one-way traffic from there on in as Murray broke the South American's serve twice to comfortably secure his passage to the final. ""In each match I felt better. I feel like I move well on these courts and I can still get my serve through the court to get enough free points, Murray said after the match, AFP reported. Murray, who is looking for his second title of the season will face Roger Federer in the final after he beat Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4 in the second semi-final. The record-breaking Swiss produced some vintage form to overcome Djokovic, who beat Federer in the semi-final at the U.S. Open last month. But it wasn't easy going for the former world number one as he took just over an hour to secure the first set. Federer had to save four break points in the fourth game to square up the set 2-2. And it wasn't until the 11th game that the Swiss was finally able to break the Serb's serve. Federer served out the first set and rammed home his advantage with an early break in the second, which was quickly followed by another. Djokovic claimed one of the breaks back but couldn't stop Federer reaching his fourth final of the season. Sunday's final is a repeat of the previous Masters event in Toronto in August. Murray won that encounter and currently holds a 7-5 career lead over the 16-time grand slam champion.

"(CNN) -- He was compared to a computer game machine by the man whose dreams of European glory he destroyed, but Lionel Messi's coach preferred to focus on his human qualities. Messi underlined his status as the world's best soccer player on Tuesday night with a stunning four-goal display that put his Spanish club Barcelona into the semifinals of Europe's premier club competition, the Champions League. The 22-year-old took his goal tally for the season to a staggering 39 as he netted a hat-trick in the first half against English side Arsenal, his fourth treble this season. Blog: Is Messi better than Maradona? The Argentina international became only the sixth player in the competition's history to score four in a game, and the first this season. He equaled former Brazil star Rivaldo with a record 25 career goals in the tournament. He has already scored one more goal than he did last season -- in eight fewer games, with a possible 11 still to play. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left in no doubt about Messi's seemingly superhuman abilities. ""He's like a PlayStation,"" the Frenchman told reporters. ""I think he can take advantage of every mistake you make. ""He is very young, but can achieve a lot -- I don't know how many players in the world could score that fourth goal he scored. It looks impossible, but he makes it possible. ""Messi has something exceptional and is in his prime. This boy now has six or seven years in front of him and if nothing happens to him he can reach unbelievable levels."" Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said that Messi's greatest quality is his humble character. ""The good thing is about Messi is that tomorrow he will get up and look for the affection of his people and his team-mates,"" Guardiola said of the young man who has overtaken David Beckham at the top of football's rich list. ""I like the love he has for football and his anonymous character. Leo was brilliant and he was decisive tonight. It is not something you can describe because you have to see it to believe it."" Messi himself was typically understated in his summation of the match, which saw Barcelona win 4-1 for a 6-3 aggregate victory. ""We are happy to go through tonight, but we have to keep going,"" he said. Barcelona will continue the defense of their European title in the semifinals against Italian champions Inter Milan, who progressed with a 1-0 win away to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday to defeat the Russians 2-0 on aggregate.

In a statement issued Saturday, Obama praised China's decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate, which officials hope will help balance China's trade deficit with the United States and Europe. ""China's decision to increase the flexibility ... is a constructive step that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy,"" the president said in the statement. ""I look forward to discussing these and other issues at the G-20 Summit in Toronto next weekend,"" he said. Will currency move help U.S.-China relations? China's official Xinhua news agency said The People's Bank of China -- China's central bank -- announced Saturday it would push further its rate reform to make the the yuan, also known as the renminbi, more flexible. The move could appease international criticism against China's weak exchange rate, which has created trade imbalances between Western nations and China. ""The decision was made in view of the recent economic situation and financial market developments at home and abroad, and the balance of payments (BOP) situation in China,"" Xinhua quoted the Central Bank's spokesperson. ""The stability of the RMB (renminbi) exchange rate has played an important role in mitigating the crisis' impact, contributing significantly to Asian and global recovery, and demonstrating China's efforts in promoting global rebalancing,"" he said. The International Monetary Fund's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, released a statement on China's move, which he described as a ""welcome development."" ""A stronger renminbi is in line with findings of the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process, to be presented in Toronto next week, and will help increase Chinese household income and provide the incentives necessary to reorient investment toward industries that serve the Chinese consumer,"" he said. China's move comes ahead of the Group of 20 and the Group of 8 meetings in Canada's Province of Ontario scheduled next week, with finance ministers and central bank governors of major trading powers will discuss trade issues and the world financial crisis. Representatives of several industrialized nations including India, Brazil, the United States and European countries have previously asked China to allow its currency to float.","China's central bank announced Saturday it will allow currency to float .

"(CNN)  -- Former world number one Ana Ivanovic has climbed to a year high of 26th in the rankings after breaking her WTA Tour title drought. The Serb ended a run of two years without a winner's trophy on Sunday, defeating Patty Schnyder in straight sets in the final of the Generali Ladies Linz tournament in Austria. Ivanovic -- who was a last-minute replacement in the draw for the injured Serena Williams -- took just 47 minutes to dispose of her Swiss opponent 6-1 6-2. It was her second success at the hard-court event, with her win there in 2008 her last on the women's singles circuit. ""It's just amazing how some things turn out. This is my first title since I won here in 2008, so it's very special. I feel very good here and am really happy to have come back this week,"" the 2008 French Open champion told the official WTA website after claiming her ninth career title. Since rising to the top of the world rankings in 2008, the 22-year-old has suffered a dip in form due to illness and injury that has seen her fall to as low as 65 in the world earlier this year. But seeded seventh in Austria, Ivanovic did not drop a set all week and Schnyder was unable to provide much of a challenge to the rejuvenated champion in the final. ""I had confidence from my last few matches and that helped me stay aggressive today. I took a lot of risks and stepped in a lot,"" she said. ""I believed in my shots and made them count, and I'm very pleased with that.""","Ana Ivanovic won her first title for two years in Linz, Austria on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki remained on track for a first grand slam singles title after a straight sets win over Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova saw the Dane progress to the semifinals of the U.S. Open. Wozniacki got the better of another night of windy conditions at Flushing Meadows, dominating her 21-year-old opponent to win 6-2 7-5. Last year's runner up in New York made just 18 unforced errors in the match, compared to 43 from 45th ranked Cibulkova who also struggled to hold serve on the Arthur Ashe court. ""It felt like playing in a hurricane,"" world number two Wozniacki told the official U.S. Open website. ""But it was the same for both players and I was happy to get through."" Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open . The 20-year-old will now face Vera Zvonareva in Friday's semifinal, after the Russian beat Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-3 7-5. ""She's playing aggressively so it's going to be a really tough match,"" Wozniacki, who could reclaim her world number one title from the injured Serena Williams should she lift the title in New York, said of her semifinal opponent. ""She's a great player. I'm going to go out there and do my best."" Zvonareva will be playing in the U.S. Open semifinals for the first time after her straight sets win over 31st seed Kanepi. The seventh seed got to grips with the wind much better than 25-year-old Kanepi, who racked up a total of 60 unforced errors over the course of the match. ""I don't think she was just making errors for no reason,"" Zvonareva, who is yet to drop a set during  the tournament, told the official U.S. Open website. ""I think I was making it difficult for her."" The result also means 26-year-old Zvonareva has now reached the last four in two successive grand slams, following her run to the Wimbledon final in June. Meanwhile, in the other half of the draw defending champion Kim Clijsters came through a tough three-set quarterfinal to set up a last-four clash with former winner Venus Williams. The Belgian second seed battled past Australian Sam Stosur 6-4 5-7 6-3, while third seed Williams overcame Italy's Francesca Schiavone 7-6 6-4 to book her place in the semifinal. The pair will meet for the 13th time in their careers in Friday's semifinal, with their head-to-head tied at 6-6. They are both chasing their third titles at Flushing meadows.","Top seed Caroline Wozniacki progressed to the semifinal of the U.S. Open with 6-2 7-5 win over Dominika Cibulkova .

"(CNN) -- France must pull its troops from Afghanistan if it wants to ensure the well-being of five French nationals taken hostage in Niger, the head of al Qaeda's north African wing said. ""If you want safety for your citizens who are held captive by us, then you must move quickly to take your soldiers out of Afghanistan according to a specific time table that you announce officially,"" said Abu Musab Abdul-Wadud, the head of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in an audio message broadcast on Al-Jazeera television Wednesday. The group has said it is responsible for the five French citizens who were kidnapped in September. The five were among seven people linked to a French nuclear energy company who were abducted in the northern town of Arlit in Niger. The other two are from Togo and Madagascar. Areva has been mining uranium for decades in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world. In a televised interview with reporters Tuesday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged citizens not to visit areas where al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghrib operates. ""The situation on the terrorism front is troubling. I do not want to alarm the French,"" he said. ""But, we will not change even an iota of our policies because we are threatened."" France has already said it may begin to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan next year. Minister Herve Morin told French radio station RTL in late October that France will begin to transfer the control of certain districts to Afghans in 2011. ""There is a fixed date by NATO in the framework of its new strategy. That is the start of 2011,"" he said. ""In 2011, we are going to transfer a whole series of districts to the Afghans."" ""At this moment, there could be the first movements or withdrawal of allied forces from Afghanistan,"" Morin said. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force.","NEW: We will not change our policies because of threats, Sarkozy says .

"(EW.com) -- ""Going the Distance"" is a light and tasty morsel of a romantic comedy in which two smart, funny, and basically sweet people try to conduct a cross-country relationship. The movie, which sounds like it was spun out of an advice column, is very high-concept, except that it has a gently authentic tone, a flavor rooted in its affection for the shrewd innocence of the 1980s. For the first 15 minutes or so, I actually wondered if it was set in the '80s. Erin (Drew Barrymore), who's 31, is finishing up her internship at a bustling newspaper, The New York Sentinel, and would do anything to land a job there. (I don't know too many 31-year-olds these days who even read newspapers, let alone dream of working at one.) Garrett (Justin Long), an easy-come-easy-go womanizer, works for a medium-size New York record label, and what he does there sounds a lot like being an A&R guy -- a job that may be even more tied to a bygone era than newspaper reporter. The two meet at a quiet, homey bar that, miraculously, doesn't have a blaring sports TV, and they proceed to bond over a round of the classic videogame Centipede. That night, back at Garrett's apartment, they confess their mutual passion for ""Top Gun,"" and Garrett's roommate (Charlie Day), a scruffy loser who is listening to their every move, blasts the film's immortal Wagnerian-sap power ballad, ''Take My Breath Away,'' as they approach their first kiss. It's funny, in a hot-tub-time-machine sort of way. After two love montages set to the Cure's ''Just Like Heaven'' and the Pretenders' ''Don't Get Me Wrong,'' I began to think: Between this feel-good '80s jukebox and the fact that no one in the film has yet sent a text message, which year is this? As it turns out, ""Going the Distance"" is quite contemporary, but the wistful retro vibe is no accident. The director, Nanette Burstein, is a veteran of documentaries (she made American Teen and codirected The Kid Stays in the Picture), and here, making a major gear shift to mainstream Hollywood comedy, she's out to take us back to an earlier vibe -- to a time when pop music was optimistic, and so were movie romances. Erin and Garrett don't just fall into glorified lust. They fall in love because they like each other's company, and Barrymore and Long have just the right sort of chemistry; they act out the rhythms of companionship. ""Going the Distance"" is mercifully free of the Styrofoam plot twists that drive most romantic comedies, but it substitutes a development that, by comparison, may seem borderline inconsequential. Erin is set to go to grad school at Stanford, and she and Garrett know they're going to be together only for six weeks. Once she moves to the Bay Area, though, they realize they want to keep it going. And so they have to fly back and forth. And they're frustrated. And horny. And jealous. (Each has a workmate flirt buddy.) Gee, what do you think they should do? The script, by Geoff LaTulippe, is full of lines that pop. And Long, who's always had a unique -- and, to me, not entirely appealing -- way of making floppy-haired boyishness reptilian, comes alive as a movie star for perhaps the first time. He plays Garrett as the kind of guy who uses his wit as an antenna for connectivity. Burstein, as a director, is drawn to the Apatow school of humane obscenity. ""Going the Distance"" is filled with raunch -- a lot of it, delightfully, delivered by Barrymore's Erin (she does a great, original bit about receiving oral sex). But none of it is shock humor. This is comedy that catches the casual dirtiness of how men and women really talk. The blue dialogue liberates Barrymore, who has never been this womanly and confident on screen. So where's the dramatic conflict? ""Going the Distance"" introduces real-world complicating factors that are meant to reflect the stagnant economy. That's why Erin and Garrett can't solve their long-distance problem. This gives the movie a surface topicality, though it also keeps it low-key, episodic, benign, and quaintly everyday. Not that that's such a bad thing. ""Going the Distance"" may be a minor movie, but it's also the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what you're seeing. EW grade: B+ .

"(EW.com) -- On Feb. 11, 2009, when Joaquin Phoenix made his infamous monosyllabic, grunged-out appearance on ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" it inspired an orgy of media gossip fueled by a basic question: Was Phoenix having some sort of mental breakdown -- or was his whole shambling, beatnik-derelict routine an elaborate hoax? ""I'm Still Here,"" Casey Affleck's fascinating and scary documentary about his brother-in-law, is powerful evidence that the answer is neither -- and that, in fact, it's much sadder. The movie, an artful piece of exploitation vérité, follows Phoenix's self-righteous retirement from acting, his awkward attempt to relaunch himself as a hip-hop star, and his wasted retreat from human relationships. The Joaquin we see in ""I'm Still Here"" is a slurry, bloated shell of his former self, with taped sunglasses that never come off and unwashed hair that's matted into crusty dreads. On stage in Miami, during the notorious performance where he dove into the audience to brawl with a spectator who ticked him off (apparently an easy thing to do), the hapless violence that we all saw 100 times on YouTube is less shocking than the extraordinary, dilapidated numbness of Phoenix's demeanor during his abbreviated rap song. Standing there in his shades and overly tight suit jacket, holding his cigarette as if he couldn't be bothered to put it out for his act, Phoenix, without doing much of anything, radiates such smarmy contempt that you may think: Who is this -- the second coming of Andy Kaufman's Tony Clifton? A reincarnation of the last days of Lenny Bruce? In ""I'm Still Here,"" Phoenix keeps saying that he wants to be a hip-hop musician, but he communicates a borderline indifference even to his own performance. And that suggests that his real mission isn't to be a rap star at all but to act out his superiority: to the curiosity seekers in the audience, to the legion of fans and movie industry colleagues whom he's turned his back on. After all, why couldn't he try to launch a music career without giving up his day job -- the way that, say, Jamie Foxx (who appears briefly on the same stage as Phoenix in a club in Las Vegas) has done? The answer is that it's all about ''street cred.'' By trashing what he's done before, Phoenix thinks he's not just another lowly entertainer on puppet strings but a pure artist who doesn't give a damn about celebrity. (Even though his celebrity is the only reason anyone would begin to pay attention to his rap career.) He's become the kind of convoluted narcissist who flogs his sincerity until it becomes a twisted form of phoniness. That bedraggled desire to declare himself above and apart from everyone else is the defining feature of what now passes for Joaquin Phoenix's ''conversation.'' As ""I'm Still Here"" goes on, he talks and talks but never really listens, gushing forth instead in a slovenly, rambling mash-up of self-pity and self-glorification. The look Phoenix is going for is late-period Jim Morrison (with worse hygiene), but he sounds like a Gen-X Dennis Hopper before rehab. What the film reveals is that Phoenix, whom we see repeatedly snorting cocaine (and surrounded by empty beer bottles), is less an enigmatic head case than a toxically ego-fueled drug casualty. Some of the movie is funny in a hungover, ""Entourage""-meets-Christopher Guest sort of way. When Ben Stiller shows up, with the script of Greenberg in hand, to offer Joaquin a role in the movie, Phoenix is so blurry and out-of-it that it's clear he has never even looked at the script and has absolutely no idea which role he's being pitched. He assumes that Stiller wants him to play Greenberg -- which only caps how annoyed Stiller is to be wasting his time with this bum. The story isn't over, though. When Stiller shows up as a presenter on the Academy Awards, in full-bearded Joaquin costume, it's now clearer, in hindsight, that he was getting his revenge. That Phoenix's handlers -- and Casey Affleck -- enable his behavior by never attempting an intervention amounts to an ethical lapse. Yet the film's unflinching honesty is, in the end, its own justification. Affleck uses Phoenix's descent to forge a riveting -- and, in its way, cautionary -- case study of a celebrity self-destructively addicted to his own psychodrama. Phoenix may say that he's left acting behind, but whether he's trolling the Internet for hookers, trying (hilariously) to convince Diddy to produce his rap album, getting huffy with an entertainment journalist at a junket for Two Lovers, or lashing out at fame while still enjoying all of its perks, the movie understands that his Last Honest Man in Showbiz routine is really a performance -- even if it's one the actor himself is only dimly aware of. The real hoax is the one that Phoenix has perpetrated on himself. It's the illusion (to quote one of his bad hip-hop songs) that he's a ''compli-f---in'-cated'' rebel rather than just another vain burnout who needs help. EW grade: A- . See full article at EW.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite a high-profile push from pop star Lady Gaga and other gay rights supporters, the outcome of a key Senate vote Tuesday on whether to begin debate on legislation that includes a repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy remains too close to call. Republicans appear united against the measure, including some GOP senators who favor lifting the Pentagon's requirement that gays and lesbians keep their sexuality a secret. The Republican opponents are upset that Democratic leaders so far refuse to allow GOP amendments to the broader National Defense Authorization Act that includes the ""don't ask, don't tell"" provision. Lady Gaga spoke at an afternoon rally in Maine to pressure the state's two Republican senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins -- to join Democrats in overcoming an expected filibuster attempt. To loud cheers from the crowd, Gaga said she was proposing a new law titled, ""If you don't like it, go home,"" which would remove homophobic straight soldiers from the military instead of gay soldiers. ""If you are not honorable enough to fight without prejudice, go home,"" she shouted. Without the support of the Maine senators, Democrats are unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed to proceed with debate on the defense authorization plan. Both oppose the policy, and Collins was the sole Republican vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee in support of getting rid of it. But in a statement issued Monday night, Collins said she would side with the rest of the GOP because the Democratic leadership of the Senate ""intends to shut Republicans out of the debate."" Collins said she agreed with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, that the law is ""simply not fair."" But she said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, should give Republicans and Democrats ""an equal opportunity"" to offer amendments to the defense bill. ""Now is not the time to play politics, and I again call on the majority leader to work with Republican leaders to negotiate an agreement so that the Senate can debate the defense bill this week,"" Collins said. In a separate statement, Snowe also indicated she would support a Republican filibuster, saying the chamber should be allowed a full debate on the measure. Snowe also questioned why the Senate would vote on repeal before the military has completed its review. ""We should all have the opportunity to review that report which is to be completed on December 1, as we reevaluate this policy and the implementation of any new changes,"" Snowe's statement said. The defense authorization act, which is a broad defense policy bill, would not rescind ""don't ask, don't tell"" until after the Pentagon completes a review of the repeal's impact on the military. The review is due in December and would serve as the basis for necessary certification by the president, defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the military could handle repealing the policy. Many Republicans complain that Congress should not step in until after that military review is completed. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said approving a repeal provision before finishing the review process would amount to an insult to military personnel. McCain also is unhappy that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, opted to include in the defense bill a controversial immigration provision that offers a path to citizenship for students who are children of illegal immigrants. Reid ""is turning legislation on our national defense into a political football,"" McCain said last week. ""Politically controversial amendments are crowding out our limited time to debate actual military and defense-related legislation."" A GOP leadership aide criticized Reid for planning to debate the ""don't ask, don't tell"" and immigration amendments before the Senate breaks for mid-term elections, even though Reid has said a final vote on the bill would not happen until a post-election session. ""The vote tomorrow is not to get on the defense bill, it's to set up a series of votes on a political wish list,"" the aide said. Reid denied last week that his scheduling was motivated by politics. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the Joint Chiefs chairman, have said publicly they support repealing ""don't ask, don't tell."" The military already has working groups looking at how it would implement the change if ordered. The groups are looking at everything from housing to entitlements, and even personal displays of affection. CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: Collins lines up behind GOP .

"New York (CNN) -- The world's two biggest economies are facing off over tensions that could ignite a trade war and lead to a catastrophic split between the United States and China, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. President Barack Obama says an undervalued currency is giving Chinese companies an unfair advantage in selling products, and this week the House of Representatives passed a bill that would let the United States put tariffs on goods from China. China has retaliated against earlier trade sanctions by the United States and strongly opposes the bill passed by the House. ""One has to hope a lot of it is bluff because the consequences of a significant trade war between China and the United States would be very dramatic,"" Zakaria said. ""We need the Chinese to still have enormous faith in the U.S. economy, not just to buy Treasury bills, but to maintain all the links they have with the U.S. economy."" Zakaria conducted a rare interview with China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, his first with a Western journalist since a similar interview by Zakaria two years ago. The interview is being shown this weekend on Zakaria's Sunday show, ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" The author and host spoke to CNN Thursday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What are the chances that we'll see political reform in China? Fareed Zakaria: The Chinese clearly feel that they need to open up but they don't quite know how and they don't know how to do it without letting go of their monopoly on power. .... They're very sure-footed now on economic power and economic reform, they really feel they have complete mastery over that area, but on political reform, they're very tentative. Wen Jiabao has been clearly somebody who's talked a lot about political reform for a long time. .... My own sense is that he is clearly of the mind to keep things moving in this direction but obviously there are other people who feel otherwise. It isn't clear to me that the forces of political reform are in the ascendancy in China. ... CNN: What sense do you have of the current state of China's economic relationship with the United States? Zakaria: Clearly the U.S. is pushing very hard on the issue of the Chinese currency and I think that a lot of it has to do with the realities of a bad economy here, coupled with a kind of sense that there are very few other levers that the U.S. has. So you're seeing a lot of rhetoric focused around Chinese currency and the fact that the House just passed this week a measure that would punish the Chinese for having artificially undervalued their currency. The Chinese central bank has actually driven its currency even lower as a kind of response to all this. Now the Obama administration has managed to maintain a pretty good overall relationship, and I think that the Chinese understand that some of this is pre-election politics, but I don't think its fundamentally good because these are the two biggest economies in the world and they should be trying to find a way to avoid getting into what appears to be the beginnings of a trade war. Remember the vast numbers of companies that are exporting from China that are American companies. The Chinese have opened up their economy to a huge number of American firms. ... Now this is all interdependence, no one is doing anyone a favor here. CNN: What's the impact of an undervalued Chinese currency? Zakaria: The Chinese benefit. We benefit enormously from having cheap Chinese goods. The big charge against the Chinese that is being made by Congress and even being made by the administration is that they are keeping their currency artificially low, and that favors Chinese manufacturers, that they have an unfair advantage to sell their goods more cheaply. OK, that's basically true. But one has to keep in mind two things. One is that a large number of those so-called Chinese manufacturers are actually American companies manufacturing out of China. The second thing is that these Chinese goods that are now cheaper are bought by Americans and Americans benefit enormously from cheaper goods. The reason there is almost no inflation in America is largely due to cheap Chinese manufacturing. The reason that the Federal Reserve has been able to maintain interest rates so low without any fear of inflation is that they have China acting as a deflationary machine pushing down the price of manufactured goods, which has allowed the Federal Reserve to rescue the American economy by keeping rates so low even now. Americans get cheap mortgages for that reason, get cheap credit, get cheap interest rates for their credit cards. So it's not as if Americans don't benefit from the Chinese having the currency cheap. In fact there are many economists who think we should send the Chinese a thank-you note for keeping the prices of our goods so low. ... I'm not sure I'd go so far but I'd say there are many, many benefits the Americans derive from having cheap Chinese goods. CNN: Do you think this is a relationship that can continue to exist or is it an imbalance that has to change at some point? Zakaria: There's a structural problem, which is that the U.S. is the established superpower in the world, China is the rising power. Those kinds of relationships have often ended up badly. Think about Japan as it rose in the 1930s, think about Germany as it rose in the 1890s and 1920s, think about the Soviet Union. But it doesn't always have to be that way, and today the world is so interdependent that it would be a catastrophe if the United States and China were to have a serious schism. There are going to be these points of tension constantly, and the question is can we navigate those periods of tension and get over them ... for the last 10 or 15 years we have. The big shift that's taken place is that the Chinese are much more confident and much more powerful than they've ever been. CNN: How is that greater power being used? Zakaria: Look at what happened with the Japanese. The Japanese had picked up a Chinese captain of a trawler who had wandered into what the Japanese regard as Japanese waters. They picked him up and arrested him. The Chinese demanded that they release him; the Japanese said no.  But eventually the Japanese bowed to Chinese demands. Why? Because they sensed that the balance of power had shifted.  It was only a few weeks earlier that the news came out that China had overtaken Japan as the second largest economy in the world. If you look at the way the Chinese stimulus has been so successful at restimulating the Chinese economy, which is now growing at 9 percent again, and you compare it to the fate of Western economies, you can understand why the Chinese are more confident, assertive and sure of themselves. CNN: So if the relationship with China is helping the U.S. in the short term, is it causing long-term damage to the U.S. manufacturing base and the overall economy? Zakaria: I think that suggests that you have an alternative to being engaged with China. It's an open world economy. It's not just China that is manufacturing stuff, it's Vietnam, it's India, it's Brazil, it's Indonesia, it's all over the world. The way I would put it is that China represents a challenge to the United States. The best way to solve that challenge is for us to get our act together. The real threat China poses is not a cheap currency. It's a competitive economy that is producing things at every level cheaper than we are, and the question is what should we be doing to be a competitive economy. While we do many things very well ... we have lost too much manufacturing capacity in America. We could revive it. Look at Germany, a case of a very high wage economy that still has maintained a manufacturing capacity, but they didn't do that by isolating themselves from the world economy. To the contrary, Germany is a huge trading nation. They've gotten their act together, they've gotten their workers better training, they've gotten their manufacturing to be more high end and more complex, so what they make is more in the BMW model, highly skilled, complex engineering, putting out premium products and commanding premium prices, which allows you to have a high wage structure. We've done that in some areas ... but by and large we've let  manufacturing erode. But that's not China's fault, that's our fault. CNN: Is the Obama administration taking the right approach in dealing with China? Zakaria: I think the Obama people have been very serious about the Chinese relationship. They approached it from the start as a major strategic partnership. I think you can't really fault the Obama administration for some of the friction, some of it is congressional short-term re-election stuff. Some of it frankly is that the Chinese have been somewhat unpredictable in their responses. They dis-invited [Defense] Secretary Gates from visiting China, which seemed a bad idea, because the one thing you do want to maintain is constant contact and collaboration between these two countries. The Chinese military clearly wanted to send some kind of a signal and withdrew an invitation, which has now been re-extended ... the Chinese are engaging in somewhat unpredictable behavior, which is unfortunate, but I think it reflects their growing pains as a great power. CNN: What's driving that unpredictable behavior? Zakaria: They're becoming more assertive, they're getting more arrogant, which is natural given their success and their size, but I don't think they're becoming more threatening. I think the problem is that they haven't figured out what their national interests are, what kind of a great power do they want to be in the world. What are their broader interests with regard to nuclear nonproliferation, with regard to the Middle East? I don't think they've thought that through. Twenty years ago, they were a struggling Third World nation that never thought about any of that stuff; now they have to have a foreign policy for everything.","President Obama has warned of dangers of undervalued Chinese currency .

"(CNN) -- As public health officials across the country look into the salmonella outbreak that began in the spring, the state of California believes it has identified its earliest cases -- and says its investigation helped tip off the rest of the country to the source of the problem. On May 28 and 29, several people became sick after attending either a prom or a graduation party in Clara County, according to Joy Alexiou, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. Tests on some of the victims, including a catering worker who nibbled on the food, determined that the culprit was salmonella, she said. That finding triggered an investigation. By interviewing prom- and party-goers about what they had eaten, the Santa Clara County Health Department found at least one common link -- a delicate custard-filled pastry called profiteroles that was served at both events. According to Michael Sicilia, a spokesman for the California Department of Health, the caterer had run out of pasteurized filler, and made the rest of the fillings with shell eggs. Throughout June and early July, county officials noted more clusters of two or more salmonella cases. In all, 42 people in Santa Clara County tested positive for salmonella, including six who ended up in the hospital, Alexiou said. Similar clusters were popping up all over California, including four in San Diego County -- one traced to a Korean restaurant -- and another incident involving food served on a movie set in Los Angeles, an incident under investigation by Los Angeles County. In Santa Clara County, investigators were faced with a dilemma. Because the link to eggs didn't emerge for several weeks after people fell ill, there were no eggs left to test. Local investigators relied on interviews with food preparers and companies to draw a trail back to a company in Iowa: Wright County Egg. In other counties, too, the trail led in the same direction, according to health officials. On July 29, the California Department of Health sent a notice to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, warning of a connection to Wright County Egg. Sicilia said the alert helped confirm the suspicions of officials in other states who were also investigating a surge in salmonella cases. California is just one of 23 states that received eggs potentially contaminated by salmonella from Wright County Egg or Hillandale Farms of Iowa, the distributors at the center of the recall of more than half a billion eggs. In Minnesota, the agriculture department noted its first seven cases between May 5 and 7. Investigators have been able to link those illnesses to a Mexican restaurant in Bemidji, which bought eggs that were produced at Hillandale Farms and distributed by a North Dakota-based wholesaler. Michigan is the latest state on the list of 23. The Michigan Department of Agriculture told CNN on Tuesday that eggs associated with the recall have been distributed in the state. As the federal government investigates the egg recall and the related salmonella outbreak that it says has sickened about 1,300 Americans, the regulatory process is coming under scrutiny from the agencies responsible and people affected by the food safety crisis. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday the investigation took a while because of its complexity. ""The clusters were very small. Two or three patients here, two or three patients there."" Frieden also indicated the organism and its DNA fingerprint are common, making it harder to isolate. It took weeks to determine the illnesses came from eggs and the producers who shipped them, he told the Atlanta Press Club. Frieden, who indicated federal, state and local health agencies are better now at working together, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's new egg safety measures, along with a stalled food safety bill, are essential. ""I think the major focus has to be prevention."" John Boyd Jr., the founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association, said that a lack of regulation by the federal government allowed this public health scourge to happen. ""The bottom line here is there should have been more inspections before the outbreak. I know Congress is looking at ... legislation to bring more enforcement,"" Boyd, who said he's been a poultry farmer for 14 years, said on Tuesday's ""CNN Newsroom."" Speaking on a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said federal regulations that took effect in July could have prevented the situation. The new regulations went into effect July 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. The current outbreak began in May and was traced to two Iowa farms, according to the FDA. One of them, Wright County Egg, has recalled 380 million eggs; the other, Hillandale Farms, recalled 170 million eggs. ""We believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time, it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred,"" Hamburg said. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the Food and Drug Administration, said under the new rule, ""We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States."" Food safety regulators don't expect any more recalls after last week's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market, but inspections are still going on. Farrar would not release details of the inspections, which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers, but the results could be released later this week, he said. While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center. The Egg Safety Center is run by United Egg Producers, a trade group that describes itself as a cooperative of egg farmers from all across the United States, representing the ownership of approximately 95 percent of all the nation's egg-laying hens. CNN Senior Medical Producer Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","NEW: 42 people in county tested positive for salmonella .

"(CNN) -- The techno music thumps in the background, but Michelle Phan's voice is a contrast, soothing like a lullaby. In precisely seven minutes and 33 seconds, if you follow Phan's meticulous instructions, she can transform you into the wide-eyed Lady Gaga from the ""Bad Romance"" video. Nearly ten million people have watched this florid romance-inspired makeup tutorial produced by Phan. Some tried to emulate Lady Gaga's dramatic eyes defined by creamy white eyeliner and fluttering lashes. Others clicked on the video just to catch a glimpse of Phan, a self-made styling sensation who reigns as the No. 1 beauty stylist on YouTube. ""I love how one thing can transform the face,"" said Phan, who lives in Los Angeles, California. ""I'm an artist, so I love how just one medium can transform a canvas. Eyeliner can really make a woman's eye more accentuated. A red lipstick can make a woman look sexier."" YouTube officials estimate there are thousands upon thousands of self-made beauty tutorials on their site since its inception in 2005. The company says these beauty videos are revolutionary in many ways -- connecting with millions of viewers, redefining the role of social media and changing the way some novice stylists launch their careers. ""YouTube has become a video encyclopedia of make up,"" said Sadia Harper, a YouTube manager who oversees the how-to and styling videos. At just 23, Phan's YouTube popularity has even landed her a gig as a representative at beauty giant Lancôme. Before her videos debuted, Phan recalls applying for a sales job at a Lancôme makeup counter in Florida in 2007. They told her she didn't have enough experience. After the rejection, Phan returned to her college apartment, where her first do-it-yourself styling video was born. She relied on a relatively simple combination of her Macbook Pro and basic film editing programs. Phan appears in all her videos as the instructor: a petite, soft-spoken young woman with a versatile face that effortlessly pulls off the wide range of looks she teaches. ""I'm really passionate about makeup, and I shouldn't let one person who said no not let me achieve my dreams,"" she said. ""I thought: 'What do I have to lose?' It was summer vacation, and I didn't have a job."" Three years later, she now boasts about 100 videos on her channel MichellePhan. They are neatly documented, easily searchable and the best part: They are free. Viewers can learn how to achieve seductive, smoky eyes and kissable cheeks. They can even copy the ""Avatar"" look by using blue and lavender eye shadows. If it sounds hard, there are no worries. Phan guides them, step by step. On average, she receives at least a million views for each video. ""These days, social media is a really important place for personal expression of body image and for circulating new ideas on what can be done with body,"" says Victoria Pitts-Taylor, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. She has studied how people think about their bodies and the web. Similar to successful blogs about cooking, dining and interior decorating, YouTube videos with styling and makeup advice can be a way for professionals, especially women, to build their entrepreneurial skills, Pitts-Taylor said. Samantha Maria, who declined to give her last name for privacy, is an aspiring stylist who hopes her videos will help her strengthen her beauty career. Better known as BeautyCrush on YouTube, she considers herself an ordinary 20-year-old student studying in Southampton, England. Her makeup and beauty videos are inspired by what she sees on the streets, she says. With her charming British accent, she narrates dozens of videos. She says she was recognized once by a stranger who followed her videos. ""I was so shocked, but it was great as the girl was lovely,"" she said. ""I shouted her out in a video because I was still excited about it."" And it's not just how-to tutorials on make up that have garnered the attention of viewers. Patricia Otegwu specializes in hair and fashion on her channel, BritPopPrincess. She is a 23 year old with an affable smile, who lives in her parent's London home. She had difficulty finding a job in rocky economic times, so she's continuing with her video ventures hoping they will help her launch her own hair products. ""It's an exciting but daunting experience,"" Otegwu said. Jonah Berger, assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said social media can be a creative and promising way to launch career. ""Before social media, you either worked your way through the ranks or you had to know the right people,"" Berger said. ""Social media democratized the progress to some degree."" But Berger points out most self-made stylists don't become famous. For Michelle Phan, standing out from the pack online hasn't been a problem. Phan laughs when she talks about how her mother wanted her to become a doctor in college for the lucrative salary. But Phan told her mother she'd rather follow passion for makeup. Now, her videos and skin care line allow her to help financially support her mother and siblings. Despite her internet fame, she still finds time to connect with her fans. She has Twitter and Facebook pages, where she writes back to as many fans as she can each day. ""Michelle you are such an amazing artist you have inspired me in so many ways, to be more creative in everything. thank you for everything :) xx,"" writes Facebook user Becky Wyburn on Phan's wall. Sometimes the comments aren't so kind, but Phan, like many self-made stylists online, have learned to take the good with the bad. ""It's like art,"" she said. ""Of course not everyone is going to like a Picasso painting, but at the end of the day, I know I put a lot of thought through the process.""","Michelle Phan, 23, is the No. 1 self-made YouTube beauty stylist .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund are back on top of the German Bundesliga table after a 2-0 victory at title rivals Mainz on Sunday. Teenager Mario Goetze opened the scoring for the visitors in the 26th minute when he punished a mistake from Niko Bungert before firing home. Mainz then wasted a golden opportunity to level matters when midfielder Eugen Polanski's 47th-minute penalty was well saved by Dortmund captain Roman Weidenfeller. And Dortmund made the home side pay for missing that spot-kick when they added a second goal midway through the second half, Paraguayan striker Lucas Barrios netting his fifth of the season from a tight angle. The result means Dortmund overtake Mainz by a point at the top of the table with 25 points from their 10 matches. Despite the defeat, Mainz remain six points clear of Hoffenheim, who moved up to third on Sunday, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Hanover. Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice for Hoffenheim with Demba Ba and Peniel Mlapa also on target. Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, third-placed Villarreal lost ground on Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table after a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon on Sunday. Diego Castro opened the scoring for the home side in the 68th minute and Villarreal needed a last-gasp penalty from Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi -- his sixth goal of the season -- to salvage a point. The result extends Villarreal's unbeaten league run to eight matches, but they are now three points behind Real Madrid at the top of the table. Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Almeria and go into next weekend's Madrid derby against Real down in seventh place in the table. Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead but Pablo Piatti levelled for the visitors on the stroke of half-time. Earlier on Sunday, Deportivo La Coruna finally recorded their first win of the season with a 3-0 home victory over Espanyol at the Riazor Stadium.","Borussia Dortmund are back on top of the German Bundesliga table .

"(CNN) -- Togo's Football Association elected Gabriel Ameyi as its new president during a congress held in Lome on Friday. Ameyi, the founder and owner of the Maranatha first division club, won 33 votes ahead of Boukpessi Essoyaba (19) and Têtê Amouzou (0). ""I am very happy. My victory is like delivering sport in my country because we suffered too much. My happiness is also the happiness of Togo football fans as a whole,"" Ameye told CNN in an exclusive interview. Ameyi said he won the election because of his ""passion"" and ""commitment"" for football. ""We needed a committed person at the head of our football and we have got it,"" said Togo football fans' president, a woman popularly known as ""Maman Togo."" The president-elect said his priority will be to put the country's football back on track, as stadiums throughout the country have been closed down for over a year. He also said that he would do all he can to qualify Togo for the next African Cup of Nations that will be jointly held in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in 2012. Togo's sports world has been hit hard by tragedy and misfortune. Twenty sports officials, including Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, died in 2008 when their helicopter exploded in Lungi, Sierra Leone. In January, gunmen attacked the Togo team bus on its way to the 2010 Africa Cup tournament, killing three and wounding many more. The team withdrew from the tournament and was promptly banned from the next two Africa Cup tournaments by the Confederation of African Football and fined $50,000. And in September, the Togo Football Association declared that a match the team allegedly played earlier in the month against Bahrain was actually played by a fake team put together by a former team manager.","Fan president, Maman Togo, is pleased with Gabriel Ameyi's election .

"London, England (CNN) -- Fernando Alonso insists he can still drive Ferrari to the Formula One world title, despite losing ground on his rivals after a disappointing Belgian Grand Prix. The Spaniard is 41 points behind the current leader in the drivers' championship standings, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, after he span out in the latter stages at Spa. But with six races left in the season, Alonso is convinced he can still force his way into the reckoning -- starting with the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on September 12. ""With this points system and the way races swing one way or another, I am convinced we still have a significant chance,"" Alonso wrote on his Ferrari blog. ""There are 150 points up for grabs, enough to turn the situation around. We must remain calm and concentrate, to try and make up the difference as soon as possible. ""Clearly, there are now three of us who need to make up for ground lost in Spa. It was not the Belgian Grand Prix we were expecting, that's for sure."" Alonso is now focusing on the Italian Grand Prix as a chance to close the gap on Hamilton, and the other three in front of him -- Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, as well as Jenson Button, of McLaren. But he admits his first trip to the famous Monza track as a Ferrari driver will add extra pressure on him to deliver the goods and that a bad result could deliver a fatal blow to his championship hopes. ""There is no denying that the Monza race will be very important,"" he added. ""At our home circuit we will have to do everything to avoid losing any more points. ""A good result here would be a great boost. If things go badly, it won't be over but it would be a hard knock for team morale. ""Racing at Monza for the first time as a Ferrari driver will definitely be a nice feeling.

"(CNN)  -- The young upstart upstaged the returning legend as Sebastian Vettel claimed pole position for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix while returning Michael Schumacher was back in seventh on the grid for Sunday's race. Red Bull's Vettel finished last season by winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and claiming second in the championship behind Jenson Button and started this year in the same emphatic style. His best lap of one minute 54.101 seconds was a tenth of a second faster than Felipe Massa in his Ferrari, who was returning to action after his horrific crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix last July. Massa's new teammate and two-time former world champion Fernando Alonso was third fastest in a good start to the season for Ferrari. 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth best ahead of Schumacher's Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. Mark Webber in the second Red Bull edged out seven-time world champion Schumacher with Button eighth on the grid. But it was Vettel who dominated for his sixth career pole and his pace was demonstrated by the gap to fourth-placed Hamilton of more than a second and 1.4 seconds better than his 41-year-old German compatriot Schumacher. ""For me it is a big surprise and it is clear there are four teams out in front with close performances. So it is thanks to the long night of work the boys did that we have the speed and pole position,"" Vettel said at his post-qualifying press conference. Schumacher admitted that he had found his return difficult: . ""I didn't really find it easy to find the peak performance and speed of the car in the time available. But I am happy because we are working well as a team. It is a long race and the season is even longer.""

"(CNN) -- Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso believes the Formula One title race is now wide open with seven races to go following Ferrari's recent resurgence. Alonso followed up his controversial victory at the German Grand Prix with second place behind Mark Webber in Hungary, and is now just 20 points behind Red Bull's new series leader. Ferrari face possible further sanctions for the incident at Hockenheim last month that saw Felipe Massa allow Alonso to take the lead, having already been fined $100,000 for breaching the ban on team orders ahead of a September 8 disciplinary hearing of the World Motor Sports Council. But the Italian team are now just 74 points behind leaders Red Bull, with McLaren second after Lewis Hamilton failed to finish in Budapest and world champion Jenson Button was eighth. ""We are in a position now that we are able to take the lead of the championship if we win one race,"" Alonso told Ferrari's website. ""I think we have to remain calm. We know that four or five drivers will fight until the last race, but we need to use our experience as a team. Schumacher says sorry to Barrichello . ""Ferrari have won so many championships, and my personal experience as well, fighting for three championships. We have to stay calm, and in these seven races get as many podiums as possible. I think continuity will be key to winning the championship."" Hamilton is hoping to bounce back at the next race, the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps on August 29 after having to retire for the second time this season due to mechanical problems.

We have some very promising developments in the pipeline, and we're making progress in lots of other areas, too. We have dug deep before, and I know absolutely that we will dig deep once more. ""With the championship so closely balanced, this is the perfect time for a break.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will hold a hearing Monday as it considers whether to approve genetically engineered salmon for human consumption. If approved it would be the first genetically modified animal permitted by the food safety agency. A company, AquAdvantage Salmon, has injected growth hormones into Atlantic salmon that enable the fish to reach maturity in half the normal growth time, 16 to 18 months, rather than 30 months. The FDA in an analysis dated Monday, wrote: ""We therefore conclude the food from AquAdvantage Salmon that is the subject of this application is as safe as food from conventional Atlantic salmon and that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the consumption of food from this animal."" But critics worry about the possible health effects of eating fish containing the growth hormone. Eatocracy: What does ""genetically modified"" salmon mean? ""It's impossible to talk about the risks other than saying they haven't been properly assessed, other than process has been rushed and we don't know,"" said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food and Water Watch. She added that the FDA is a ""very stressed agency"" with all the latest recalls and outbreaks, that it ""can't ensure the safety of the foods they currently regulate."" Hauter said that the FDA has relied too heavily on information provided by AquAdvantage and that there should be a more extended time given to thoroughly vet and discuss risks. A final decision is expected in a few weeks.","If OK'd the salmon will be the first genetically modified animal permitted by the FDA .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We know that Fridays are awesome, but you know what today's show could use? A mascot! And we've got one coming up for you in about eight minutes. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get to it. First Up: Gulf Oil Spill . AZUZ: First up, top kill. It sounds like something pretty bad. Officials are hoping it'll do something good, though: stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. The top kill -- it's also called a ""dynamic kill"" -- is something we mentioned earlier this week. You basically clog up the well with a special kind of mud. BP, the company that owns the well, has been trying a bunch of ways to deal with this leak. One strategy is using dispersants, chemicals that help break up the oil. The Environmental Protection Agency is worried about the specific kind of chemical that's being used. It's ordered BP to start using a different dispersant in the next couple days. The Minerals Management Service is part of the U.S. Interior Department. It's in charge of regulating offshore oil drilling. It's gotten some criticism lately for being too close to the industry it's supposed to oversee. There've been accusations of improper gifts or improper behavior. Ken Salazar is the secretary of the interior. He's in charge of the Interior Department. He says he's working to clean up the Minerals Management Service, and he's keeping an eye on the different strategies to clean up this oil spill. KEN SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR: If something doesn't work, you need to immediately fall back to other alternatives. We, every day, are on top of BP, relative to the different work streams that they have going on. This particular work stream that they call the dynamic kill is something that should come, according to their schedule, in play on Sunday. That will be an effort to essentially kill the well through the insertion of mud. We're doing everything we can to hold BP accountable, and we will hold them accountable on behalf of the American people. Blog Report . AZUZ: You've been talking about what you think the worst part of the oil spill is; most of you have discussed its impact on marine life. Listen to what Keenan says: ""The thing that will be affected most is the fishing industry. If oil spilled near my town, it would ruin the economy because about 90 percent of it is fishing."" From Tara: ""Our seafood will become more expensive, and I'm not ready to cut back on my favorite food just yet."" Brian says ""this spill is becoming eerily similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up,"" he says, ""we're gonna be reluctant to build another oil rig."" Aaron thinks ""we should get neighboring countries to try to help us in such a bad ecological crisis."" Carley notes that ""ocean life is the base of the food chain; when we pollute the oceans, we are affecting ourselves too."" And Jonathan says ""it's obvious the fishing industry is taking a hit. The disaster will damage hundreds of years worth of marine life and the ecosystem."" Economy Check . AZUZ: We have a quick look at some economic headlines for you now, starting with a drop in the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 376 points yesterday. Not good news; the Dow indicates how the whole stock market is doing. Some experts argue that the debt crisis that's happening over in Europe is making investors nervous, and that's causing some of the declines in the U.S. market. Next up, jobless claims. We're talking about the number of people who are filing for unemployment for the first time. The number went up last week for the first time in a month. And finally, a Wall Street reform bill is moving forward in the U.S. Senate. Yesterday, they voted 60 to 40 to end debate and have a final vote on the bill. That could happen within days. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The Yellow Sea is off the coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Not legit. Actually, it's next to the Korean Peninsula. The Iberian Peninsula is in Europe. Korean Tensions . AZUZ: It's the Korean Peninsula that's getting a lot of attention right now because of something that happened in the Yellow Sea back in March. A mysterious explosion tore a South Korean warship in half. The ship sank. 46 sailors were killed. It was near part of the Yellow Sea that both North and South Korea say belongs to them. Several countries -- including South Korea and the U.S. -- investigated the incident. The results point the finger at North Korea, that a North Korean submarine launched a torpedo that sank the South Korean ship. The North denied the accusation. The South vowed to respond. Here's why all of this is important. The U.S. has an agreement with South Korea to defend it against any aggression. So, if a military conflict breaks out, the U.S. will have to get involved. The tension on the Korean Peninsula goes back decades. The Korean War, fought from 1950 to 1953, killed millions of people on both sides. When it ended, the Demilitarized Zone -- or DMZ -- was established as a kind of barrier between the two countries. Eunice Yoon takes us there now. (BEGIN VIDEO) EUNICE YOON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're on Freedom Highway driving towards the Demilitarized Zone. It splits the North from South Korea, and it's been described once by former President Bill Clinton as the scariest place on earth. After the Korean War, a line was drawn at the 38th parallel, two-and-a-half miles wide, cutting 155 miles across. The DMZ was set up as part of a truce in 1953, but no peace treaty was ever finalized. So, the two Koreas are technically still at war. Here, the Cold War lives. This is the joint security area in the truce village of Panmunjom. This is a very highly controlled part of the DMZ, and only certain soldiers and military officers are allowed here. This is one of the conference rooms where the United Nations command led by the Americans would meet with the North Koreans, and they would discuss all matters regarding the border and the armistice. These mikes record everything in this room, and they also happen to be right on the demarcation line. So, if I cross over here, I'm in North Korea. There are reminders of the hostilities. This is the Bridge of No Return. Over there is the North Korean side of the demarcation line. And the prisoners of war, after the Korean War, were brought here and told to choose a side. Once you cross this bridge, you could never go back. This is the only place where you're going to see South and North Korean soldiers staring each other down. The South Korean soldiers are chosen for their stature, so they look more intimidating. They also are highly trained in martial arts, hence the Tae Kwon Do stance. What's so surreal about this place is that it's become a tourist attraction for both sides. We were just with a tour of U.S. war veterans, and over here, the North Koreans are holding their own tour. And 60 years on, we're still waiting for peace. (END VIDEO) Address to Congress . AZUZ: Mexican President Felipe Calderon wrapped up his trip to the U.S. with a speech to a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress. On Wednesday, he and President Obama talked about some of the issues that affect both of their countries. President Calderon brought up those same concerns in his speech yesterday. He pointed out the benefits of working together. MEXICAN PRESIDENT FELIPE CALDERON: Mexico and the United States are stronger together than they are apart. Together, we can renew our partnership to restore stronger and faster economic growth on both sides of the border. A stronger Mexico means a stronger United States. Shoutout .

London is hosting the 2012 Olympics, and it unveiled the face of the games this week: Wenlock -- that's the thing on the left -- and Mandeville. The designer that came up with these guys says they were inspired by the steel that was used to build London's Olympic stadium. He designed them specifically for kids, and says he hopes that the mascots will help connect young people with sports and the legacy of the Olympics. Before We Go . AZUZ: Well, before we go, you've heard of the leaning tower of Pisa? This is the leaning press box of Giants Stadium. That's leaning pretty far. Don't worry about it; it's not a disaster.

The Giants and Jets are moving into a new home next door, and the old stadium's spot is being turned into a parking lot. Goodbye . AZUZ: So, you've got demolition, you've got a parking lot.

"London, England (CNN) -- Wayne Rooney must be prepared for criticism from fans when he returns from injury for Manchester United, his former England teammate David James told CNN. The striker has not played for the club since his controversial statement last month that he wanted to leave, which was followed by a quick change of mind and a subsequent lucrative new five-year contract. Rooney went to the United States for conditioning treatment on his injured ankle, but is now being assessed ahead of a possible comeback in Saturday's Premier League match against Wigan. The 25-year-old's apparent rift with manager Alex Ferguson split United fans, some of whom accused him of engineering the situation to get a better pay deal, and James said Rooney needs to accept that he will remain firmly in the media spotlight. ""You have to accept that if you're going to put yourself out there, then you're going to have some good press and bad press,"" the 40-year-old James told CNN. ""The reality is that if you're going to accept people cheering you out of hand, for something you don't think needs cheering, then you've got to accept people booing you. ""If you're going to put yourself in the spotlight for accolade, then you've got to accept the reverse consequences."" James has sympathy for Rooney, who became a Premier League player with Everton at the age of just 16 and has had to deal with intense media pressure -- this year he was accused by newspapers of sleeping with a prostitute while his wife Coleen was pregnant. ""It is difficult, the likes of Wayne Rooney - he was a kid when he was in the first team and not much older than a kid when he was playing for England, so I think the reality is very subjective,"" James said. ""And when you haven't experienced normality through a career, it's very difficult to work out how to pitch yourself. A bit of advice is don't believe the hype. ""You're there to do a job, and as long as you're doing your job -- it's not easy but don't get carried away with it. I think when I was younger I was fortunate to be involved in a modeling campaign once, and at that moment in my life I thought I was the best thing since sliced bread. I think somewhere near the end of the season it all went wrong."" The goalkeeper, who now plays in England's second division with Bristol City, rates Rooney as the toughest striker he has faced. ""I'm going to go for Wazza, only because he chipped me and then laughed about it. I still love him, I think he's great,"" James said. World Cup shortcomings . The former Liverpool, Manchester City, West Ham and Portsmouth keeper became the oldest World Cup debutant in June's 0-0 draw with Algeria, when he admits England failed to take their opposition seriously. ""I think, generally, the level of football was underestimated to the extent that you're playing teams like Algeria, and when the group was announced you're kind of like, 'Well they're the easy team, everybody's going to beat Algeria, maybe the only issue is with America.' ""And as result after result came through, the only staggering result was Portugal against North Korea [Portugal won 7-0]. Other than that, most games were tight -- really, really tight. ""It was almost as if teams had gone in to the World Cup to not lose matches, and then we suffered because teams were capable of nullifying what we had as an attacking option."" England coach Fabio Capello was vilified by the UK media following the 4-1 second-round crushing by Germany, but James backed the Italian. ""He's pedantic, without a doubt. The one thing I liked about it was I came into a squad, and he told me what he wanted to do. He instructed the players,"" James said. ""Even in training, if he saw something he didn't like, he'd stop. He's full-on 100 percent, everything is about winning and that's it. I can deal with that, I can deal with that sort of environment. I didn't need him coming up to me asking me how I was, I like him."" Role models in sport . While James has set up a foundation to carry out charity work in the African country of Malawi, he does not believe that footballers have to be role models. ""I don't think as a footballer you have to be out there doing charity work. I'm not doing it because I'm defending the football industry, I'm doing it because it's the way that I am -- and it gives me the opportunity to go a little bit further because of football perhaps,"" he said. ""I think I've been out three times, and my expertise is not farming. I appreciate that I'm going out there and having a few photos taken, but that's not what we're about, not what I'm about. ""The idea of doing something on an agricultural level, excuse the pun, but it was a small seed at the beginning. The idea isn't so much that there's a particular food source that we're trying to grow, it's just that there's a template of education and knowledge which, given the right sort of teaching, then people can implement that in the areas that need to do that.""","Former England goalkeeper David James has sympathy for Wayne Rooney .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Haitians getting a helping hand from hoops? You're going to see it for yourself in today's edition of CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. Game on! First Up: Korean Tensions . AZUZ: North and South Korea don't get along too well under the best of circumstances. And right now, is not the best of circumstances. South Korea is calling off trade with the North, closing off access to its waters for North Korean ships, and setting up a new military plan with regard to the North. All of this is in response to the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The South says North Korea fired the torpedo that sank the ship. The North denies that. The U.S. is involved here, too. President Obama ordered military commanders to work with South Korea to prevent any aggression from the North. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging North Korea to share what it might know about the sunken ship. Plus, the U.S. and South Korea just announced yesterday that they're going to run a military exercise together as a direct response to the March incident. North Korea says that it's considering the situation as the first phase of a war, and that if the South does anything, the North will respond. Stopping the Leak . AZUZ: Tension on the rise in Asia. Frustration on the rise in the U.S. over this oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Some of you have talked on our blog about your frustrations with the spill. You are not alone. According to a new CNN poll, 76 percent of Americans disapprove of how BP handled the oil spill, and 51 percent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama has handled the spill. That brings up another question: Who should be in charge of the cleanup efforts? The government says it should be BP. Since the company owns the well, the government argues that BP is responsible for stopping the leak and for the cleanup. But BP says the government has the ultimate control over the efforts in the Gulf. The one thing that both sides seem to agree on is that they're frustrated -- like you, like all of us -- with the efforts so far. KEN SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR: I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading. If we find that they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way appropriately. DOUG SUTTLES, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, BP: I am probably just as frustrated as the secretary is. You know, we've been at this every day for more than a month now, trying to get this flow stopped and actually trying to fight this thing offshore. So, what I would say is we're doing everything we can. We've got the brightest people, the best people, every resource available putting at it. And we're going to stay at it, despite the frustration, despite the setbacks we have. We won't quit until we get this job done. I can promise you that. Impact Your World . AZUZ: While BP and the government work to stop the underwater leak, other groups are dealing with the effects of this spill on the surface of the water and on land. And you can help out.

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? You lose consciousness whenever you get a concussion. Not necessarily! In fact, most people who've had concussions didn't black out. Head Injuries in Football . AZUZ: One thing that every concussion does have in common is that they all temporarily interfere with how your brain works. They can affect things like your memory, speech or reflexes. And anyone who's had a concussion is more likely to have another one. Most concussions are caused by a hit to the head. It's part of the reason you hear so much about them so much in sports, especially contact sports like this one. A congressional committee is looking at the long-term impact of these head injuries and how to prevent them. It held a hearing on the issue yesterday. Nolan Harrison, who played for 10 years in the NFL, says that the pressure of the pro game can sometimes work against concerns about concussions. NOLAN HARRISON, RETIRED NFL PLAYER: There was always pressure to get back out on the field. There's still no parameters in place on the sidelines that you can say, ""OK, this guy has had this type of a hit. We're going to keep him out for a certain amount of time."" AZUZ: The NFL is trying to tackle the issue of concussions, but it's also pushing states to look at how younger players can be affected by concussions. One of the lawmakers who's part of this hearing says it's important for the pros to set an example. REP. LINDA SANCHEZ, (D) CALIFORNIA: And what we've seen with the NFL is, young kids in sports at all levels emulate their favorite players. And if the NFL isn't doing things correctly, it's, you have very little chance that it will trickle down, you know, to youth sports like it should. So, the NFL really needs to take the lead and really highlight safety. This Day in History . (ON SCREEN GRAPHIC) May 25, 1787 - The Constitutional Convention begins in Philadelphia .

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Healing Hoops . AZUZ: Amy Stephens is no stranger to the basketball court. She played in college, she's coached for around 20 years, and she's led Drake's women's basketball team to more than a hundred wins. Recently, she took her hoops know-how out of Iowa and down to Haiti. Eric Hanson of affiliate KCCI explains why and what happened when Coach Stephens arrived. (BEGIN VIDEO) ERIC HANSON, KCCI REPORTER: When your whole world is shaken before age 12, escapes are simple and rare, especially for girls. You see, boys near the epicenter of Haiti's earthquake don't let a flat basketball derail a good time. But girls, their green pigtails stay on the sidelines, until a Division I women's coach shows up.... AMY STEPHENS, DRAKE UNIVERSITY BASKETBALL COACH: I might be just as nervous as they are. HANSON: ...And convinces 40 young Haitians to trade their green dresses for Bulldog blue. STEPHENS: Put your arms out in front, and if they can touch someone, they're too close. HANSON: Even though not one of them can understand a word she's saying... STEPHENS: One, two, three -- oh. HANSON: ...Or why in the first 15 minutes of a basketball camp, baskets aren't being shot... STEPHENS: We're making the number eight around our legs. HANSON: ...Once ball handling became comedic, the coach used to precision decided she might as well turn them loose... STEPHENS: OK. Lay-ups. We're doing right-handed lay-ups. HANSON: ...On the baskets they'd been eyeing. STEPHENS: Yes. Oh, almost. HANSON: Air balls, there were plenty, until baskets started falling. And when they did, 6th grade girls became 6th grade girls. STEPHENS: That's the beauty of the age group. It doesn't matter if you're Haitians or Americans. When you get excited and you high five, all of a sudden it really breaks down, it breaks down barriers. ISAAC FILS, HAITIAN COACH: They're just so happy about playing. They're playing, so they feel very, very happy. You know? So, they're enjoying themselves, you know. HANSON: Suddenly, the boys were the jealous ones. SANDY HATFIELD CLUBB, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, DRAKE UNIVERSITY: This is a group of girls who, they said, don't play basketball. HANSON: And the girls burdened with adult-sized problems discovered it's OK to play. CLUBB: Their joy, their excitement, just to watch them playing. They're playing just like 5th and 6th graders play. It's hard to believe, especially when you look behind them and they're living in these tents and there is rubble from the earthquake. It's overwhelming. FILS: When they play, they forget about the awful earthquake that happened in Haiti. Sport is very, very, very good for them to make them forget some things like the earthquake. It's a good thing, you know? (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: It is indeed. Before we go, a little problem-solving question. 33 students in a school band want to play drums. The school only has 6 drums. There's no money to buy new drums. The answer? You make the drums yourself! That's the solution Mike Hernandez came up with. He's the music teacher at Cove Road Elementary School in New Jersey dreamed about making drums out of buckets, so that's what he did. Goodbye . AZUZ: All he had to do was drum up some support from the community for his creative solution. You just can't beat that with a stick! You need two of them.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Our penultimate program of the school year includes a mission to Mars that will never get off the ground. The explanation's coming up. I'm Carl Azuz. You're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Oil Spill Disaster . AZUZ: First up, BP officials are hoping to get to the ""cap"" part of the ""cut and cap"" plan today. This is the latest attempt to try to fix the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. Before they can put the cap in place, they needed to cut part of the well so that they have a smooth surface to put the cap on. Yesterday, the ""cut"" part of the plan hit a snag: The blade got stuck in one of the pipes. This video came in later in the day. You see that yellow thing that looks kind of like a box? That's the blade. And the fact that it's moving around is a good thing; it means the blade got unstuck. BP expected to start cutting again sometime yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the oil is washing onto shore in more places. These balls of tar and patches of oil started showing up on beaches in Alabama and Mississippi yesterday. Forecasters say that shifts in the weather could affect where the oil that's out in the Gulf is going. Chad Myers has more on that. CHAD MYERS, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: The weather pattern is in fact shifting. High pressure is now in control in the Gulf of Mexico. This reduces the threat of hurricanes, but it also moves the wind to be in this direction. The direction that the people here, all the way back from let's say Apalachicola all the way back -- which is just a rich oyster bed right through there -- all the way back along Fort Walton Beach, in through Destin and all these areas that people know of these white sand beaches. That's where the water is going to be pushed next because of this high pressure that's just not going to move for many, many days. I.D. Me . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an Asian country that was founded more than 2,500 years ago. I'm made up of thousands of islands, and I'm home to more than 126 million people. My capital city is Tokyo. I'm Japan, and my government is run by a prime minister. Resignation Announcement . AZUZ: Well, right now, Japan is looking for a new prime minister. Yukio Hatoyama, who took over the job less than a year ago, is now stepping down. In Japan's government, the prime minister comes from the party that has the most people in parliament. Another member of Hatoyama's party will take over for now. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for July. Having your country's leader resign after such a short time in office might seem a little strange to us. But in Japan, it's not that unusual. At least, not recently. Kyung Lah explains what we mean and examines Hatoyama's path from candidate to former prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: Yukio Hatoyama lead a political upheaval. Japan's voters, sick of political business as usual, were reinvigorated by Hatoyama's Obama-style message of change last fall, ousting a ruling party that held control for almost 50 continuous years. Japan's new prime minister and his party, the Democratic Party of Japan, pledged major government reform and economic recovery. But the euphoria didn't last long. The world's second largest economy continued to struggle, weighed down by deflation and a ballooning national debt. Then this anger from Okinawa: Candidate Hatoyama promised to move a U.S. Marine base off the island. Prime Minister Hatoyama couldn't keep that promise, as he came under pressure from the U.S. The issue overshadowed Hatoyama's entire agenda and helped drive his approval ratings into the teens. Hatoyama is Japan's fourth prime minister in less than four years. Shinzo Abe resigned exactly one year after he took the job. Yasuo Fukuda didn't quite make it a year. Neither did the next prime minister, Taro Aso. And now, Yukio Hatoyama, on the job months short of a year. As Japan faces critical economic challenges and the fastest aging population, it must once again put those issues aside and once again focus on finding yet another leader. (END VIDEO) Peace Meeting . AZUZ: Moving to Afghanistan, where a gun battle broke out outside of a peace conference. Afghan President Hamid Karzai was leading the event. He was speaking when rockets and explosives started going off outside. Incredibly, he finished his speech! But he left immediately afterward. The Taliban, the militant organization that used to control Afghanistan, said it was responsible for the attack. Ironically, President Karzai planned the meeting to talk about including members of the Taliban who turn their back on violent attacks like this one. All of it happened in the capital city of Kabul. The fighting kept going after President Karzai had left the area. Two people who were described as suicide bombers were killed in the violence. Another person was arrested. Guatemala Sinkhole . AZUZ: Parts of Central America are recovering from Tropical Storm Agatha. It hit the region last weekend. One of the countries that was hit the hardest was Guatemala. More than 150 people were killed there. The storm triggered mudslides, destroyed homes, caused more than a dozen bridges to collapse. It also caused this! Looks like someone drilled straight into the earth. It's a sinkhole. This one's about a hundred feet deep, more than 60 feet wide. It swallowed several buildings; there are buildings down there! Fortunately, no one was injured by the sinkhole. Experts say sinkholes can be caused when water dissolves minerals in certain kinds of rocks. They can also be caused by different kinds of construction. One official thinks that might have contributed to this one. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! In Roman mythology, who was the god of war? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Thor, B) Mars, C) Saturn or D) Kratos? You've got three seconds -- GO! Mars was the god of war and one of the most important gods in Roman mythology. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Mars Simulation . AZUZ: Of course, that's whom the planet is named for. Mars is the second closest planet to Earth, and scientists have talked about going there for years. Today, a group of explorers is doing it. Except, not really. It'll be like they're going to Mars, though. These guys have volunteered to take part in a simulation, spending the next year and a half in a fake spacecraft. Imagine a reality show, but in space. The goal is to find out what the 520-day trip to Mars would be like, how the isolation and cramped spaces would affect people. The crew will conduct nearly 100 experiments and even fake a Mars landing. The volunteers can walk away any time they want. Why Teach? AZUZ: We've talked a lot about how the recession has impacted your education. Teachers are affected, too. We've seen layoffs; we've seen budget cuts. Considering all of the challenges that teachers face, it raises the question, why teach? Well, recently, we asked educators to send in iReports and tell us why they do it, what they love about their jobs. Take a listen to some of their replies. (BEGIN VIDEO) OMEKONGO DIBINGA, WASHINGTON, D.C.: I became a teacher because there is a quotation that says children are the messages that we send to a future that we just don't know. And I thrive every day with the possibility that I can help shape a positive message for the future. JASON GATSON, FORT WORTH, TEXAS: I believe in knowledge and I believe that very few professions offer you the chance to influence the future like teaching does. Granting somebody the gift of knowledge can lead them to a better life that they otherwise would not have had. W. J. O'REILLY, NEW YORK CITY: If, as a teacher, I can supress my own egotistical idea that I know the truth, then I give my students the chance to test their opinions and follow those intellectual threads inward to their own self discovery, with guidance of course. This is inner-motivation, and it's why I call myself a teacher every day. (END VIDEO) iReport Promo . AZUZ: Well, teachers, we welcome your iReports, but teachers aren't the only ones who can send them in. Students, you can too! In fact, you can send us one about how you're spending your summer break. It's as easy as this: You make the video. Go to the Spotlight section which you see right now on CNNStudentNews.com. And you click the iReport link. And once you're on the page, what you do: scroll down just a bit and click where it says ""share your story."" That will get your video to our staff. You fill out the information you see there, and we will have what we need to take your iReport. Now, there is one rule you have to remember: You have to be at least 13 years old. The address again: CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, you get 10 seconds to shoot a free throw in the pros. So, how many do you get to shoot 50? Bob Fisher's going to take one minute, which ties his own world record. 50 free throws, one minute. He also holds the title for the most free throws in two minutes. He set both of the records at the school where he's -- you guessed it -- a shooting coach. A local reporter challenged fisher recently. The reporter only netted 20. Goodbye . AZUZ: We probably wouldn't do much better, but it'd be worth a shot. I mean, if it's free, why not throw your hat in the ring? Those puns were foul. Thankfully, just one more day to go.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: What you've learned in government and civics classes is unfolding right now on Capitol Hill. How the lessons apply in life -- our first story on CNN Student News! First Up: Supreme Court Nominee . AZUZ: Elena Kagan is a name you're going to be hearing in the weeks ahead. She is the solicitor-general -- the Obama administration's top lawyer. It's her job to argue cases for the government at the U.S. Supreme Court. President Obama now wants her to serve on that court; Kagan is the president's top choice to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: While we can't presume to replace Justice Stevens' wisdom or experience I have selected a nominee who I believe embodies that same excellence, independence, integrity and passion for the law and who can ultimately provide that same kind of leadership on the court. AZUZ: But as you know from your government classes, President Obama can't just give her the job. He needs the ""advice and consent"" of the U.S. Senate, who'll make the final decision on Kagan. They'll be looking at her resume: Her law degree from Harvard University. Her work as dean of that university's law school. Her service as a lawyer for the former Clinton administration. But one major concern for some senators: Kagan has no experience as a judge, unlike all the current members of the Supreme Court. So she's likely to face some tough questions from senators; they're going to be trying to get an idea of how she would rule in certain situations before they decide whether or not to confirm her. If the 50-year-old New Yorker gets the job as associate justice, she would be the fourth woman to serve in the history of the Supreme Court. Cleanup Health Hazards . AZUZ: While BP considers different ways to stop and clean up an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, other folks are trying to help out. Their livelihood depends on it. Rob Marciano shows us how dirty a job the clean-up is. And you're going to hear him mention ""Valdez"" -- that's a reference to the Exxon Valdez, a ship that spilled 11 million gallons of oil near Alaska back in 1989. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Clearing the oil is a big job, and the pros can't do it alone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a safety training class. MARCIANO: So the call has gone out to recruit the locals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're going to be working in contaminated water, you'll have to have boots -- rubber boots. MARCIANO: Hundreds have already volunteered to help and safety trainings like this one are being held across the coast. CAROL VAUGHN, BEACH CLEAN-UP VOLUNTEER: Why are they getting volunteers when they have contractors? MARCIANO: A reminder that cleaning up oil is a dangerous job. VAUGHN: Hearing today, the type of equipment you have to wear to pick up trash off the beach, was a realization that this is real and it's happening. MARCIANO: Some volunteers who pitched in after the Valdez spill are still sick. Due to financial settlements, many can't even talk publicly about their health problems, but it is bad. DEBBIE TAYLOR, BILOXI REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER: They have long-term effects, some central nervous system effects and who's to say we won't see that here. It think it's just going to be a wait-and-see game. MARCIANO: Debbie Taylor is on the frontlines at Biloxi's Regional Medical Center where preparations are already underway. Some of Taylor's first patients could be these fishermen. Normally, these boats would be out trying to net some shrimp. But the oil spill has put a stop to that, so they sit and they wait. Some of these boats may actually be out working for BP trying to clean up the mess. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: BP's here to ask for your help. MARCIANO: BP is already holding informational sessions. Phillip Nguyen attended, and now wants a long-term contract to clean up. He runs two shrimp boats that now sit idle. PHILLIP NGUYEN, SHRIMP BOAT OPERATOR: Unpredictable for the future of the shrimp business and shrimp industry, we need to get some sort of financing income from somewhere. MARCIANO: The Coast Guard performs safety checks before each vessel is approved for duty. Safety for the boat, but what about the crew? RICK COW, FISHERMAN: We're worried about that too, but working and we've got to do it, you know? You got to take risks on that. MARCIANO: So you need the money so you just start doing it? COW: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. (END VIDEO) I. D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can ID Me! My goals include freedom and peace for almost 500 million citizens. I'm a partnership of 27 European countries. I have one official currency: the euro. I'm the European Union, and my main trading partner is the U.S. Rescue Plan . AZUZ: All right, so you get an idea from that how the economies of Europe and America are linked together. Take what's happened in Greece. It has huge debt -- money it owes that some investors are worried it may not be able to repay. Because that's bad for Europe -- and Europe has that close trading partnership with the U.S. -- the American stock market dropped last week, after Greece's bad news. Well, here's some better news. The European Union has just come up with a new plan to deal with European debt. It's set aside almost a trillion dollars to stabilize and protect Europe's economies. And that has investors in America, and around the world, breathing a sigh of relief. As proof, the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- part of the American stock market -- jumped up hundreds of points yesterday. A good economic sign. Brown Steps Down . AZUZ: Britain will be getting a new leader. Its current prime minister, Gordon Brown, whom you see right here -- he's asking his political party -- the Labour Party -- to get ready for a new leadership contest. But he won't be a candidate. This is all because of Britain's election last week. Three of Britain's political parties shared most of the vote. But none of them got enough votes, to form a government on its own. So it looks like two of them will have to get together, form an alliance to get leadership in place. Which two parties that will be hasn't been decided yet. But what's interesting about all this is that an election like this hasn't happened in Britain since 1974. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Tchaparian's students at River Bluff School in Fresno, California! Where would you find Hampton University? You know what to do! Is it in: A) Virginia, B) New York, C) Arkansas OR D) South Carolina? You've got three seconds -- GO! A historically black university, Hampton is located in Virginia! That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Obama Commencement . AZUZ: Speaking at a graduation ceremony at Hampton University, President Obama talked about the importance of education. It's hard for anybody to disagree with that: The national unemployment rate is at 9.9 percent. The president pointed out that the rate is more than twice as high for people without a college degree than it is for those with a college degree. What might cause more disagreement, though, is what the president had to say about certain types of technology. Listen to this. OBAMA: This class is graduating at a time of great difficulty for America and for the world. You're entering a job market, in an era of heightened international competition, with an economy that's still rebounding from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. You're accepting your degrees as America still wages two wars; wars that many in your generation have been fighting. And meanwhile, you're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank that high on the truth meter. And with iPods and iPads; and Xboxes and PlayStations; none of which I know how to work; information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment, rather than a tool of empowerment, rather than the means of emancipation. So all of this is not only putting pressure on you; it's putting new pressure on our country and on our democracy. Blog Promo . AZUZ: Okay, it's your turn. We want to know what you think about this. Not everyone has an iPad or an iPod, but we've almost all played video games. You've grown up with computers in your classes, many of you. Do you agree with the president that the information you get from these things is a distraction? Or do you think you learn something from them? Talk to us today at CNNStudentNews.com! We're looking forward to seeing what you have to say. Before We Go . AZUZ: When I told a friend today that our last story was about clogging, she wanted to know what people were clogging. In this case, shoes! The event may not feature the fanciest of footwork. But when it comes to sheer numbers, it stomped the old record -- that was 425 people dancing for less than five minutes. This, this event, included more than 2,500 stepped out for more than six minutes. They clogged the streets with victory. Goodbye . AZUZ: ...that all depended on de-feet.

"(CNN Student News) -- May 3, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Times Square, New York • Arkansas & Tennessee • Arizona . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, MAYOR, NEW YORK CITY: Let me say that we are very lucky. Thanks to alert New Yorkers and professional police officers, we avoided what could have been a very deadly event. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: That story out of New York City leading off our show today. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News. First Up: Times Square . AZUZ: Things are more or less back to normal in New York's Times Square. The area was put on lockdown for a while over the weekend, and here is why: Saturday night, someone left an SUV with the engine running on the street. A T-shirt vendor noticed it, saw smoke coming out of it, told a nearby police officer. The officer looked inside and spotted what authorities think might have been a bomb. That's what triggered the lockdown. Times Square is usually filled with tourists and people going to the theater. Authorities immediately evacuated the area. You can see some of that in this iReport. Some people were moved out of Times Square. Others were kept inside the hotels or theaters they were already in. Eventually, the bomb squad was called in. That's the guy in the gray suit just to the left of center of your screen there. Inside the SUV, they found a device made from gasoline cans, propane tanks, fireworks and electric clocks. Police say it apparently didn't work. Instead of exploding, it just filled the SUV with smoke. The vehicle was taken out of Times Square yesterday. Officials have started an investigation into the whole thing. They're checking the vehicle and its contents for fingerprints. They're going over surveillance footage and amateur videos from Times Square to see if they can identify who left the SUV there. Authorities are treating this incident as a potential terrorist attack. Gulf Coast Oil Spill . AZUZ: Next stop, Louisiana. Officials there are making some predictions about an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Ken Salazar, the secretary of the interior, is warning the region to prepare for the worst. Several government officials think the leak could continue for weeks. The fishing industry in part of the Gulf will be shut down for at least 10 days. All of this started with an explosion on an offshore oil rig last month. The rig sank; it caused a leak. And now, more than a million and a half gallons of oil have spilled into the Gulf. The Coast Guard and the company that owns the rig are both doing what they can to contain this spill. President Obama, who visited the region yesterday, says those efforts will keep going for as long as it takes. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I'm not going to rest, and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest or be satisfied, until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil on the gulf is contained and cleaned up, and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods. Currently, the most advanced technology available is being used to try and stop a leak that is more than 5,000 feet under the surface. Because this leak is unique and unprecedented, it could take many days to stop. That's why we're also using every resource available to stop the oil from coming ashore and mitigating the damage it could cause. Severe Storms . AZUZ: North from the Gulf Coast, a couple states are recovering from severe weather. Parts of Arkansas were hit by heavy storms, possible tornadoes on Friday. One person was killed. About two dozen others were hurt. Meanwhile, ""extremely dangerous"" flooding in Tennessee is responsible for at least five deaths over the weekend. Nashville got between 6 and 10 inches of rain in just 12 hours on Saturday. The city's mayor called it ""one of the most severe rain events Nashville has ever experienced."" He urged people to stay home and off the roads. There was more rain in the forecast for Tennessee yesterday. Teacher Appreciation Week . AZUZ: Well, it's time to give a little thanks to your teachers! This is Teacher Appreciation Week. And to celebrate, we want you to head to our blog and talk about your favorites. But put some thought into this one. Tell us how your teachers make a difference in your lives. It could be by showing you CNN Student News. If you want to go for some extra credit, and we know you want some extra credit, send us an iReport for Teacher Appreciation Week. You can do it all at CNNStudentNews.com. Immigration Reform . AZUZ: The issue of immigration getting a lot of attention right now. Part of the reason seems to be a new law in Arizona. We covered that last week. The law requires any immigrants in Arizona to have immigration documents with them at all times. It also requires police to question anyone who might be in the U.S. illegally. Over the weekend, thousands of people protested the Arizona law. Officials said 50,000 people marched in this demonstration in Los Angeles. There were similar protests in New York, Washington and Arizona. Critics of the law argue it will lead to racial profiling. They claim police will question people about their immigration status based mostly on their race. Now, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is working to address that criticism by making some changes to the law. She signed those changes into effect Friday. This is the big difference. Originally, police officers in Arizona could stop anyone based simply on a ""reasonable suspicion"" that they might be in the country illegally. Now, officers can only ask people about their immigration status while the officers are enforcing some other law; maybe speeding, maybe loitering. Governor Brewer says the changes ""make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated in Arizona."" Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Killey's social studies classes at Haven Middle School in Evanston, Illinois! What type of musician is most likely to perform a cappella? You know what to do! Is it a: A) Cellist, B) Guitarist, C) Drummer or D) Singer? You've got three seconds -- GO! Since a cappella means ""without instrumental support,"" a singer is the right choice here. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Virtual Choir . AZUZ: Nearly 200 singers raised their voices in a choir performance recently. They didn't need any instrumental support, but they did get some help from technology. When the curtain went up, they weren't really there! John Vennavally-Rao takes note of how the ethereal ensemble came together. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN VENNAVALLY-RAO, REPORTER, CTV NEWS, TORONTO: At first, it may seem strange that Patrick Murray is all alone, given choirs are all about making music together. PATRICK MURRAY [SINGING IN LATIN]: Singing ""Lux Aurumque."" VENNAVALLY-RAO: The 20-year-old music major at the University of Toronto, singing to his computer a popular choral piece called ""Lux Aurumque."" MURRAY: I recorded a video on my webcam along with the audio and then uploaded it to YouTube. VENNAVALLY-RAO: On its own, a rather ordinary video. But Karen Koh of Singapore did the same. So did Steven Hansen in Sweden. And Melody Myers of Tennessee. Videos that kept coming in on YouTube, the different parts of the same song. MELODY MYERS OF TENNESSEE, [SINGING IN LATIN]: Singing ""Lux Aurumque"" VENNAVALLY-RAO: All singing to an instructional video from composer-conductor Eric Whitacre. MURRAY: Everybody had to sync up their video to his video at the start of this beep. VENNAVALLY-RAO: Producer Scott Haines put all those clips together; this, the extraordinary result: the conductor and the 185 voices on YouTube. MURRAY: These people are from everywhere. 12 different countries represented in this video. VENNAVALLY-RAO: A choir unlike any other. MURRAY: There are people in Austria in this video. I've never been to Austria and maybe I never will, but here I am in this video singing with someone in Austria. VENNAVALLY-RAO: Composer Whitacre wrote he found the final product overwhelming. The poetic symbolism about our shared humanity and the need to connect. MURRAY: All you needed to participate was a webcam and a microphone. I think it's the future of creating music. VENNAVALLY-RAO: And Whitcare says he hopes to one day compose an original piece for the virtual choir with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people singing alone, together. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"(CNN)  -- Jorge Lorenzo continued his charge towards a maiden MotoGP world title with his seventh victory of the season in the Czech Grand Prix in Brno. The 23-year-old Spaniard held off compatriot and pole sitter Dani Pedrosa with Australia's former world champion Casey Stoner completing the podium. Reigning world champion and Lorenzo's Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi continued his remarkable comeback after a broken leg by claiming fifth. Yamaha has dominated this season with Lorenzo drawing level with the record held by Michael Doohan and Giacomo Agostino of finishing first or second in the first 10 races of the season in motorcyling's elite category. ""It was a very difficult day as I had crashed in qualifying so my confidence was not so high. The wind made it difficult for the riders but for me its a fantastic win,"" he told the official MotoGP website. Rossi signs for Ducati in two-year deal . Honda's Pedrosa was overtaken by Pedrosa on the first of the 22 laps and had to settle for second. He trails Lorenzo by 77 points in the title race. 2007 world champion Stoner was content to settle for third after a late change to the set-up of his Ducati on the morning of the race. Ben Spies of the United States finished fourth, just ahead of Rossi with two more Americans, Nicky Hayden and Colin Edwards, in sixth and seventh. A massive crowd of nearly 150,000 saw a Spanish hat-trick in the championship races. Toni Elias won the Moto2 category with Nicolas Terol leading a Spanish clean sweep of the podium in the 125cc race.","Jorge Lorenzo wins Czech MotoGP in Brno for his seventh win of the season .

"(CNN) -- Nick Heidfeld has left his role as reserve driver at Mercedes to become a tester for Pirelli ahead of the Italian company's return to Formula One as the sport's sole tire supplier next year. The 33-year-old German had driven in F1 for a decade but was left without a seat when BMW ended its association with the Sauber team at the end of last season. He was given a lifeline when Mercedes took over the world champion Brawn GP team this year, becoming back-up to returning seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg. ""I would like to thank Ross Brawn, Norbert Haug and Nick Fry for allowing me the opportunity to become Pirelli's official test driver,"" Heidfeld told F1's official website. ""The team has always said that they would not stand in my way if such a chance arose, and they have kindly allowed me to take up this exciting new role."" Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn said: ""Nick is an extremely experienced driver and we are confident that his racing knowledge and technical feedback will prove extremely useful to Pirelli and therefore of benefit to the sport as a whole."" Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Haug said the move might help Heidfeld find a drive for 2011. ""It would be great to see Nick in a competitive car in next year's world championship and I am sure his leading role in the new tire development, in addition to his skills, puts him in a good position for the remaining seats in 2011,"" Haug said. ""There could be no more experienced and knowledgeable driver in the cockpit to steer the tire development for next season. We thank Nick for his contribution to our team over the last nine months and wish him well with his new challenge."" Pirelli will begin testing this week in a Toyota TF109 car from last season, with Bridgestone stepping aside at the end of 2010. The Milan-based company has not been involved in F1 since 1991, but has landed a three-year contract to provide all teams with tires to go with its exclusive deals with motorcycling's World Superbike and British Superbike categories.","Nick Heidfeld has become a tester for F1's 2011 sole tire supplier Pirelli .

"(CNN Student News) -- May 24, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Panama City, Florida • Shanghai & Beijing, China • West Point, New York . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: May 24th, 1844: The first telegraph message was sent. May 24th, 2010: You can watch CNN Student News on TV, online and on iTunes. A lot changes over 150 years. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's do this. First Up: Gulf Coast Oil Spill . AZUZ: Construction delays, permit problems, the threat of hurricanes: Officials in Panama City, Florida have dealt with a lot of problems to open up a new airport. Here's a new one: a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. We've talked about some of the different industries that this thing is affecting. Tourism is a big one, especially in Panama City. This new airport is expected to bring in millions of dollars. The problem is, people are worried about how clean the water is, and those concerns might keep them away from the region. The spill is more than 100 miles away from Panama City's coastline, but officials are keeping a close eye on it. RANDY CURTIS, PANAMA CITY BAY COUNTY AIRPORT: Well, certainly it's something we've watched very closely. And fortunately, we've not had any impacts in this part of Florida and the Gulf with the oil itself. So, we are open for business. DAN ROWE, PANAMA CITY BEACH VISITORS BUREAU: This airport is a great opportunity for us to showcase the region. And you know, we will get through the oil spill. There's no oil on Panama City beach or any of the beaches in northwest Florida now, but we do need to continue to get the word out that this is a great place to come to visit and the airport is a means to get there. AZUZ: Last week, we told you about something called a ""top kill."" This animation shows how it would work. Engineers would pump this special mud into the leaking well. They hope that would stop the flow of oil. Then, they can seal the whole thing with cement. Officials had hoped to try that yesterday. Didn't happen. They're now looking at giving it a shot tomorrow or Wednesday. Recently, some CNN iReporters sent in their ideas about how to deal with this spill. CNN asked Bill Nye the Science Guy to take a look at their suggestions. He's is, as we said, the science expert. He actually used to deal with oil spills. Check out his reaction to the iReports. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN IREPORTER: You slide this in place on the hole's stopper, going up the pressure which will plug that gap. You then drill several fastening bolts to fasten it in place. And at this stage, basically, all you need do is either tap into the pipe through the dam and pump in the golf balls, the rubber, the crap that will flow down and block. NYE: As soon as somebody says drill through here, you're really in trouble. The stuff is unbelievably hard and it's broken. It's brittle. I mean, when you start to drill through it, it will just crack and you'll have this crack propagate up and down the pipe. And the leak will actually get even more difficult to deal with. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN IREPORTER: As you can see, this is simulating an oil spill in the water. And you just sprinkle some sand on it. As you can see, immediately the sand is absorbing the oil and bringing the oil down to the bottom, which makes the top very clear. NYE: Yes, yes, this is great. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN IREPORTER: It doesn't take the sand for it to absorb. NYE: So, here's the problem. A lot of people don't want tar on the bottom of the ocean either. And the amount of sand involved, when you have an oil spill that's 10 nautical miles by 20 nautical miles, ends up to be a very large amount of sand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, CNN IREPORTER: You got two scenarios here. We think, first of all, you can actually disperse this on the spill that's out there now. You soak up the oil that's out there now. You've got skimmers coming along and skim up the hay or use the shrimp boats with their nets, something along that line. Or if it washes up on shore, it's going to be just like seaweed, and you can take traditional beach cleaning equipment and just pick it up. NYE: Hay. They're suggesting hay. Hay might work pretty well too. And oil just sticks to that material. Just sticks to it. If you can get that stuff out there and that's what, when I worked on oil slick skimming boats, that's what we used. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Estrada's language arts classes at Summerour Middle School in Norcross, Georgia! What U.S. government position have John Negroponte, J.M. McConnell and Dennis Blair all held?  Is it: A) Ambassador to the U.N., B) Director of national intelligence, C) Secretary of state or D) Attorney general? You've got three seconds -- GO! Those are the first three directors of national intelligence. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Intelligence Director Resigns . AZUZ: Well now, President Obama is looking for the fourth director of national intelligence. Dennis Blair, who's held the job since January of 2009, resigned late last week. The director of national intelligence -- the job itself -- has been around for about 5 years. It's the person responsible for collecting information from a bunch of government agencies -- including the CIA, the FBI and the Homeland Security Department -- and using all that information to create a single National Intelligence Program. Mr. Blair announced his resignation last Thursday. His office had been criticized recently for not coordinating intelligence efforts well enough and not stopping an attempted terrorist attack in advance. Blair's resignation will be effective at the end of this week. Clinton in China . AZUZ: Some other big names in the Obama administration are over in China. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading a group of more than 200 officials to Beijing for talks with the Chinese government. They're going to be going over a lot of topics, the biggest one is trade. It's something that Secretary Clinton talked about yesterday when she met with Chinese business leaders in Shanghai. That city is hosting the World Expo. It's kind of like the Olympics for economics, science and technology. Secretary Clinton is urging China to allow American companies more freedom to compete with Chinese companies in China. She says that when there's a level playing field, both countries win. Spoken Word . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The threat will not go away soon. But let's be clear: al Qaeda and its affiliates are small men on the wrong side of history. They lead no nation. They lead no religion. We need not give in to fear every time a terrorist tries to scare us. We should not discard our freedoms because extremists try to exploit them. We cannot succumb to division because others try to drive us apart. We are the United States of America. West Point Graduation . AZUZ: The president, speaking there during the graduation ceremonies at the United States Military Academy in West Point. During his speech to the cadets, the president talked about some of the challenges that they and the country face in the fight against terrorism. This is the 9th West Point graduation since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. President Obama says that while the war on terror has changed in that time, it's still just as important, and he pointed out that the country is united in its support of its troops. The president also talked about diversity at West Point. This year's graduating class marked a milestone at the academy. It's the first time that the number one overall cadet and the valedictorian are both female. Teen Climbs Everest . AZUZ: Another milestone to tell you about now. Jordan Romero, the guy you see over my shoulder, is on top of the world! He made it the top of Mount Everest on Saturday -- you don't get any higher than that -- and he's just 13 years old! That is the kicker. Jordan has already climbed six of the so-called ""Seven Summits,"" the tallest mountains on every continent. During his climb up Everest, he stopped to talk about the experience. JORDAN ROMERO, 13-YEAR-OLD CLIMBED MT. EVEREST: It's Mount Everest. It's a tough mountain and the altitude is tough; it's so physically and technically hard. And there's a lot of new things I've been wanting from this whole trip. I've been able to see Mount Everest from wherever I go. I'm already happy with that. I've been learning a lot about culture, politics, religion, people, everything about Nepal and China. So, it's been such a great trip and I've learned so much from it. Before We Go . AZUZ: Including how to wear incredibly heavy coats. Now before we go, a lot of world championships are decided out on the field. This one is played out in a barn. Still, the competition is fierce at the World Pinball Championships. Every contestant has a different approach. Some are smooth and steady. Some like this guy turned the whole thing into a dance recital. The guy's been playing this for 35 years, so who are we to question the pinball wizard. When it comes to the player with the best technique... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...we couldn't really pin it down. Time for us to stop flapper-ing our gums and tilt on out of here. If you don't get those pinball references, your teachers might. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. We'll see ya tomorrow.","Soak up some analysis of what may and may not help clean up an oil spill .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's North African wing, known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, said it is responsible for last week's kidnapping of five French nationals in Niger, the Arabic-language news network Al-Jazeera reported Tuesday. The news agency broadcast an audio recording of a voice it identified as that of Salah Abou Mohammed, a spokesman for AQIM. CNN was not immediately able to independently confirm the report. ""Even though security was tight in the location and the security guards were many, the soldiers of Islam took control of all security and kidnapped five French nuclear experts that work at the company Areva. And we claim responsibility for this blessed operation,"" he said, as reported by al-Jazeera. ""And we would like to tell the French government that the mujahedeen will make their demands soon. We warn you against taking any unwise actions."" Seven people linked to a French nuclear energy company were kidnapped in the West African nation of Niger last week. An employee of Areva and his wife were among those abducted in the northern town of Arlit, the company has said. Areva has been mining uranium for decades in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world. The other five were subcontractors who worked for the French construction firm Vinci, Leila Touiti, a company spokeswoman has said. Five of the abducted are French nationals, French foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero has told reporters. It was not immediately clear Tuesday whether AQIM was also claiming responsibility for the other two hostages.","Al Qaeda's North African wing claims responsibility, Al-Jazeera reports .

"(CNN)  -- Former European champions Feyenoord suffered an astonishing 10-0 defeat to Dutch league leaders PSV Eindhoven on Sunday. The Rotterdam side are one of the traditional powerhouses of Netherlands' football but find themselves second bottom with coach Mario Been under intense pressure. This latest humiliation, easily the worst result in their history, they were beaten 8-2 by arch-rivals Ajax in 1982, came at PSV's Phillips Stadium. Their cause was not helped by the red card for Kelvin Leerdam after 34 minutes when they were a solitary goal behind through Jonathan Reis, who went on to grab a hat-trick. Jeremain Lens (2), Balazs Dzsudzsak (2), Ibrahim Afellay, Ola Toivonen and Orlando Engelaar also scored for the table toppers. But the immediate future looks bleak for both Been and Feyenoord, who have won 14 Dutch titles, 11 Dutch Cups to go with their 1970 European Cup triumph and two UEFA Cup crowns. Been told the official Feyenoord website that it was a ""dark day in the club's history."" Fellow Dutch giants PSV have achieved a 10-goal victory margin twice in their history against the Go Ahead Eagles and FC Volendam in 1973 and 1998 respectively.

"(CNN) -- Indonesia has urged Saudi Arabia to take legal action against a Saudi employer accused of grossly abusing an Indonesian maid, Indonesian government officials said Thursday. The 23-year-old woman is recovering in a Saudi hospital after being severely beaten, according to Indonesian consulate officials. The Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry said Thursday that it had followed up on the case, which has outraged many in Indonesia. ""At first, we already called the Saudi Arabia ambassador here in Jakarta a few days ago to the ministry, and at that occasion we expressed the position of the Indonesian government, which condemns the act, inhumane act, against our nationals,"" ministry spokesman Michael Tene said. ""We also ask the Saudi government to ensure that they will be responsible for that and take appropriate action according to the law."" Sumiati binti Mustapa Salan went to work in Saudi Arabia four months ago to support her family in a small fishing village in Indonesia. She was tortured since the first day of her employment in a Medina household, said Didi Wahyudri, Indonesia's citizen protection consul in Saudi Arabia. ""She was beaten badly. But she is recovering,"" Wahyudri said. A migrant rights group and Indonesian officials have said Sumiati also suffered from cuts to her face and possibly burns from an iron. ""We are asking for justice,"" said Wahyudri, who added that Indonesian officials had reported the case to Saudi police. Sumiati has been hospitalized since November 6 at the King Fahd Hospital in Medina. CNN was not able to reach Saudi officials for comment. Offices were closed because of Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage. Sumiati's case is one of several involving Asian migrant workers in Middle Eastern nations that have made headlines in recent months. Last summer, doctors removed nails that had been hammered into the body of a Sri Lankan maid, allegedly by her Saudi employers. Human rights groups have expressed alarm about the poor treatment of these workers, though it has been difficult to document abuses of domestic workers that take place behind closed doors in private homes. A Human Rights Watch report earlier this year said migrant domestic workers often face isolation and forced confinement that contribute to psychological, physical and sexual violence, forced labor and trafficking. Nisha Varia, a senior researcher for women's rights at Human Rights Watch, said the problem is compounded by the fact that Saudi labor laws do not cover migrant workers and, often in such cases, justice has been slow or non-existent. ""The overall justice system is riddled with problems,"" Varia said. ""It's not good for Saudis. It's much worse for migrant women."" On top of that, once a woman reports a case of abuse, she is then held at a shelter in her nation's embassy until the case is resolved, said Varia, who has visited such shelters in several Middle Eastern nations. Often, a woman could be held for months, maybe years, without being allowed to work, which deters many women from reporting abuse, Varia said. Millions of workers from Asian countries travel to the Middle East to make money and shed lives in their homeland that are rooted in poverty. Sumiati was one of them, according to the Jakarta Globe newspaper. It reported that her parents were unable to support her and her four siblings and in July, after she graduated from high school, Sumiati left for Saudi Arabia with the help of a labor recruiting agency. A statement from a migrant rights group said Sumiati's abusers ought to be punished. It urged the Indonesian government to take appropriate action on her behalf. The Indonesian government said it plans to send to Sumiati's uncle to Saudi Arabia to be with her for moral support, the state-run Antara News Agency reported, adding that the government will help bring her back home. CNN's Moni Basu and Lucia Isman contributed to this report.","The woman is recovering after being severely beaten .

"(CNN Student News) -- April 30, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Gulf of Mexico • Santa Clara, California . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Arbor Day is awesome! Especially when it falls on a Friday. To celebrate, we are branching out into a bunch of topics in today's show. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get to it. First Up: Oil Update . AZUZ: The federal government will use ""every single available resource"" to help contain that oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The secretary of Homeland Security declared it an incident of ""national significance."" What that means is that resources from other parts of the country can be used to try and control the spill. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal already declared a state of emergency to help free up resources for the effort. Yesterday afternoon, the oil was about 16 miles off the Louisiana coast and headed toward shore. When it does start hitting the coast, it could threaten hundreds of species of wildlife: birds, shrimp, crabs, otters. In fact, the entire Gulf Coast fishing industry could be affected. Yesterday, we told you that the Coast Guard was going to try and contain part of the spill by setting it on fire. They did; you can see the smoke from that fire right here. They were hoping to set another controlled burn yesterday, but the weather wasn't cooperating. Some authorities think this spill is getting worse, much worse. At first, the estimate was that the spill was leaking out about a thousand barrels of oil per day. Now, the Coast Guard is saying that's increased to as many as 5,000 barrels. That's more than 200,000 gallons per day. Financial Reform . AZUZ: The Senate is ready to debate a financial reform bill. When you hear the word debate, you mighty think of people being on opposite sides of something. This time, everyone agrees! They all want to debate. Republicans and Democrats had been working on this bill in private sessions. They disagreed on some parts of it, and the Republicans -- plus a few Democrats -- blocked it from moving forward until those differences could be worked out. Late Wednesday, they changed their minds. Every senator, Republican and Democrat, voted to start debate. Immigration Reform . AZUZ: The Senate's looking at taking up another controversial issue: immigration reform. Some Democratic senators were planning to release a new proposal late yesterday. It would increase the number of border patrol officers and make it tougher to hire illegal workers. Plus, it outlines a process to legalize the millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. One Republican leader says the proposal is just an attempt to get voters out for November's midterm elections. He says there's no chance that immigration reform will move through Congress. Some Democratic sources say the same thing, that the odds of this passing the Senate this year are pretty slim. Word to the Wise . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... calorie (noun) a unit of energy or heat that is often associated with food . Fast Food . AZUZ: Your body needs calories for energy; they fuel everything you do. But if you get too many of them or don't burn them off with exercise, those calories can turn to fat. Lawmakers in part of California say that some fast food kids' meals have too many calories. They believe one way to discourage kids from wanting those meals is to ban the toys that come with them. So, the new rule in Santa Clara, California: kids' meals with more than 485 calories get no toy. Kids' meals with less calories can still include the toy. There are also limits on fat and sodium, or salt. One lawmaker says this will help fight childhood obesity and ""breaks the link between unhealthy food and prizes."" But the California Restaurant Association thinks the rule goes too far, and some critics say parents should be responsible for what their children eat. Blog Promo . AZUZ: This led us to consider a question that's kind of like the video game question we asked the other day: Who's responsible here? Who should decide on calories? Is it the government? Should restaurants be responsible? Should parents be responsible? Go to our blog, tell us your opinion. The address: CNNStudentNews.com. This Day in History . (ON SCREEN GRAPHIC) April 30, 1789 - George Washington is inaugurated as first president of the United States . April 30, 1803 - Negotiations conclude on Louisiana Purchase, which doubles the size of the United States . April 30, 1975 - South Vietnam surrenders to the North, ending the Vietnam War; remaining Americans are evacuated from Saigon . Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to everyone whose parents serve in the U.S. Armed Forces! What branch of the U.S. military was founded first? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it the: A) Army, B) Navy, C) Air Force or D) Marines? You've got three seconds -- GO! The U.S. Army was established first, way back in June of 1775. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Military Child . AZUZ: The Month of the Military Child pays tribute to people whose parents serve in all branches of the military. 1.7 million American kids have a parent who serves, and this month recognizes their sacrifices; for example, when your mom or dad is away for months at a time. Sandra Endo shows us how the military is helping families stay in touch. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: So, where's your daddy at? AMARI LUNN, MILITARY CHILD: On a ship. ENDO: On a ship? ENDO: Three-year-old Amari Lunn can't wait for daddy to come home. FAINA LUNN, MARRIED TO U.S. NAVAL OFFICER: I have to explain to him that daddy's working. But he's like, ""But when is daddy coming home?"" ENDO: Daddy is Navy Chief Gary Lunn, currently on the USS Dwight Eisenhower, deployed in the North Arabian Sea. Lunn has been deployed for six months; his family eagerly awaits his return. F. LUNN: Where do you see daddy? Do you see daddy on the TV? A. LUNN: Yeah. ENDO: This is Lunn's 9th deployment. But this one is different thanks to a program his kids affectionately call the ""Daddy Show."" F. LUNN: Press play. Back up so you can see daddy. ENDO: Through a non-profit program called United Through Reading, deployed service members can choose a book and record videos from their base to read aloud to their children. CHIEF GARY LUNN, U.S. NAVY: Today, I'm going to read, the book is called ""The Ear Book."" A. LUNN: ""The Ear Book!"" ENDO: Programs like this one that help keep families connected are becoming increasingly popular in the military. When service members with kids are deployed for long stretches, psychologists say it's the children who feel it the most. LYNETTE FRAGA, ZERO TO THREE: Some children may withdraw and you have a difficult time talking about their experience. Or some children are very aggressive and you might see them crying a lot or having trouble sleeping. ENDO: But with these videos, smiles often replace tears, especially for the Lunn family. ROMELLO LOVINSKY, MILITARY CHILD: It's, like, better because I get to see him and he'll get to talk with me and stuff on the videos. ENDO: Do you see a difference in your kids? F. LUNN: Yes, yes. Now, he thinks daddy's around more. ENDO: It's also a major morale boost for the parent serving far away. G. LUNN: I know it's helping me out a lot, especially knowing the response that's coming from it. Just mentally, calming me down and enabling me to stay focused at my job. I love you. I love all of you. Muah! A. LUNN: Muah! ENDO: With the country engaged in two wars and many service members facing multiple deployments, the military is expanding and promoting programs which help ease the strain on families. Sandra Endo, CNN, Norfolk, Virginia. (END VIDEO) Comments . AZUZ: Okay, at Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews, a student named Adrian called our attention to the Month of the Military Child. He told us about his experience as one -- the service and the sacrifice -- and we asked for your experiences as well. Cory described it as an adventure, just by moving around and making new friends along the way. Ryan says it can be hard to keep friendships with the frequent moves, but that he's grown up learning respect and flexibility. Nate says the hardest part is the time his dad spends away from home, but that he couldn't be any more proud as his son. And Kevin says it's hard because his family makes sacrifices, but it's for a big cause. We thank and salute all of you military kids out there for your sacrifices. Before We Go . AZUZ: And before we leave you today, you've heard of electronic music. This would be the literal version: a mechanical marimba player. He's not just banging out some pre-planned tune, either. This is jazz, and he's improvising, learning what his fellow musicians are doing and then adapting to it. At least, that's what they claim. Now, before any of you get worried about robots ruling the music industry, the point here is the interaction: man and machine working together. Goodbye . AZUZ: And that sounds just fine to us, because do you really think a robots-only band would play jazz? There's no chance. They'd totally be metal. Sunday starts National Teacher Appreciation Week.

"(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso set the pace during practice for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. The Spaniard was quickest in both the morning and afternoon sessions as his rivals for the drivers' championship lagged behind. Alonso posted a lap of two minutes, 0.797 seconds in a rain-hit morning session but improved to record a second lap of one minute, 49.032 seconds in the more favorable afternoon conditions. Force India's Adrian Sutil was 0.125 seconds behind Alonso, while McLaren's Lewis Hamilton came third. Drivers' championship leader Mark Webber was left trailing by a full 2.6 seconds. Webber told Formula One's official website: ""Today was a bit of a messy day with the changing conditions, but it was actually pretty good for us. We got some good information to go through and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. ""There are a few quick guys out there, but we're not slow either. It's hard to get a feel for what everyone's doing with the changing weather. It's a beautiful track here, it's special - today we got to sample it in all conditions."" After the morning session was dominated by rain, the afternoon stint was delayed by a red flag, then concerns for the crowd after spectators appeared to climb onto fences for a better view of the track. It led to a chaotic end to the final session, but Alonso managed to complete his quickest lap of the day shortly before time ran out. Alonso told the Formula One website: ""The impression one gets on Friday does not always get confirmed on Saturday and Sunday, therefore we have to evaluate today's results with a lot of care. ""Having said that, it has definitely been a positive day, because the car seems to respond well in all track conditions that we encountered today."" Renault's Robert Kubica came fourth, Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa was fifth, Sebastian Vettel came sixth in the Red Bull, while Jenson Button was seventh overall -- four places behind McLaren teammate Hamilton. ""The weather made it a bit of an up-and-down day,"" Hamilton said. ""It started off very wet, so we didn't do too much running in the morning. But we got a few more laps this afternoon on the intermediates and then the option tire. ""Because the rules don't allow us to use too many wet-weather tires - we only have three extremes and four intermediates - we really need to look after them, so we were very cautious, just in case we need to use them later on in the weekend. ""We're definitely making small steps forward. This track does seem to suit our car better [than in Hungary], but let's not get ahead of ourselves. ""If it rains, then we seem to be competitive, but we have realistic expectations for this weekend - I didn't score in the last race, so it's important that we get more points on the board on Sunday.""","Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso is quickest in practice for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Tuesday that Wayne Rooney wants to leave the English Premier League club in a series of interviews aimed at ending speculation over the soccer star's future. ""We cannot quite understand why he would want to leave,"" Ferguson told reporters, revealing he had first known in August that Rooney would not sign a new contract. ""We don't understand it. I can't answer any questions about why he is doing it. ""We can speculate. We can have opinions. It won't matter a dickie-bird, simply because the player is adamant he wants to leave. We have to deal with the next part of that, which we will do, as best we can, in relation to this request. ""I can do no more than I have said at the moment because we still, to my mind, have the door open."" Has Wayne Rooney made the right decision? Rumors had been building that the striker had refused to extend his United deal -- which expires in mid-2012 -- following an apparent rift with Ferguson, with the player having publicly contradicted the Scot in statements about his fitness. Ferguson has rarely selected Rooney in his starting line-up since newspaper reports emerged last month with claims about alleged marital infidelities, at first saying he was protecting the player and then that he had an ankle injury. Read CNN World Sport anchor Alex Thomas' Twitter feed . But the 24-year-old last week said he has had no fitness problems this season after returning to action in England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro, sparking widespread reports that he was unhappy with Ferguson. ""Why he was saying he wasn't injured, you can only guess yourself. It's disappointing,"" Ferguson told the United website on Tuesday. ""We've never had any argument, not a bit. I think you have to understand the mechanics of these situations when people want to leave the club. It's an easy one to say he's fallen out with the manager, a very easy one to say."" Ferguson said United chief executive David Gill had begun new contract negotiations with Rooney before the World Cup started in June. ""David, in the early part of the summer, had opened talks with his agent. And that was to be continued after the World Cup,"" Ferguson said. ""I was in the office on August 14 when David told me he'd had a call from his agent saying that Wayne wasn't going to sign his contract. So then David came across to see me. He said he couldn't believe it and neither could I. ""I was dumbfounded, I couldn't understand it at all because only months before he'd said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life. We just don't know what's changed the boy's mind. David was shocked, I was shocked. ""I had a meeting with the boy and he reiterated what his agent had said. He wanted to go. I said to him, 'Just remember one thing: respect this club. I don't want any nonsense from you, respect your club.' ""What we're seeing now in the media is disappointing because we've done everything we can for Wayne Rooney, since the minute he's come to the club. We've always been there as a harbor for him. Any time he's been in trouble, the advice we've given him -- I've even been prepared to give him financial advice, many times."" No January signings, say Real Madrid . Ferguson opted to rest Rooney for the match against his former club Everton in the light of newspaper allegations that the player had slept with prostitutes. Rooney then played in the Champions League clash with Scottish club Rangers, but came off with an injury. ""He got an ankle injury in the Rangers game. He was seen clearly hobbling at halftime. He confirmed it himself in an interview with Sky,"" Ferguson told reporters at another press conference. ""My idea, based on the fact he wasn't playing that well, was to leave him out of the Sunderland game, make sure his ankle is properly prepared for the next game, and give him a 10-day recovery so he could play for England."" Ferguson said he decided to clear the air by talking publicly because the situation was affecting United's on-field performances, most recently dropping points against promoted West Brom on Saturday. Van Der Sar gifts West Brom a point . ""There's been no falling out. That's why we need to clarify the situation now for our fans. Because what we saw on Saturday was unacceptable. When we were at 2-2 and the fans were chanting for Wayne Rooney, it put pressure on the players and it didn't do any good for the team. ""So we've got to clarify the situation and try to do it right. There's no [specific] offer on the table for Wayne [at the moment]. ""Of course. David's prepared to offer the best terms possible for any player in the country. We realize and recognize the quality of the player, that's why negotiations were started early summer, two years before his contract was up, to extend that contract. And also extend at the behest of the player itself. ""He said he wanted to stay for life. We were honoring that request from Wayne to stay at the club, at the club he loved. He said the best thing he'd ever done was to sign for Manchester United. ""So David was prepared, with the discussions with our owners, to offer Wayne the best contract that anyone could have in the country."" Meanwhile, Rooney has been ruled out of Wednesday's home Champions League clash with Turkish club Bursaspor after suffering another ankle injury in training. He was stretchered off the pitch in the morning session, meaning he joins veteran Ryan Giggs, defender Jonny Evans and striker Michael Owen on the sidelines. United's website said the extent of Rooney's injury was not yet known.","Alex Ferguson reveals that Wayne Rooney said in August he would not sign a new deal .

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- A suspected serial shooter is keeping a city in southern Sweden on edge. Police say as many as 15 shootings in Malmo over the last year may be linked to a single perpetrator who is targeting immigrants living in the city. Investigators have no suspects. The shootings have all been well planned, under the protection of darkness and at places familiar to the shooter, according to CNN's Swedish affiliate TV4, citing police. Several of the shootings have occurred in recent weeks, police say. On Thursday evening, two immigrant women were wounded when shot through their apartment window. ""I'm almost afraid of turning on the light in my apartment at night now,"" Shukrije Berisha, who lives in the same building, told the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet. In similar incidents, two men of an ""ethnic minority background"" were recently shot while waiting at bus stops, according to police. One of them ""was lucky to be alive after being shot in the torso,"" Malmo police superintendent Hans Nilsson told CNN. ""The shooter was most likely waiting in the bushes before firing his weapon,"" Nilsson said. Victim Basi Hassan told TV4, ""I was standing here at the bus stop when I suddenly heard a shot. I don't know where it came from. Then I saw my own blood and I started feeling dizzy."" The latest report of a shooting came late Friday evening, when a male immigrant reported he was shot at while riding his bicycle. The Swedish National Murder Commission and the Swedish National Criminal Police have launched a major operation together with local police to find the gunman. A group of psychologists is trying to profile the shooter's behavior before, during and after the attacks. Police have also increased the number of officers and K-9 units patrolling the city. In Malmo, where nearly a third of the residents are immigrants, many now fear for their safety. One 17-year-old girl, identified only as Fatima, told TV4 that she refuses to go to school by bicycle or bus and will only travel by car now. ""I couldn't sleep last night. I just couldn't stop thinking about it,"" she said. The shootings also bring back memories of Sweden's ""Laser-man,"" a shooter who was targeting immigrants in Stockholm in the 1990s with a laser-aimed rifle. ""We haven't had anything this big here in Sweden since the Laser-man was around,"" Nilsson said. The recent slew of shootings has also prompted a mobile phone text message that has circulated among Malmo's youth. According to Nilsson, the text states: ""A killer is loose in Malmo so stay indoors."" ""We are very clear that we are not behind this text message, but we can also understand that people are worried,"" he said. Malmo Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh says she is angered by the shootings. ""It is awful that people should have to be worried and feel fear for walking our streets,"" she said.","Shooter targeting immigrants, police say .

"Wichita, Kansas (CNN) -- A few years ago, Cessna, one of the most renowned names in aviation, was selling hundreds of multimillion-dollar airplanes annually. Then the recession hit. The company lost half of its orders and half of its jobs -- 6,000 jobs in Wichita alone. ""I think now every day we wake up, we feel we have to go out and earn our right to be that number-one manufacturer in general aviation,"" said Cessna CEO Jack Pelton.

"(CNN Student News) -- May 6, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Athens, Greece  • Chandeleur Islands, Louisiana • Sacramento, California . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News. Give us 10 minutes, we'll give you today's commercial-free headlines, starting with protests over in Greece. First Up: Greek Debt Crisis . AZUZ: The country has a massive debt. We're talking nearly $400 billion. That is bigger than the entire nation's economy. The Greek government is considering some plans to get try to that debt under control. Those plans include spending cuts, and those are not popular with a lot of workers. Yesterday, thousands of Greeks went on strike. They walked off the job because of the proposed cuts and they took to the streets to protest. This one is at the Greek parliament building. Lawmakers were inside going over those proposals to cut spending. The people outside are workers: teachers, doctors, transportation employees. They were demanding that members of parliament come outside and face them. Of course, police were out all over the country to deal with these protests. In some spots, that led to fighting between the police and the protesters. Some people in the crowds threw bottles, rocks and sticks at the officers. In the capital city of Athens, a fire bomb hit a bank, killing three people inside. Parliament lawmakers held a moment of silence for the victims. In terms of Greece's debt, the country is getting some help from the European Union. On Sunday, it agreed to an aid package worth $145 billion. But in order to get that package, Greece must adopt some of those cost-cutting measures that it's considering. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The U.S. government has a list of people who are not allowed on board airplanes. Legit! It's called the No Fly list. No-Fly . AZUZ: And the government is making some updates to it, specifically, how often airlines have to check it. This is based on changes to the No Fly list or when names are added to it. In the past, airlines had 24 hours to check the list after they were told about an update. Now, they'll have to do it within two hours. The goal of this is to prevent a repeat of what happened on Monday. That's when Faisal Shahzad, a suspect who's been arrested in connection with the failed bombing plot in Times Square, was allowed to get on a plane even though his name was on the No Fly list. Shahzad's name had been added to the list earlier in the day. But because it was within that old, 24-hour window, the airline hadn't checked the updated list when it sold him a ticket. As we told you yesterday, there were other things that did raise red flags, including the fact that Shahzad bought his ticket in cash. So, authorities were able to find and arrest him before his plane took off. Oil Spill . AZUZ: One leak down, two to go. BP says the smallest of three leaks in the Gulf of Mexico has been sealed. More than 200,000 gallons of oil have been leaking into the Gulf every day. Plans are now underway to stop the biggest leak. In the next few days, officials expect to place a pollution containment chamber -- the four-story, steel box you see right here -- over that leak. If it works, a second box will be used to cover the last leak. The plan is to collect the oil inside those boxes and then pipe it up to ships on the surface. Reports indicate that the oil is getting closer to shore. Miles of booms -- these sort of floating barriers -- have been put in place to try to control the spill. Gary Tuchman gives us a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEO) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're 35 miles south of Gulfport Mississippi. These are the Chandeleur Islands, actually in Louisiana waters, and right now you are looking at the oil that is threatening to come on this island. Protective boom's right here; this yellow thing is the boom. It looks like foam. But this is the oil from the massive oil slick. People on the coastline, obviously in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, are very concerned. But we can tell you, because we took a three-and-a-half hour boat ride to get out here, that the oil is still at least 35 or 40 miles away. I mean, you could see it right now: If it wasn't for this protective boom, it would be on these islands. These islands are amazing wildlife refuges. They are places where migratory birds come on their way between North, Central and South America. And you can see the birds as the sun is going down on these islands. These islands used to be about 20 miles long, north to south. But because of hurricanes over the years -- Katrina, George -- it's now about 16 miles. And ultimately, the fear is that in the years to come and if there's more damage here, the islands will be gone. They're uninhabited; no one lives here. Although about a couple hundred years ago, there were a couple hundred people who lived on the islands. Now, it's a wildlife refuge. The oil you see is right here next to the boom, and there's great concern it will go over the boom, on these islands, and then on the coastline.

"(CNN) -- As our nation salutes the men and women who risked their lives for our country, CNN iReporters share the innovative ways they made a positive impact on veterans' lives. iReporter Roger J. Stavitz decided to give back to the VA clinic in Lincoln, Maine, that he credits with saving his life from post-traumatic stress disorder and diabetes. This Vietnam vet got his hands dirty in the grounds surrounding the new VA building, planting $500 worth of flowers to bring some color and fragrance to his brothers in arms. This small change made a major transformation in not only the austere building, but also Stavitz himself. ""The trip is 90 miles, round trip, but it is worth it for my own therapy,"" Stavitz said. ""It pleased the veterans, it pleased the staff, and veterans would stop to talk to me about what I was doing."" Those chats about shared experiences became an important part of their healing process. Stavitz recently visited his flowers, marveling that they were still alive at this time of year in Maine. ""They looked like old friends,"" Stavitz said, ""the gift that keeps on giving."" He admits his gift may be small, but believes it is not insignificant. He hopes that people find one thing that makes them smile, like planting flowers does for him, and think about how that small act can help themselves as well as those who have given so much to our country. Watch Roger's beautifying efforts, on CNN iReport. For Debbi Fisher, it all started because of Root Beer, her late husband's horse. ""He needed a job!"" laughs Fisher, who founded the Rainier Therapeutic Riding Program in Washington state. The program, near the Joint Base Lewis-McChord, is the Northwest's first branch of the NARHA Horses for Heroes program. In this program, healing occurs on horseback. The horses' mission is to help injured soldiers overcome the difficulties of returning home after battle, especially physical and mental disabilities. Each soldier is paired with a horse and a lead volunteer for an eight-week program, completely free of charge. ""We teach them to understand how the horse thinks,"" Fisher said, ""to use the thinking side of the brain instead of the reactive one. And all of a sudden a light bulb goes off, and the soldiers think, 'I can apply this, too.'"" By developing a close relationship with their horse during their time at Rainier, soldiers learn to trust again in a way that is difficult for them to do with people. ""I can't say enough good things about the program,"" Fisher said. ""My heart has always been there, and they have done so much for our country... This really helps them get back to society."" For Fisher, who has a son in Afghanistan and a daughter in the Air Force, it is a personal joy for her to make this difference. See work being done at the Rainier Therapeutic Riding Program, on CNN iReport. Dentist Michael Teitelbaum was looking for a way to help his young patients avoid cavities, when he came up with a campaign that would also benefit our soldiers' sweet tooth. After every Halloween he offers a candy buyback, where candy-sharing children receive a dollar coin for every pound of candy they bring in for overseas troops. This November, he has already received about 200 pounds of candy. In eight years of Teitelbaum's candy buyback program, he has collected over 2,000 pounds. Teitelbaum chuckled when considering the children's surprising generosity. ""The kids that are quick to give up their candy have the Halloween bags that have been clearly picked clean of their favorite treats,"" Teitelbaum said. He helps those children struggling to give up their Halloween haul with a certificate of patriotism, a picture, and of course, the dollar coins. The soldiers, Teitelbaum said, give away much of the candy to the children in Iraq and Afghanistan, who have never tasted American sweets. But he has also received letters that the troops devour a lot of it themselves, and want more. ""Over there they really don't get to celebrate Halloween or other holidays,"" Teitelbaum said, ""so it gives them a little taste of home."" See the candy donations pile up, on CNN iReport.

"CNN)  -- Australian paceman Peter Siddle took six wickets including a hat-trick as England were skittled for 260 on the first day of the Ashes series at the Gabba in Brisbane. The home side were 25 without loss in reply at the close with Simon Katich 15 not out and Shane Watson on nine, the openers having survived a testing half hour to round off a superb day for Ricky Ponting's men. But it was the heroics of birthday boy Siddle, 26 today, which put them in a strong position with his hat-trick the 11th by an Australian in Test cricket history. England were 197 for four wickets when he struck, removing Alastair Cook for 67 then Matt Prior and Stuart Broad for ducks in successive balls. ""It was amazing, but I hope it's just the start of a great series for us. I was just trying to bowl fast, pitch it up and get it straight and they were three good players to get out,"" Siddle told Sky Sports. ""It's a good list to join, Australian hat-tricks in Test cricket."" A battling 76 by Ian Bell until he was the ninth man out to Test debutant Xavier Doherty lifted England to some respectability. Journeyman left-arm spinner Doherty, a surprise inclusion in the Australian team, wrapped up the England innings in the same over as he bowled James Anderson to finish with two wickets for 41. England had begun their previous series in Australia, which resulted in a 5-0 thrashing, in disastrous fashion with paceman Steve Harmison's well-chronicled wide. This time around, it was scarcely better as captain Andrew Strauss was dismissed for a duck to the third ball of the morning, edging Ben Hilfenhaus to Mike Hussey at gully. Blog: England's Ashes hopes could turn to dust . Cook and Jonathan Trott set about repairing the damage on a wicket with a green tinge and helpful to the bowlers, but with the score on 41, all-rounder Watson bowled Trott for 29. Kevin Pietersen played well for his 43, but Siddle accounted for him and Paul Collingwood for just 4 in his second spell as he found the right length to bowl on the slow surface. Bell and Cook looked to be lifting England into a strong position, but Siddle, returning again to the fray, then struck in devastating fashion and also later accounted for Graeme Swann to finish with six wickets for 54. Bell, who had been in fine form in the warm-up game in Tasmania, continued where he left off, but attempting to up the scoring rate only chipped a Doherty delivery to Watson in the covers. England, who hold the Ashes having beaten Australia on home soil in 2009, have gone into the series as narrow favorites but will have work to do on the second day of the first Test, if they are to prevent the home side from building up a sizeable first innings lead.","Peter Siddle takes hat-trick as England dismissed for 260 in first Test in Australia .

"(RealSimple.com) -- My mother was no domestic goddess. She was a golfing, blackjack-playing, martini-drinking sort who had little to do with cooking, sewing, or, God forbid, ""crafts."" Throughout my childhood, we ate Thanksgiving dinner at the golf club. This was essentially my parents' place of worship. Both my sister and I were eventually married there, and we recently scattered my mother's ashes on the ninth hole. The best thing about Thanksgiving at the club, as far as I was concerned, was the magnificent centerpieces the staff assembled: towering assemblages of nuts, fruit, chocolates, and candles in the shape of Pilgrim children that made my sister and me twitch with acquisitive longing. RealSimple.com: Upgrade your Thanksgiving table settings . Once I left home, I did things rather differently. Starting at the age of 19, I cooked myself silly every Thanksgiving. Even during my vegetarian years, and on through brining and turducken and other frivolities, I compensated for my mother's uninterest. This particular rebellion of mine was just fine with her, as she was widowed early on and happy to have a reason to visit me. She would come clear across the country if necessary, always bringing her contribution: the centerpiece, a creation soon known as Mr. Turkey. Mr. Turkey had a simple red-felt turkey head, with a black-bead eye on either side, and was attached to the butt end of a pineapple with straight pins.

Even though the S-shaped seams of the neck were ironed together in the manner of a third-grade art project, I am quite sure my mother did not make the turkey head herself. Perhaps it was a gift from one of the ladies at the bridge table. When an eye fell off, we drew one on with a Sharpie. And it was charming, in an outsider art-meets-Lillian Vernon kind of way. I put it at the center of my table every year, always surrounded by a flock of hand-carved apple swans I had learned how to make in my early 20s from a chef friend. RealSimple.com: The best turkey essentials . We found Mr. Turkey's head up in the closet with the wrapping paper after my mother died, its edges rotting slightly from seeping pineapple juice.

"(CNN) -- Russia's president visited the disputed Kuril Islands on Monday, over Japanese protest, Russian state media said. The Japanese government, which had urged against the visit, quickly responded after the trip. Prime Minister Naoto Kan told reporters President Dmitry Medvedev's visit was ''extremely regrettable.'' Medvedev visited the island of Kunashiri, the first time a sitting Russian president has set foot on any of the chain of more than 50 islands in the northwest Pacific. He made the stop during an Asian tour that included a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the weekend in Vietnam. ""To bring the people's living standards on the islands up to the level of Russia proper, it is necessary to make sure that the services that the citizens receive in this remote region are comparable to those in ... the rest of the country,"" Medvedev said on state television. ""It is necessary to ensure that doctors and other specialists go there."" Medvedev said on state television that after speaking with residents, he believes the islands do not have enough medical specialists, and called for a plan that would include a housing construction program to provide housing to those who choose to move there as an incentive. The Kurils stretch between Russia in the north and Japan in the south. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Soviet Union in 1945 annexed the four southernmost islands, which previously belonged to Japan. Ever since, the islands  -- called the South Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan -- have been the subject of dispute. That dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a formal peace treaty following World War II. In a speech on Russian state TV, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called Japan's reaction to the visit ""unacceptable."" ""It is our land,"" he said. ""The Russian president visited Russian land, Russian territory, a Russian region. We have explained that to our Japanese partners. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website that it told Masaharu Kono, the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, that Japan's protests over the visit were impermissible. ""It was indicated to the Japanese side that its attempts to influence the choice of domestic routes by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were totally unacceptable and incompatible with neighbourly relations between Russia and Japan that have taken place in recent years,"" the statement said. Lavrov had said earlier that the ambassador would be summoned to the ministry ""and we will once again clearly and unequivocally reiterate our position. We will not take any steps that might impede the Russian-Japanese cooperation, but the Japanese side should, of course, draw conclusions.""

"(CNN) -- Republicans effectively gained control over Congress on Tuesday. The GOP won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, thus overturning the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. In the Senate, where the procedural power of the minority has already given Republicans the power to shape deliberations, the narrowed Democratic ranks will further weaken the majority. In the weeks running up to the election, there were some commentators who concluded that the current situation would be the best outcome for President Obama. Pointing to the example of the 1994 midterms, which gave Republicans control of Congress, they have argued that a bad outcome for Democrats would ironically allow Obama to regain his standing. Obama could use Republicans as a foil to attack extremism -- just as Clinton did with Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995 and 1996 -- and he would have political cover and incentives to move closer toward the center, where voters would like him more. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said, ""I do see a similarity to the Clinton experience. The divided government result, if it happens, is good for the president, because he now has some potential enemies but he also has some potential partners to get things done where he didn't have them before."" Yet this analogy rests on a selective memory of what happened after 1994, which is particularly surprising from someone who worked in the administration. The period that followed those midterms was among the most contentious in recent American politics. Republicans conducted a series of investigations into the Clinton administration, which consumed an enormous amount of time and political energy from the White House. The investigations culminated in Clinton's impeachment proceedings. The partisan battles took their toll. While Osama bin Laden and his minions were preparing to attack the United States, Washington was engaged in bitter partisan wars over Clinton's relationship with an intern. As the historian Steve Gillon recounted, the partisanship also drowned a secret effort by Gingrich and Clinton to reach a bipartisan pact on Social Security reform. The process damaged both parties, not just Democrats. Republicans were left without their own leaders. Gingrich essentially was forced to resigned because the Republican Conference lost confidence in his leadership. His slated successor, Louisiana's Robert Livingston, had to resign because of personal problems. The 2000 election revealed how divided the parties had become. Democrats and Republicans squared off in the courts after questions about the vote in Florida, making the electoral process itself fair game in the scandal wars taking place between the parties. Divided government will make a fragile legislative process even more difficult to maneuver. Although political scientists have shown how important legislation has passed in periods of divided government, it is unclear how this model holds up in recent times. There was not much legislative progress on big issues such as Social Security or health care reform in the second half of the 1990s. These years were not some high point in policymaking. In fact, it was just the opposite. Most key issues were pushed aside. The situation will only be worse today. The intensified partisan polarization that exists in today's never-ending campaign cycle makes it even more difficult for the parties to reach deals on major issues. With the exodus of moderate Democrats as a result of Republican victories, the parties in Congress will move farther apart. The 24-hour polarized media will fuel the conflict and facilitate scandal warfare. For those who liked what they saw in the second half of the 1990s: Obama will have more trouble doing what Clinton did politically when he painted Republicans as right of center. After all, the nation doesn't have divided government, it has a divided Congress. So if Obama attacks the Congress for failing to produce results, voters will not only turn to see the face of Speaker John Boehner but they also will see whoever ends up as leader of the Senate Democrats. This makes the argument hard to sell. Additionally, there is no reason to believe that either President Obama or congressional Republicans will have much incentive to enter a grand bargain such as welfare reform in 1996. If there was ever a time that Republicans had reason to compromise it was after their disastrous showing in the election of 2008. Yet Republicans did not compromise. Now, with 2012 over the horizon, the GOP will have more incentives to oppose the president. Indeed, Sen. Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Republicans, recently said: ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" At the same time, Obama faces a significant risk if he tries to appease Republicans in Clinton-like fashion. After all, many liberals are already frustrated with the kinds of compromises Obama has made. Going too far -- for example, declaring that the era of big government is over -- could trigger a challenge to the president in the Democratic primaries. We should hope that the United States is not about to live through a repeat performance of what occurred after 1994. The nation faces too many pressing economic and foreign policy problems to have that happen again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer says GOP gained control of Congress and some predict that will help Obama .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi underlined his status as the best player in the world with two inspirational goals and an assist as holders Barcelona cruised into the quarterfinals of the Champions League with a 4-0 victory at home to Stuttgart on Wednesday night. While Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, was unable to stop Spanish rivals Real Madrid crashing out of Europe's premier club competition last week, Messi made sure that Barcelona suffered no such embarrassment ahead of Friday's last-eight draw. The Spanish champions will join Inter Milan, CSKA Moscow, Lyon, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Arsenal in the hat along with Wednesday's fellow victors Bordeaux. The Argentina forward scored the opening goal in the 13th minute to give the Catalan giants a 2-1 lead on aggregate, then helped set up Pedro Rodriguez nine minutes later before killing off the German visitors with an opportunist third on the hour. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola opted to start with Thierry Henry up front alongside Messi, leaving expensive pre-season signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who scored the equalizer in Stuttgart last month -- on the bench. Influential midfielder Xavi was ruled out by an injury suffered in training on Tuesday. The hosts started with a fluidity sometimes missing in their European play this season, and Messi made Stuttgart pay for giving him too much space as he took the ball from near halfway and lashed in a left-foot shot from just outside the penalty area for his 30th goal of the season. Messi, who netted a hat-trick against Valencia on Sunday, then set Yaya Toure free in the penalty box with a delightful angled ball behind the Stuttgart defense, and the Ivory Coast midfielder's low cross gave young winger Pedro a simple chance to sidefoot into the net. Messi teed up Toure 10 minutes after halftime, but his resulting shot was dragged wide of Jens Lehmann's goal. The 22-year-old showed him how to do it five minutes later as he took a clever flick from Daniel Alves, turned his man and then placed a low shot into the left-hand corner of Lehmann's net. Ibrahimovic came on for injured midfielder Sergio Busquets in the 65th minute, and soon after Messi was denied his hat-trick by the veteran Lehmann. The former Germany international belied his 40 years as he got down to his left to keep out Messi's header from a towering Alves cross. Messi went close again in the 86th minute as he skipped through the Barcelona defense and dinked a chip past Lehmann, but wide of the goal. But Lehmann could do nothing to stop substitute Bojan Krkic slotting in Barcelona's fourth goal three minutes later as the 19-year-old ran onto Ibrahimovic's well-timed pass. French champions Bordeaux also progressed into the last eight with a 2-1 victory at home to nine-man Olympiakos, beating the Greek side 3-1 on aggregate despite also having a man sent off. Yoann Gourcuff put Bordeaux ahead in the fifth minute with a fine free-kick, and also hit the post with another set-piece. Olympiakos had striker Matt Derbyshire sent off for a second booking on the hour mark, but equalized on the night five minutes later through substitute Kostas Mitroglou. Bordeaux were also reduced to 10 men in the 69th minute when captain Alou Diara was booked for the second time after a seemingly innocuous challenge on Ieroklis Stoltidis. Striker Marouane Chamakh sealed the tie with two minutes to go when he powerfully headed in a left-wing cross from Benoit Tremoulinas at the far post, then Olympiakos saw Swedish defender Olof Mellberg dismissed for a second booking five minutes into time added on.","Lionel Messi scores twice as holders Barcelona cruised into quarterfinals of Champions League .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bo the Portuguese water dog made his White House debut under cloudy skies Tuesday afternoon, spending several minutes taking his new family on a lively romp over the South Lawn with frequent stops for hearty sniffs at his new surroundings. Malia Obama practices walking Bo as her parents and sister, Sasha, wait their turn. Bo landed on all four feet at his fourth home in his six short months of life, fulfilling President Obama's campaign promise to get his daughters a dog in return for all the time he spent on the road during the long presidential fight. ""He's a star. He's got star quality,"" the president said of the black curly pup with white front feet and chest and a lion-cut tail. The Obamas ended up with a purebred dog, despite the president's preference for a mutt, largely because of 10-year-old Malia's allergies -- Portuguese water dogs don't shed -- and because of opportunity.  Watch Bo frolic on the White House lawn » . Bo didn't fit in well with his first owners and was returned to the breeder in March. That breeder happened to be the breeder of Sen. Ted Kennedy's Portuguese water dogs, and when Kennedy learned the puppy was available, he arranged to offer him to the Obamas. Bo spent a month with Kennedy's trainer before coming to the White House for an initial visit over the weekend and for his official welcome Tuesday. ""Dog Whisperer"" Cesar Millan said on Tuesday afternoon that Portuguese water dogs are an active breed and will need long walks and will need to understand quickly who is the ""pack leader."" ""Very important everybody plays the leadership role -- the girls, Ms. Michelle, obviously, the president,"" he said. ""Everybody has to learn to walk the dog, to master the walk."" The Obamas, Millan said, have an opportunity to model good behavior for dog owners. ""This is definitely the most popular dog in the world right now,"" he said. ""This is why it's very important for everybody -- all the Obama family -- to practice the exercise, the discipline and affection."" While out with his family and the dog Tuesday afternoon, Obama said Bo had ""a bunch of possibilities"" of where to sleep, but his own bed wasn't one of those. Bo will be allowed into the Oval Office, he said, and the family will take turns with walks. The president and his family also shared some of their newfound knowledge about Portuguese water dogs. ""The only concern we have is that apparently, Portuguese water dogs like tomatoes. Michelle's garden is in danger,"" he said. ""We don't have tomatoes,"" the first lady said. ""Not yet,"" Obama reminded. ""He doesn't know how to swim,"" chimed in 7-year-old Sasha. ""Apparently they have to be taught how to swim,"" the president said. ""They have webbed feet. And they herd fish for the fishermen in Portugal. That is what we've heard.""","Portuguese water dog cavorts on South Lawn with Obama family .

"(CNN) -- Move, Sony's new motion controller for the PlayStation 3, has been nearly everywhere in the days and weeks leading up to its official release September 19. Gaming fans and critics alike have seen what the new device can do, how it will behave and even how it will affect their current and future gaming. But as complex and complicated as it seems, the Move had a very basic beginning. To paraphrase Walt Disney, it all began with a ball. At a demo event in Washington, the man behind the Move, Richard Marks, talked about how the motion controller came to be and where he hopes it will take gaming in the future. As the manager of research and development for Sony, Marks said that work on the Move started after they developed the EyeToy camera for the PlayStation 2 and discovered they needed a ball to help it focus. ""Early work with the EyeToy camera got it to recognize specific shapes and colors to help it with tracking,"" Marks said. ""We figured out that lighting is key to tracking."" Marks and his team found that the EyeToy, which is now a part of the Move system, was able to find and follow items that were sphere- or ball-shaped. It's not surprising, then, that the hand controllers for the Move, which started showing up in online stores this week, are topped with colored balls that have led some to compare them to ice cream cones. ""The sphere looks the same no matter what angle you hold it,"" he said. ""The camera then tracks the location by the size of the sphere. Bigger sphere means closer to the screen, while smaller means further away."" The development team used foam spheres with some success until a researcher wanted to make the spheres light up. It turned out that lighting the ball helped the EyeToy track the device even better. ""[The researcher] wanted the sphere to change colors to reflect different things in potential gameplay,"" Marks said. ""What we found was that the camera worked better because the colored light in the ball makes it stand out from any background."" The Move and EyeToy actually examine the surroundings of a player for color pixels and then assign a completely different color to light up the sphere. The result is a smoother tracking of movement in three dimensions, something that a similar controller for another console can't do. Once they got the camera to track a lighted, colored sphere reliably, how could they turn that into a game device? Marks said that for his very first rudimentary Move controller, he took a regular controller for the PS3 and put the ball on one end. ""I cut the ends off because I wanted to make something that would feel good in one hand and had buttons to help with gameplay,"" he said. ""It wasn't pretty."" The research-and-development team began to tweak the look and feel of the proto-Move controller, adding a gyroscope and accelerometer to assist with game movement. Marks insisted that the new device keep the buttons from the PS3 controller because he said they are needed to do specific, in-game movements. ""You want to know you are having an effect in the game. Buttons give you instant feedback instead of just waving a hand to get something done,"" Marks said. ""Not only can you quickly change from item to item using buttons, the T-button [an analog button located where your fingers wrap around the device] allows you to control how much of something you want to do. It gives the players more feedback and more freedom."" Marks envisions the Move controller as a device that will allow players the opportunity to explore 3-D environments and games in ways that previously were seen in science fiction movies. He said the Move can pinpoint the position and angle of the player's hand in a way that's perfect for point-of-view games. Although his team had a good controller in hand, it was too expensive in the beginning. Eventually, pricing of the components, specifically the gyro and accelerometer, came down. Marks said sensor technology also got better over time. ""We could have done something early, but it wouldn't have been as good,"" he explained. And if one Move is good, two are better. ""Two Move controllers allow for more detail,"" Marks explained. ""It opens up so many more possibilities for game developers to really put players in the middle of the action. There are a lot of things you can do as long as the platform is good."" He said first-person shooter games like ""SOCOM"" and individual sports games such as tennis, golf and archery will be the early success stories for the Move. But he's not counting out any game genre because, he said, developers are testing out the Move to find out what it can and can't do. ""I want new ways to show up to do things we haven't even thought of,"" Marks said. ""The Move isn't going away any time soon.""","The Move system grew out of the EyeToy camera for PlayStation 2 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai -- whose country harbored the al Qaeda terror network when the group attacked the United States nine years ago -- used the September 11 anniversary to deplore the assault and call for an effective counterterrorism strategy in the longstanding Afghan war. ""The Afghan government is asking the international community for a lasting counterterrorism strategy,"" said Siamak Herawi, a Karzai spokesman who relayed the president's message Saturday. ""Afghanistan's villages are not the sanctuaries for these terrorists and Afghan lives should not be sacrificed for terrorism that has another base and home,"" the message said, making reference to militant bases across the Afghan border in Pakistan. Al Qaeda terrorists were allowed to operate in Afghanistan by the ruling Taliban government when New York and Washington were attacked by plane hijackers on September 11, 2001. A U.S.-led invasion later ousted the Taliban government. But militants have been able to maintain havens along the Afghan-Pakistan border for years and have tenaciously squared off with the NATO-led coalition attempting to keep the Karzai government and its nascent government afloat. The Karzai message, making reference to the toppling of the Taliban, called 9/11 ""an act of international terrorism which consequently rescued Afghanistan from terroristic domination and resulted in the destruction of terrorist bases and sanctuaries inside of Afghanistan."" Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, said memorial events have been staged in Afghanistan to remember September 11 and honor victims of attacks in Afghanistan. ""As a country we cannot let the passing years dull our memories.  Many of us have personal recollections of September 11, 2001, and many more painful memories have been created since.  As we now know, the events of that fateful day in September 2001 began here in Afghanistan.  The al Qaeda murderers gathered here to train.  They gained a foothold in this country so that more terrorist acts could be launched from Afghan territory,"" he said. Eikenberry said the United States is in Afghanistan ""to prevent international terrorists from again establishing a safe haven for extremists who would plot to wreak havoc"" throughout the world. Speaking a week before parliamentary elections in Afghanistan, Eikenberry said it is important to remember how the conflict began and what must be done to keep the United States secure. President Barack Obama has called the Afghanistan-Pakistan region the central front in the fight against terrorism. ""Our part of this task is to help Afghanistan achieve the stability, respected fair governance, economic well-being, and status in this part of the world so that international terrorists will find no ground on which to openly stand in this great country,"" Eikenberry said.","The Afghan war has persisted .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Within a year that saw a massive earthquake, a spreading cholera epidemic and recurring signs of government instability, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere is gearing up for its latest battle: presidential elections. Nearly all of the 19 candidates have campaigned on similar platforms: fighting corruption, creating jobs and addressing a series of natural disasters that has left the Caribbean nation reeling and prompted many to urge for a postponement of Sunday's vote. Haiti, which has endured near constant health and environmental crises, is facing a growing cholera epidemic affecting nearly 70,000 people that many fear could further scare voters from the polls. The death toll stands at 1,603, the Ministry of Public Health and Population reported Friday. More than 29,000 people have been hospitalized, with a stunning 18.3 percent mortality rate in the country's cholera-affected northeast, it said. But Ken Merten, the United States ambassador to Haiti, said the election process was on track. He said 250,000 new voters were registered and more than 11,000 voting stations have been identified in the fifth presidential election since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship and the first since the devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake in January. Among the candidates is perhaps Haiti's most flamboyant politician, Michel Martelly, who is perhaps better known by his street name: Sweet Micky. Martelly's penchant for dressing in drag and organizing raucous street parties in the Haitian capital has made him a popular choice among portions of the electorate. ""Yes, I've been the bad boy,"" Martelly told CNN. ""But the people of Haiti believe in that rebel status that I'm selling. You know, in able to fight the system, you must be strong, must be courageous."" His style clashes sharply with that of a more soft-spoken front-runner and former first lady, Mirlande Manigat. The 70-year-old conservatively dressed Sorbonne Ph.D stands to be Haiti's first female president. Her husband, Leslie Manigat, was elected president in 1988 under the Assembly of Progressive National Democrats (RDNP) party but managed to hold on to the office only four months after his election. ""It was a coup d'etat,"" Manigat told CNN. ""A military coup against him. And we had to go again in exile for two years."" Manigat ran again in 2006, losing to current outgoing President Rene Preval in a controversial election in which Preval failed to secure more than 50 percent of the vote, but managed to avoid a mandatory runoff. In a country accustomed to political upheaval, angry crowds in the Haitian capital last week tore down posters of Preval's hand-picked candidate, Jude Celestin, amid frustrations with the country's corrupt and often ineffective leadership. Celestin, whose well-funded campaign has occasionally featured airplanes dropping confetti, leads the largest bloc of politicians competing for seats in both houses of the Haitian parliament. But with no clear front-runner, elections could be forced into a runoff in January if no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote. Last week, days of violent protests brought Haiti's second-largest city, Cap-Haitien, to a standstill amid voter frustration about government corruption and the growing cholera outbreak. ""There's a history of some violence [during Haitian elections],"" International Crisis Group spokesman Bernice Robertson told CNN. ""Some irregularities, some accusations of fraud, before, during and sometimes after the elections."" Despite billions of dollars pledged by international donors, little has been done to clean up mountains of rubble or resettle the 1.3 million homeless people living in tents who have often suffered most from the spreading epidemic. Meanwhile, the Pan American Health Organization said it was planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak. ""We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic,"" the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. ""We need more of everything,"" he said. ""More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water."" Sunday's election could be among the most important in recent history, as incoming lawmakers will grapple with campaign promises meant to address the country's staggering range of problems.","19 candidates have campaigned on similar platforms ahead of Sunday's elections .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal prevented Novak Djokovic from reaching the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals and kept his own hopes alive by beating the Serbian in London on Friday night. The Spaniard notched his second Group A win this week, triumphing 7-5 6-2 in the season-ending men's tournament. He will face Tomas Berdych on Friday in a rematch of this year's Wimbledon final, with the Czech having earlier earned his first victory with a result that left American eighth seed Andy Roddick needing to win his final match in straight sets. Nadal is seeking to reach the final for the first time, having failed to win a match at the same venue last year. He defeated Djokovic in the U.S. Open final in September to complete his collection of Grand Slam titles, and needed to overcome a strong first-set challenge this time from the world No. 3. Djokovic, who beat Berdych in his opening match, appeared to be the stronger player in the early games but then had his serve broken by Nadal before immediately replying in kind. Nadal broke again in the 11th game and held serve to claim the first set as Djokovic appeared troubled by problems with his contact lenses, then raced to a 4-0 lead in the second set before winning in one hour and 52 minutes. ""It was a very good match for me. I was very sorry for Novak for what happened with his eye, I hope he is okay. It was my best match in this tournament,"" Nadal told reporters. The 23-year-old Djokovic said he was disappointed he was not given more time to solve his eye problem. ""I'm just really annoyed by the fact that something like this can affect the match. It did because my right eye got irritated and from the five-all I could not see a ball, especially the return. It was just terrible,"" he told AFP. ""I don't want to find any excuses for my loss, but the fact of the matter is that I just could not play. I needed some time to make it right, but I didn't have time. Everybody was hurrying me up, saying come to the court, play your match."" Berdych, who lost to Nadal in the final of this year's third Grand Slam in July, won 7-5 6-3 against Roddick as he saved two set-points at 4-5 on his serve in the opener. The 25-year-old then stunned his opponent with a winning forehand return off a 110-mile-per-hour second serve and was untroubled as he closed out the set. The sixth seed hit 28 winners and made 27 unforced errors, while winning 12 of 16 net approaches and serving six aces. ""The last couple of weeks, I was in this position many times but not often was I able to get back, to do a couple of good serves, get to deuce, then win the game,"" Berdych said. ""That's the thing that's going to give you a lot of confidence. Then the next game I managed a quick break and that was the key to the match."" Roddick, who lost his opening match to Nadal after qualifying for the event for the eighth consecutive year, will play Djokovic in the closing Group A match on Friday evening. On Thursday, second seed Roger Federer takes on No. 4 Robin Soderling in their third Group B match, then Britain's Andy Murray plays Spain's David Ferrer. Federer has won both matches so far, while seventh seed Ferrer has lost his two. No. 5 Murray and Sweden's Soderling both have a 1-1 record.","Rafael Nadal keeps his ATP World Tour Finals hopes alive by beating Novak Djokovic .

"(CNN) -- Iran has charged two German journalists who interviewed the son and lawyer of a woman condemned to die by stoning with espionage, Iranian media reported Tuesday. ""Their reports and propaganda in Tabriz proved that they are in the country for spying,"" Malek Ajdar Shafiee, the head of the Justice Department of East Azarbaijan, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars News Agency. The two men, identified only as a reporter and photojournalist, were arrested last month in the northwest city of Tabriz after they interviewed the son and lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning. The Iranian government also says Ashtiani was involved in her husband's murder, a charge her family has denied. The charges against the two Germans comes the day after they were shown on Iranian state-run television. The program produced by Iran's Channel 2, quoted one of the men saying that they were ""tricked"" by an activist with the German-based International Committee Against Stoning, into entering the country illegally. The unnamed man told the television station that the committee's spokeswoman, Mina Ahadi, used the journalists for her own gain. ""Mina Ahadi sent me to Iran because she knew she would benefit from my arrest, and I'll sue her when I get back to Germany,"" the man said. Ahadi denied that the journalists traveled on behalf of the anti-stoning organization. Meanwhile, a German diplomat based in the embassy in Tehran was granted consular access for a second time Tuesday to the two German nationals, the German Foreign Office said in a statement. Monday's broadcast also showed a woman identified as Ashtiani. The woman, whose face was blurred and whose words were translated from the Azeri language to Farsi, blamed Ahadi for spreading false information about her case around the world. Ashtiani's son Sajjad Gaderzadeh and her lawyer Hootan Kian, were also interviewed on the program, the first time they have appeared on television since their arrests last month. Kian, a government-appointed lawyer, has been critical of the government's handling of Ashtiani's case. He said in August that she was being tortured while in prison and that he also feared for his own life. Gaderzadeh said Kian had told him that his mother was being tortured. ""Unfortunately I listened to them and lied to the foreign media about everything,"" he said on the program. This is the third time Ashtiani has appeared on state-run television confessing to the charges of adultery and murder. ""I am a sinner,"" she said Monday on the program. The International Committee Against Stoning condemned the televised confession. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran's goal in airing this program is to agitate public opinion against Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and Mina Ahadi, yet despite all efforts, in and of itself the program is a powerful reflection of the international campaign to save Sakineh,"" said a statement from the organization. Iranian courts have said Ashtiani's case is still under review.","The Germans were arrested after interviewing a woman's son and lawyer .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police say they are investigating the disappearance of more than $400,000 worth of jewelry from a photo shoot involving Lindsay Lohan in London on June 6. Jewels are missing from an Elle magazine photo shoot of Lindsay Lohan.

"New York (CNN) -- Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday he is donating $100 million toward improving public schools in Newark, New Jersey. ""Every child deserves a good education, and right now it's not happening"" Zuckerberg said. His donation will be the first grant handed out by his new foundation, Startup: Education, an entity financed by him and focused on bettering education in the United States. Zuckerberg appeared on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" on Friday, alongside Newark Mayor Cory Booker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Booker told Winfrey that Zuckerberg wanted the donation to be anonymous at first, but was persuaded to make the announcement public, hoping it would inspire others to donate as well. With an estimated net worth of $6.9 billion, Zuckerberg ranked 35th on this year's Forbes 400 list of richest Americans -- up from 158th last year. At 26, he and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz are the youngest billionaires on the list. The announcement comes a week ahead of the release of ""The Social Network"" -- a highly anticipated movie about the early years of the social networking powerhouse. The movie and the book it is based on -- ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich -- do not depict Zuckerberg in the most favorable of lights. Responding to critics who have suggested that the donation is being timed to counteract the effects of the movie, Zuckerberg said: ""It's a movie. It's fun. A lot of it is fiction ... This is my life. I know that it's not that dramatic."" But some in the tech community say that, regardless of the timing, Zuckerberg's gift could have far-reaching ramifications on charitable giving. ""Skeptics might question the timing of the move, but it would be foolish to underestimate the significance of the gesture -- not only in its direct impact on public schools, but in its lasting imprint upon the technology industry,"" wrote Pete Cashmore, CEO of social media blog Mashable in a column for CNN. ""Zuckerberg's donation should be praised, as it will likely provide inspiration to the growing ranks of newly minted technology founders,"" he said. According to Booker, 50 percent of high school students in Newark do not graduate. Booker and Christie hope that their new plan will provide a model for education reform nationwide. Control of Newark public schools has been in the hands of the state since 1995. Under an agreement between Mayor Booker and Governor Christie, the state will maintain legal control over the district, but will authorize the mayor to develop a comprehensive education plan. Zuckerberg grew up in Westchester County, New York, and founded Facebook in 2004, while studying computer science at Harvard University.

"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Fourteen people died and another 25 were arrested Wednesday in drug-gang violence in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, military police said Wednesday. That brings the total to 22 dead and 153 arrested since Sunday, police said. The gangs have shot up a police station and torched at least five buses and 11 cars in the attacks, officials said. It was not immediately clear if all the dead were gang members, or if civilians and police also suffered fatalities. The violence stems from the transfer of prisoners from local institutions to federal lockups in other states, the government-run Agencia Brasil news outlet reported, citing Rio de Janeiro Public Security Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame. Some of those prisoners ordered the violence, Beltrame said. The attacks also came as a result of police trying to remove some drug gang members from Rio's slums, called favelas. Beltrame said two rival gangs joined forces to launch the attacks. The security chief also said he mobilized all police in the city to try to restore order and to step up police presence in 17 of Rio's slums. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva addressed the situation Tuesday. ""I called the justice minister and told him to attend to Rio de Janeiro with whatever he needs,"" Lula told CNN affiliate TV Record. Officials are concerned about crime in Brazil as the nation prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Rio.

"(CNN) -- If George Orwell and Lucille Ball had a love child, his name would be Stephen Colbert. In the last century, the great critics of corrupt political language were British authors who wrote dystopian novels. In ""1984,"" Orwell described a totalitarian society in which meaningless political language, dubbed Newspeak, veiled horrible truths. Earlier, In ""Brave New World,"" Aldous Huxley described toddlers conditioned in laboratories to be afraid of books. And in ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Anthony Burgess imagined a world in which ultraviolent teens rampaged in a distinctive English-Russian patois that defined their alienation from society and authority. Now in the 21st century, there is Colbert's ""truthiness"" -- political half-truths, quarter-truths and what the website Politifact describes as ""Pants-on-Fire"" prevarications. On his Comedy Central show, ""The Colbert Report,"" he introduced ""The Word,"" a regular deconstruction of language contortion designed, in Orwell's notion, to defend the indefensible. (One example: ""A Perfect World,"" as in, journalists should demand to investigate torture, but it's not a perfect world.) It's sharp political humor and a canny critique of American culture, language and iconography. And it's helped the comic emerge as this nation's court jester, licensed by the youthful cable TV audience to speak truth to power. Such is Colbert's power and influence that he has been invited to testify before Congress today on the issue of illegal immigration -- and to testify in character. It's as if the Congress of the Eisenhower years invited Harpo Marx to offer testimony by beeping his bicycle horn. Colbert has long been on to something important about the nature of our political discourse at the beginning of a new postmodern millennium: that ideology has become the lens through which Americans found their particular truth, let the evidence be damned. As a caricature of Fox's Bill O'Reilly, he has turned deconstruction of the culture wars into an art form, adopting the slogans and symbols of America's ideologues, even as he reveals their emptiness. Of course, during the last century, there were always comic voices -- from Will Rogers to Lenny Bruce to Pat Paulson to George Carlin -- who could be counted on to deflate the pretensions of the rich and powerful using their own words. But cable television has created a different breed of comic cat with vast media reach. And on Fox, Glenn Beck offers himself up as a ""rodeo clown"" (his words), a character who embodies the disaffection and alienation of the right, but whose acolytes experience him as real enough to follow him in the thousands to the Lincoln Memorial for a rally. Jon Stewart insists that his ""Daily Show"" is comedy entertainment and not journalism, and yet it has become the main source of political news for millions. Even as President Obama is seen by some to have lost his campaign mojo, Stewart and Colbert plan their own Washington rally, making them arguably the most potent antidote to the blustery right. Is it possible we are reaching the point in political history when a fictional character can be elected to office? Viewers and fans should remember what's real about all this and what's not. I was reminded of this firsthand when I encountered the Colbert comic persona during one of the 2004 presidential conventions in which he declared himself a worthy presidential candidate because of his humble origins.  He was a descendant, he said, of ""goat turd farmers from France."" As producers explain to guests on ""The Colbert Report,"" it is not their job to be funny, but to act as foil for the self-important and clueless cable talk show host.  The guest tries to disabuse Colbert of his ridiculous view of politics and the world, an effort that never works, of course. What happens when Colbert is questioned by members of Congress promises to be a comic hall of mirrors in which illusion and allusion, reflection and deflection, truthiness and reality collide and converge. Members of Congress might treat the spectacle as entertainment, but they would be wise to look a level deeper, to see that the followers of Colbert's circus may one day cast off their ironic pose and step up to cast their votes. When I was the age of Colbert's legion of  fans,  I turned to the novels of Orwell, Huxley and Burgess to sharpen my skepticism toward the language of those in power. Such fiction is likely to wane in influence in an era when so many read less and care less. In its place is something quite different but, in its own way, quite good: comedy and satire shining a disinfecting light on the language of scoundrels. Turn on the telly.  Pass the popcorn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Peter Clark.","Roy Peter Clark says Stephen Colbert is heir to social comment tradition of Orwell, Huxley .

"(CNN) -- Family, friends and classmates turned to prayer and Facebook on Wednesday amid an ongoing search in upstate New York for a missing college student. Jenni-Lyn Watson, 20, of Liverpool, was last seen Friday morning at her family's home, said Sgt. Robert Marshall of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office. Watson was on a Thanksgiving break from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. Liverpool is a suburb of Syracuse. ""This [disappearance] is extremely uncharacteristic for Jenni-Lynn,"" said Marshall. Watson's parents reported her missing Friday night. The college junior's purse and other personal items were found at the home, but a Verizon LG enV3 phone is missing. One call was made on the phone from a heavily wooded area near other residences, said Marshall, who declined to provide details. The phone has since been turned off or is not operating, he said. Authorities are looking at records of Watson's cell phone calls. ""We're still looking at everything,"" spokesman Sgt. John D'Eredita said Wednesday night. Detectives are following leads from numerous phone calls, but D'Eredita was not aware of any sightings of the young student. Authorities consider Watson's disappearance a missing-person case, Marshall said. Detectives traveled to Mercyhurst, where they met with faculty and staff, the Onandaga County Sheriff's Office said. Searchers had covered about 600 acres by Wednesday evening. Sheriff's deputies are trying to identify the driver of a dark pickup truck that was seen near her residence the day Watson disappeared, D'Eredita said. Watson is described as 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing about 100 pounds. She has dirty blond hair and brown eyes. As of Wednesday afternoon, when simultaneous vigils were held for Watson, nearly 21,000 people had become members of a Facebook page about her disappearance. One of the church vigils was organized by the family; the other was held in a chapel at Mercyhurst College, a Catholic institution. ""It was amazing today to see the turnout during fall break,"" college spokeswoman Debbie Morton said of the vigil held there. About 200 people attended, including members of the football team, which has a NCAA Division II game this weekend. ""You felt overwhelming worry, but you still felt there was reason to hope,"" Morton said. Watson is a dance major and ballet dancer at Mercyhurst. ""It is a highly disciplined area,"" Morton said of Watson's field of study. Authorities asked people with information to call 315-435-3081.

"(CNN) -- The fourth quarter of 2009 for the music and video game industries is shaping up to be all about the Beatles. And both could use some ""Help!"" The video game industry has high hopes The Beatles 'Rock Band' will pull it out of recession. The band, which released its last full album of original music in 1970, is the focus of the simultaneous Wednesday release of ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" for the Rock Band video game franchise, as well as the digitally remastered box set of the Beatles 13-album discography by EMI. Analysts expect a spike in video game and CD sales, which have been declining through the year. For audiophiles the release of the remastered CDs in mono and stereo is the first re-release of the Beatles catalogue since 1987. ""It's probably the biggest catalogue remaster that has ever happened,"" said Paul Bromby, EMI's senior marketing manager heading the re-release for the London-based company.  Watch more about the 21st century Beatles » . Given the state of CD sales, it may also be the last major event of its kind: Sales of CDs in the United States last year dropped 19 percent, according to entertainment market researcher the NPD Group, while purchases of digital downloads increased by 29 percent. Forrester Research estimates digital downloads will outstrip CD sales by 2012.  Why do the Beatles mean so much to the music industry? » . The remastered CDs are also a first step toward the Beatles catalogue eventual release for digital download. Allan Rouse, project coordinator on the reissue for EMI, told CNN the new masters are ready for digital download if and when EMI and Apple Corp. -- which represents surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Star, and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon -- make them available for release. Still, the increase in the release of digital music -- which now accounts for a third of all sales, according to NPD -- isn't enough to make up for the total loss of sales. In 2008, there were 13 million fewer U.S. music buyers than the previous year. That is making video game releases by Rock Band and Guitar Hero, where players compete to strum in time on plastic guitars to original recordings, an increasingly important crossover player in the music industry. ""There's a lot of excitement (in the video game industry) because this is the first game since the Wii Fit that is aimed for a mass market,"" said Michael Pachter, a video game analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities, who first tried his hand at The Beatles game with George Harrison's son, Dahni, at the E3 Expo, where the game debuted in June. Like the Wii Fit -- an exercise-along Nintendo game that was a breakout hit since its global release in 2008 -- ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" is expected to attract game buyers beyond ""hardcore gamers,"" Pachter said. ""Guitar Hero and Rock Band expanded gaming more to families, something that parents in their 40s could play along with their teenage girls,"" Pachter said. ""But most of these compilations have bands that probably half the parents never heard of. Everyone knows the Beatles. You can't say that about many bands."" ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" will have 45 songs representing a cross-section of their career. Additional music from The Beatles catalogue will be made available for purchase and download including ""Abbey Road,"" ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and ""Rubber Soul,"" to be released in October, November and December, respectively -- giving a boost to the sale of Beatles songs through the end of the year.  See images of Abbey Road studios » . Pachter estimates the video game will sell 5 million units globally by the end of the year, with prices ranging from more than $50 to $250 for a limited-edition package with Beatles guitar and drum set controllers. Video games sales have dropped nearly 20 percent from last year. The Beatles release is expected to be a boon for music-based video games, which had U.S. revenues of $452 million the first half of this year, compared to $840 million during the same period last year, according to NPD.  Console wars heat up » . Another industry closely watching the Beatles game release and the popularity of plastic fake guitars are the makers of real musical instruments. Sales of guitars exploded with the popularity of the Beatles in the 1960s. Will new Beatles fans via Rock Hero be inspired to buy the real thing? While the guitar is still the most popular musical instrument, guitar sales in the U.S. -- which accounts for 42 percent of global sales -- dropped 6.6 percent to $1.6 billion last year, the largest drop in more than a decade, according to Music Trades.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The detained captain of a Chinese trawler was released by Japan and returned to his home country, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Zhan Qixiong, who had been held by Japanese authorities since September 8, arrived safely early Saturday morning in Fuzhou, the capital of southeast China's Fujian Province, according to Xinhua. The captain left Japan with officials from China's Foreign and Agriculture ministries. ""We decided to suspend the charges in consideration of the Japan-China relationship,"" said the Japanese prosecutor in the case. In China, the captain's wife, Chen Tingting, said she was thrilled. ""We are so happy, we are just really very happy to hear the news,"" she said. His home is Jinjiang city, in Fujian. The captain was arrested off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea, after his vessel crashed into two Japanese patrol boats. He was accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed their duties. ""The Japanese side bears full responsibility for the current situation, and it shall bear all the consequences that arise,"" Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Tuesday in New York, as China escalated demands for the captain's release. Wen was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. Word of his release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China. The four are being investigated for entering a military zone without authorization and videotaping military targets, Chinese state media said. Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals, however. The four Japanese nationals were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army, their company said Friday. A Chinese national also is missing and presumed arrested with his Japanese co-workers on Wednesday in northern Hebei Province. They work for Fujita Corp., a mid-size Japanese construction company that Goldman Sachs Group acquired in April 2009. Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained. ""Currently, the case is being investigated,"" is all that Chinese security authorities in Shijiazhuang said in a statement, the state-run China Daily reported. But Beijing had plenty to say about Japan detaining the Chinese fishing captain. Japan ""illegally arrested"" him and his crew of 14, China said. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan earlier this month freed the fishing captain's crew. China's Foreign Ministry said that Japan had ""seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations"" with the arrest of the captain and his crew. In response, China halted talks with Japan about increasing civil flights and expanding aviation rights between the two countries. Officials and nationals on both sides also canceled trips to each other's nations. CNN's Jo Kent contributed to this report.","NEW: The captain has arrived in China .

"(CNN)  -- Free elections 20 years ago this week in Poland marked the unraveling of the Soviet bloc of Eastern European nations and the beginning of market reforms. Shipyard workers hold Solidarity trade union flags on the anniversary of free elections in Poland. The events of June 1989 also marked the turning point for companies like KGHM, which has grown into a global player in the world's copper market and one of Poland's largest companies with 18,000 employees. ""A lot of changes have happened since that moment, since 1989,"" said Zbigniew Klich, a development engineer who has worked at a company copper smelter near Lubin for more than 30 years. ""This is the Poland of my dreams,"" Klich said. ""Even though I will probably retire in the next few months I feel so fortunate to have seen the last 20 years in my professional career."" The financial crisis has had minimal impact on the company so far. ""In comparison to other sectors of the Polish economy, the commodity business has been doing quite well,"" said Jarek Romanowski, sales director of KGHM. Poland's export prowess has led the nation to become one of the great success stories of former communist bloc economies. In 2008, it ranked 22nd in the world with more than $190 billion in exports, ahead of Australia and India, according to the CIA Factbook. The country's economy has grown every year since 1992, and bucked the recessionary trend of other European Union nations by expanding its economy by just under 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. ""Poland is not an island and we are very much linked to other EU countries so a lot depends on the performance of the German economy,"" said Dominik Radziwill, Poland's deputy finance minister. ""But even with the current forecasts which are really pessimistic for the German economy, we still think Poland should be doing relatively OK."" Leszek Balcerowicz was the country's first Finance Minister after the fall of communism and initiated Poland's free market reforms. ""Socialism (was) a very bad system and everybody knew that it was a bad system without any hope for a better life,"" he said. ""Transition to a better system is sometimes difficult but you have to overcome these difficulties on the way to a better regime."" One industry that exploded was Poland's once state-run media industry, which now includes eight daily national newspapers plus dozens of television channels and radio stations. ""The transformation had many phases in Poland. The state totally withdrew from the press market and step-by-step, private TV stations appeared,"" said Polish journalist Adam Mischnik. ""So, today we have a pluralist media which represents very different tendencies."" Janusz Weychert and Mariusz Walter founded the ITI group, a leading private media company in Poland with television stations - including the influential news network TVN24 - as well as a home video, new media and theatrical production operations. ""Under one umbrella there's various projects put together,"" Weychert said. ""The advantage it gives us is the free flow of content and information between all the platforms."" Communism and absolute media control may have only been twenty years ago - but in Poland today, certainly for the country's youth and the media, it's a lifetime. Maciej Popowicz set up ""Nasza-Klasa"" - Poland's equivalent to Facebook -- with three friends in 2006. Its success made 25-year-old Popowicz one of Poland's youngest millionaires. He's also too young to remember what life was like under Communism. ""I'm very glad that I live in these times because we have so many more opportunities than our older friends so for example, you couldn't manage your own business twenty years ago, now there is an opportunity to do that,"" Popowicz said. ""So you can develop your ideas, create your own firms."" But market reforms haven't been kind to the historic shipyards of Gdansk, where the Solidarity Union movement began with union leader and future Polish president, Lech Walesa. Marching with him was Brunom Baranowski, a shipyard worker for more than 30 years who spent nearly a year in jail for civil disobedience for his role in the union. In the 20 years since the end of communism, he's seen the shipyard workforce shrink from 18,000 to about 2,700 today. The shipyard, in danger of going bankrupt, was given a lifeline this week when Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition, met with Polish officials and told the press an EU bailout of the shipyard was likely. Still, Baranowski said ""shipyard workers don't have much reason to be happy. Over the past 20 years we have been trying to save our jobs."" While the fortune of his nation improved, he still lives in the same tiny apartment as he did in 1989 and has the same worries about his job. But Brunom says it was all worth the fight. ""Of course it's much better. In the old days all you could get at the shop was vinegar and mustard. To get anything else you had to know people. Now everything is available,"" he said. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","Twenty years after democracy Poland has strongest economy in former Soviet bloc .

"Washington (CNN) -- There's nothing funny about the issue of migrant farm labor -- unless Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert is discussing it. Colbert, accompanied by a media swarm, sarcastically testified on Capitol Hill Friday about the conditions facing America's undocumented farm workers. The popular host of ""The Colbert Report"" told members of a House Judiciary subcommittee that he hoped to bring attention to the workers' hardships. ""I certainly hope that my star power can bump this hearing all the way up to C-SPAN 1,"" he joked. ""America's farms are presently far too dependent on immigrant labor to pick our fruits and vegetables,"" he told the subcommittee, keeping in character with the arch-conservative he plays on television. ""Now, the obvious answer is for all of us to stop eating fruits and vegetables. And if you look at the recent obesity statistics, many Americans have already started."" Colbert told the panel that ""we all know there is a long tradition of great nations importing foreign workers to do their farm work."" ""After all,"" he said, ""it was the ancient Israelites who built the first food pyramids. But this is America. I don't want a tomato picked by a Mexican. I want it picked by an American, then sliced by a Guatemalan, and served by a Venezuelan in a spa where a Chilean gives me a Brazilian."" ""My great-grandfather did not travel across four thousand miles of the Atlantic Ocean to see this nation overrun by immigrants,"" he declared. ""He did it because he killed a man back in Ireland. That's the rumor."" Colbert appeared before Congress the day after ""The Colbert Report"" showed video of him packing corn and picking beans on a farm as part of a challenge from a pro-immigrant-labor group. ""I'll admit I started my work day with preconceived notions of migrant labor,"" Colbert said. ""But after working with these men and women ... side by side in the unforgiving sun I have to say -- and I do mean this sincerely -- please don't make me do this again. It is really, really hard."" The brief experience, he said, ""gave me some small understanding why so few Americans are clamoring to begin an exciting career as seasonal migrant field workers."" Colbert appeared alongside, among others, United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez, whose group over the summer launched ""Take Our Jobs,"" a campaign that challenged U.S. citizens to replace immigrants in farm work. The group, which says only seven citizens or legal residents have taken it up on the offer, argues that immigrant workers aren't taking citizens' jobs, and is pushing for a bill that would give undocumented farm workers currently in the United States the right to earn legal status. On his show Thursday night, Colbert mocked those deriding his appearance before the committee, saying he agreed that showing up in character would ""sully the good name of experts that Republican-controlled Congresses have actually called to testify in the past,"" like Elmo, the Sesame Street character who promoted music education before a House subcommittee in 2002. Republicans on the subcommittee were not impressed or swayed by Colbert's appearance. ""Maybe we should be spending less time watching Comedy Central and more time considering all the real jobs that are out there -- ones that require real hard labor and ones that don't involve sitting behind a desk,"" said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. ""If we did we'd realize that every day ... Americans perform the dirtiest, most difficult, most dangerous (jobs) that can be thrown at them."" Many of these workers, King said, ""would prefer the aroma of fresh dirt to that of the sewage of American elitists who disparage them even as they flush."" ""It's an insult to me to hear that Americans won't do this work,"" he added, arguing that the hiring of undocumented workers is driving down wages and taking jobs away from those in the country legally. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, used the occasion to rip the Obama administration's immigration policy. The notion that there's little competition for jobs between citizens and undocumented workers is a ""myth,"" he claimed. ""We could make millions of jobs available to American citizens ... if the federal government simply enforced our immigration laws,"" Smith asserted. ""Unfortunately this administration is turning its back on American workers."" Democrats were quick to challenge the Republicans' claims. While Americans will take tough jobs, ""study after study"" shows that ""people would rather have no income and no welfare than take the back-breaking jobs that the migrant farm worker has to do every single day,"" said Rep. Howard Berman, D-California. ""Were it not for immigrant farm workers in this country, there would be no seasonal fresh fruit and vegetables,"" he said. Most of the media attention, however, remained focused on Colbert. The chairwoman of the subcommittee, Rep. Zoe Lofrgen, D-California, told CNN's Dana Bash before the hearing that she didn't think Colbert's appearance was a stunt. ""Celebrities add pizzazz to an issue,"" she said. ""I hope his celebrity will bring attention"" to this one. But another Democrat, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, initially seemed unimpressed with Colbert, asking him to leave the committee room and merely submit his written statement instead. Colbert noted that he was testifying at Lofgren's invitation, and said that he would remove himself at her request. Conyers later told CNN he feared Colbert would create a ""circus"" atmosphere. But Colbert, who engaged in a question-and-answer session with the subcommittee, actually turned out to be ""profound,"" he said. CNN's Jason Hanna, Deirdre Walsh, Alison Harding and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report .","Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert testified about conditions facing migrant farm workers .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A verdict on a holy site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims will not be delivered Friday, as was previously expected. India's Supreme Court on Thursday temporarily stayed the verdict. The order postpones a judgment that will decide ownership of long-disputed land in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. Supreme court lawyer Mukul Rohatgi told reporters that the hearing on the petition would resume Tuesday. India stepped up security ahead of the anticipated decision and on Wednesday, temporarily banned mass text messages over fears that the ruling might spark sectarian passions. The order came from the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Home Affairs to telecommunications companies, instructing them not to deliver bulk text messages ""in all service areas with immediate effect for the next 72 hours."" The northern Indian town has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there. In 1859, British colonial administrators annexed the site because of growing religious disputes and created separate Muslim and Hindu places of worship there. Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace a Muslim mosque razed by a Hindu extremists 1992. The destruction of the 16th-century Babri mosque sparked widespread riots in which more than 2,000 people died nationwide. A court battle over who has rights to build on the site has dragged on for years. This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after the judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid any violence. Rohatgi said the supreme court has sent notices to both sides in the lawsuit in an attempt to find a compromise over the explosive issue.","Both Hindus and Muslims claim rights to land in Ayodhya .

"(CNN) -- Titleholders Inter Milan relieved the pressure on under-fire manager Rafael Benitez by qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League along with Group A rivals Tottenham on Wednesday night. The Italian champions scraped a 1-0 win at home to Dutch league winners Twente to go through to the last 16 ahead of the final round of matches on December 7. Veteran Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso scored the winner in the 55th minute after Wesley Sneijder's free-kick hit the defensive wall. The Dutch midfielder had earlier hit the woodwork from a similar situation and missed an early chance from close range for injury-hit Inter. Third-placed Twente hit the crossbar through second-half substitute Denny Landzaat in the 75th minute, but now face a drop into the second-tier Europa League. England's Tottenham, playing in Europe's top club competition for the first time, remained top of the table after crushing Werder Bremen 3-0. The German club next host Inter in their final match, having only two points from five matches -- three behind Twente with a worse goal difference, meaning their European season is effectively over. Tottenham went ahead in the sixth minute when defender Younes Kaboul followed up his match-winning goal from Saturday's London derby against Arsenal to volley in a right-wing cross from winger Aaron Lennon. Croatia midfielder Luka Modric made it 2-0 in the first minute of first-half injury-time as he calmly poked in a volley after striker Peter Crouch headed down a cross from fullback Alan Hutton. Gareth Bale hit the bar with a free-kick five minutes after the break, but had a penalty saved by goalkeeper Tim Wiese soon after when Modric was fouled by Felix Kroos. However, Crouch sealed victory with 11 minutes to play as he converted Lennon's low cross after Bale's floated center hit the top of the bar. Barcelona qualified from Group D with a 3-0 victory away to Panathinaikos, which eliminated the Greek side. Winger Pedro scored twice while Leo Messi continued his sensational scoring run to give the Catalan club an unassailable 11 points from five games. Daniel Alves set Pedro free for the 27th-minute opener, firing in a low shot, then the Brazil fullback charged forward to start a super move that ended in Messi converting Adriano's cross in the 63rd minute. Six minutes later, Alves and Andres Iniesta combined to give Pedro a simple second goal. The Spanish champions finished top following Rubin Kazan's earlier 1-0 win at home to second-placed Copenhagen, which left the Russians just a point behind the Danes ahead of their trip to Barca's Nou Camp next month. Christian Noboa's penalty in first-half injury-time gave Rubin a first home win in the competition in six attempts. The club's captain scored after Bebras Natcho's free-kick was handled by veteran winger Jesper Gronkjaer, and his side held on for victory after Copenhagen's Dame N'Doye hit the crossbar and goalkeeper Sergei Ryzhikov denied substitute Kenneth Zohore in time added on. Manchester United qualified from Group C with a 1-0 win away to Scottish side Rangers, as Wayne Rooney scored the winner in his first start since early October. The England striker netted an 87th-minute penalty after Brazilian defender Fabio da Silva was fouled by Steven Naismith. It was Rooney's second match in four days, having come on as a substitute on Saturday following an ankle injury and the controversy over whether he would stay at the English club which ended in him signing a new five-year contract. Third-placed Rangers will now drop into the Europa League regardless of the result of their final match against Bursaspor. The Turkish club will finish bottom following the 6-1 thrashing at Valencia, who need to beat United to finish top. The Spanish side, however, are guaranteed a place in the second round following a four-goal first-half blitz at the Mestalla. Juan Mata's 17th-minute penalty was followed by the first of striker Roberto Soldado's two goals, then fellow striker Aritz Aduriz netted at the near post at the second attempt and winger Joaquin whipped a deflected effort into the top corner. Soldado rounded the keeper and fired into the roof of the net 10 minutes after halftime before Pablo Batalla converted a low cross at the far post, then Alejandro Dominguez wrapped up Valencia's win with 12 minutes left. French club Lyon went through for the eight successive year despite losing 3-0 at Schalke, who also qualified from Group B. The German side led 2-0 inside the first 20 minutes through Peruvian midfielder Jefferson Farfan and Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who capped victory with his second goal with a minute to play. Veteran Spanish striker Raul set up Farfan with a deflected pass after pouncing on an attempted clearance by Pape Diakhate, then Peer Kluge's cross provided Huntelaar with the second. Lyon had key midfielder Yoann Gourcuff stretchered off with an ankle injury in the second half, then Huntelaar's late deflected effort gave Schalke a perfect home record and put his side a point clear ahead of the December 7 trip to Portugal. Schalke will face a Benfica side who surprisingly crashed 3-0 at bottom club Hapoel Tel Aviv. The Israelis picked up their first victory to leave Benfica three points behind Lyon, as attacking midfielder Eran Zahavi scored in each half either side of defender Douglas da Silva's 74th-minute goal from a corner.","Tottenham and Inter Milan qualify for knockout stages of Champions League .

"(CNN) -- FedEx on Friday found a package containing radioactive material that went missing a day earlier at one of its shipping stations in Knoxville, Tennessee, the company said. The package contained a radioactive rod used in CT scans, which use X-rays to create images of patients' bodies. The shipment was lost in transit between its origination point, a hospital in North Dakota, and the equipment's manufacturer in Tennessee. FedEx spokeswoman Sandra Munoz said the rod was enclosed in a metal cylinder that was itself enclosed in a rectangular box. That rectangular box had originally been placed in another box that had the shipping information on it. ""We are trying to track down how the package became detached from the original shipment,"" Munoz said. FedEx employees found an unlabeled container Friday afternoon and opened it, revealing the metal cylinder, which remained closed. ""FedEx employees were never exposed to the radiation,"" Munoz said. Earlier, Munoz had said that if the metal container were opened, there would be some exposure to radiation, but at a low concentration.

"(CNN) -- A Chicago police officer processing a burglary scene and another person were fatally shot Friday afternoon, police said. The officer, an evidence technician, died at 2:30 p.m., one hour after the shootings in the 8100 block of South Burnham Avenue, said Police Superintendent Jody Weis. Police identified the officer, a father of four, as Michael Flisk, 46. Another man also died, Weis said, adding there was no information on a motive. The second victim was a retired Chicago Housing Authority officer, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""The thought that someone can shoot and kill a police officer is unacceptable,"" Weis said. ""We will find those responsible. We shall squeeze that neighborhood and we will find who did this."" The gunman is described as a black male wearing a gray thermal shirt, a blue vest and a gray skull cap, according to WLS. Flisk was collecting evidence at a garage involved in a burglary, Weis said. The officer was a 19-year veteran of the police force and is survived by his wife and four children. He also has three siblings serving in the department. Flisk received 67 awards during his career, police said. The Chicago Police Memorial Foundation offered a $10,000 reward late Saturday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever killed Flisk.

"(CNN) -- High ranking officials in North Korea on Wednesday paid their respects during the state funeral of the country's second-highest ranking military officer, Jo Myong Rok, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Jo, 82, was vice marshal of the Korean People's Army. He died of a heart attack on Saturday, state media said. The high-ranking army official made history in 2000 when he became the first North Korean military officer ever to enter the U.S. Pentagon, later meeting then-President Bill Clinton. Jo's casket was carried by an armored car and escorted by motorcycles away from Pyongyang's Central Hall of Workers where mourners were permitted to gather, state media reported. The country's longtime leader Kim Jong Il and his son Kim Jong Un were among members of the funeral committee, state media said. Jo's death has fueled speculation over new leadership in North Korea. ""The old guard is fading in influence,"" said Scott Snyder, North Korea expert at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's not clear if Kim Jong Un actually needs more titles to make it clear that he is on the rise,"" he said, referring to Kim Jong Il's son. North Korea has been ruled by the Kim family since 1948, and it is widely anticipated that Kim Jong Un will eventually succeed his father, but little is known about the apparent successor. The son of Kim's third wife, who died in 2004 from breast cancer, Kim Jong Un reportedly studied under a false name at the International School in Bern, Switzerland, before attending the Kim Il Sung military academy in Pyongyang. Some North Korea analysts believe, on the other hand, that he may never have left North Korea.","High ranking officials attend state funeral of the country's second-highest ranking military officer .

"New York (CNN) -- The first of three surgeries needed to construct the right ear of 9-year-old Aidan Sullivan came one step closer over the weekend after a New York charity donated $7,000 to replace money stolen from child's fund-raiser. Aidan's parents, Tim and Colleen Sullivan, received a call from The Vincent Crotty Memorial Fund of Suffern, New York, on Saturday to tell them it would contribute $7,000 toward the cost of the boy's upcoming surgery. ""They heard about our story on news and in the papers,"" Colleen Sullivan said. ""They called us up and came over and presented us with the check."" She said she and her husband ""feel honored"" that the charity chose their son, who suffers from a congenital disorder that has caused deformities in his jaw and skull. The money replaces cash reported stolen after a fund-raiser in Connecticut last weekend. Danbury, Connecticut, police Lt. Tom Michael said $7,000 in cash and $1,000 in checks were missing after a November 20 event sponsored by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic fraternal organization. Peter Crotty, whose charity's contribution matches the missing cash, said the donation ""seemed like the right thing to do."" Crotty said he read about the stolen donations on Thanksgiving and was saddened by the emotional distress inflicted on the Sullivans. Crotty founded his charity after the March death of his 18-year-old son and his son's best friend, Chris Konkowski, in a car accident while driving to baseball practice. He said Aidan's story caught his attention because of his own family's experience, ""because it was about a young boy and the emotional sadness and anxiety that people feel due to loss."" Crotty said his organization has received four other contributions nationwide from families who want to get involved. The $7,000 will go toward a scheduled March 1 procedure needed to reconstruct Aidan's missing right ear. While this will not cover all of his needed surgery, his parents are said they were grateful and excited. ""I was crying and touched,"" Colleen Sullivan said. ""There was this feeling of everything is going to be OK.""","Charity donates $7,000 to replace cash reported stolen from child's medical fund .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Justice expects to bring fraud charges next week against a major construction firm -- Secaucus, New Jersey-based Schiavone Construction Company -- for its work on two of the biggest government construction projects in the New York region, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The case involves work on upgrades of New York's subway system and the Croton Water Treatment Plant. Schiavone is likely to be charged with violations of rules designed to assure minority- and female-owned contractors receive portions of federal contracts, the source said. Schiavone, according to the source, actually received the bulk of such subcontracts for major projects in the New York region and farmed out work to a trucking firm with ties to organized crime. The New York Times reported that Schiavone is in negotiations to settle the charges by paying more than $20 million. The source confirmed the accuracy of that report. Another person with knowledge of the case said the settlement is still in the process of being negotiated and has not yet been finalized.

"New York (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's appearances in New York this week are part of a shrewd strategy that is aimed at enhancing his standing in Iran and the Middle East, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. Ahmadinejad, who came to the United Nations for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, met with journalists and was interviewed on Larry King Live, where he called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""skilled killer"" and parried questions about his nation's nuclear program. ""The reality about Iran is that it's a middle-rank power, a regional power, and if not for Ahmadinejad's outlandishness, it would not deserve as much attention as we're giving it,"" Zakaria said. ""But we give it and him enormous attention and almost give Iran and Ahmadinejad free power."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What do you make of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's appearances in New York this week? Fareed Zakaria: One of the annual traditions of the U.N. week has become breakfast with Ahmadinejad. He throws a breakfast for 10 or 12 of us in the media, and its always interesting to see. He has certainly become more schooled and practiced at it. He's now very comfortable in the limelight, he's very comfortable with the media attention. I was struck by the fact that while he's clearly having some troubles at home, he showed no weakness, no hesitation, no nervousness, in fact quite the contrary, he was very confident and quite tough in a lot of the things he said. CNN: What is his game plan? Zakaria: At one level he enjoys the limelight and getting all this attention. He also recognizes that it gives him a certain kind of status at home. There's that perverse dynamic at play here where the media understands this and yet ends up building up this person. But beyond that he's often pursuing a very shrewd definition of of Iran's national interest. CNN: What makes it shrewd? Zakaria: For example, the issue that gets the most attention is almost always the comments he makes on the Palestinian issue. His goal clearly seems to be to appropriate that issue from the moderate Arab states -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- who are of course his key rivals for leadership of the Middle East. He goes much further than they can in his zealous defense of the Palestinian cause, in attacks on Israel and yet is almost always just short of saying something that is truly belligerent. He may have said a few things in the early years that could be interpreted as threatening to attack Israel, but now he's very careful. It makes it impossible for the Egyptian president, say, to make an anti-Iranian speech or an anti-Ahmadinejad speech because on the streets of Egypt, people regard Ahmadinejad as a friend of the great Arab cause. CNN: Is it in his interest to try to doom the peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians? Zakaria: I asked him why he was opposed to the peace talks if the Palestinians wanted to get into them and would he support any deal that the Palestinian people approved of? And he was uncomfortable, because on the one hand he has often said that he wants the Palestinian people to get what they want and here of course, he's criticized the peace talks. The honest answer is no, he does not want the peace talks to succeed, and he's trying to find a way to be an obstructionist without seeming to be an obstructionist. He redirects the question into an attack on either Israel or an attack on the United States, arguing that we can't be a fair broker of these talks because we are too one-sided. It helps him to have tension between Israel and the Palestinians. CNN: What's behind the remarks he made about Netanyahu? Zakaria: He made some very inflammatory remarks about Netanyahu, he called him a dictator, which is truly bizarre because he's a duly elected prime minister. And then he called him a killer who should be on trial for the death of Palestinians, and that I haven't heard him say before. He's looking for ways where he can be tougher on Israel and more zealous in defense of the Palestinians than anyone else in the Middle East. He wants that mantle. CNN: Did he make any news on the nuclear issue? Zakaria: Again I was struck by how tough he was. He did say he would always be willing to talk, but when asked if he was willing to be more cooperative or provide more documents, he was very resistant. It was almost as if he had got his back up on that and felt as though Iran had made enough concessions already. CNN: There have been reports that the clerical hierarchy in Iran has strong doubts, or fears, about Ahmadinejad? Zakaria: He now knows how to parry that kind of question pretty well. He didn't back down from a few things he had said that have gotten him into trouble in Iran. One of them was that he had praised Cyrus the Great, the pre-Islamic Iranian monarch, and he had been criticized by some of the conservative clergy who said you should not be highlighting Iran's pre-Islamic past, you should be highlighting Iran's Islamic heritage. And he in effect doubled down on his praise. He said he was a great king, he abolished serfdom, he abolished slavery, I don't see what's wrong with praising him. He said, there are people who disagree with me in Iran, but I am the elected president. It didn't seem as though he was trying to backtrack. He was more comfortable than in the past in admitting that there was opposition in Iran, but at the same time holding to his position pretty strongly. CNN: Does Ahmadinejad's tough stance present a dilemma for the Obama administration? Zakaria: Sure, it presents a real dilemma. Basically the Obama administration's Iran policy was premised on the idea that we would reach out to the Iranians and say let us agree to disagree on the fundamental issues of your legitimacy and our legitimacy and just come up with a workable deal that will give you some benefits and us some benefits. That strategy was premised on the idea that the Iranians would be willing to talk, to engage. It doesn't appear as if they are, or if they are, we haven't found the magic key to unlocking the gate. The reality is that the Iranian regime has as its core a kind of anti-Americanism, and maybe that's the DNA and it's just very difficult for them to move out of it. It also may be that at this moment, they face certain internal forces that make it difficult for them to change that basic dynamic and start negotiating with the United States. CNN: So what's the result? Zakaria: For whatever reason, they are not willing to play ball, so the Obama administration is left to figure out, in the absence of Iranian cooperation, what's the best strategy. So they've pushed sanctions, and actually been very successful at getting the sanctions passed by the U.N., implemented by the Europeans, supported by the Russians and the Chinese, but it remains to be seen whether in the short-term it will produce the ultimate goal, which is to make the Iranians cut some kind of a deal on the nuclear issue. CNN: Do you think the U.S. has to make a decision imminently or does it have more time? Zakaria: I think it has time. I think the biggest mistake we could make is to inflate the importance of Ahmadinejad, to inflate the importance of Iran, inflate the importance of this issue. Iran is a problem.  It is a regional power on a path which might end up with its acquisition of nuclear weapons. This is not an imminent threat to the United States certainly, and I don't believe it's an imminent threat to Israel. The reality is that Israel has a very strong nuclear deterrent, probably 200 to 250 nuclear weapons. The Iranians are not crazy. Seeing Ahmadinejad once more made me feel that these are very savvy calculating characters, and time is not really on their side. Sanctions are having an effect, the economy is in a mess, the regime faces internal problems, so why should we feel any pressure? Let them feel the pressure.","Iran president made annual trip to New York for U.N. General Assembly .

"London, England (CNN) -- They are the iconic images of a thrilling 2009-10 soccer season in England that helped Bradley Ormesher claim his very own Premier League title. The Times newspaper photographer is one of a legion of snappers who pitch up at matches the length and breadth of England and -- come rain, come shine -- chronicle the many magic moments from a grueling, nine-month campaign. Ormesher's hard graft and spectacular imagery reaped rewards this year when, for the second time since 2008, he was crowned the Barclays Photographer of the Year, one of the most prestigious gongs in the field of football photography. The Manchester derby proved a rich hunting ground for Ormesher, whose portfolio of five photos features three from clashes between Manchester United and City. He captured the joy and despair on show from both sets of players after Paul Scholes's injury-time goal secured a victory for United at City to keep Alex Ferguson's title hopes alive, and Rio Ferdinand's pained reaction after Craig Bellamy had scored in the return fixture at Old Trafford. Ormesher also snapped Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson laughing in the middle of an August rainstorm, Fernando Torres holding off Rio Ferdinand prior to scoring for Liverpool and a sea of delighted faces at Everton, after Jack Rodwell had just scored the clinching goal in their win over Manchester United. Here the man who created the images talks to Fanzone about the inspiration behind the photos and how he achieved an award-winning end product.","The Times newspaper Bradley Ormesher is crowned Barclays Photographer of the Season .

"(CNN) -- Spain's 2010 World Cup heroes dominate the list of nominees for this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or, the award given to the world's best footballer. Barcelona's Andres Iniesta, the man whose goal beat the Netherlands and handed Spain their first World Cup, is on the list alongside his midfield partner Xavi and star striker David Villa, who found the net five times during the tournament. In all, the reigning World and European champions have seven players in a 23-strong shortlist, Real Madrid pair Iker Casillas and Xabi Alonso, Cesc Fabregas of Arsenal and Barcelona defender Carles Puyol completing the Spanish contingent. The award is a combination of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the France Football Ballon d'Or trophy, which have previously been run separately. The winner of the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or will be announced in Zurich on January 10. Argentine superstar Lionel Messi, who won both trophies in 2009, is one of six Barca players nominated, Daniel Alves of Brazil being their final contender. Real Madrid duo of 2008 winner Cristiano Ronaldo and Germany play maker Mesut Ozil, who enhanced his growing reputation with a string of impressive displays during Germany's run to the semifinals in South Africa, also make the elite list. Another German who shot to stardom during the World Cup is Bayern Munich's golden boot winner Thomas Mueller, who is nominated with club and national team colleagues Miroslav Klose, who hit four goals in July's football showpiece, full-back Philipp Lahm and midfield dynamo Bastian Schweinsteiger. Inter Milan's UEFA Champion's League triumph has not gone unnoticed among the selectors, with their Dutch talisman Wesley Sneijder included after a hugely successful year which also saw him reach the World Cup final with Netherlands. Inter's Brazilian duo of right back Maicon and goalkeeper Julio Cesar have also been short listed with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o. Africa is represented further by Ghanaian Asamoah Gyan after his contribution to the Black Stars' World Cup quarterfinals appearance, and Ivorian Didier Drogba is on the list after a fine season with English Premier League champions Chelsea. Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan is also nominated after a year which saw him win the Europa League with his club and reach the last four of the World Cup with Uruguay. No English players are on the shortlist after a disappointing World Cup for Fabio Capello's team. The nominees are selected by football experts from FIFA's Football and Technical and Development Committees. Full list of 23 players nominated for 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or: . Xabi Alonso (Spain), Daniel Alves (Brazil), Iker Casillas (Spain), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast), Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon), Cesc Fabregas (Spain), Diego Forlan (Uruguay), Asamoah Gyan (Ghana), Andres Iniesta (Spain), Julio Cesar (Brazil), Miroslav Klose (Germany), Philipp Lahm (Germany), Maicon (Brazil), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Thomas Mueller (Germany), Mesut Ozil (Germany), Carles Puyol (Spain), Arjen Robben (Netherlands), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany), Wesley Sneijder (Netherlands), David Villa (Spain) and Xavi (Spain).","Spain have seven players nominated for the FIFA Ballon d'Or .

"(CNN) -- He's started in a record 291 consecutive games, but Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre's streak could be intercepted by injury this weekend. In a press conference Monday, Vikings head coach Brad Childress said Favre had two fractures, including a stress fracture, and was wearing an ankle boot. ""He's had ankle and heel problems for a long time, so that walking boot makes him a little bit more comfortable,"" Childress said. The Vikings will play the New England Patriots this Sunday. ""I wouldn't rule anything out in terms of the end of the week,"" Childress said. But he added, ""You can't put a guy that's a sitting duck out there. ... His competitive nature, I'm sure, will come into it, but a lot of times you've got to protect people from themselves."" The Vikings are coming off a 28-24 loss Sunday to the Green Bay Packers. ""You feel like you've let everybody down,"" Favre said in a press conference after the game. ""It's tough."" Childress said he's handling Favre's situation day by day. It's unclear whether Favre's marathon record will end this weekend. ""Once he's functional, he can play,"" the coach said. Favre recently made headlines due to allegations that he sent explicit material to a woman who worked for the New York Jets when he was the Jets' quarterback two years ago. The National Football League initiated an investigation into Favre's alleged actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that Favre sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Jets sideline personality and host Jenn Sterger in 2008. Favre's record for most consecutive starts by any player in the history of the NFL spans about 19 seasons, according to NFL.com.","Quarterback Brett Favre has two fractures .

"New York (CNN) -- Pakistan's foreign minister expressed disappointment Friday over what he called ""a very harsh sentence"" for a Pakistani scientist convicted of attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan. A federal judge issued Thursday the 86-year sentence for Aafia Siddiqui, who was convicted by a jury in February on seven charges, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers. ""I think she has not been given the benefit of the doubt,"" Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi told CNN Friday. ""But she does have a right to appeal. I'm sure her family and the government will consult and will think of going with the appeal."" Qureshi said the sentence has sparked reaction in Pakistan, where ""people have protested, people have demonstrated. Many people feel that she is innocent and she was framed and she should have got a fairer chance."" He added, however, that Pakistanis ""also understand the government did its best, and we have our limitations. There is due process of law and we have to stay within the process of law. But there is a disappointment and that has been expressed on the streets of Pakistan."" He spoke to CNN while in New York to attend sessions at the United Nations. ""I'm disappointed at the sentence,"" he said. ""I think it's a very harsh sentence."" Prosecutors said Siddiqui picked up a rifle and shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unrestrained at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. The agents returned fire, shooting her in the abdomen. Siddiqui was extradited to the United States in August 2008, after the shooting incident. At her sentencing Thursday morning, the 38-year-old MIT graduate shook her head in defiance and wagged her finger in a ""no"" gesture as U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman laid out the case against her. But Siddiqui was more subdued when Berman allowed her to speak before the packed courtroom filled with family, spectators and foreign and national press. Clad in a khaki suit and a hijab that covered most of her face, Siddiqui repeatedly asked her Muslim supporters to not ""get emotional."" ""I don't want any violence in my name,"" Siddiqui said of the demonstrations in Pakistan, where her case has become a cause celebre. ""If you do anything for me, please educate people about Islam because people don't understand that it is a religion of mercy.""

"(CNN) -- Crews in Taiwan have found body parts as the search unfolds for victims of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week, official media said. Four sets of body parts have been found, with DNA testing to be done, Taiwan's official Central News Agency said. Nineteen tourists from southern China, a Chinese tour group leader and a Taiwanese bus driver went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on the island's eastern coast, gave way. Three dozen family members of the missing Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan on Monday night. They were to visit the site of the rock slides on Tuesday, China's state media said. Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless. Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million). No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said.","Four sets have been discovered, with DNA testing to be done .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Tariq Aziz, one of the best-known faces of the Iraqi government for more than two decades, was sentenced to death Tuesday by the Iraqi High Tribunal for his role in eliminating religious parties during Saddam Hussein's regime, court officials told CNN. His family was shocked by the verdict, his daughter told CNN. They had no idea he was going to be sentenced Tuesday, Zainab Aziz said from Amman, Jordan. ""Until last week they were hearing new witnesses in this case,"" she said, criticizing both the verdict itself and its timing. ""My father served his country for more than 22 years. He delivered himself to the U.S. Army [after the fall of Hussein] because he wasn't afraid. He didn't do anything wrong. He served his country,"" she told CNN International's ""iDesk"" program. ""He has been wronged,"" Zainab Aziz said. ""He feels that way and we feel that way because we know he didn't do anything wrong, he only served his country as a foreign minister and that didn't include anything of these bloody crimes he's been tried for right now,"" she argued. ""I think it's very unfair,"" she said. She said her father had little expectation that an appeal would help. ""I don't think he has any hope of coming out"" of prison, she said, adding that he is ""old and frail. ""He doesn't have any hope, but he is really happy that we are OK, that we are doing fine,"" she said. ""That is his only consolation."" Badi Arif, an attorney who used to represent Aziz, said there is a political motive behind the death sentence. ""Mr. Aziz used to always tell me, 'They'll find a way to kill me, and there is no way for me to escape this,'"" Arif told CNN. ""But from a legal perspective, this sentence is wrong; this is illegal and this is unexpected."" In March 2009, Aziz was sentenced to 15 years in prison in connection with the 1992 executions of 42 merchants. Aziz was deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003, also holding the post of foreign minister for part of that time. Abed Hameed Mahmoud and Sadoon Shaker, top former regime Baathists, also were sentenced to death for their involvement, court officials said. Amnesty International urged Iraq not to carry out the sentences, even as it acknowledged the brutality of Hussein's regime. ""Saddam Hussein's rule was synonymous with executions, torture and other gross human rights violations, and it is right that those who committed crimes are brought to justice,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""However, it is vital that the death penalty, which is the ultimate denial of human rights, should never be used, whatever the gravity of the crime,"" he said in a written statement. The Vatican also opposed the death sentence, spokesman Federico Lombardi told CNN. ""This is not the most adequate way to promote reconciliation and reconstruction of justice and peace in a country that has suffered so much,"" he said. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Fionnuala Sweeney, Mohammed Jamjoom and Hada Messia contributed to this report.","NEW: The Vatican opposes the death sentence as ""not the best way to promote reconciliation""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in northeast Texas were assessing damage Monday morning after a tornado destroyed homes, knocked train cars off their tracks and injured at least four people. Five homes in Rice, Texas, were destroyed as 125 mph winds whipped through a seven-mile swath of Navarro County Sunday evening, said Eric Meyers, the county's emergency management coordinator. Meyers rode out the tornado inside a vehicle and videotaped the twister as it tore the roof off a school about a block away. ""We are in the tornado! We are in the tornado!"" Meyers yells several times in the video. ""The sheer power was just amazing,"" Meyers said in an interview Monday on CNN's ""American Morning"" program. The storm, which struck around 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), also turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car, knocked 11 cars from a freight train off their tracks and caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School, Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. Video: 'People screamed, cried, and prayed' as tornado passed . Four people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, he said. In addition to ""significant damage"" from the storm moving through Navarro County, witnesses also reported possible tornadoes in other parts of northeast Texas Sunday evening, the National Weather Service said. Callers reported four tornadoes in Lone Oak, Texas, Fire Chief Chris Moore said, but authorities had not yet confirmed whether a twister had touched down there. The storm destroyed one home, damaged three others and knocked down power lines there, Moore said. Authorities called off a youth football game as winds picked up speed and hail pelted the county, he said. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos . Sonia Butler hunkered down in the bathroom of her Rice home with her brother as the storm hit. ""You could just hear the wind coming through the house and it felt like a big suction,"" she told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""And then it sounded like a loud train, and it only lasted -- not very long, but after that, after we came out of the restroom, our house was just gone."" Her husband, Raymond Butler, sought shelter in another part of the home as the storm hit. The room he stayed in remained untouched, but the storm demolished most of their home, ripping off the roof, shattering light bulbs and breaking their deceased daughter's track trophies. The storm also destroyed two trucks, a trailer, and a giant pecan tree on the property -- but it spared the grave of their daughter, who died last year. ""I just got down on my knees and said, 'Lord be with us,' "" Raymond Butler told WFAA. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. ""We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,"" he said. Someone screamed when they saw a funnel forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. ""The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening. ... We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,"" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. ""Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,"" he said. Later Sunday, a possible tornado swept through Baldwin County, Alabama, knocking down power lines and tree branches, destroying a mobile home and shifting another mobile home off its foundation, said Leigh Ann Ryals with the county's Emergency Operations Center. One person was injured, Ryals said, and crews planned to continue surveying damage Monday. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange is defending the group's recent leak and said it poses no real risk to soldiers or civilians in Iraq. ""This material doesn't mention any soldiers' names, doesn't mention any names of Iraqi civilians,"" he told CNN's Larry King Monday. ""The only thing at risk here is the reputations of the politicians and bureaucrats that put these soldiers into harm's way -- and who put Iraqis into harm's way,"" he said. Last week, the whistle-blower website published some 400,000 classified documents detailing the war in Iraq. They showed, Assange said, the deaths of 109,000 people, including soldiers and civilians. The release also revealed that roughly 15,000 more Iraqi civilians died during the conflict than previously thought, he said. The Pentagon has denounced the leak and has warned it could put U.S. troops in greater danger -- an accusation Assange denied. Earlier this year, WikiLeaks released more than 70,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan. The website was heavily criticized then by the U.S. government, the military and some human rights groups for failing to withhold civilians' names, potentially putting them at risk of retaliation. Assange said WikiLeaks redacted the new round of documents, which included 391,832 reports. He also addressed an interview he gave last week to CNN's Atika Shubert. Assange walked out after she started to ask questions about investigations in Sweden, where he has been accused in separate cases of rape and molestation. King, who appeared to be watching footage of the old interview, momentarily thought Assange had walked out on him. ""I didn't walk off Larry just then, but perhaps I should,"" Assange said. He called such claims false and urged media groups not to conflate the content of the leak with ""any sort of tabloid journalism."" ""It should be obvious that these things are not in balance and they are not proportionate. It is not right to bring in sensational, and -- in fact false claims -- a relatively trivial matter compared to the deaths of 109,000 people,"" Assange said. He also blasted an argument, which he said has been made by the Pentagon, that the recent leak does not contain any significant or new information. ""Of course, there's nothing new to them in the material. But there's a lot new to the rest of the world,"" he said. CNN was offered access to the Iraq documents in advance of the release but declined because of conditions that were attached to accepting. The New York Times and The Guardian, a British newspaper, were among a handful of organizations provided early access to the documents. The Guardian said the reports detail torture, summary executions and war crimes. U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, the documents show, it said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell has said field reports do not contain evidence of war crimes. The Times wrote that hundreds of reports of beatings, burnings and lashings suggested that ""such treatment was not an exception."" Most abuse cases contained in the new batch of leaks appear to have been ultimately ignored, the paper said.","Julian Assange talks to CNN's Larry King .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says relations with China are ""extremely important,"" but Beijing's demand for an apology and compensation over the detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain is ""completely groundless and is utterly unacceptable for Japan."" The statement Saturday went on to assert Japanese jurisdiction over the islands where the captain was detained and declared that the dispute was handled in accordance with Japanese law. Zhan Qixiong was detained earlier this month after his trawler collided with Japanese vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. He was freed on Friday. Earlier, Satoru Sato, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, made similar statements to Japan's Kyodo news agency in response to China's apology demand. Despite this call for an apology, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the two sides should resolve the problems through dialogue and consultation, according to Chinese state media. Zhan was accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed their duties, China's Xinhua news agency said. He arrived home safely on Saturday, according to Xinhua. ""We decided to suspend the charges in consideration of the Japan-China relationship,"" the Japanese prosecutor in the case said. The arrest tensions between the two countries, with Beijing accusing Japan of ""unlawful and invalid"" arrest of the captain and his crew of 14, according to Xinhua. China considers the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China its property, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources . that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Word of the captain's release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China. The four are being investigated for entering a military zone without authorization and videotaping military targets, Chinese state media said. Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","NEW: Statement asserts Japanese jurisdiction over disputed islands .

"(CNN) -- Leonard Skinner, the gym teacher who inspired the name of the legendary southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, has died. The band announced his death on its website, saying Skinner died in his sleep early Monday morning. He was 77. ""Coach Skinner had such a profound impact on our youth that ultimately led us to naming the band, which you know as Lynyrd Skynyrd, after him,"" wrote Gary Rossington, guitarist and a founding member of the band. ""Looking back, I cannot imagine it any other way. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time."" Band lore has it that Skinner was a coach and gym teacher at Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Florida -- and a stickler for the school's policy against long hair. He reportedly sent several students to the principal's office for violating the policy, including some who would go on to form an up-and-coming band with a tongue-in-cheek variation on his name. The band formed in the early 1970s and had a string of acclaimed songs, including ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" In October 1977, a plane crash in Mississippi killed lead singer Ronnie Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; Gaines's sister, vocalist Cassie Gaines; an assistant road manager; and the pilot and copilot. But the band soldiered on, released more than 60 albums and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.","Skinner, 77, dies in his sleep, the band says .

"(CNN)  -- Robert Levy, father of the Capitol Hill intern found slain nine years ago in Washington's Rock Creek Park, revealed to The Washington Post recently something he had never shared before but that all parents understand. When he dropped off Chandra, 24, at the Metro a week before she was reported missing, ""Something inside of me knew it was going to be the last time I ever saw her. I just wish I had done something."" He didn't tell anyone, including his wife, about his misgiving. Not during the investigation of U.S. Rep. Gary Condit, who was having an affair with Chandra. Not when a day laborer from El Salvador was arrested for Chandra's murder. Only now, nine years later, can Robert Levy admit the guilt he still feels. Surely, he knows that he's being irrational. Chandra was living and working in the nation's capital, not a war zone. What was he going to do? Tell her to get back in the car? Do not be embarrassed, Mr. Levy. We all have these feelings about our children. And we rarely act on them. According to Bureau of Justice statistics, violent crimes against Americans 12 and older are at their lowest level in more than three decades. As young people move through their 20s, their victimization rate, already low, declines further. We in the media fail to remind people enough of these things. We sometimes forget such statistics, however, because new and old forms of media feed us a 24-hour-a-day diet of menace and mayhem -- the constancy of which previous generations of parents didn't experience. As Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and criminal justice expert, says, ""We're inundated with information about crimes. The more bizarre and horrendous, the more saliency they get."" The steady drumbeat of crime pumps up our anxiety that something bad may happen to our child that we could have or should have prevented. Maybe it surfaces the first time we leave our infant with a baby sitter. Or when we give our elementary school-age daughter permission to start walking home from school by herself and she doesn't call us at work the minute she gets there. It's not just criminals we fear. We agree reluctantly to let our 17-year-old son, a newly licensed driver, drive his friends home from soccer practice. It's 8 p.m., he's not home yet and we start to fret. Or we put our college student on an airplane and for a split second think, ""What if that thunderstorm they're predicting takes the plane down?"" When my grown son went scuba diving for the first time on the Great Barrier Reef, I woke up in the middle of the night worrying that his oxygen tank might fail. Had I talked enough with him about precautions he should take? Did the tour guide know how to reach my husband and I right away should something happen? I told myself, ""He's 25, for God's sake."" That helped, but not much. We question ourselves less frequently as our children get older, but not a lot less. Why? Daniel Keating, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan, suspects there's more to it than media coverage. Parents are more deeply involved in their older children's private lives than previous generations were, he says. College is no longer the ""declaration of independence"" it used to be, for child or parent, but rather a continuation of credit card charges, daily phone calls and regular texts. We continue to prop up our children long after they actually need us to. It's not surprising, then, that when something bad happens, we assume we could have done something to prevent it. The ability to stay connected round-the-clock may be the clincher. Remember when we were in college and our parents had to phone the front desk of our dorms in the hopes of reaching us? They knew there was a good chance we wouldn't get the message until the next day, if at all. Logistics made it silly, if not useless, for them to worry immediately. With texting and Twitter, Keating says, ""We have the technical ability of constant surveillance. This keeps our children constantly in our minds."" We need not cut connections, although fewer peeks on Facebook might not be a bad idea. And, says Keating, we need not -- indeed we should not -- repress our fears. Instead, he advises parents to identify the specific event they're afraid of and counter with the evidence that it's really unlikely. ""If possible, let it fly away as rapidly as it flew in,"" he says. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.","Laura Stepp: Robert Levy, Chandra's dad, feared he wouldn't see her again .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored four goals for the first time as Real Madrid retained top spot in Spain with a 6-1 thrashing of Racing Santander on Saturday. Defending champions Barcelona had briefly gone to the La Liga summit with a 2-0 victory at bottom club Zaragoza thanks to two goals from Lionel Messi, but Ronaldo upstaged the world player of the year as Real ran riot. The Portugal forward took his tally to 11 goals in 11 games this season -- eight coming in his last three league matches. Santander came to the Spanish capital just one point above the relegation zone, and tried a defensive line-up of three center-backs which was exposed time and again in the first half. Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in the 10th minute with a calm finish after collecting Angel Di Maria's superb long pass for his fifth league goal this season, then five minutes later he set up Ronaldo's first of the night with a low cross from the right. Ronaldo made it 3-0 in the 27th minute despite coming from an offside position, sidefooting home again this time with his left foot as Mesut Ozil mirrored Higuain's assist. Santander switched to a 4-4-2 formation at halftime, but it made no difference as Ronaldo completed his hat-trick two minutes after the break as he showed good balance to turn and guide in a low cross from Di Maria which went behind him. The world's most expensive player then made it 5-0 from the penalty spot in the 55th minute after Di Maria was brought down just inside the area, and Germany midfielder Ozil put Real further ahead from Xabi Alonso's throughball on 63. Santander took small consolation 10 minutes later when midfielder Papa Diop's shot took a wicked deflection off the back of teammate Markus Rosenberg, leaving Real captain Iker Casillas helpless in goal. The victory means Real have scored 16 goals in three league games, and kept Jose Mourinho's unbeaten team one point ahead of Barcelona. ""We've been playing well for several games now, doing a good job overall and pressurising our opponents as a whole team. Individual quality starts to shine through sooner when a team works well collectively,"" Mourinho told the Real website. ""We have to start working on our game against Murcia [on Tuesday] as of now. Ozil, Carvalho and Xabi Alonso will have a three-day holiday. The rest will be called up for the match. [Karim] Benzema will be a starter, and so will Ronaldo."" Messi took his tally to four goals in a week as he followed up his two-goal effort from Barcelona's 2-0 Champions League win over Copenhagen. The Argentina forward put the Catalans ahead three minutes before halftime after being set free by Spain striker David Villa's surging run on the counter-attack. Zaragoza, rock bottom with just three draws from eight matches, then had midfielder Leonardo Ponzio red-carded soon after halftime following an incident also involving Barcelona fullback Dani Alves. Barca took advantage in the 66th minute as Messi lashed home the loose ball after the home defense failed to clear, while Villa hit the outside of the post later on. Valencia could have joined Barcelona on 19 points, but lost 2-1 at home to Mallorca in the late match. The islanders led 2-0 before half an hour had been played as a much-changed home side suffered a second successive league defeat. Chori Castro netted both goals -- the first a sixth-minute penalty after striker Pierre Webo was clipped from behind, the second an opportunist header after an earlier shot was blocked. Valencia, who drew 1-1 away to Scottish club Rangers in the Champions League in midweek, pulled one back from the spot in the 35th minute through Roberto Soldado but could not capitalize on an improved second-half showing. Third-placed Villarreal, who also have 16 points, can move ahead of Barca on goal difference with victory against Atletico Madrid on Sunday . In Saturday's only Italian Serie A match, Fiorentina moved up to 12th place with a 2-1 win at home to Bari -- a result that left both clubs in a bunch of six on eight points, eight behind leaders Lazio. Midfielder Marco Donadel opened the scoring in the 34th minute and Alberto Gilardino doubled the lead with eight minutes to play before Alessandro Parisi's late consolation. Former Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara has been named new coach of Italy's Under-21 team, replacing Pierluigi Casiraghi.","Real Madrid lead Barcelona by a point after defeating Racing Santander 6-1 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A classified U.S. military document appears to lend credence to claims that Iran crossed the Iraqi border to arrest three American hikers. The field report was one of 400,000 the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks released Friday concerning U.S. and coalition operations in Iraq. The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained -- all on the Iraqi side of the border, according to The New York Times, which reviewed the document with aid from an American government official. ""This has been suggested publicly before,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told CNN on Friday. ""The simple answer is, we don't know. All we know is that two hikers remain in Iranian custody and should be released today. They have done nothing wrong."" The July 12 edition of The Nation magazine cited two witnesses who said they saw members of Iran's national police force in July 2009 cross the border into northern Iraq to apprehend Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal. Shourd has since been released. Bauer and Fattal remain jailed in Tehran's Evin prison. The hikers described themselves as tourists. Tehran contends they are spies. The military document, dated July 31, 2009, the date the hikers were detained, has been heavily redacted. It includes references to Kirkuk and Baghdad, cities in Iraq. A fourth hiker who became ill and did not go on the trip ""reported that a kidnapped female called him saying that they were being surrounded by armed men,"" according to the report. A drone aircraft was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16 jet fighters were alerted, the Times says of the document. The military dispatch ended with an assessment. ""The lack of coordination on the part of these hikers, particularly after being forewarned, indicates an intent to agitate and create publicity regarding international policies on [Iran],"" the assessment read in part. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Three American hikers were arrested in July 2009 .

"(CNN)  -- When talking about so-called family values, pastors, popes, and politicians routinely quote the Bible as if it were an unassailable divine authority --  after all, they assume, God wrote the Bible, and therefore it is absolutely and literally true. But that is a misconception. As the Bible itself makes clear, its authors were human beings, many of whom are named: David, Isaiah, Luke, and Paul. These human writers wrote over the course of more than a thousand years, and their writings reflect their own views and the values they shared with their contemporaries. So it's not surprising that inconsistencies are frequent in the Bible, both trivial and profound. Although Jews and Christians, individually and collectively, have for the last 2,000 years accepted the Bible as authoritative in principle, in practice many of its values have been rejected. On issues such as slavery, no one today would maintain that slavery is acceptable, even though, according to the Bible, it was a divinely sanctioned institution. In the debates about slavery in the 19th century those opposed to its abolition cited the Bible in support of their position, but despite such biblical warrant, their views were renounced. According to biblical law, a father could sell his daughter as a slave, and the last of the Ten Commandments lists as off-limits a neighbor's possessions -- his house, wife, slaves, and livestock. But the majority of modern Jews and Christians no longer accept the biblical view of women as men's property and hence subordinate to them, as they have also abandoned the biblical practice of polygamy. In current debates about family values, most of which have to do with sex, opponents of abortion and advocates of a woman's right to choose both cite the Bible in support of their conflicting views, even though the Bible in fact says nothing specifically about the issue. And with regard to same-sex marriage, although the few biblical writers who mention same-sex relationships, especially between men, were unequivocally opposed to them, many contemporary believers would argue that, as with slavery and the status of women, it is time to recognize that the values of the biblical writers are no longer necessarily our own. Opponents of same-sex marriage cite Leviticus, which says that when a man sleeps with a man as with a woman it is an abomination. They're right: It does say that. But it later calls for the death penalty for such activity, which only the most rabid opponents would insist on. The Bible also calls eating pork and a woman wearing a man's clothes abominations, yet many would no longer enforce such prohibitions. Individual biblical texts should not be appealed to selectively: Such cherry-picking is all too easy because of the nature of the Bible as a multi-authored book. Rather, as with another formative text, the Constitution, one needs first to understand it historically -- what did its words mean when they were written -- and then attempt to determine what its underlying values are, not just what it says in a specific passage. Only in this sense can the Bible be considered to have timeless relevance that transcends the historical particularities of its authors. What are those underlying values? I would argue that they are rooted in love of neighbor, which Jewish and Christian commentators over the ages have identified as the essential and enduring message of the Bible. Here are three of them. The great Rabbi Hillel, who when asked what the basic principle of the Torah was, replied: ""What is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor: That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary."" His words are echoed both by his near-contemporary, another rabbi, Jesus of Nazareth, who put it this way: ""Whatever you wish people to do to you, so you should do to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets,"" and by an early leader in the movement that Jesus started, the rabbinically trained Paul, who pronounced that ""Love is the fulfilling of the law."" So, I suggest, the essence of the Bible --  its ultimate authority -- is not in its individual pronouncements, but in its underlying message: equal, even loving, treatment of all persons, regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Coogan.","Michael Coogan: Bible seen as unassailable divine authority, but it was written by men, not God .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund restored their seven-point lead over Mainz at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after beating bottom-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-1. Dortmund went a goal down in the 33rd minute when Marco Reus scored for the visitors, but hit back with goals from Serbian defender Neven Subotic and Shinji Kagawa to open up a 2-1 lead. Two more goals from midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz and Lucas Barrios late in the game wrapped up another impressive win. Bayern Munich moved up to fifth place as they thrashed Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 at the Allianz Arena. Anatoliy Tymoshchuk opened the scoring in the 29th minute for Bayern only for Frankfurt's Theofanis Gekas to cancel it out four minutes later. But goals in the 59th minute by Thomas Mueller and Mario Gomez two minutes later ensured three points for the home side and Tymoshchuk claimed his second of the match shortly before the final whistle. The win means the reigning champions are now unbeaten in seven matches but still trail leaders Dortmund by 14 points. Bayer Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim sees them lose ground on Mainz -- who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Friday night. Leverkusen were unlucky not to claim all three points. A penalty by Gylfi Thor Sigurdsson in the fourth minute of stoppage time added to Vedad Ibisevic 38th minute strike for Hoffenheim and cancelled out two goals from Leverkusen's Sidney Sam and Arturo Vidal early in the first half. Leverkusen remain in third while Hoffenheim drop to sixth place. Goals from Jan Schlaudraff, Didier Ya Konen and Mike Hanke earned Hannover a 3-0 home win over Freiburg and leaves them in fourth with 25 points.

"(CNN) -- A loft office collapsed at a Colorado Salvation Army thrift store, sending debris onto people below and launching a frantic search for someone who may have been missing, authorities said Friday. The second-story loft collapsed around 3 p.m., when 22 people were in the thrift store and warehouse complex in Grand Junction, fire department spokesman Mike Page told CNN. Authorities initially believed one person may have been missing, but later learned that everybody had made it out of the building. The search took several hours because of the large quantity of rubble that was being removed by hand, Page said. Police dogs were assisting with the search. Rescuers used thermal imaging at the facility on Ute Avenue, Page said. Teams drilled a hole into the wall on the opposite side of the building to continue the search operation. Michele Mahoney, who works at a nearby business, said she heard a loud noise around 3:15 p.m. and came outside to discover a chaotic scene.

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. ""Cracklin' Rosie,"" by Neil Diamond . She's not a girl -- she's a bottle of wine. Neil Diamond told Rolling Stone that he got the idea from an Indian tribe in Canada with a much higher male than female population. When the guys with girlfriends all went out on dates, the bachelor guys got together and drank homemade hooch. And actually, Cracklin' Rosie is pretty decent wordplay when you realize the song's boozy origins: ""Crackling"" is used in the wine world to describe a wine that's lightly sparkling. You can actually buy a crackling rosé. 2. ""Elenore,"" by The Turtles . If you've ever listened to this song and thought the line ""you're my pride and joy etcetera"" felt like a pretty poor attempt at lyrics, well, you're right. ""Elenore"" wasn't a girl, but an anti-love letter to the Turtles' record label. The label was demanding a hit just like ""Happy Together,"" which had come out the previous year, so the band slapped together a song they felt was insanely clichéd, happy-go-lucky and generally crappy. To everyone's surprise, it was a big hit. 3. ""Jane,"" by Barenaked Ladies .

The song was about how they were disillusioned with him after he hit on Mia Farrow and some of the other girls studying with him. Mia Farrow and most of the group later felt bad for making these accusations, feeling they had probably misinterpreted his actions. 5. ""Ana's Song (Open Fire),"" Silverchair . At first glance, the lyrics pleading with Ana to die might seem shocking, but in reality, lead singer Daniel Johns suffered from anorexia nervosa and was writing about his experience with it. 6. ""Delilah,"" by Queen . Delilah was one of Freddie Mercury's beloved cats. Mental Floss: The girl who inspired Lincoln's beard . 7. ""Martha My Dear,"" by The Beatles . The lyrics to this one may have been inspired by Paul McCartney's girlfriend, Jane Asher -- he says they ""probably"" were -- but the name comes from his Old English Sheepdog. 8.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This week the who's who of the United Arab Emirates rubbed shoulders at a Gala dinner. Business people talked deals, swapped business cards and rubbed shoulders with government elite -- in China. Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashed al Maktoum with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao . The Chinese government invited Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum on an official visit to the country. The ruler responded by arriving with an entourage of 50 business leaders and throngs of government support -- an obvious symbol of the importance the U.A.E. has put on growing relations with China. ""China is a booming market. We're here exploring opportunities with Chinese government entities as well as Chinese private sector companies,"" said Sultan Al Jabar CEO of sustainable energy company, Masdar. The U.S. and Europe arguably identified the exploding opportunities in China 15 years ago and, in fact, make up the bulk of the investment into the country. Compared with the huge amounts of dollars pouring in from these countries, Middle Eastern nations do relatively little business in China. Trade has mostly centred on oil imports coming out of the Gulf and cheap Chinese goods coming into the region from the other direction. Neverthess, trade between the two countries reached $19 billion last year and the U.A.E is keen to strengthen and diversify ties with the booming Chinese economy by investing in areas like finance, real estate and construction. ""China, India, the U.A.E. are considered fast growing emerging markets. So, what it is, is we have to see what are the niche markets and some growth where we can complement each other rather than compete,"" Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, the U.A.E. Minister of Foreign Trade told CNN. Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem is Chairman of Dubai World, the Dubai government's powerful holding company which supervises a portfolio of businesses -- including the third largest ports operator in the world, DP World. The company is looking at investing in China and considers real estate and finance attractive investments, according to Bin Sulayem. ""We would like to do business in a sector we are familiar with. We're big in real estate. We're big developers. We also look at the financial sector because we have a merger with a mortgage company in Dubai. We are investing in financial institutions,"" he said. Bin Sulayem thinks that in today's climate it is easier to invest in the East than the West: ""We are concentrating in China, concentrating in Africa, because these are places where they're hungry for capital and there is growth potential,"" he said, ""The officials in the East are encouraging while the officials in the West are creating noises unnecessarily. So, naturally, people will look at more investment in the East,"" he continued. To drive home the U.A.E.'s interest in doing business with China, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum met with Chinese president Hu Jintao in Beijing. He also oversaw the signing of a private investment deal between telecommunications firm, Etisalat announcing plans to set up a research center with a Chinese partner, Huawei Technologies. The two companies have been working together for about five years but getting things done in China is still far from easy, according to Etisalat CEO, Ahmad Abdulkarim Julfar: ""At the beginning of our relationship with Huawei, there was a communication issue. But that has been overcome. With others, we have to approach different people to get a decision made. So, in business, time is the most valuable thing and we don't have time to waste,"" he said. Very few of the U.A.E. delegation have any experience working with the Chinese, which is why the government is conducting a seminar especially for Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum's executives on the basics of doing business in China. They hope the lessons which include talking about the country's laws and business culture will help any future business collaborations to go smoothly. The Chinese are working to bridge the cultural gap too. ""We tell Chinese companies to be careful of eating pork and drinking alcohol in the U.A.E., to learn English and Arabic and not to sell fake goods. Chinese firms are still finding their way,"" Qiu Yong Xiang, General Manager of state-owned investment company, China International Intellectech Corp. China and the U.A.E. are certainly building closer ties and striving for more profitable partnerships.

"(CNN) -- Hugo Almeida scored a hat-trick and was then sent off as he helped Werder Bremen to end a miserable run of results on Sunday with a 3-0 victory at home to St. Pauli, who also ended the game with 10 men. Thomas Schaaf's team, knocked out of the Champions League in midweek and already out of the German Cup, won for the first time in eight Bundesliga matches. Bremen had not scored for 450 minutes, but Portugal striker Almeida ended that drought after just 52 seconds. St. Pauli's Gerald Asamoah headed against the bar a minute later, but Almeida extended the lead in the 20th minute as Marko Marin set him up on the counterattack from a corner at the other end. St. Pauli again hit the woodwork in the second half when Tim Wiese tipped Marius Ebbers' shot onto the bar, but Almeida sealed victory in the 64th minute with his ninth league goal this season after a fine pass by Said Hsejinovic. Kagawa on target as Dortmund win . However, he was sent off with 10 minutes to go after lashing out at St. Pauli defender Carlos Zambrano, whose teammate Markus Thorandt saw red in the final minute for a foul on Torsten Frings. The result means promoted St. Pauli have now not won for six matches and have fallen to 14th in the table, two points above the bottom three. Mainz make ground on German leaders . Relegation-threatened Cologne moved up to 16th and out of the bottom two despite conceding a late equalizer in the 1-1 draw at home to Wolfsburg. Slovenia striker Milivoje Novakovic put Cologne ahead six minutes after halftime, scoring from close range when keeper Diego Benaglio could not hold a free-kick by Portuguese midfielder Petit. Wolfsburg, who lost striker Grafite to injury late in the first half, earned a point in the 81st minute through substitute Cicero -- who smashed in a superb overhead kick soon after coming onto the pitch.

"(CNN)  -- In a previous posting about voting issues, I mentioned J. Alex Halderman, an assistant professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, whose ""resume"" includes hacking into voting machines in the name of exposing security flaws. Analysis: Our votes are counted accurately -- aren't they? At the time, his best-known exploit involved accessing a supposedly tamper-proof voting machine and getting it to play Pac-Man. It turns out that as I was writing that, Halderman and his students pulled off another coup, exposing vulnerabilities in an internet-based system for overseas and military voters that the District of Columbia planned to test in the November election. ""Within 36 hours of the system going live, our team had found and exploited a vulnerability that gave us almost total control of the server software, including the ability to change votes and reveal voters' secret ballots,"" Halderman wrote on his blog. This link is Halderman's how-we-did-it. Along the way, Halderman's team ""collected crucial secret data stored on the server,"" ""modified all the ballots that had already been cast to contain write-in votes for candidates we selected,"" ""installed a back door that let us view any ballots that voters cast after our attack,"" and -- best of all -- ""left a 'calling card' on the system's confirmation screen, which voters see after voting."" Official ballot: District of Columbia mock election (pdf) After 15 seconds, the page plays the University of Michigan fight song. Here's a demonstration. The ""Wolverines"" attack on D.C.'s experiment went undetected, Halderman said, until the fight song (""Hail to the Victors"") was discovered. To be fair, the people running the D.C. pilot program made a couple of weeks available for outsiders to have a crack at their system. While Halderman and his students did their best in the name of protecting the sanctity of the voting process, it appears that there were others with potentially less-friendly motives also taking advantage of the test period. Testifying before the D.C. Board of Ethics and Elections -- in a virtually empty room, according to news reports -- Halderman dropped this bomb: ""While we were in control of these systems we observed other attack attempts originating from computers in Iran and China. These attackers were attempting to guess the same master password that we did. And since it was only four letters long, they would likely have soon succeeded."" Halderman's team even changed the D.C. system's password (who uses a four-letter password?) to thwart the foreign intrusions. Granted, this was a test and only a test of a small pilot program. But the idea of attempts from outside of the United States to compromise the security of the most basic of American rights should worry anyone who cares about the political process. Flaws in the D.C. system wasn't the only issue making news: . • The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law spotlights three potential threats: voter registration problems (3 million people were unable to vote in 2008 because of such issues and registration efforts are notably fewer than the last election), ballot ""security"" operations (often allegations of voter suppression or intimidation) and voting machines. Another read on voter suppression concerns. • The controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the ""Black Panther"" voter intimidation case in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Election Day 2008 has not faded; if anything, it's grown as an issue for political conservatives. • The Sentencing Project reports that between 1997 and 2010 an estimated 800,000 people convicted of felonies regained their right to vote, as 23 states have, in varying fashions, changed their laws on the subject. • Concerns remain about U.S. military personnel stationed overseas getting ballots from their home states in time to vote and mail back before Election Day. Several states received waivers from a new requirement that ballots be mailed out by 45 days before the election, to ensure their return on time. • If you're interested in following current court cases involving voting issues, check out this website from the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University.","Professor, students expose vulnerabilities in internet-based voting system .

"(CNN) -- The father of three missing Michigan boys has no ""established relationship"" with a mystery woman that he claimed he left his sons with before unsuccessfully trying to commit suicide, a police chief investigating the boys' disappearance said Monday. John Skelton, the father, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor, in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide. Authorities said Skelton's suicide attempt was not successful, and he is being held at a mental health facility. ""There is no established relationship between he and the person that he described to us as Joann Taylor,"" Chief of Morenci Police, Larry Weeks, told reporters. The police chief asked for the public's help with information regarding Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan, later discovered by police, that was believed to be carrying the boys between 2:30 p.m. Thursday to 1:30 p.m. Friday. Skelton told police that Taylor was supposed to take the boys to the boy's home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, around 3 p.m. Friday. But the boys -- 5-year-old Tanner Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 9-year-old Andrew Skelton -- never arrived and police aren't sure whether John Skelton's story is true. They say they don't know whether Taylor is real. ""We remain hopeful,"" Weeks said Monday. ""That's why we're doing what we're doing, and hope to bring these boys home."" Authorities issued an Amber Alert on Friday. The last nonfamily member saw the boys at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the chief. The alert notes that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds. Kathye Herrera, a family spokeswoman, spoke to reporters Sunday, thanking neighbors who have searched for the boys and prayed for their safe return. ""We've got three great little boys out there, and we're going to get them back,"" she said. Authorities asked the public Sunday for help in locating three young boys missing for several days. ""We need calls. We need tips. Anything that's out there, no matter how incredible you may think it is, call.

"(Budget Travel) -- For years, Budget Travel has been advising readers to rent short-term apartments whenever they plan to spend more than a few days in expensive cities like Paris and New York. Short-term apartment rentals can help travelers save money on both lodging and meals, while providing a more authentic experience. Regardless of recent headlines concerning new rules -- or supposed new efforts to enforce old rules -- for short-term rentals, we still endorse the option as a smart, fun and safe way to stay. While there may be new implications for owners seeking to rent out their properties in these cities, renters themselves face no possibility of fines or problems of any kind with the local authorities. ""There's nothing illegal that the traveler is doing when staying in a vacation rental,"" says Carl Shepherd, chief development officer of direct-from-owner rental specialist HomeAway. ""None of these cities have any penalties for renters."" The announcements of lawmakers and housing officials seem to imply otherwise, hinting that because some home owners may technically be violating unenforced local ordinances by renting out their properties, renters are somehow guilty by association. The truth is that based on years of precedent -- and the fact that restrictions are vaguely worded and that the municipalities involved are uninterested or incapable of enforcing them -- the risks encountered by renters are extremely minimal. So fear not. Arm yourself with our 6 tips for safer, smarter rentals, and read on for specific advice about Paris, San Francisco and New York. Budget Travel: World's weirdest hotels . PARIS . Here's the deal: Late last year, city officials started to enforce a 2005 law that restricts owners from renting their properties for periods of less than one year. Citing a lack of affordable housing in the central city -- always a popular topic among voters, and, yes, this began in a run-up to elections -- Mayor Bertrand Delanoë ordered a local housing agency to warn some of the estimated 38,000 offenders that they were violating the law by renting flats for shorter spans. How many warning letters did the housing authority send out? As of midsummer 2010, about 25. ""For the moment,"" says one property owner who prefers to remain anonymous, ""any enforcement of this law is minimal to the point of being invisible."" If enforcement efforts are ever ramped up substantially, short-term rentals could be harder to come by in Paris. Even though no owners have been hit with the maximum €25,000 (more than $32,000) fine for violating housing regulations, the possibility of such a fine will probably be enough to turn some short-term listings into long-term rentals. Bottom line: In Paris, there has been no noticeable drop-off in owners posting short-term apartment rentals. At last check, homeaway.com listed an all-time high of 1,605 properties in Paris. Budget Travel: The coolest small towns in America . SAN FRANCISCO . Here's the deal: San Francisco's obscure, long-ignored law prohibiting rentals of less than 30 days is nearly 30 years old, but few people thought about it until news arose about crackdowns on tourist rentals in other cities. Rather than inquire as to the legality of such rentals, the city has traditionally preferred to subject owners to the local 14 percent hotel tax, bringing in millions annually that would not have been raised had the properties been occupied year-round by owners or long-term renters . For the sake of the city budget, there's an obvious incentive to keep ignoring the ordinance. NEW YORK CITY . Here's the deal: Of the trio of cities, New York is the only one to actually pass new rental legislation. As in Paris and San Francisco, the primary target is not the small-time owner who rents out a place from time to time. Instead, the focus is on ""illegal hotel"" operations: large-scale attempts to convert residential apartments intended for permanent occupants into travel accommodations. So how will the law be enforced, and exactly what rental scenarios will be deemed illegal when the rules become effective as of May 1, 2011? No one's entirely sure. Budget Travel: Confessions of... A Disney cast member . State Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, the cosponsor of the bill, was quoted as saying, ""Somebody who is going away on vacation and once in a blue moon rents the apartment is probably not going to be affected by this."" Probably. That's right: Even the bill's cosponsor can't say exactly how the law will play out. Nominally, the purpose behind the legislation is to provide more affordable housing for city residents and to protect travelers from sketchy quasi hotels. But the law might not have become a reality had it not been for the lobbying of hotel and motel associations -- which obviously compete with vacation rentals, and which would obviously benefit if travelers turned away from short-term rentals en masse. Among all the confusion and uncertainty, one thing is clear: Travelers want their vacation rentals. In the second quarter of this year, HomeAway recorded a 104 percent increase in inquiries for New York City apartments compared with the same period in 2009.

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Security forces in Saudi Arabia have arrested 149 people alleged to be members of al Qaeda, the Saudi Interior Ministry said Friday. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, Interior Ministry spokesman, said the people were plotting to kill government officials, security forces, and media employees. ""Their general motives are spreading an ideology of hate by calling others disbelievers, collecting money to finance the deviant al Qaeda group inside and outside the kingdom, easing travel for some individuals for training in destabilized places and executing criminal plots to spread chaos and insecurity."" al-Turki said. The arrests occurred over an eight-month period, and the people seized were dispersed among 19 active terrorist cells throughout the kingdom. Security forces found 2.24 million riyals (or about $600,000) among the cells. Saudi state-run TV reports said of the 149 people, 124 were Saudi nationals. There were also Yemenis and Egyptians. The cells have external links, al-Turki said, a reference to al Qaeda in Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan. The people were involved in collecting money and financing terrorism, targeting oil refineries and government buildings, weapons training, and making hand grenades. Al-Turki said the suspects were trying to using the hajj, or Muslim pilgrimage, season to create unrest and pursue recruiting. The suspects pursued internet recruiting, and used nicknames in their recruiting efforts. Some of the names included God's beloved, the killer, the immigrant lion, the newcomer, and the daughter of beloved Najid. Among those arrested was a woman, who was sent back to her family after she was seized. CNN's Rima Maktabi contributed to this report .","The arrests occurred over an eight-month period .

"Washington (CNN) -- Food safety regulators don't expect any more recalls after last week's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market, but inspections are still going on following a salmonella outbreak traced to two Iowa farms, federal officials said Monday. Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the Food and Drug Administration, said it was ""a little premature"" to discuss the findings of those inspections. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Sunday night that farms involved in the recall fell short of safety standards. Farrar would not release details of the inspections, which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers, but the results could be released later this week, he said. About 1,300 cases of salmonella have been linked to eggs from Wright County Eggs and Hillandale Farms of Iowa, forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control reported. Wright County Egg has recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs. ""We have a very complicated network of food distribution in this country,"" Hamburg told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. ""You start with a couple of farms in Iowa and you can get nationwide exposure."" Speaking on a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, Hamburg said federal regulations that took effect in July could have prevented the recall. The new regulation went into effect July 9, requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. The current outbreak began in May, according to the FDA. ""We believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time, it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred,"" Hamburg said. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Farrar said under the new rule, ""We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States."" The FDA said some companies that bought and resold eggs from Wright County or Hillandale could issue sub-recalls, meaning they would ask their customers to return the products. But that won't add to the more than half a billion eggs already recalled. The Danielson family of Watertown, Minnesota, was among those afflicted by the outbreak. ""Everybody had diarrhea. That was kind of the first thing,"" Todd Danielson told CNN affiliate KARE, ""and then headaches and then throwing up and then it was body aches. I couldn't even move. I mean it was like in your joints it hurt so bad. It was worse than any flu I've ever had."" Brittany Danielson, 10, added, ""We thought we had the flu, but then we saw the egg recall and we figured that's what it was because my dad read off the symptoms from the computer and those were all the symptoms we had."" The Danielsons and their neighbors both told KARE they bought Hillandale Farms eggs at Wal-Mart. Hillandale Farms, one of the largest U.S. producers, said in a statement Sunday it is devastated by the possible connection between its product and salmonella. The company said it would work with the FDA to review ""every phase of our operation"" and fix any problems. Both Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms were supplied by another company, Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Jack DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. Dr. Donald E. Hoenig, the Maine state veterinarian, said the allegations included keeping too many birds in cases, failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals, and improper euthanization. Hoenig said DeCoster and his company agreed to a $25,000 fine and made a $100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility. In 1996, the Labor Department accused DeCoster of maintaining ""sweatshop conditions"" for migrant workers at its Turner, Maine, chicken farm, where then-Labor Secretary Robert Reich said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $3.6 million. In January 2002, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hit another DeCoster company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees, some of whom were in the country illegally, and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained. The managers were fired for ""unrelated reasons,"" the EEOC said, and DeCoster agreed to pay a settlement of more than $1.5 million. In 2000, Iowa's attorney general declared DeCoster a ""habitual violator"" of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog-farming operations. He paid a $150,000 penalty and had to build six concrete storage structures, and his company was barred from expanding those operations. In a statement issued Monday morning, Wright County Egg said it was working with the FDA on the current recalls and defended its record. ""Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms. We have reviewed Commissioner Hamburg's comments to the media, but because we have not received any written reports from FDA to date, it would be inappropriate to respond to her remarks. It is important to note that any concerns raised verbally during FDA's on-farm visit were immediately addressed or are in the process of being addressed,"" the statement said. ""When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and implement corrective measures for our operations,"" it said. ""We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner."" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center, a trade association entity. ""This is one of the larger recalls that have happened,"" Eberle said. But she added, ""This is an extremely rare occurrence.""

"(CNN) -- Democrat Alex Sink will debate Republican Rick Scott on Monday, setting up a nationally televised showdown between the two Florida governor hopefuls on CNN. The debate, co-sponsored by CNN, the St. Petersburg Times and the University of South Florida will be moderated by CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. It will air live at 7 p.m. ET during a special edition of ""John King, USA."" The Florida governor's race is considered to be one of the most hotly contested contests of the midterm election cycle. It pits Sink, the state's chief financial officer, against Scott, a billionaire health executive who shocked the GOP establishment to win his party's nomination. During their last debate on Wednesday, the two did not shy away from personal attacks or sharp-tongued remarks. Scott attempted to capitalize on the election season's anti-incumbent fever when he referred to Sink as a ""Tallahassee insider."" Sink returned fire when she referred to Scott as a ""corporate raider,"" and questioned his business dealings. But the gloves really came off when the candidates got down to business, answering - and in some cases, not answering - specific questions about their positions on policy and how they would govern if elected. Scott threw a major jab when he attacked Sink's plans to deal with the state's budget problems. ""We're walking into a two-plus billion-dollar deficit,"" Scott said. ""We know we have to save money. Obama math doesn't work here."" Sink shot back, ""I don't know what Obama math is. What I do know is I was a 4.0 math major at Wake Forest University and I know how to add numbers."" Sink called Scott's charge that she planned to raise taxes a ""fairytale fabrication"" and accused the Republican candidate of running a smear campaign. ""Rick, we can't trust anything you say,"" Sink said. ""You have been throwing mud and negative advertisements since the Republican primary and your charges have been outlandish."" Continuing a theme he has used throughout the campaign, Scott tied Sink's views on policy to those of President Barack Obama. ""If you believe Obama's plan is the right plan for the country, vote for my opponent,"" Scott said. ""Obamacare is a disaster, his stimulus is a disaster, and on top of that, she believes his economic policies are the right solution. They're not."" But Scott had to defend his own positions when the panel asking questions raised the issue of Scott's stewardship of the hospital chain Columbia/HCA. During Scott's tenure, the company was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. Scott characterized the experience as a teachable moment: ""In business, if something goes wrong, you focus on it, you get better at it, and that's what I've done,"" Scott said. On social issues, Scott did not give a direct answer when asked if he believed homosexuality was immoral; instead, he pledged his opposition to gay marriage and gay adoption. Sink was quick to point out Scott's evasion and state her position on gay adoption, saying that judges and social workers should decide what is in the best interest of the child. In the most recent CNN/Time/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Scott and Sink were locked in a near tie among likely voters.

"(CNN) -- A prosthetic leg thought to be that of missing 10-year-old Zahra Baker has been found in a brushy area off a North Carolina road, Chief Tom Adkins of the Hickory, North Carolina, police said Wednesday. Police launched a search for Zahra on October 9, but no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. The girl's disappearance is now being probed as a homicide. Adkins said that the prosthetic leg is ""consistent with"" that of Zahra, a freckle-faced youngster who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and developed lung cancer a few years later, according to CNN affiliate WCNC. The prosthetic was found late Tuesday afternoon off Christie Road in Caldwell County, he said, and authorities are using its serial number to confirm it belonged to the young girl. Zahra got the leg in Australia, where both her birth parents are from. Meanwhile, authorities focused anew Wednesday on the Hickory home that Zahra Baker lived in with her father, Adam Troy Baker, and her stepmother, Elisa Baker. Police officers and FBI agents were inside the residence late into the evening, finishing up their search focusing in the back of the home. A backhoe and other construction machinery began digging into grounds around the family's home early in the morning, with investigators using rakes to comb through the dug-up dirt and with police dogs canvassing the area. Additionally, police removed at least one bag of evidence from the house Wednesday morning. ""New information"" led to the renewed search inside and outside the home, said Adkins. ""We're looking for any piece of evidence that can help in that investigation,"" he added. A day earlier, employees at Foothills Environmental Landfill in Lenoir, North Carolina, found a mattress that investigators believe belonged to Zahra and was thrown out by her parents in early October -- just days before she was reported missing. The disappearance of Zahra, who had persevered through numerous health battles and wore hearing aids, has made international news. Police said the missing girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, admitted last week that she planted a fake ransom note the day after the girl's disappearance was reported. Initially arrested on October 10 on several charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks, Elisa Baker was additionally charged with obstruction of justice for leaving the note. That charge is a felony. She is now cooperating with investigators, Hickory police said in a statement issued Tuesday. The previous day, she had joined police as they searched for evidence at a site near a home she lived in three years ago. Zahra's father was arrested just after 3 a.m. Monday in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges, which are unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. Adam Baker was at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport picking up a family member Sunday before he voluntarily went to the Police Department in Hickory, about 60 miles northwest of Charlotte, to talk to authorities. Family members and neighbors have told reporters that Zahra's stepmother abused her. Her attorney has denied the allegation. Police have said they had been in contact with Zahra's biological mother in Australia and asked for the girl's medical records. HLN's Rupa Mikkileni contributed to this report.","NEW: FBI and police searched late into the night inside Zahra Baker's home .

"(CNN)  -- Blackburn is set to become the first English Premier League side to come under Indian ownership, the club confirmed Tuesday. Blackburn chairman John Williams told the club's website that a deal with poultry giants Venkys would likely be completed in November. He said that after ""detailed talks"" with the Premier League and an ""extensive due diligence process"" that the way was clear for the groundbreaking deal. Venkys chairperson Anuradha J. Desai added: ""We expect to be the first Indian company to acquire a Premier League team and we are particularly delighted that the team is Blackburn Rovers, with whom we believe we have many shared values and ambitions."" The terms of the sale are yet to be disclosed, but Venkys joint managing director B Venkatesh Rao told CNBC the deal was worth £46 million ($72.97 million),  with the full amount to be paid upfront. Venky's is part of the £290 million ($459m) valued Venkateshwara Hatcheries (VH) group, which is listed on the Mumbai stock exchange. The acquisition by the Indian conglomerate would take the number of English Premier League clubs with solely foreign ownership to nine, and comes in the wake of Liverpool's highly-publicized sale to New England Sports Ventures, who own the Boston Red Sox baseball team. Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester City, Manchester United and Sunderland are also under exclusively foreign control while Arsenal, Blackpool and West Ham have influential foreign shareholders. Blackburn's mooted sale would end a two-year wait for a buyer at Ewood Park, after the Jack Walker Trust put the club up for sale hoping to attract fresh investment. In that time two other Indian buyers, Saurin Shah and Ahsan Ali Syed, have seen prospective bids falter. With Blackburn currently languishing just above the Premier League relegation zone, manager Sam Allardyce needs a cash injection to strengthen his squad. Venkys certainly has the financial capacity to oblige. The group posted a profit of $187 million last year and has an annual turnover of $1.58B. Formed in 1976, the conglomerate has diversified in recent years to include nutritional supplements and healthcare products for humans alongside their mainstream poultry products. Blackburn won the English Premier League title in 1995 as former owner Jack Walker ploughed millions into the club, but have not enjoyed comparable success in the intervening years.","Indian poultry giant Venkys set to take over English Premier League Blackburn .

"(CNN) -- A search is on for a missing Nepali sherpa who has summited Mount Everest 19 times. The mountain guide went missing after an avalanche on Saturday, said the mountaineering agency for which he works. An avalanche swept away Chuwang Nima Sherpa on 7,129-meter-high (23,389-foot-high) Mount Baruntse on Saturday afternoon, while he was fixing ropes for climbers at 7,045 meters (23,113 feet), said Jiban Ghimire of Sherpa Shangri-La Treks and Expeditions. ""Chuwang Nima was fixing ropes for another expedition in the mountain, because they asked for help, when the avalanche struck,"" Ghimire said. Chuwang Nima was climbing with mountain guide Melissa Arnot, from the U.S. state of Idaho. The two had planned an alpine-style climb, without any support staff and fixed ropes or stops till the summit, Ghimire said. A helicopter was dispatched to look for Chuwang Nima on Sunday morning, but had to return because of bad weather. Chuwang Nima, 39, is well known in mountaineering circles, and climbs and trains in the United States as well. He was in Denali National Park in Alaska for technical training and rescue operations during the summer, according to Ghimire. Apa Sherpa -- a 50-year-old Nepali -- holds the record for summiting Everest, with 20 climbs. Everest is the world's highest mountain above sea level, at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet).","The guide went missing after an avalanche on Saturday .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An unemployed security guard from Ecuador is Spain's top snoozer. Pedro Soria Lopez, 62, was able to nap for 17 minutes and register a 70-decibel snore while sprawled out on a couch in the middle of a crowded shopping mall in what's been billed as the first-ever Spanish National Siesta Championship, CNN sister network CNN Plus reported. The grand siesta champ won the first cash prize of 1,000 euros (about $1,400) in credit to purchase goods at the shopping center in Madrid. The competitors started off by lying down on blue sofas, some in pajamas. Each got to eat a lunch ahead of time, then had twenty minutes to get as much z's as they could squeeze in. Hundreds of contestants took part in the siesta championship which began October 14 and ended Saturday. The intricate rules award points to contestants depending on how long they sleep during the 20-minute competition time, any unusual positions they sleep in, eye-catching pajamas they might be wearing, and yes, a lot of extra points for snoring. The sponsors say it's meant to raise eyes to the problem of a country that's become so fast-paced that many say the traditional siesta is at risk. ""The modern life is a danger that we feel is against the siesta. When you sleep la siesta everyone has the image that your life is calm, you have a good life. And then, the modern life is a direct attack,"" said Daniel Blanco, president of the National Association of Friends of the Siesta earlier in the competition. His group, which includes about 50 of his friends across Spain, persuaded a shopping center, Islazul, to host and pay prize money for the siesta competition. In the competition, the siesta is limited to 20 minutes, a duration which the organizers and some doctors say is optimal; a quick nap after lunch to get refreshed, without entering a deep sleep cycle. But the traditional siesta in Spain often lasts an hour or more. The bustling shopping center where the siesta championship is being held is a prime example of the changing times in Spain. The stores don't close at lunchtime -- which is what used to happen with Spanish shops -- so instead of sleeping the siesta, people are working or shopping. Siesta lovers complain that Spain's frenetic push to compete in the global economy means longer, more pressure-package workdays, even if some Spanish workers still get a two-hour lunch break. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Spain's first national siesta championship wraps up in Madrid .

"(CNN) -- An alleged gang member who police say was behind 80 percent of the killings in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, over the past 16 months was arrested over the weekend, officials said. Police believe that Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, known as ""El Farmero,"" was the leader of the Aztecas gang, a group closely linked with the Juarez cartel and its enforcement arm, La Linea. Gallegos confessed to authorities that he ordered the killings of three people linked to the U.S. consulate in Juarez in March, as well as the attack on a party of young people that killed 14, federal police said. The 32-year-old was arrested Saturday. Gallegos ""is allegedly responsible for homicides, extortions and distribution of drugs in all the sectors of Ciudad Juarez,"" the federal police said in a statement. He was captured as part of an operation to dismantle the Aztecas gang, police said. Surveillance and tips from the public led authorities to a house occupied by armed men, where Gallegos was arrested. According to authorities, the gang leader also admitted to the killings of five federal police officers. Two others were captured along with Gallegos. Carlos Rodriguez Ramirez, 41, is accused of smuggling drugs between Juarez and El Paso, Texas. Gisela Ornelas Nunez, 32, was identified as being in charge of transporting drugs and weapons to Juarez, police said. Police seized two assault rifles and two handguns, along with 228 cartridges for different weapons. They also found 90 grams of what police believe is marijuana. Two cars and two trucks, including one that was armored, were also taken. In 1996, Gallegos was arrested in the United States for drug trafficking, Mexican authorities said. There have been more than 2,500 drug-related killings in Juarez this year alone, signifying that if Gallegos' claim is accurate, he would be responsible for more than 2,000 murders. Those numbers would be comparable to those of some of the most ruthless war criminals. But Tony Payan, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at El Paso, said that such staggering statistics must be examined with skepticism. The number does not specify whether he was directly responsible for those deaths or marginally linked through his role in the gang. Still, ""no doubt this is a big bust,"" Payan said, describing Gallegos as one of the heads of the Azteca gang. The Azteca gang is dedicated to doing the bidding of the Juarez cartel and is in a battle with a rival gang, the Artistas Asesinos, who work for the Sinaloa cartel. As a whole, the Azteca gang is certainly responsible for thousands of deaths over the past four years, Payan said. Gallegos was key because he worked closely with the Juarez cartel leadership and directed side enterprises, such as robbery, extortion and kidnappings. ""He's probably the brains behind the strategy of a self-financing gang,"" Payan said. The arrest is a victory for President Felipe Calderon's offensive against the drug cartels, and taken together with other recent killings or arrests of high-level leaders, shows the police strategy, Payan said: to go after the big fish in the drug trafficking organizations. ""To cut the legs off at the street level, we have to cut the head,"" he said of the plan. Among the killings Gallegos admitted to are the high-profile shooting deaths of three people linked to the U.S. consulate in the city. The shootings occurred March 13 when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their SUV. Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle. Because Gallegos' arrest might be linked to the ongoing investigation into the killings of the Americans, an FBI spokesman declined to comment on the development.","Arturo Gallegos was arrested Saturday .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities have apprehended the alleged leader of a global human trafficking ring that smuggled Chinese migrants to New York City through Mexico. Mexican federal police arrested Huang Chen Yaowei, 31, and rescued eight undocumented Chinese migrants, Mexico's Secretary of Public Safety said in a statement Friday. U.S. immigration authorities arrested another suspect, Zhendi Li, in New York, the statement said. Huang is the suspected leader of an international criminal organization that charged Chinese migrants $80,000 for passage to the United States through Mexico. He was allegedly involved in trafficking Chinese citizens since May 2004, Mexican authorities said. The Chinese migrants were kept in hotels in Mexico City before crossing into the United States, authorities said. The smuggling organization allegedly used counterfeit passports and visas to make the migrants think that there stay in Mexico was legal. According to the statement, Huang sent the migrants to Zhendi, ""who allegedly was responsible for receiving them in New York, later providing them housing, moving them and charging the families of the undocumented large sums of money."" Mexican authorities said they worked with U.S. immigration officials to coordinate the investigation and the simultaneous capture of Zhendi. During Huang's capture, Mexican federal police also confiscated an SUV, eight Chinese passports, four cell phones and more than $70,000 in Mexican pesos, U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and euros. In January 2009, roughly 1 percent of approximately 10.8 million unauthorized migrants in the United States -- about 120,000 people -- were from China, according to the non-profit Migration Policy Institute. Between 2005 and 2008, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 6,000 Chinese nationals, according to figures from the Department of Homeland Security.","Another suspect has also been arrested in New York .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan must remain in a drug rehabilitation program until January 3 instead of going to jail for violating her probation with a failed drug test, a judge ruled Friday. If Lohan violates the rules of her rehab program or fails a drug test before her next court date on February 25, she will be sent to jail for 180 days, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox told her. Staying clean and sober until then would end Lohan's supervised probation, and she can ""put this long episode behind you,"" Fox said. ""Do you understand?"" the judge asked her. ""Yes, sir,"" a sobbing Lohan said. Fox had ordered the actress to prison for a month in September, but she was freed 14 hours after reporting to the facility when another judge granted her a $300,000 bail. Three days later, Lohan checked into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. ""I wish that she could get it together, but I'm not quite sure we've gotten her attention yet,"" prosecutor Danette Meyers said Friday as she asked the judge to send the actress to jail for 180 days. Meyers argued that Lohan has a pattern of checking into rehab ""every time she has a violation and jail is leering over her head."" Defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley told the judge that Lohan ""is trying her best"" but ""relapse is a part of recovery."" ""She remains committed to the treatment program,"" Holley said. Her probation officer recommended that Lohan be allowed to remain in rehab, Holley said. While Lohan did not speak beyond short ""yes"" and ""no"" answers in court, she did send a handwritten letter to the judge. The contents were not immediately disclosed. Fox, who took over Lohan's three-year-long case in August, said he thought Lohan's ""epiphany may have been encouraged by the fact that (she) went to jail."" ""I'm not going to be manipulated,"" the judge said as he began to lecture the 24-year-old actress. ""You are an addict,"" Fox said. ""I hope you understand this. You have to change your lifestyle."" Otherwise, Lohan will destroy her reputation and be ""unemployable and uninsurable,"" he warned. Lohan acknowledged in a series of Twitter messages last month that she failed the test and has a drug problem. ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night,"" Lohan wrote. ""I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" The Beverly Hills Courthouse has been the scene of several Lohan appearances over the past year related to violations of her probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction. In July, Judge Marsha Revel ordered the actress to serve 90 days in jail and 90 days in rehab for violating her probation. The sheriff released her from jail after just 13 days because of overcrowding and her rehab stint at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center ended after 23 days. ""She has learned her lesson,"" Holley told Fox as he agreed to let her out of rehab early on August 25. Fox allowed Lohan to live in her West Hollywood, California, home as long as she followed a new set of rules, including regular drug testing. If she was successful for just 67 days, her supervised probation would end, he said. ""She's very serious about her sobriety,"" Holley said then. ""She looks forward to proving to the court that she is taking this seriously."" But she failed a drug test less than a month later, triggering Friday's probation violation hearing. Lohan's legal troubles began when she was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills, California. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu, California, drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica, California, police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at 10 on the soap opera ""Another World,"" took off on the big screen a year later when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap."" CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Judge: If Lindsay Lohan breaks a rule before February 25, she will go to jail for 180 days .

"(CNN) -- The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that sparked protests worldwide four years ago will be republished in a new book soon. Staffers at Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten said the cartoons will be in a book created by cultural editor Flemming Rose and will be titled ""The Tyranny of Silence."" Rose could not be reached for comment. The book is scheduled to hit stores on September 30, staffers said. The cartoons were published in September 2006 and sparked worldwide protests after the reprinting of the caricatures in other publications. Islam forbids depictions of Mohammed. Many Muslims were also furious at the drawings themselves. One of them showed the religious figure wearing a turban shaped like a bomb with a lit fuse. In January of 2007, a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Some European papers later published some of the cartoons as a way of covering the controversy, some papers said.

"(CNN) -- Andre and Korisha Shipley were still mourning the death of their 17-year-old son, Jesse, when two months after his funeral, they received shocking news from students of the same Staten Island, New York, high school Jesse had attended. Members of a forensic science club on a field trip to the morgue couldn't believe what they noticed on a cabinet in the medical examiner's lab. ""They saw this jar with a brain in it labeled Jesse Shipley,"" recalls Korisha Shipley, whose daughter Shannon came home in tears that day delivering the news. ""They knew Jesse and he knew them. They were looking at his brain, and his brain was looking right back at them,"" the father adds. Jesse Shipley died in a car accident in January 2005, and the family members say that even though they agreed to an autopsy, they thought they were burying their son with all of his organs. To them, the cause of death was obvious - blunt trauma resulting from a car accident - so there was no reason for authorities to have kept the brain for further review. The couple are now suing the city for the emotional distress caused by the handling of their son's remains. ""As far as we understand, during an autopsy you cut open the body, you look for the cause of death, you check out the organs and you put them back in. In this case, it was a little more than that,"" Andre Shipley says. In a statement to CNN, the attorney representing the city wrote that although officials sympathize with the family, ""it was within the Medical Examiner's discretion to perform an autopsy, and in appropriate cases, to remove and retain bodily organs for further testing."" Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist and a spokesperson for the National Association of Medical Examiners, says determining cause of death is not as simple as people think. He says it is common practice for medical examiners in the U.S. to save the brain and certain other organs when they think it's important. ""To say someone died of a motor vehicle accident, doesn't really tell us anything,"" Weedn explains. ""For example, if a passenger in the backseat was epileptic, their fit could have distracted the driver and led to the death. So, from the outside it may not be so obvious why the person actually died."" Weedn says the brain is preserved for at least two weeks in a formula that firms the matter enough for the coroner to examine it, a process necessary to rule out suspicion and to maintain evidence for cases when the death is determined to be the result of criminal activity. He says the deceased is often buried within that time period. ""We have a certain authority to investigate death for public health and public safety reasons. That is a right pitted against the individual right, and sometimes that does upset families,"" he explains. Others, such as University of Pennsylvania medical ethicist Art Caplan, disagree. He says most people recognize the duty of medical examiners to rule out crime, but that does not justify keeping organs. ""The state says we're going to take this body and examine it to see what might have happened, but we promise you, we'll give everything back,"" Caplan says. ""When you don't do that, you're breaking a basic covenant with society and with families."" The College of American Pathologists provides a sample autopsy consent form on its website. According to the form, the consenter authorizes ""the removal, examination, and retention of organs....as the pathologists deem proper for diagnostic, education, quality improvement and research purposes."" However, the form also states that ""organs and tissues not needed for diagnostic, education, quality improvement, or research purposes will be sent to the funeral home or disposed of appropriately."" According to Caplan, the laws are clear about what a medical examiner should do, but there is little oversight in the industry. He says in situations where an autopsy has been performed and a bereaved family is concerned whether all the remains have been returned, it is usually up to the family to ask. Court documents from the Shipley case indicate that medical examiners have extensive, but not unlimited, discretionary authority. The trial court ""found that questions of fact existed with regard to whether Jesse's brain had been lawfully retained for scientific purposes, and whether the defendants unlawfully interfered ... by failing to advise [the family] at the time the body was released for burial that the brain had been removed and retained."" But, Weedn says approaching the family with this information is an area where even some medical examiners disagree. ""Some forensic pathologists would say going to the family and asking, 'Can I keep this?' would further upset them at a time of grieving,"" he explains. ""But, there are others who say we really should be asking the family every time."" Still, Weedn says, in some circumstances it is not beneficial to ask family, because the person of you ask permission could potentially be connected to the cause of death. ""It's all about trust,"" says Rebecca Skloot, author of the book, ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,"" which explores the history of tissue research in the United States. In her opinion, cases such as the Shipleys' contribute to a growing mistrust in the medical system. ""People worry things are being done to them without their knowledge, and so they don't trust doctors,"" Skloot explains. ""It doesn't matter if you take it out and put on your shelf or send it off to do research, it's still taking something without people's knowledge."" Perhaps what's most extraordinary in the Jesse Shipley case is that the family did find out through the serendipitous field trip students from Jesse's high school took the morgue. Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, a forensic pathologist and attorney who reviews cases like these but is not involved in the Shipley case, says the medical examiner was right to take out the brain for investigation but was wrong to openly display Shipley's name on it. ""You're talking about a matter of sensitivity and common sense,"" Wecht says. ""Certainly if you're going to have student visitors, then you should not have names and numbers available to see."" The Shipleys' attorney, Marvin Ben Aron, says not only the brain, but parts of the liver and testes were later returned and buried in a small casket with their son's body. He says handling the remains was the most traumatizing aspect for the family. ""For them, whenever they remember their child, part of their memory is holding a jar of organs in their hands that they never should have known existed,"" he explains. He is hoping for a settlement during their October 27 court date. ""I feel bad for those people who found out in the past and even worse for those who never will,"" Andre Shipley says. ""We buried our son, and then two months after we had chunks of him coming back to us. This is not the way it's supposed to be."" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.","Andre and Korisha Shipley found out that their son's brain was not buried along with him .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The confirmation of five cholera cases in Haiti's capital is a ""very worrying development,"" a U.N. spokeswoman told CNN. Public health officials are working to keep the country's cholera outbreak from spreading in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where tens of thousands of people are still living in sprawling tent cities after January's devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake. The fast-moving outbreak has claimed at least 253 lives on the impoverished island nation, and another 3,015 cases have been reported, according to Haiti's health ministry. Port-au-Prince could still be safe. The five patients were infected north of the capital, and those confirmed cases do not mean cholera has spread to Port-au-Prince, Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti, told CNN. ""Our response system worked, but obviously this is a very worrying development,"" she said. The five patients in Port-au-Prince were infected in Artibonite, north of the capital, Wall said. They traveled to the nation's main city, where health officials discovered them to be infected within the incubation period, she said. The five have been isolated and are receiving treatment, she said. But meanwhile, officials are stepping up sanitation efforts and setting up quarantine areas in Port-au-Prince. And authorities are bracing themselves for a possible larger outbreak nationwide. ""I think the only responsible thing we can do at the moment is prepare and plan for the worst case scenario,"" Wall said. Wall said aid organizations are working on constructing facilities to treat patients and sending more doctors to the affected areas. ""We're all right for supplies ... but we're short on medical personnel,"" she said. The cholera outbreak comes after recent heavy rains caused the banks of the Artibonite River to overflow and flood the area. The river was dammed in 1956 to create Lac de Peligre and  is Haiti's dominant drainage system. On Friday, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Agency for International Development discussed the outbreak and efforts to work out a containment strategy. The CDC will send an 11-member team to Haiti over the next few days to find out which antibiotics will be most effective in treating the cholera outbreak. USAID will provide supplies needed to set up treatment centers. The group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas. Cholera is caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine and, in severe cases, is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, according to the CDC. In such cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock. ""Without treatment, death can occur within hours,"" the agency says. A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria. During epidemics, the source of the contamination is often the feces of an infected person, and infections can spread rapidly in areas where there is poor sewage treatment and a lack of clean drinking water. All the reported cases in the Lower Artibonite involve severe diarrhea and vomiting, Wall said. Ian Rawson, director of Hospital Albert Schweitzer Haiti near Verrettes, said patients began showing cholera-like symptoms on October 16. The pace picked up significantly Tuesday and beyond, though he said the situation was under control Friday at his 80-bed facility about 16 miles east of Saint Marc. ""So far, we've been able to manage it,"" Rawson said, noting that new patients were now coming in via pick-up trucks about every 10 minutes. Temperatures in the mid-90s exacerbated the dual concerns about dehydration and people contracting cholera by drinking tainted water. People lined roadsides in and around villages with  buckets, hoping that passersby might have clean water, said Eric Lotz, Haiti's  national director for the nonprofit Operation Blessing. The U.N. mission in Haiti credited access to clean water and free medical facilities for preventing feared outbreaks of cholera and tuberculosis.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A disputed holy site in India will be divided in an attempt to satisfy competing religious claims to the site, the Allahabad High Court ruled Thursday. Muslims, Hindus and a local sect all will get part of the land at Ayodhya, the court said. Muslims have already said they will appeal to the Supreme Court. Thousands of people have died in sectarian violence in India since Hindu extremists razed a Muslim mosque on the site in 1992. Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities. They will be allowed to keep an idol in a makeshift temple under the central dome at the site, Judge S. U. Khan announced in his ruling. Khan is one of three judges on the high court. ""All three sets of parties, i.e., Muslims, Hindus and Nirmohi Akhara are declared joint title holders of the property,"" Khan wrote. He gave them three months to come up with proposals for which sections of the property they want, while awarding some specific areas to Nirmohi Akhara, a local Hindu sect. India beefed up security across the country as it braced for the verdict, deploying hundreds of thousands of troops in anticipation of possible violence. The destruction of Ayodhya's Babri mosque in 1992 sparked religious riots across India, in which more than 2,000 people died. It was some of the worst violence the country has seen since independence in 1947. But India appeared to remain calm on Thursday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged citizens not to let extremists stir up violence. ""Often it is only a few mischief makers who create divisions in our society. I would appeal to my countrymen to be vigilant and not let such people succeed in disrupting peace and harmony,"" he said in a statement after the ruling was announced. ""It is my hope that the response of the people of India to the judgement will be respectful, dignified and do our country proud,"" he said, adding that it was ""correct"" to maintain the status quo until the Supreme Court hears the case. The Allahabad court was asked to rule on a number of issues in addition to the dispute over the ownership of the land, which has been going on for decades. But it is not clear from their rulings if the judges were able to agree on points including whether the Hindu deity Lord Rama was actually born there and when the Babri Mosque was built. Like India itself, they appear to have split on religious lines. India is a majority Hindu country, but has more than 160 million Muslims. In fact, only two other countries, Indonesia and Pakistan, have more Muslims than India, although India is only about 13 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. India's government was determined to prevent sectarian violence over the Ayodhya ruling. Paramilitary forces were deployed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Home Ministry spokesman Onkar Kedia said Thursday. In the rest of the country, paramilitary forces and air force aircraft are being kept on reserve. About 190,000 forces are in place in Uttar Pradesh, Kedia said, without disclosing the total number of troops that have been deployed across India as a ""precautionary measure."" India's Home Ministry also has temporarily banned bulk text messages and has urged the media to exercise restraint and to not sensationalize any possible violence. The town of Ayodhya has been a religious flashpoint for more than 400 years. Hindus believe that Lord Rama, one of the religion's most revered deities, was born there. The Babri Mosque was built on the site after the region became part of the Mughal Empire in the 1500s. Two years after independence, in 1949, the gates to the site were locked after Muslims claimed Hindus had placed deities of Rama in their area. Hindu groups have pushed to build a temple in Ayodhya, to replace the mosque torn down by Hindu extremists. This month, Hindus and Muslims were urged to pray for peace after a judgment date was announced, and some Ayodhya residents fled to avoid potential violence. CNN's Sumnima Udas and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","NEW: India remains calm after ruling on site at center of 1992 violence .

Hungary needs time to calculate the cost of the disaster, saying that the government's first response had been to try to save lives and clean homes. Tibor Dobson, a top disaster management official, told CNN that the sludge -- which flowed from an aluminum plant reservoir that burst on Monday -- is less dangerous than it was when it spilled. Officials believe pH levels have dropped to within an acceptable range, making the river safe, Dobson said. They are monitoring the Danube for sign of toxicity, such as dying fish. Nagy said pH levels had fallen to 9.1. That's more alkaline than neutral, which is 7 on the scale, but much less than it was originally, at 13, the Catastrophic Protection Unit said Thursday. Emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers in hopes it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity. The exact chemical composition of the sludge has not been revealed, but aluminum processing normally involves compounds that include cyanide, cadmium and chromium. The environmental disaster -- which occurred nearly 100 miles west of Budapest near the town of Ajka -- has killed two children, ages 1 and 3, an elderly woman and a 35-year-old man whose SUV overturned in the sludge. About 250 people have been evacuated from their homes, said Gyorgi Tottos, a spokeswoman for Hungary's Catastrophe Protection Unit. The reservoir has since been repaired and the flow from the pool halted. But the material that flowed out of the reservoir continues to pose a threat. The plant received an operating permit in 2006, he said. The European Commission is studying a copy of the permit and sees nothing wrong with the paperwork so far, he added. The aluminum factory has said it will pay for the victims' funerals. It has property and liability insurance, insurer Allianz Hungaria Biztosito told CNN, but would not say how much. Residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst. It was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely would be able to return home. The long-term consequences of the leak were also unclear. In some villages, police with guns patrolled some of the villages to keep looters at bay. A state of emergency has been declared in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Tommy Evans, Jim Boulden and Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","Hungary asks European Union for assistance in cleanup .

"(CNN) -- The top-two Bundesliga teams suffered embarrassing defeats by lower-league opposition in the German Cup on Wednesday night. Mainz crashed to just a second loss so far this season, losing 2-1 at second-division Alemannia Aachen ahead of this weekend's showdown with title rivals Borussia Dortmund. Aachen led 2-0 through Benjamin Auer and Marco Hoger before Hungary striker Adam Szalai reduced the deficit with 22 minutes to play. Second-placed Dortmund also exited at the second-round stage, losing 4-2 on penalties against Kickers Offenbach after being held goalless in extra-time by the third-division team. Bundesliga strugglers Stuttgart were also taken to extra-time by a team from the fourth division, before rallying to win 3-1. Bayer Leverkusen bowed out following a 5-4 penalty shootout defeat away to fellow top-flight team Borussia Monchengladbach after the match ended 1-1. Eintracht Frankfurt crushed Hamburg 5-2, while fellow Bundesliga side Hoffenheim progressed with a 1-0 win over division two team Ingolstadt.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Ten of France's 12 oil refineries were stopping production Friday, an oil industry spokesman said, as the country went through a fourth straight day of strikes over pension reforms. Unions said workers at all 12 refineries were taking part in the strike. Yves Le Goff, a spokesman for the French Oil Industry Association, said there is currently no rupture in the fuel supply, but that did not stop consumers from lining up at gas stations across the country to stock up on fuel, just in case. The work stoppage at the refineries was having a direct effect on the two main Paris airports, Orly and Charles de Gaulle. Both are supplied by a pipeline that comes directly from refineries that were shut down Friday, according to Trapil, the company that owns the line. While Orly said it has enough fuel to last for 17 days, French media reported that Charles de Gaulle has enough fuel to last at least through the weekend. A spokesman for Paris Airports would not confirm how many days the Charles de Gaulle fuel would last if the pipelines continued to be blocked, but said there was no concern. ""We are not at all worried right now,"" the spokesman said. The strike is over government pension reforms, which have passed the lower house of Parliament and are now awaiting approval by the Senate. Workers are especially upset over plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62, a provision that has already been approved by both houses of Parliament. It will not become law, however, until the Senate approves the full spate of reforms. The strike is the fourth by unions in the past month and the first one to go longer than 24 hours. Unions have said it will be open-ended, with a vote each day about whether to continue the walkout the following day. French President Nicolas Sarkozy indicated Thursday that his government would not back down in the face of strikes. ""Our duty is to act; to act in the public interest, act with justice, but to act,"" he said, according to a report in the Paris daily newspaper Le Monde. Another concern Friday was the increasing number of high school students joining the protest. There were demonstrations Friday in several French cities including Paris, where students were in front of the Senate to protest the bill. Student protests led to ""disruptions"" at 342 schools across the country Thursday, the Education Ministry said. Transportation was suffering only minor disruptions. Local transport services like subways and buses were operating well, though only half of the high-speed TGV trains were running, officials said. CNN's Jim Bittermann, Winnie Andrews, and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Friday is the fourth straight day of strikes .

"(CNN) -- South America will support the joint Spain-Portugal bid to host the 2018 World Cup at next week's vote, a top official at its football confederation revealed on Thursday. CONMEBOL will have three of 22 votes when world ruling body FIFA's executive committee meets on Friday to elect which countries will stage the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. ""The 10 countries are agreed to give the vote to Spain,"" its general secretary Eduardo Deluca told reporters after a meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay. England's bid representative David Dein had visited Brazil and Paraguay earlier in the week meeting CONMEBOL president Nicolas Leoz as he sought South American support. The Paraguayan is one of the confederation's three executive members along with Argentina's Julio Grondona and Ricardo Terra Teixeira of Brazil. Deluca's announcement follows claims by the head of the Spain-Portugal camp, Miguel Angel Lopez, that it had already secured eight votes. Lopez told the Bloomberg news agency on Monday that Spain's Angel Maria Villar Lona would also vote for the joint bid along with five other executive committee members. The head of the Asian Football Confederation, who is from 2022 candidate Qatar, also said he would be supporting Spain-Portugal. ""Asia supports the Iberian bid. There's an excellent relationship between Asian football and Spanish football, we have done a lot of projects together, but that doesn't mean there has been a pact between us,"" Mohamed Bin Hammam told Spanish newspaper Marca. ""It is something that happens between a lot of bids and it's not at all illegal. Qatar is going to support Spain and Portugal and they will support us, but we're not breaking any rules."" FIFA ruled that there had been no illegal collusion between rival bid camps earlier this month when it suspended two executive committee members for offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Oceania president Reynald Temarii will both be excluded from the December 2 vote, reducing the number from 24. The Oceania federation is meeting this weekend to see if it can find a way to get its vote reinstated, Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report has cast doubt on the Iberian bid's ability to finance the renovation of stadiums given Spain and Portugal's economic problems. ""If building these stadiums means taking on more debt, I fear that they won't happen,"" the chief economist at Spanish savings bank foundation Funcas said. Angel Laborda said both countries would be tightening their budgets, meaning local councils would struggle to find funds for stadium work. Spain-Portugal is bidding along with England, Russia and Belgium-Netherlands for 2018, while Qatar, Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States are vying for the rights to host in 2022.","Spain-Portugal bid can expect to win three votes from South America next week .

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- Both candidates contending in Guinea's much-delayed runoff presidential elections called for calm from their supporters and traded accusations over the weekend after the runoff was postponed for the fourth time. The West African nation's election was due on Sunday but was delayed indefinitely on Friday for technical reasons by new electoral commission head Gen. Siaka Toumani Sangare, a Malian national. Fighting between supporters of the rival candidates Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde continued on Friday night and Saturday morning after Diallo's supporters claimed they were attacked by Conde's RPG supporters and Conde's supporters said they were sold poisoned water and yogurt at a large rally in the capital Friday afternoon. Both candidates called news conferences Saturday to give their side of the story and call their activists to calm. Two people were killed on Tuesday and dozens injured in clashes between supporters of Diallo's UFDG and police. Senior party members also said that one of its supporters was killed and another left in a coma after violence between UFDG and RPG loyalists on Thursday. That violence continued into the weekend, and there were reports of security forces firing at civilians and raping at least one girl in Conakry's impoverished suburbs. Experts and political leaders are worried about the prospect of ethnic polarization, as support for both parties is divided along ethnic lines. The two largest ethnic groups, Peul and Malinké form the principle bases of support for Diallo's UFDG party and Conde's RPG party respectively. ""What worries us is the excessive tribalization of the debate and the violence,"" Diallo said to reporters on Saturday. Diallo's party also sees the Guinean state as biased against their party and complicit in the recent violence that has engulfed the capital. ""We need to be extremely careful because our country runs a big risk when politicians at the highest levels act they way they are acting today,"" Faya Minimono, a senior official of Diallo's UFDG party said Saturday. The U.N. Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a statement Friday condemning what it saw as ""excessive force"" and ethnic-based violence carried out by Guinea security forces during the week. ""Some members of the security forces appear to be making threats, and even carrying out assaults, based on people's ethnicity or political affiliation,"" the report said. Guinea, a former French colony, has never had a free and fair presidential election in its 52-year history. A military junta has ruled the country since taking power in a coup after the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008.","Presidential runoff election in Guinea delayed indefinitely .

"London, England (CNN) -- The officer in charge of the British nuclear submarine that ran aground in October has been removed from command, the Ministry of Defence said Saturday. Andrew Coles had been commanding officer of HMS Astute, which the United Kingdom calls its most powerful attack submarine. ""Commander Coles will continue to serve in the Royal Navy and he will be reappointed to a post where his talents and experience can be used to best effect,"" a ministry statement said. ""A new commanding officer will be appointed as soon as possible."" The HMS Astute ran aground off the Isle of Skye, in northern Scotland, while doing sea trials. Its nuclear propulsion system was not damaged in the incident and its reactor was declared safe, with no environmental impact, the ministry said. It was eventually pulled free and escorted back to port. The submarine can carry a mix of as many as 38 Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, according to the ministry.","Cmdr.

"(CNN) -- Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez wants a third clash with Manny Pacquiao following Saturday night's successful defense of his WBA and WBO lightweight titles. The 37-year-old stopped Australia's Michael Katsidis on a technical knockout in the ninth round in Las Vegas to take his record to 52-5 with 38 KOs. The only draw of his career came against Pacquiao in 2004 when he retained his WBA and IBF featherweight titles, but he lost his WBC super featherweight belt in a controversial split decision to the Filipino in 2008. ""We know that Pacquiao has been avoiding us. We will put a lot of work into it, and a third fight is what the public wants to see,"" Marquez told reporters after beating Katsidis, whose brother Stathi -- a horse-racing jockey -- died last month. ""Yes he beat bigger fellows but they are all past their prime, while I beat younger and stronger boxers like Juan Diaz and Michael Katsidis."" However, one stumbling block to a rematch is that Marquez wants it at the weight limit of 140-142 pounds, while Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach says he wants to fight at 147. ""I know he can make that weight as when he fought Margarito [this month], he was just 144 pounds. So if they insist in fighting at 147, like Freddie Roach has mentioned, they are again giving excuses."" However, Pacquiao doubts that the public wants to see him fight Marquez again, The Philippine Star reported on Sunday. ""Will they still watch it?"" Pacquiao said in Manila. The newspaper said Pacquiao's business manager Eric Pineda would accept the fight if Marquez promoted it. ""Manny thinks Marquez has a small fan base, that's why he doesn't want any hand in the promotion. All he wants is a guaranteed purse, and that Top Rank and MP Promotions won't be involved in the promotions. Then he will take the fight,"" Pineda said. Following his win over Antonio Margarito two weeks ago, Pacquiao has been linked with a bout against American veteran Shane Mosley, who he has yet to encounter. Pacquiao has this year juggled his political career with two successful fights, beating Joshua Clottey before stopping Margarito to become the first man to win world titles in eight weight categories.","Juan Manuel Marquez targets another crack at Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao .

A private funeral for Kwa Geok Choo will take place next Wednesday, the prime minister's office said in a statement. She was married to Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely credited with molding Singapore into one of the world's most prosperous countries. Lee, 87, was the founding father of the island nation. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is now Singapore's prime minister -- the country's third since it gained independence from Malaysia in 1965.

"(CNN) -- This weekend's Scottish football fixtures have been curtailed as overseas officials scheduled to cover for striking referees decided not to help out. Poland's football association withdrew its offer of 12 officials, while two refs from Portugal returned home on Friday after arriving in Glasgow, the UK Press Association reported. Luxembourg's Alain Hamer will referee two Scottish Premier League matches in two days as he takes charge of second-placed Celtic's home clash with Inverness and defending champions Rangers' trip to Dundee United. The four remaining SPL games are expected to go ahead ahead despite the Portuguese officials Cosme Machado and Joao Ferreira having been scheduled for two of them. Israel will provide officials for the other two, with Meir Levy to referee Hamilton Accies v St Mirren and Eli Hacmon taking charge of Kilmarnock-Aberdeen, also on Saturday. Sunday's Challenge Cup final between Ross County and Queen of the South is still expected to be played. However, two of the three Scottish Cup replays are off due to the Polish turnaround and 10 lower league matches have been postponed. Scotland's category one officials decided earlier this week that they would stand down in protest against increasing levels of criticism from players, managers and the media. PA reported on Thursday that the cost to bring in overseas officials would be around $50,000 compared to the $300,000 shortfall if the matches were not played. SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said the strike was ""a sad day for Scottish football."" ""After further positive talks yesterday, and having received the backing of both the SPL and the SFL [Scottish Football League], I felt that we had shown our commitment to the refereeing fraternity and that they had recognized that substantial progress had been made,"" he told the SFA website. It is the first time that Scotland has employed officials from outside its borders. The 44-year-old Hamer has a decade of experience in Europe's top club competition, the Champions League, and has refereed Scotland matches at international level.","Portuguese and Polish referees decide against covering for striking Scottish officials .

"(CNN) -- The Syfy Channel is known for a certain kind of escapist fun. Saturday nights are reserved for their original movies: movies that are lower-budget than the fare seen in theaters, but still meet science fiction fans' need for fantastic monsters, time travel and magic. With a reputation for being delightfully campy, Syfy's original movies are a guilty pleasure, said Colin Ferguson, star of Syfy's original series, ""Eureka."" ""Within the bandwith of the campy sci-fi movie, you can go from completely self-aware, with something like [classic sci-fi movie] 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,' and then in the middle you have something like [the Syfy movie] 'Sharktopus,' where the creature is just way over the top, sort of on purpose,"" Ferguson said. ""And on the other end you have sort of the more realistic version of the campy creature, like 'Triassic Attack,'"" he added. ""Triassic Attack,"" is Ferguson's Syfy original movie directorial debut and will air Saturday, November 27, at 9 p.m. ET. The movie is about the fossilized remains of dinosaurs that are brought back to life by a Native American spell and urged to wreak havoc on a small town. The ravenous, animated skeletons start eating as many people as they can. However, because the resurrected dinosaurs are only bones, they have no digestive organs. So their human meals just drop to the ground after mastication. ""I'd describe it as, 'What happens when a flying tyrannosaurus rex attacks Oregon?' "" said Ferguson. ""Pandemonium ensues, no doubt!"" The movie's tagline reads, ""They're ancient, they're angry and they're out for revenge."" Based on that description, Frank Conniff, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" writer and current member of ""Cinematic Titanic"" said it could be a perfect addition to his movie riffing routine. ""I guess the central dilemma of the movie is the digestive system of these monsters. ... Is Rolaids or Tums doing a sponsor?"" he said. ""Who could not watch a movie with that description?"" Conniff has made a living out of lovingly poking fun at campy, B-grade movies. He said the reason so many people love campy films is because of their originality and filmmakers' resourcefulness. ""The best of them have a real personality that comes through that you don't necessarily see in a big-budget movie,"" Conniff said. Big-budget science fiction movies tend to rely more on a constant barrage of noise and shiny objects instead of the charm of a campy filmmaker, like Ed Wood, he said. ""In some ways ['Triassic Attack]' could be a cheesy B movie, and in some ways it could be an action/adventure sci-fi movie,"" said Jeff Beach, co-founder of the production company behind ""Triassic Attack,"" UFO Films. ""We make fun movies with a lot of visual effects and a lot of action, and there's this huge fan base for them,"" he said. ""Anytime I'm out and about and people ask me what I do, I say, 'Oh I make the movies for the Syfy Channel,' and people are like, 'Oh! I love those things!' Anyone from a hairdresser to a guy in a grocery store, guy parking the car. I think it's really a wide spectrum of viewers for these movies, and I think the age range also varies very much, too."" ""Syfy Channel is filling a void,"" Ferguson said. ""People used to go to drive-ins to see these kinds of movies."" There's something about cheap entertainment that makes people smile, he said. Thomas Vitale, the executive vice president of programming and original movies at Syfy, said the movie ""Sharktopus"" made everyone on his team smile. Even saying the word ""Sharktopus"" was fun, he said. ""We create this world that's outlandish -- we create this world where 'Sharktopus' really exists, where the military creates a sharktopus and the sharktopus gets loose,"" Vitale said. ""Once you set that up, everything that follows has to live within that world and has to make logical sense based on the outlandish premise that we've created."" Another recent Syfy movie, ""Red,"" starring sci-fi fan favorite Felicia Day, applies that logic to the fairy tale ""Little Red Riding Hood."" Vitale said it was an easy leap to go from ""a story that's about a little girl and a talking wolf,"" to an original movie that was about how a modern girl would deal with the sci-fi version of a talking wolf -- a werewolf. With such attention to detail and adherence to a fantastic story line, Vitale said it's no surprise that Syfy's original movie team is made up of sci-fi geeks. ""Everything at Syfy Channel is run by robots, actually,"" said Karen O'Hara, vice president of original movies at Syfy. ""We're all fans of the genre, we all consume a lot of science fiction, fantasy and supernatural programming,"" Vitale said. ""First and foremost, we are entertainment junkies. When I was a kid, the one thing my parents were always on me about was to turn off the TV."" And while it's clear the creative team at Syfy knows what traditional sci-fi fans want in terms of continuity and premise, Ferguson said he believes the network is reaching out to a more mainstream audience. ""With the creation of [original Syfy series] 'Eureka' and 'Warehouse 13,' it was like, 'no space, no aliens,' sort of grander science-type stuff. At the same time you had the mainstream [audience] getting more technical, more savvy, more sort of geeky,"" Ferguson said. ""Everyone is talking about iPhones and iPads and knows about e-mailing this and YouTube and Netflixing directly,"" he added. ""It's all very sci-fi anyway in our world. So I think modern culture and technology sort of moved towards sci-fi, and Syfy tried to meet them half-way."" For now, thankfully, man-eating dinosaur skeletons are still squarely in the realm of outlandish camp.","Syfy Channel's original movies are known for their campy fun .

"(CNN) -- All the world is watching, eager to welcome those 33 miners from the pits of hell. It is a tale of courage and resilience that rivals the return of Ernest Shackleton and his men from their ill-fated voyage across Antarctica. Nearly all the credit belongs to the 33 Chilean men who have survived the ordeal. So, too, should it go to their families and fellow countrymen who have heroically rushed to the rescue. But even as we wait to see if all men make it safely to the top, it is not too early to salute the Americans who pitched in to help as well with the U.S. technology that proved so vital. After a long dry spell, it is so refreshing to see us at our best again. The U.S.-Chilean company Geotec Boyles Bros., which operated the first drill to reach the miners, assembled help and materials from across the globe. In Western Pennsylvania, two companies long-trained by mine collapses in that region rushed to action. They had UPS ship south a specialty drill, capable of creating shafts large enough to fit the men without collapsing, within 48 hours. And UPS did it for free. Then, working with Chilean crews, Geotec's Kansas-based partner came up with the plan to get the miners to the surface almost two months earlier than the Christmastime date originally projected. Expert driller Jeff Hart, a contractor from Denver, Colorado, was called from Afghanistan, where he was helping American forces find water, to man the machine. The 40-year-old drilled for 33 days straight, through tough mineral ore, to reach the men trapped more than 2,000 feet below. His comment after breaking through last week? ""We got the job done."" Read more CNN.com op-eds . Three NASA doctors have provided advice on how to keep the miners healthy, both physically and mentally. And the design of the rescue pod is the brainchild of NASA engineer Clinton Cragg. Cragg drew on his experience as a former submarine captain in the Navy and directed a team of 20 to conceive of a small 13- foot-long tube to carry the miners one at a time to the surface. All told, about a dozen Americans decamped to the desert, and many more labored from home, to rescue the miners. The display of generosity and technological ingenuity shows our finest face to the world. Our capacity for problem-solving and helping those most in need of it, sustains the faith that we can, as Hart said, get ""the job done."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Authors: Chilean miners' ordeal shows courage and resilience, with credit to families and nation .

"Abu Dhabi, Uae (CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates will not implement a planned ban on all BlackBerry services that was to have gone into effect next week, the state news agency said Friday. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority confirmed that all BlackBerry services have conformed to the agency's regulations, the WAM news agency said. As a result, authorities will not follow through with a ban on services that was to have gone into effect on Monday. The news agency did not immediately say how Research In Motion (RIM), the Canadian company that produces the BlackBerry, conformed to the regulatory authority's concerns. ""RIM cannot discuss the details of confidential regulatory matters that occur in specific countries, but RIM confirms that it continues to approach lawful access matters internationally within the framework of core principles that were publicly communicated by RIM on August 12,"" the company said in a statement. In August, the UAE threatened to block access to e-mail, web browsing and text messages on the popular smartphone if Research In Motion didn't provide government access for security investigations. The BlackBerry is the dominant smartphone in the UAE, where the capital, Abu Dhabi, and the emirate of Dubai are major business hubs of the Middle East. The threatened ban would have affected more than a half-million BlackBerry users in the country, as well as visitors to Dubai and the rest of the emirates. For consumers, the UAE controversy represents a growing battle between digital companies and governments over data security. While companies like BlackBerry want to ensure their users' privacy, governments increasingly want access for security reasons. BlackBerry messages are encrypted to keep them from being deciphered by anyone who might intercept them. Other companies, like Google, have added encryption -- in Google's case, after some private data was compromised, setting off a public spat with China's government. Operating systems such as the iPhone's and Google's Android often store information ""in the clouds,"" meaning over the internet, while BlackBerry sends data to its own offshore servers, said Tim Beyers, a senior technology analyst for The Motley Fool, a financial services company. However, virtually all smartphone systems geared toward corporate clients are encrypted, he noted. While various companies have agreed to offer ""back doors"" for governments when they're investigating potential security threats, BlackBerry's stock in trade has been privacy. ""RIM has been known as the very buttoned-down, corporate smartphone supplier,"" Beyers said in August. ""Security is the No. 1 reason that perception has remained. That is their competitive advantage and anything that dilutes that story dilutes their corporate advantage and makes it harder for Research in Motion to grow.""

Selena Gomez came of age in the spotlight, and now the young actress and singer advocates for children as UNICEF's youngest goodwill ambassador. Gomez, 18, has also been involved with CNN Heroes since 2008, when she served as a presenter at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."" She recently sat down with CNN Heroes producer Allie Torgan to talk about the Heroes campaign and her humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why did you decide to get involved with UNICEF? Selena Gomez: I started working with them for the Trick-or-Treat campaign [a fundraiser where children go door-to-door to collect money on Halloween], and I ended up falling in love with what they do. There's 24,000 children that die a day from preventable causes like malaria, not getting enough food, dirty water, and UNICEF's goal is to make that number zero. They asked me to be their ambassador, so I help them out as much as I can. Torgan: Tell me about your recent mission trip to Ghana. Gomez: UNICEF chose Ghana because of its high child mortality, so we got to see exactly what UNICEF is doing to provide healthy clean water, education, and protect these kids from preventable diseases. I got to see firsthand, and I got to help out myself. It was a really humbling experience for me. I remember a 14-year-old and his friends going to each village, telling everybody how they wanted an education. You think about how many kids hate school here and how much they just wish they didn't have to go to school. You know, I was one of those kids. I complained all the time about having to do homework and I wanted to go out and play, and these kids are begging for school. ... It was so powerful. It makes you more aware of how fortunate you are. There was this little kid playing with a bunch of plastic bags that he wrapped string around, and it was a soccer ball. That's all he needed. And you think about all the Game Boys and all the things that kids ""need"" to be entertained here. It was all about simplicity with them. I loved being around them. It got me excited to help more. Torgan: Do you think your work is having an impact with kids here in the U.S.? Gomez: I am very blessed to have a lot of fans, and basically my goal is to use my voice to educate them on all of these things. Kids want to help. You just need to tell them how. And you just need to encourage them. Torgan: How would you describe a hero? Gomez: A hero to me would be someone that truly believes in something. The passion and the drive of wanting to make the world a better place, or to help out and to contribute in some small way, that's a hero to me. Torgan: Back in 2008, you were a presenter at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" and you helped honor Maria Ruiz, who helps children in Juarez, Mexico. What was that experience like, and what did you think of her? Gomez: She was so amazing, and she was so sweet. She takes clothes and food across the border, and you could tell that everything that she does, she does because she wants to. But then that night was about her, and I loved that. It was a very good moment. This award show is by far my favorite. It was so cool to see these people that help out and really genuinely care about everything they do. I loved it. I cried so many times, and I met some amazing people, and the whole time I was just very grateful to just be there. I'm looking forward to going again.","Actress and singer Selena Gomez is also UNICEF's youngest goodwill ambassador .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Police raided a major methamphetamine lab in an Atlanta, Georgia, suburb, discovering a large amount of crystal meth and liquid methamphetamine oil, they said Tuesday. ""This is believed to be one of the largest methamphetamine confiscations in the United States,"" according to a statement from Gwinnett County Police Cpl. Edwin Ritter. A total of 933 pounds of methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $44,641,000 was recovered during the raid Monday afternoon, officials said. Ritter said Jose Galvez-Vela, 33, of Weslaco, Texas, is in custody and has been charged with trafficking methamphetamine. Police requested assistance from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration ""due to the size of this lab and extremely hazardous situation,"" according to the statement. The two agencies removed large qualities of the chemicals from a home in Norcross, Georgia, after police obtained information regarding its production, the statement said. Authorities say the home does not appear to have had anyone living in it and was used strictly for the production of methamphetamine.","NEW: Jose Galvez-Vela, 33, charged with trafficking methamphetamine .

"(CNN) -- A grand jury has brought felony charges against three Dallas, Texas, police officers who were caught on patrol car dashboard cameras beating a motorcyclist after a chase, prosecutors said Thursday. Officers Paul Bauer and Kevin Randolph were charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant, a charge that carries a five-year minimum prison term, in the September 5 beating of motorcyclist Andrew Collins. A third officer, Henry Duetsch, was charged with third-degree felony of tampering with physical evidence, said Jamille Bradfield, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney's office. Bauer was also charged with assault and with official oppression, both misdemeanors. Randolph -- who was fired for failing probation after the incident -- was charged with official oppression and tampering with a governmental record, another felony. There was no immediate response to the charges from the three defendants. Prosecutors say Bauer and Randolph spotted Collins sitting on his motorcycle on a sidewalk the night of September 5. He drove off when the officers shined a spotlight on him, and they began pursuing him. An internal investigation found that Bauer and Randolph disregarded an order to stop the chase, with one of the officers saying, ""Keep us going. I'm going to kick the s--- out of him."" Collins eventually stopped, and when the officers spotted him, Bauer struck the bike with his patrol car. Randolph beat Collins with his baton after Collins dropped to all fours, and Bauer began hitting and kicking him, police said. And Duetsch, who arrived on the scene after Collins had stopped, turned another cruiser's dashboard camera away from the scene when he arrived. Three other officers were put on restricted duty after the beating. They were seen on the second video also having contact with Collins, but they are not clearly seen because Duetsch had turned the camera away from the beating, Dallas Police Chief David Brown said earlier this month. In a statement issued after the indictments, Brown said the charges are ""another step in the process of bringing this incident to a conclusion."" ""As chief of police, I will ensure that every citizen of this city is treated with a deserved measure of respect by our officers,"" he said. Collins suffered bruises in the incident, developed blood clots and complained of pain. He initially was charged with three traffic warrants, evading arrest, resisting arrest, and possession of marijuana after his arrest. After seeing the video, police dropped the resisting arrest charge.","The charges stem from the September 5 beating of a motorcyclist .

"(CNN) -- World champion Jenson Button fired a warning to his 2010 title rivals that he will be just as quick with new team McLaren after setting the fastest time of the pre-season testing sessions in Jerez. The British driver, who left Brawn ahead of the manufacturers' champions takeover by Mercedes following the capture of his maiden drivers' crown, ended the eight days at the Spanish circuit top of the timesheets on Saturday following a best effort of one minute 18.871 seconds. That run put the 30-year-old ahead of the 1:19.299 set by Red Bull's Mark Webber on Friday and the 1:19.583 recorded by new McLaren teammate and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton last week. McLaren reported on their Web site that Button was ""very comfortable and confident in the car"" as he completed 108 laps in his third test with the team ahead of the final sessions in Barcelona next week. ""Both drivers will spend alternate days in the car evaluating the new bodywork and aerodynamic components ahead of the season-opener in Bahrain on March 14,"" McLaren said. Renault's new signing Robert Kubica was second fastest in Saturday's sessions, completing 117 laps in long runs in the R30. Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi was third quickest over a similar distance ahead of Force India's Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg in a Mercedes after the German took over from Michael Schumacher. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was sixth, while Webber was back in eighth after his RB6 could manage only 88 laps after an engine failure. Meanwhile, struggling new team Campos hope to be on the grid in Bahrain after confirming that shareholder Jose Ramon Carabante has now taken a controlling stake. The Spaniard has appointed former Force India boss Colin Kolles as team principal of an outfit which has just one confirmed driver, Bruno Senna. ""I would like to thank Bernie Ecclestone, who worked tremendously to support our efforts to keep the team viable,"" Carabante told F1's official Web site. ""The whole rescue operation has been a race against time with the goal of always having the team run two competitive cars at the first Grand Prix of the F1 season. ""We have a lot of hard work still ahead of us but we are excited about making our F1 debut and looking forward to a competitive season.""","World champion Jenson Button sets fastest time of the eight pre-season testing sessions .

"(InStyle.com) -- It's been a super-hot summer, in more ways than one: As temperatures across the country climbed to near-record highs, the stars headed seaside to frolic, clad in a slew of sexy, stylish swimsuits. Now that Labor Day is looming just around the corner, InStyle looks back at the best celebrity bikinis of 2010. Best Metallic: Kim Kardashian  The bikini queen and reality show star looked top brass in this bronze triangle-top suit. On anyone else, the combination of metallic fabric, metallic accents and strings might be a little much, but on Kardashian, it's just right. See all 33 of the best celebrity bikinis of 2010 . Best Accessories: Sienna Miller  We like Miller's patterned bandeau bikini, but we love the layers of gold and silver jewelry she piled atop it while playing with on-again beau Jude Law on a beach in Ponzo, Italy. Best Body: Halle Berry  It's hard to believe that the Oscar-winning actress is 44; in this cute suit-and-short-shorts combination, Berry showed off a body that women half her age would envy. We love her little ""accessory"" -- adorable 2-year-old daughter Nahla -- too. The most iconic swimsuits of all time . Prettiest Pattern: Kate Bosworth  Bosworth first found fame in the 2002 surf flick ""Blue Crush,"" so it's no surprise she'd make our top ten. Lounging poolside after a long weekend at the Coachella Music Festival, she looked downright groovy in this purple paisley two-piece. Best Retro: Taylor Swift  A retro-style suit is a great option for a girl who wants to show some skin, but not too much. Swift kept her high-waist, polka-dot two-piece from looking like a throwback by wearing it with quirky sunglasses and a loose, easy braid. 10 hottest celebrity bikini trends . Best Blue: Ashley Greene  This pretty hue is a perennial swimsuit favorite -- no surprise, considering that it perfectly matches both a typical pool and the summer sky. The ""Twilight"" star's version, which she sported in Las Vegas, features a halter-style bandeau top, perfect for her lithe frame. Cutest Cover-Up: Katharine McPhee  McPhee's striped bikini is chic on its own.

Best Mix-and-Match: Megan Fox  As Fox demonstrated in Maui, a mis-matched two-piece can be even cuter than a perfectly coordinated style. Her denim-resembling bottom might be too much with a matching top, but it's perfect when paired with a striped triangle style. Megan Fox's transformation . Best Bright: AnnaLynne McCord  In Miami, the ""90210"" star opted for a hot pink two-piece paired with multiple bracelets, necklaces and simple black shades.

"Washington (CNN) -- For federal workers with security clearances, losing a house to foreclosure can cost them their jobs as well, because financial distress can be a security vulnerability, a recent study says. Attorney Sheldon Cohen says he has several clients who face losing their jobs -- or being rejected for a new job -- because they have gotten into debt and cannot pass the required background check. ""The government needs to take into account the current financial crisis in the country,"" he said. ""Not everybody who loses their house due to a mortgage or a short sale is necessarily a security risk."" To prove his point, Cohen looked at the Defense Department, and counted the number of contractor employees who have been stripped of their security privileges because of debt. Ten years ago, there was fewer than one case per year that reached the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, the study shows. Last year, there were 24, and the pace this year looks similar. Employees with at least 10 other agencies face similar procedures of reviewing and revoking clearances, Cohen says. ""No single fact (e.g. a foreclosure) will necessarily result in a denial of clearance. Conditions beyond the individual's control can be mitigating,"" said Jennifer Dorsey, a spokeswoman for the government's Office of Personnel Management. But an inability to satisfy debts can be grounds for denying an employee a security clearance, according to the Pentagon's published guidelines. ""An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds,"" the guidelines say, ""including espionage."" Financial problems were the reason double-agent Robert Hanssen, one of the most damaging spies in American history, started selling secrets to the Soviets in the 1980s, according to Eric O'Neill, the former FBI counter-espionage agent who helped catch him. O'Neill said even if the financial difficulties are not the government employee's fault, they can make a worker vulnerable. ""Foreign agents are looking for that,"" he said. ""It's not hard. You can pull the credit report on just about anybody, and you look at them and realize, wow, they are in enormous debt."" Then, O'Neill says, a foreign agent might approach the target -- say by following the employee after work to a bar -- and offer to pay for secrets. He says the agent might say, "" 'Hey, I've got a solution to your problems. Just give me something little, and I'll give you some money, and you'll make ends meet this month.' "" The revoking of clearances, recently highlighted by ProPublica and The Washington Post, could be costing the country valuable employees. As an example, Cohen cited a client, whom he declined to name, who may lose her security clearance because of foreclosure. ""She's a highly-trained person,"" he said. ""And she'd be difficult to replace. So not only are people losing their jobs, the government is losing the services of good people they need."" Fran Townsend, the former Homeland Security adviser under President George W. Bush, says when officials discover vulnerable employees, ""the first order of business is always to try and save that person's clearance, and therefore job. But I can see now, during this period, where this is probably a much more serious concern for investigators.""","Some are being turned down for new jobs over debt .
Others have been stripped of their security privileges .

"(CNN) -- The future of Liverpool Football Club will be decided in London's High Court next week after current owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett mounted a legal challenge to the proposed buyout by New England Sports Ventures (NESV). Reds chairman Martin Broughton announced the sale to the company which owns the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday, but the American co-owners claimed the £300 million ($476m) offer ""dramatically undervalues"" the club. Hicks and Gillett also allege that the sale, which is subject to Premier League approval, is not legally binding because two board members who approved the deal had already been sacked. But Broughton says the removal of managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre, and their replacement by Hicks's son Mack and his associate Lori McCutcheon, were not valid moves. What does the sale mean for Liverpool? ""The key thing is the court case,"" Broughton told the Liverpool website. ""We need to go to the court to get a declaratory judgment, which is for the court to declare that we did act validly in completing the sale agreement, and then the buyers can complete the sale. ""I am confident. I wouldn't have taken the board through that process yesterday if I hadn't been confident."" Meanwhile, NESV posted a statement on Liverpool's website in which they confirmed their intention to clear the debt, reported to be between $397m and $445m, loaded onto the club by Gillett and Hicks. What do you think of the sale? Sound off with CNN iReport . ""NESV wants to create a long-term financially solid foundation for Liverpool FC and is dedicated to ensuring that the club has the resources to build for the future, including the removal of all acquisition debt,"" it said. ""Our objective is to stabilize the club and ultimately return Liverpool FC to its rightful place in English and European football, successfully competing for and winning trophies."" Hicks and Gillett took out loans in the club's name to buy it in February 2007, promising to invest in a new stadium and new players. Blog: Jumping from frying pan to fire? But with the club's debts spiraling, the stadium project failing to get off the ground and the team struggling on the field, the owners have become targets for angry fans. Liverpool failed to qualify for this season's lucrative European Champions League and the team is currently 18th out of 20 in the English league after seven matches -- the worst start to a season for decades. Manager Roy Hodgson, who replaced Rafael Benitez in July, has welcomed the proposed takeover. History of Liverpool in images . ""It's very positive and of course I'm delighted,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford by West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League on Saturday. A mistake by goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar gifted the visitors an equalizer 10 minutes into the second half after Hernandez and Nani had given the Alex Ferguson's men a two goal lead before the break. Van Der Sar's fumble from a Chris Brunt cross fell to the feet of Somen Tchoyi who pounced on the error to score after 55 minutes. Tchoyi's effort came five minutes after Patrice Evra deflected a Brunt free-kick into his own net. Ferguson left his star striker Wayne Rooney on the bench until the 71st minute but he couldn't force a winner as Man United poured forward in the closing stages. The draw is the 2009 champions third in succession in the league and leaves them in third place on 14 points. Arsenal moved up to second after they beat Birmingham City 2-1 at the Emirates. The Gunners had to come from behind after Birmingham striker Nikola Zigic headed home from a Keith Fahey cross in the 33rd minute. But it wasn't long before Arsenal were back on equal terms. Marouane Chamakh was awarded a penalty eight minutes later after being fouled. Sami Nasri stepped up to convert the spot kick. And it was the Moroccan striker who secured all three points for the home side when he rounded Birmingham's keeper Ben Foster to record his fifth goal of his Arsenal career. League leaders Chelsea could only manage a goalless draw against Aston Villa at Villa Park. The point keeps the 2010 champions five points clear of the chasing pack. Villa move up to eighth. Despite the loss Birmingham remain 16th place in the table as strugglers Wolves and West Ham -- the Premier League's bottom two sides -- drew 1-1 at Molineux. Matthew Jarvis had put the home side ahead in the 10th minute after he volleyed home a weak punched clearance from West Ham's keeper, Robert Green. Despite dominating the first half, Wolves couldn't double their lead and were made to pay eight minutes into the second half when defender Kevin Foley brought down West Ham striker Victor Obinna. Mark Noble stepped up to convert the penalty. Tottenham Hotspur also came from behind to defeat their west London rivals Fulham 1-2 at Craven Cottage. Goals from Roman Pavlyuchenko and Tom Huddlestone in either half secured the win for Spurs after Diomansy Kamara had given the Cottagers the lead after half an hour. Wigan looked as though they were also on course for a notable away win at St James Park over Newcastle. But Argentine defender Fabricio Coloccini equalized for the home side in the fourth minute of added time at the end of the match. Two goals in as many minutes by Ex-Newcastle striker Charles N'Zogbia midway through the first half gave Wigan a surprise lead. Newcastle's efforts to get back into the game were thwarted until the 72nd minute when substitute Shola Ameobi gave the Magpies hope of a point when he scored from close range before Coloccini's late show. The result leaves Wigan in 12th place, one point and one place ahead of Newcastle in the table. Bolton Wanderers grabbed a last gasp winner at the Reebok Stadium to overcome Stoke City 2-1. Lee Chung-Yong had given Bolton the lead in the first half with a stunning curling effort from 22 yards after 22 minutes. Rory Delap equalized for Stoke early in the second half and the game looked as though it was heading for a draw until Ivan Klasnic scored the winner two minutes into stoppage time. Klasnic didn't celebrate for long though as he was sent off moments later for a second bookable offence.

"(CNN) -- More than 1,200 NASA workers will be laid off Friday, despite Congress passing a $19 billion budget for the space agency two days earlier. Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said Thursday she didn't believe the bill would affect planned layoffs, ""certainly not for tomorrow."" Thursday was the last day for laid-off employees to report to their workstations. Shuttle workers on their last day were to receive their final paperwork. Many of the departing workers have worked on the shuttle program since its beginning in the early 1980s. Late Wednesday, the House passed the NASA Reauthorization Act following the Senate's approval, giving NASA the authority to move forward with President Barack Obama's strategy for the agency. The bill overwhelming passed both houses of Congress and Obama is expected to sign it. The exact amount of money each NASA program receives will be decided by congressional appropriations, but not until after the November elections. The bill authorizes an additional shuttle launch, extending the retirement date of the shuttle program from February 2011 until June 2011. The NASA administrator said an additional shuttle mission could help stock additional supplies on the international space station. The bill extended the space station's life until 2020.

"(CNN) -- A stampede of fans erupted outside a South African stadium Sunday before a warmup match between Nigeria and North Korea leading up to the World Cup, police and the local organizing committee said. There were no fatalities reported, police said, but 14 people sustained minor injuries. A police official was in stable condition after being trampled by the crowd, and a second police officer had minor injuries. The match at Makhulong Stadium, in the Johannesburg suburb of Tembisa, was arranged by a private company, authorities said in a statement, and tickets were being handed out outside. ""Initial reports from the stadium, which is not a 2010 FIFA World Cup stadium, indicate that 10,000 tickets were distributed outside the stadium, but a number of fans wanted to enter the stadium without tickets,"" the statement said. ""It would seem that there was also some confusion among the crowd as to the ticketing system which led to disruptive behavior on the part of the crowd."" Police began implementing ""crowd management"" measures, but the group pushed against the gates, twice forcing them open, authorities said. Calm was restored after police reinforcements arrived. In a statement issued after the stampede, the sport's international governing body FIFA said the match had ""no relation whatsoever"" to the upcoming World Cup contests. FIFA wished a speedy recovery to those hurt, but added, ""Contrary to some media reports, FIFA had nothing to do with the ticketing of this game.""","NEW: ""No relation"" to World Cup matches, FIFA says .

"(CNN) -- The San Diego County, California, sheriff and other officials are to hold a town hall meeting Tuesday night about what will become of the house that's the site of the nation's largest cache of homemade explosives ever found in one spot. For now, the single-story suburban house in an unincorporated area outside Escondido has been deemed too dangerous for bomb squad technicians to re-enter after they discovered homemade explosives inside last week, officials said. Eight or 9 pounds of explosives were found in the backyard after a gardener was injured when he accidentally ignited the material almost two weeks ago. It has been cordoned off, but residents are concerned about how authorities plan to secure a house that a prosecutor has described as a bomb-making factory. The house's resident, George Djura Jakubec, 54, a computer software consultant, is being held in lieu of $5 million bail on bomb-making and bank robbery charges. The homemade explosives are volatile and are the kind favored by terrorists worldwide: hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD, and pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, which is now the target of new U.S. airport body scans and pat downs. Authorities are investigating Jakubec's intentions. Exacerbating the work of the bomb squad is the overwhelming volume of clutter that indicates Jakubec was a hoarder of papers, boxes and other items, officials said. Friction from moving any papers or boxes could cause hidden explosives to ignite, officials said. Authorities have removed about 9 pounds of HMTD from the backyard, a quantity that one expert likened to a large car bomb that could blow out the house's windows and doors and damage adjacent houses. Joy Colclough lives about 100 yards from the hazardous home, according to CNN affiliate KGTV. She received a reverse 911 call earlier Tuesday, warning her of potential activity around the residence, but has not been asked to evacuate. ""It's not a convenient time. But I don't think there's any convenient time for having explosives next door to where you live,"" she told KGTV. On Tuesday afternoon, Assistant San Diego County Sheriff Ed Prendergast declined to provide details of officials' presentation for the town hall meeting, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. PT at Woodland Park Middle School in San Marcos. Sheriff Bill Gore, Escondido Police Chief Jim Maher, Escondido Fire Chief Michael Lowry and other public safety officials were to answer questions from residents about the explosives and hazardous chemicals that remain in the house, and authorities will provide information about personal safety regarding the planned disposal of the volatile materials. The additional HMTD discovered inside the house last week is in a bottle, Prendergast said. PETN was also found inside the house, officials said. ""We have not removed it yet. It's too dangerous to move. Any movement can set it off,"" Prendergast said. ""We have a saying: We'll go as fast as we can but slow as we must,"" he added.","House near Escondido, California, held record cache of homemade explosives .

"(Wired) -- Unmanned aircraft, for all their utility, are fairly simple beasts. They're good at taking direction, but they're not so good at processing information on their own. Now the Air Force figures it's time for drones to get a lot smarter, especially as they take off or land. As anyone who's ever flown knows, the runway is a crowded place. Planes on the runway queue up to get airborne. Planes in the air have to coordinate with Air Traffic Control for the order in which they can safely land, taking precautions not to get in anyone's way until it's their turn. There's a fair amount of information to rapidly process in order to avoid collisions and other accidents. Pilots can handle that information load. Drones can't. Yet. It's one of the big reasons why the Federal Aviation Administration has been so reluctant to allow unmanned aircraft to fly over the U.S. Even robotic flights over relatively unpopulated areas along the southern border have been canceled when there's the most routine technical hiccups. On Tuesday, the Air Force Research Laboratory at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said it'll soon solicit engineers to design an algorithm to allow drones to ""integrate seamlessly"" with piloted planes for takeoff and landing. In the algorithm-driven future that the labs want to build, drones will be equipped a database of terminal procedures; link up with Air Traffic Control; and ""recognize the intent of other aircraft."" For instance: aircraft landing on parallel runways can appear to be on a collision course before they turn and land. Right now, a drone would simply perceive that a plane's trajectory is going to remain unchanged, making it a threat for collision. But a capable algorithm would let the drone process Air Traffic Control information like basic airfield maps to know that there's no actual danger from the oncoming piloted plane. ""The developed algorithm(s), optimally, would require no more a priori information than a human pilot,"" the labs instruct. ""Intent analysis should be accurate, reliable and real-time, enabling quick and appropriate decisions that are necessary in this time critical environment."" There's a clear commercial application here. As Wired mentioned on Wednesday, FedEx is starting to think about an airfleet of linked-up drones that can fly in formation at the direction of a piloted aircraft.

"Washington (CNN) -- Will an anti-incumbent wave return Republicans to power in the House and Senate, or can Democrats engineer a late rush to hold on to their congressional majorities? The 2010 mid-term elections comes down to campaign basics in the final nine days until vote-counting begins. For now, the two parties agree that Republicans will win more seats than they currently hold, but they differ sharply on how many and whether a major power shift will occur. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program that an unprecedented GOP wave would win control of both chambers as well as state legislatures in a broad condemnation of President Barack Obama and Democratic policies. ""The voters are tired of the fact that the federal government has not listened to them over the past two years, has moved in its own direction, at its own rhythm and they want to pull back on that,"" Steele said. ""And I think you're going to see a wave, an unprecedented wave on election day that's going to surprise a lot of people."" His Democratic counterpart, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, pointed to strengthening poll numbers for his party's candidates as a sign that the Democratic base was getting energized. ""From this point forward, it's all about turnout and ground game, and we're seeing good early voting trends,"" said Kaine, the Democratic National Committee chairman, when asked on the ABC program ""This Week"" if Democrats can hold their majorities. ""We've got work to do, but we think we can do it."" While Kaine said the House remains uncertain, he sounded much more confident about the Senate. ""Four or five months ago, the Republicans thought they had a great chance at taking both houses,"" Kaine said. ""For a variety of reasons, the Senate has gotten much more difficult for them. And again, we're seeing this week strong moves in polling for our Senate candidates"" in several states. One of those reasons is inexperienced, conservative ideologues backed by the Tea Party movement who defeated mainstream Republicans in primary elections and now trail Democratic foes as the November 2 vote approaches. The Delaware race is a prime example. Christine O'Donnell's primary win over nine-term Republican Rep. Mike Castle made a Senate seat once considered likely Republican now an apparent Democratic victory for previously little-known Chris Coons. O'Donnell's campaign became a national joke over a long-ago comment that she once ""dabbled in witchcraft"" and other missteps. It also exposed a rift within the political right between the mainstream Republican establishment, which criticized O'Donnell and other Tea Party backed candidates, and the more conservative Tea Party movement. With the election approaching, Republicans put on a united front Sunday, with GOP strategist Karl Rove -- one of O'Donnell's harshest critics -- calling the Tea Party movement ""patriotic"" and ""incredibly positive."" While noting that Tea Party backers ""are not people who are skilled in the ways of Washington,"" Rove told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" he welcomed the movement as a ""wholesome development"" that would greatly increase Republican turnout in a mid-term election. Rove predicted Republicans will win well over 50 House seats to easily grab majority control of the chamber, and that a GOP Senate majority also was possible. On the same program, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland predicted a different outcome, due to voter distrust of what he called special interest money going for anonymous donations to groups running attack ads against Democratic candidates. The issue hammered by Democrats including Obama in recent weeks was proving resonant, Van Hollen said. ""I'm confident the Democrats are going to retain their majority because the American people are connecting the dots between these tens of millions of dollars of secret special interest money,"" he said, later adding: ""The early voting states are showing good news for the Democrats."" Both Rove and Steele said election disclosure laws should be changed, but added that the anonymous donations to groups running political ads complied with current law. Rove added that Democrats including Obama benefited from similar anonymous campaign funding in the past.","Nine days before the vote, both sides predict success .

"New York (CNN) -- You have heard of the seven-year itch in marriage. Now, the itch caused by bedbugs is causing relationships to come under even more pressure. New Yorkers say they have increasingly heard tales of couples breaking up because of the little creatures that have infested New York homes, stores and movie theaters. One man, interviewed randomly on the street, said he knew someone who broke up because of the bugs who like to hide in mattresses. He said that's ""because they were scared to death about bugs. She wouldn't date him because he had bedbugs, and she freaked out."" The fear of bedbugs is also heightening intimacy tensions. Stacie Handwerker, a real estate attorney, said, ""I was dating a guy, and he asked me do you have any bedbugs in [your] apartment? Because if you do, you won't be seeing me!"" The exterminators are on the front lines of the bedbug battles, and they have seen the casualties: romance. Timothy Wong, the technical director of M&M Environmental exterminators in lower Manhattan, said he has seen couples break up because of bedbugs. ""The girlfriend had them at home, and the boyfriend didn't stick by her, so it actually destroyed that relationship,"" he said. ""I got rid of the bedbugs, but I wasn't able to salvage the relationship, but I'm sure there were other problems before that,"" said Wong. The phones were ringing nonstop in his offices. Wong says the callers are usually the ones not getting bitten. Some of the callers blame their loved one, claiming they don't have any bites. Relationship and life coach Donna Barnes said bedbugs are a creepy aspect to dating right now. She advises not telling people on the first date you have bedbugs. She says that when the relationship is escalating, it's a good idea to inform the other person if you are bringing him or her into areas of potential exposure, Barnes said. She recalled a client who admitted having bedbugs. ""She was horrified, embarrassed and didn't want to tell anybody."" Barnes cautions ""if that's the case, you're better off to not date for a little while and clean out the problem first and then go out."" Handwerker, who was interviewed while out with friends at a bar, said ""what an age we live in where people now are vetting you out to see if you have bedbugs first. He didn't even ask me if I had any diseases. He doesn't want to be eaten by bedbugs."" Based on interviews, it appears women have more resistance to meeting a man who might have bedbugs. One woman said ""men and women are different. A woman would care if a guy had bedbugs but if a man met a hot girl, he probably wouldn't care if she had bedbugs."" A man at the bar confirmed this, admitting ""come back to my place"" would be his response to an attractive woman with bedbugs. There are no official figures regarding the effects of bedbugs on relationships in New York. Many New Yorkers questioned reported no contact with bedbugs or any relationship strains because of the fear. One woman said, ""I think there's enough excuses not to date someone in New York. ... Bedbugs doesn't need to be added to it.""","Bedbug infestation has added new wrinkle to New York City's dating scene .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- There are five days left until the opening day of the biggest sporting event India has ever put on. While there is a furious push to finish dozens of projects around the city to try to make it sparkle for the upcoming Commonwealth Games the plight of the smallest and poorest citizens of India go wholly ignored. Impoverished children are crawling all over many of the Commonwealth Games related construction sites. Some sit inches away from speeding cars on mounds of dirt, others walk under massive machinery, and some pick up the tools and bricks around them as their parent work a full day. ""This is happening all the time and people just turn a blind eye,"" said Save the Children Advocacy Director in India Shireen Miller. Miller says by law the children should not be on construction sites, while they are not normally paid by the contractors, the older children often end up doing work for free just to help their parents. ""It shouldn't be happening. Children should not be there unprotected, unsafe and working."" The contractors are supposed to create a safe place for the children near the sites. Child advocates say that rarely happens. Instead mother's hold small babies on their hips while carrying loads of dirt on the their heads, or they put them down on the site surrounded by the dust and danger construction can pose. ""Where can I leave them? mother Lal kumar said with her toddler on her hip. ""I bring them wherever I go."" The workers are normally from the poorest and most desperate parts of India. A subcontractor shows up in their villages and offers work in big cities like New Delhi. There is no work in their villages, so the entire family moves from place to place to sustain themselves. ""If there is poverty then the kids come themselves, if there is poverty then what else can we do. There is nothing in our village, so because of poverty, we're here."" Kuwar said. She has two young children who on this day were playing in the dirt and with the tools as cars buzz by and Kuwar plowed into the ground with a shovel. The scene is repeated on construction sites throughout the city, and by no means is this just on sites related to the Commonwealth Games. You see children playing, sleeping or sitting on everything from road construction sites to private home construction. When the child is old enough like 11-year-old Jitender you sometimes see them doing the work. We ask Jitender if he is being paid to pick up bricks on a huge construction area along side a busy New Delhi highway. ""No."" He said, ""I don't work here but I help my mother."" And in so doing the contractor gets free labor, the parents get a helping hand, and the child has something to do. But child advocates say this is one step toward child labor continues a cycle of poverty and is simply dangerous for children. ""What you see at constructions sites, all kinds of hazardous materials,"" activist and urban planner Dunu Roy said. ""We don't see too much of deaths but [we see] injuries, cuts and certain amounts of a disease like dengue [and] stomach borne infections."" However there are people trying to do something about the dangerous and illegal position children are being forced into. For decades an Indian organization called ""Mobile Creche"" has been convincing contractors to let them set up day care facilities for children on the construction sites. ""I would have kept them with me at work but it is not allowed. Now they have also started go to the school,"" a mother of four told CNN back in 2008 as she nursed her baby before heading back into Nehru Stadium to continuing laying bricks. Yet as a whole the police, government officials, and everyday citizens pass by the construction sites everyday and do nothing. Suraj Singh, a subcontractor on one site with a half dozen children on it told CNN, ""This is just how it is for the poor. What safety can there be for the poor? Tell us? There is no safety for the poor. This is life. These people don't have the money to leave their kids at home with servants, and work here."" Singh's reaction may seem callous but is too often true. Billions have been spent on beautifying the city because of the games. As it turns out the games have also exposed the world to one of India's ugly problems.","India is rushing to get ready for the Commonwealth Games .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Myanmar on Tuesday for a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade. Kim Aris arrived about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday at the international airport in Yangon, the former national capital, which also is known as Rangoon. Myanmar air force security officials escorted Aris, speeding his arrival without going through standard immigration. Suu Kyi, also escorted by security officials, was quickly able to greet her son. About 100 of her supporters were on hand for Aris's arrival from Bangkok, Thailand, where he had waited for weeks in limbo for a Myanmar visa. Mother and son left the airport together, bound for her home. It was not immediately clear how long Aris planned to stay in Myanmar. Aris last saw his Nobel Peace Laureate mother in 2000, when he spent about two weeks with her, according to one of her attorneys. Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison. Myanmar's military regime freed her days after holding the country's first elections in two decades, which critics worldwide dismissed as a sham. The junta's party declared a landslide victory. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party boycotted the November 7 elections, faulting the military junta. The regime had enacted a new law that forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. The NLD won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. This year, the generals refused to allow international monitors to oversee its elections and overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi has repeatedly challenged Myanmar's regime over the years. For her efforts, she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.","They'd been separated for a decade .

"(CNET) -- Apple likes glass. A lot. You can tell that much from its many retail stores, and in its products where glass is used in displays, notebook trackpads, and both the front and back of the iPhone 4. That last place, though is what might be causing the company some headaches. That's according to a report today from Gdgt, which says that slip-on cases -- the kind that cover the back and sometimes front of the iPhone 4, have been the cause of serious cosmetic damage with the backside of the iPhone. Dirt and other loose bits of debris from your pocket end up in that space. Over time, that can lead to a shattered backside as small scratches grow to become large cracks that travel across the back of the device, much like a ding on a windshield. This has become a big enough problem, the report says, that Apple's engineers have been hard at work in ""a quiet lockdown,"" testing various third-party cases to see how widespread the problem is, and presumably to make sure it does not happen with future iterations of the device. The news comes at an especially interesting time given the recent expiration of Apple's free iPhone 4 case program (which included Apple's no closed-back bumper), and the reported beginnings of mass production for a CDMA version of the iPhone said to be coming to Verizon in early 2011. If Apple is planning to bring any physical design changes to that version of the iPhone, a back that's susceptible to cracking could very well be holding up that process. This wouldn't be the first time cracks have cropped up on Apple's hardware, or the iPhone line for that matter. Both the Mac G4 Cube, which was introduced in 2000, and the iPhone 3G experienced reports from users that the outsides were developing ""hairline surface cracks."" Similar blemishes had appeared on white versions of the company's MacBook notebooks, which Apple reportedly began acknowledging and repairing early last year. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the wake of Hurricane Tomas, cholera has reached the congested capital of Port-au-Prince, where as many as 73 people have come down with the potentially deadly infection. Dehydration is one of its tell-tale signs. In a camp in Cabaret, just east of Port-au-Prince, children lie on cots as life-sustaining fluids are pumped intravenously into their bodies. The cholera outbreak in Haiti has now killed 583 people and another 9,123 people have been hospitalized, according to Gabriel Timothe, director general of Haiti's Ministry of Health. Medical personnel fear rising waters over the banks of Haiti's Arbonite River, which they say is a source of contamination, have increased the risk of a wider rate of infections. ""We're doing everything we can to mitigate [the] spread,"" Dr. Jon K. Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a press conference on Tuesday. Health officials had braced for problems after Tomas, fearing the hurricane that battered the Caribbean nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak. On Monday, Dr. Toni Eyssallenne of Hospital Bernard Mevs confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3-year-old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in Port-au-Prince. Two more cases were confirmed Tuesday by Eyssallenne. A 41-year-old woman who contracted the disease has not traveled in a year, the official said. A 33-year-old who lives in a tent city uses a communal water source. She, too, did not bring the infection into the city. Previous cases had been centered in Haiti's Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, including the city of St. Marc, north of the nation's capital. Until Monday, health officials said that those being treated for cholera in Port-au-Prince all contracted the disease elsewhere. The young Port-au-Prince boy lived in a tent city across the street from a place that sells macaroni, and he had not traveled in over a year, and he hadn't had any contact with people from St. Marc or the Artibonite region, Eyssallenne said. After suffering from nausea and diarrhea, the boy was treated and released from the hospital after his condition improved. Hurricane Tomas' trek past Haiti killed 20 people and injured another 36, a Communications Ministry official said Monday. Seven people were missing and 5,954 were homeless, the official said. Health officials fear that the water dumped by the storm will worsen the outbreak. The concern is that overflow from latrines and septic tanks could contaminate the supply of fresh drinking water and contribute to the spread of the bacteria. In the capital, the canals were not overflowing, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Andrea Koppel. But that was not the case in cities west of the capital, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Tomas, she said. Still, even Port-au-Prince looks and smells like a dump -- a caldron of water, garbage and human waste. ""We get used to it,"" said one resident. Ten months after a magnitude-7 earthquake laid waste to much of the nation, people compete with animals scavenging through the ubiquitous dumps for scraps of food. ""The quick solution is management,"" said Environment Minister Jean Marie Claude Germain. ""Management meaning that you have a structure in place, but the structure was not conceived with the slums in mind."" But most of the residents of Port-au-Prince live in slums. ""We're working on it,"" Germain said. ""We will work with the private sector."" CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this story.","NEW: Two more Port-au-Prince cases confirmed .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the Shanghai Masters after suffering a shock 6-1 3-6 6-3 defeat to Jurgen Melzer in the third round on Thursday. Nadal's serve was broken twice in the opening set against the Austrian, who is ranked 12th in the world and will now play Argentina's Juan Monaco in the quarterfinals. U.S. Open champion Nadal came into the tournament on the back of a title in Japan, having been upset in the semifinals in Thailand the week before. He now has a season record of 67 wins and nine defeats ahead of the Paris Masters and ATP Tour World Finals in London. ""I felt slow on court. I had more mistakes than usual,""  the 24-year-old Spaniard told reporters on Thursday. ""I played shorter than usual. [I was] a little bit more tired than usual, just physically and mentally."" Melzer has an outside chance of playing in both the singles and doubles at the season-ending event in London, which would make him the first player to do so since Spain's Emilio Sanchez in 1990. ""But it's a long way there. I'm almost 900 points off the eighth player. This is a very long way,"" the 1999 Wimbledon junior champion said. There are four places yet to be confirmed for the tournament, with Sweden's Robin Soderling, Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, Spain's David Ferrer and injured American Andy Roddick currently on course to claim the remaining berths. Third seed Roger Federer, who has already qualified for London, set up a quarterfinal clash with fifth seed Soderling after dispatching Andreas Seppi 6-3 6-4. The Swiss maestro faced several break-points in the opening set, but his Italian opponent was unable to take advantage and the 29-year-old progressed. Soderling reached the last eight on Thursday with a 7-5 6-4 win over 11th seed Ferrer. World No. 4 Andy Murray advanced with a 6-3 6-4 victory over French qualifier Jeremy Chardy, ensuring his place in the eight-man ATP Tour World Finals in the process. Murray will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals in Shanghai, after the French 12th seed beat Germany's Florian Mayer 7-5 6-3. ""It was a big match for me, because I knew I'd qualify for London if I won, the 23-year-old Murray told his official website. ""I thought it was very good. I served well when I needed to, when I was down break points at the start of the match. My second serve I varied a lot, because he was trying to run round and hit his forehand."" Second seed Novak Djokovic, who won the China Open in Beijing last week, is also into the last eight in Shanghai after a 6-1 6-1 triumph over France's Richard Gasquet. The world number two never looked threatened in the match, breaking Gasquet's serve on five occasions and hitting 25 winners. The Serbian will next face Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, Nadal's conqueror in Bangkok before winning the title. The in-form Spaniard dented world No. 7 Berdych's end-of-season hopes with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 win over the Wimbledon runner-up, but has lost all three previous encounters with Djokovic.","Rafael Nadal is beaten in the third round of the Shanghai Masters by Jurgen Melzer .

"Washington (CNN) -- Depending on who is talking, the Tea Party movement is either an extremist force dividing Republicans or a group of disgruntled taxpayers setting the government on a proper course. The conservative political force has shaken up this year's congressional elections, backing candidates who defeated Republican incumbents and other mainstream GOP candidates in primaries across the country. Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express -- the most organized and visible of the movement's factions -- told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that his group is a political action committee comprising members limited to donations of up to $5,000 with no corporate contributions allowed. ""We're the purest form of democracy, I think, in the Tea Party movement, in the sense that when we want to do something, we don't have any money to start with, we have to send an e-mail out to our people and say, 'Hey, we think Sharron Angle is going to be a great candidate in Nevada, and do you want to get behind her?' "" Russo said Sunday. The end result, he said, would be the election of candidates ""willing to stand up for more responsible fiscal policy in Washington."" ""We've turned the political system on its head,"" Russo said. ""And what's done that is that millions of Americans, who, many of them, had been sitting out the political process, have gotten involved in the campaigns."" However, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program that candidates such as Angle showed the negative impact of the Tea Party movement on the political right. Republican primary victories by Tea Party-backed nominees over mainstream contenders such as Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and nine-term Delaware Rep. Mike Castle end up giving Democratic contenders a chance to win previously out-of-reach races in November, he said. ""When the Tea Party becomes the gatekeeper of a Republican primary, we end up with contests we never dreamed of,"" Durbin said. ""Who would have guessed that today we would be taking an honest look at Alaska, Delaware, and Kentucky, where we clearly have races where the Democrats can win?"" Durbin also cited Florida, where Republican Marco Rubio's Senate candidacy with Tea Party support caused Gov. Charlie Crist to wage an independent campaign, throwing the race into what Durbin called ""turmoil."" ""I think that shows the Tea Party position is too extreme for most voters, and I think we're going to do well in those states,"" Durbin said. ""People have to ask themselves, is this what we really want in the United States Senate?"" Rubio, interviewed on the CBS program, said he and the Tea Party movement reflected the ""sentiment in mainstream America that Washington is broken."" ""We don't want to change America,"" he said in reference to President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign theme and agenda. ""We want to fix things that are wrong in America."" He advocated bedrock conservative positions, including a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, banning congressional earmarks and imposing term limits on Congress members. However, his stance was more moderate on an issue important to the crucial senior citizen population in Florida -- reforming Social Security to ensure its future solvency. Rubio said benefits for current retirees or those close to retirement should remain fixed, and the system must survive for the younger and future generations without bankrupting the country. ""We're going to have to accept there are going to be some changes,"" he said, mentioning a possible future increase in the retirement age for eligibility. Also on the program, another Tea Party-backed nominee -- Colorado Republican Senate candidate Ken Buck -- expressed similar conservative credentials. ""I see myself as part of a group of candidates who have been elected in this country because of frustration with what's happening in Washington, D.C.,"" Buck said. ""We're going there not to be part of the establishment, not to be part of what we consider the problem in Washington, D.C., but to get there and to reduce spending, to promote ideas like a balanced-budget amendment and term limits and ideas that have been talked about for a while,"" he said. The Tea Party-backed candidates interviewed Sunday made no mention of the ""Pledge to America"" document released last week by House Republicans as a proposal for how they would govern if in power. Democrats criticized the economic-focused program that includes reduced spending, lower taxes and other bedrock GOP positions as a rehash of failed past policies. In an editorial Saturday, the New York Times called the document ""a bid to co-opt the Tea Party by a Republican leadership that wants to sound insurrectionist but is the same old Washington elite."" ""Not only are the players the same, the policies are the same,"" the editorial said. ""Just more tax cuts for the rich and more deficit spending. We find it hard to believe that even the most disaffected voters will be taken in."" Conservative Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" that the ""Pledge to America"" represented a return to Republican roots. ""Republicans didn't just lose our majority in 2006, we lost our way,"" Pence said. ""We walked away from the principles of fiscal discipline and reform that minted our governing majority back in 1980 and again in 1994. And the American people walked away from us."" Conceding that the proposals in the document are ""not necessarily new,"" Pence said it represented a commitment to ""important first steps in this Congress to steer our national government back to"" basic principles and practices.","Sunday talk shows offer varying views of Tea Party movement .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Christian Pakistani woman sentenced to death for blasphemy is innocent and should be released, Pakistan's minister for minority affairs told CNN. Shahbaz Bhatti reached his conclusion after a three-day investigation into allegations that Asia Bibi defiled the name of the Prophet Mohammed during an argument last year with  Muslim fellow field workers. Bhatti said he personally submitted his finding to President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday and recommended that Bibi be freed. ""This case was filed on the basis of religious and personal enmity,"" Bhatti said. Despite the minister's recommendation, it is still not clear if or when Bibi will be pardoned by the president. Zardari asked Bhatti to propose names for a committee of scholars and experts who would recommend reforms ""to effectively prevent the misuse of the blasphemy law for personal and political reasons."" On Wednesday, a presidential spokesman and spokeswoman told CNN that Zardari will pardon Bibi only if necessary and after the legal process has taken its course. Bibi has appealed her conviction and death sentence, a process that could take months. Bhatti said he has advised Bibi's lawyer to file a petition for the court to rule on her appeal as soon as possible. He also said the president has called on authorities to provide added security for Bibi while she is in prison and when she's released. Bibi's husband told CNN his family received death threats soon after his wife's case made headlines.","NEW: President calls for panel of scholars and experts to review blasphemy law .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is putting the final touches on a security assistance package totaling as much as $2 billion over five years to help Pakistan fight extremists on its border with Afghanistan, senior U.S. officials and diplomatic sources tell CNN. The aid is expected to be announced later this week when Pakistani officials are in Washington to hold high-level talks. The package aims to address Pakistan's insistence it does not have the capability to go after terrorists, and needs more support from the United States, the sources said. The aid will help the Pakistanis purchase helicopters, weapons systems and equipment to intercept communications. It falls under the United States' Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, which provides grants and loans to countries to purchase weapons and defense equipment produced in the United States. It also includes more counterinsurgency assistance to Pakistani troops and a program allowing members of the Pakistani military to study at American war colleges. The $2 billion package is on top of billions of dollars the United States already gives Pakistan in military aid and a $7.5 billion aid package over five years in non-military counter-terrorism assistance approved by Congress last year. ""They key is to beef up their ability to go after militants, it can't be diverted to other threats,"" one senior U.S. official said. Pakistan has long claimed its military is geared toward defending itself against threats from countries like India, and does not have the kind of equipment it needs to fight insurgents. U.S. officials said they recognize Pakistan's current military hardware is not perfectly suited toward such operations, but made clear the new aid must be directed toward fighting extremists, rather than India . ""We recognize they need different kinds of capacities and more of them to handle extremists form within their own border,"" one official said. ""They do need more capacity and the kinds of capabilities that are geared toward fighting extremists, rather than a major land conflict."" U.S. officials acknowledge the Pakistani military is stretched thin since this summer's devastating floods, and has had to divert resources from the fight against extremists to conduct relief efforts. They hope the new security assistance will address the military's resource limitations so they can redouble efforts to go after militants. ""There is an expectation with that capacity comes a greater effort,"" a senior official said. The aid comes on the heels of a White House report sent to Congress earlier this month which uses unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the Taliban and al Qaeda, despite repeated Obama administration claims in public that Pakistan is working hard to crack down on militants . The White House assessment, obtained by CNN, is particularly tough on Pakistan's inability to make gains in South Waziristan, where many analysts believe key al Qaeda leaders have gained a safe haven to use as a base to plot terror attacks against Western targets. The report notes that from March to June, the Pakistani military ""continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with Afghan Taliban or [al Qaeda] forces in North Waziristan. This is as much a political choice as it is a reflection of an under-resourced military prioritizing its targets."" ""The capacity issue is very real,"" another senior official said. ""It's not like they could just go into North Waziristan if they wanted to and succeed. There is an issue of political will but the capacity issue remains extremely important."" The official said the multi-year assistance package is designed to provide the Pakistanis with ""an issue of predictability and consistency"" in U.S. military assistance, which has typically been done on a year-to-year basis. Pakistan has long voiced concerns the United States is not going to remain engaged with the region over the long term. ""We need to demonstrate we are in it for more than six months to a year. This offers a time horizon and allows them to chill out about that,"" the official said. Even with the harsh White House report, U.S. officials do acknowledge that Pakistan has made some progress in combating terrorism, noting the country has suffered thousands of casualties as a result of its campaign against extremists in its tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. Suspected U.S. drone strikes have also increased in Pakistan, killing dozens of high-level militants in the tribal areas. Although the U.S. does not comment on drone strikes, Pakistani officials have said they could not be done without Pakistani cooperation. While in Pakistan in July, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Pakistani government has become ""very serious"" about fighting the violent extremist organizations within its borders. At the time, Clinton alluded to the security assistance being announced this week, while telling reporters the United States was ""working on a multi-year package with the Pakistanis."" Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Pakistan's military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, are leading a Pakistani delegation arriving Tuesday for the U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue, three days of meetings starting Wednesday with Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The talks address all facets of the relationship between Washington and Islamabad, but counterterrorism cooperation will be a major aspect of the talks. ""Pakistan has taken aggressive action within its borders. But clearly, this is an ongoing threat and more needs to be done,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday. ""That will be among the issues talked about.""","The aid package could total as much as $2 billion .

"(CNN) -- More than seven months after the death of a luger practicing for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the Coroners Service of British Columbia has ruled Nodar Kumaritashvili's death an accident caused by multiple blunt force injuries. Kumaritashvili, a 21-year-old from the republic of Georgia, died when his body went airborne and slammed into a metal post at about 90 mph (144 kph )during a training run shortly before the Olympics officially opened. The coroner's report, written by Tom Pawlowski, said Kumaritashvili's injuries ""proved immediately fatal."" There had been concerns from athletes about the speed of the record-setting track at the Whistler Sliding Center, according to a Georgian official. ""There were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident,"" Nikolas Rurua, Georgia's deputy minister for culture and sports, said in February. Rurua added that there had been several crashes in the same area. When the official luge competition started, male and female racers started from lower points on the luge track, which led to slower speeds. Pawlowski's report acknowledges concerns about the design of the track. ""Following Mr. Kumaritashvili's fatal incident, questions arose regarding athlete safety at the Whistler track and more specifically, the design of the track and the unprecedented high speeds attained at this venue, such as the record speed of 153.98 km/h [about 95.68 mph]."" Given the high speeds at the track, the International Luge Federation (FIL) asked the sliding center for more training days prior to the Olympics and required athletes to make numerous practice runs from various, lower parts of the course before graduating to the top of the course. ""A number of crashes were observed (68 crashes in 2,482 runs), but the FIL Technical Delegate also noted in his report that nobody was badly hurt,"" during a training week in Whistler, the coroner's report states. Pawlowski's report states that an FIL official sent a letter to the track designer expressing surprise over the speeds and said the designer's calculations of top speeds were incorrect. Kumaritashvili completed required training runs, the report states. But Pawlowski added, ""the relative lack of experience Mr. Kumaritashvili had on this challenging track set a backdrop for the incident and it was a significant disadvantage, as far as safety was concerned, for the athlete entering the high pressure environment of the Olympic Games."" The coroner's report recommends the two international federations over sliding sports -- which include bobsledding and luging -- conduct reviews about their involvement into track design and construction. Pawlowski said ""further and greater scrutiny of safety issues at the track is advisable."" ""It may be that risk can never be fully eliminated from the realm of sliding sports,"" the report added. Journalist Eka Kadagishvili contributed to this report.","Kumaritashvili died during a practice run for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Atlantic bluefin tuna will not be added to a list of banned exports, following a vote on Thursday afternoon in Doha, Qatar. The vote was held among the 115-member nations who have signed the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species. The popular sushi staple has been the focus of international attention as East Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the fish have decreased by an estimated nearly 61 percent in the last decade, according to International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the inter-governmental group that manages tuna fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. The proposal to ban export of bluefin tuna was defeated by an outright majority, according to John Donaldson, the chairman of the committee tasked with hearing the proposal. The proposal, originally raised by Monaco, aimed to reduce the overall harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna. ICCAT has been the target of criticism for what many see as lax enforcement of its own limits. The proposal by Monaco noted that, in 2007, an ""independent review of ICCAT,"" conducted by reviewers that ICCAT appointed concluded that ""ICCAT contracting parties' performance in managing fisheries on bluefin tuna particularly in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is widely regarded as an international disgrace."" Monaco's proposal noted that, on ICCAT's watch in 2007, over 32,000 tons of bluefin tuna were exported to Japan alone. The total allowable catch for that year for the whole of the Atlantic Ocean was just 29,500 tons.","East Atlantic, Mediterranean stocks down by nearly 61 percent in the last decade .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Hilton hotel chain has reached an agreement with the federal government to make changes in about 900 hotels nationwide to further accommodate guests and visitors with disabilities, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. The agreement covers the Hilton hotels built since passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1993. It includes making changes to Hilton-owned hotels under a variety of trade names including the Waldorf Astoria, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, Doubletree and Homewood Suites. Government lawyers had alleged Hilton failed to provide an adequate number of accessible rooms, failed to disperse accessible rooms among the various categories of available accommodations and failed to provide individuals with disabilities the ability to reserve accessible rooms through its reservation system. The allegations also claimed Hilton facilities had failed at times to provide individuals with disabilities the accessible sleeping accommodations that they had reserved. The Americans With Disabilities Act ""protects the right of people with disabilities to stay in accessible hotel rooms, and to reserve those hotel rooms through the same convenient systems as everyone else,"" Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez said in a statement. The Justice Department stressed that Hilton had cooperated throughout the investigation. In a statement released by the corporation, its top executive promised to take steps to enhance accessibility ""at hotels with the Hilton Worldwide network, on its websites, and through its reservation system."" ""Hilton Worldwide is pleased to take further steps to provide our guests with disabilities the accessibility in accommodations they expect from an industry leader,"" said Christopher Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton Worldwide.","U.S. Justice Department announces the agreement .

"(CNN) -- Leslie Nielsen, whose longtime career as a dramatic actor took a sudden turn into comedy with spoofs like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" has died at age 84, his family said Sunday. The Canadian-born Nielsen's career reached back into the early days of television, when he made frequent appearances on live drama series like ""Goodyear Playhouse."" He played the earnest starship captain in the 1956 science fiction classic ""Forbidden Planet"" and made regular appearances on a wide range of TV dramas into the 1970s. Much of that changed in 1980, when he was cast as a doctor aboard an endangered jetliner in the gag-a-minute disaster-movie parody ""Airplane!"" Nielsen's deadpan delivery of lines like ""I am serious -- and don't call me Shirley"" helped launch a second career. The film's producers went on to cast him in their short-lived television series ""Police Squad!"" and had him reprise that show's bumbling lead character, Lt. Frank Drebin, a decade later in three ""Naked Gun"" movies. Nielsen appeared in several similar but less-acclaimed spoofs following those films.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's financial state was thrown into stark relief on Thursday after the English club's American owners revealed a record loss of $137 million despite making an unprecedented operating profit of $160 million. The disparity of figures is largely caused by interest payments of $67 million and a one-off cost of $107 million relating to the Premier League outfit's bond scheme, launched in January to help restructure the debts accrued by the Glazer family in purchasing the 18-time English champions in 2005. The club produced a record turnover of $455 million for the year ended June 2010, more than double that of local rivals Manchester City, but suffered a big swing from last year's profit of $77 million -- which was largely due to the world-record $130 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. However, United chief executive David Gill insisted that the Glazers were not in the same position as fellow Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett, who have been forced to sell Liverpool due to debts incurred in buying the now ailing five-time European champions. ""We are not a club that needs to sell. We have money in the bank so there is zero pressure on that, no pressure at all to sell any star player whether it is Wayne Rooney or X, Y or Z. I can categorically say that,"" Gill told the UK Press Association. ""There was no desire at all from anyone at the club to sell Cristiano -- he wanted to go, and as a result we managed to extract a world-record fee. The philosophy is to retain and attract the best players. We have £165 million (£260 million) in the bank, but in some ways we would prefer to have £80 million in the bank and Ronaldo on the pitch."" Giggs targets third European crown . Gill was heartened by figures such as those showing that the club has the lowest wages-turnover ratio in the Premier League of 46%, despite player salaries rising from $195 million to $210 million. By comparison, Premier League champions Chelsea's wage bill was last reported at $226 million, Manchester City's is $212 million and Arsenal's $175 million. ""There are very good results for the club with records here, there and everywhere but they are complicated with non-cash items and exceptional one-off hits,"" Gill said. ""The United fans should not be concerned. We have a long-term financing structure in place, excellent revenues that are growing, we are controlling our costs and we can afford the interest on our long-term finance. ""In our opinion, if something changed in the ownership, this club will survive and continue -- it is covering the financing cost more than adequately. We still have cash to invest in players and to give good contracts to players, and we are comfortable with the business model."" While United's overall debt has risen to $830 million, the accounts revealed that the Glazers did not take out any money from the club to service their high-interest payment-in-kind loans of $318 million. United's media revenues rose to $167 million but match-day income fell to $160 million, reflecting moves by supporters' clubs to undermine the Glazers by boycotting games. The Premier League on Friday confirmed that Liverpool's prospective new owners, New England Sports Ventures, have passed the ruling body's criteria. However, NESV -- who own the Boston Red Sox baseball team -- face a court battle with Hicks and Gillett, who are trying to block the sale agreed by Liverpool's board this week. Meanwhile, veteran Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has denied reports claiming that he has decided to retire at the end of this season. ""That's complete nonsense. I don't yet know whether I will stop or continue after this season. Only in the course of this season will I think about it. Then I will decide and not before. For now I keep my focus on United,"" the 39-year-old Dutchman told website www.sport-promotion.nl.","Man Utd's owners make record loss of $137 million despite operating profit of $160 million .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal fought back from going two goals behind to draw 2-2 at home to holders Barcelona in a classic Champions League quarterfinal that more than lived up to all its expectations. Barcelona tore into their opponents in the opening 20 minutes, with only goalkeeper Manuel Almunia standing in their way. On at least three occasions, Spaniard Almunia stopped his compatriots with world class saves, preventing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Lionel Messi and Pedro from getting on the scoresheet. That enabled Arsenal to go into half-time on level terms, but that was to end just 30 seconds after the break when a long ball caught out the home defence and with Almunia coming, and failing, to get the ball, Ibrahimovic coolly lobbed the ball home. And the Swedish striker doubled that advantage 13 minutes later when another long pass caught Arsenal square, allowing the former Inter Milan striker to fire home from an acute angle. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger decided to bring on winger Theo Walcott, and the England international went on to change the game with his stunning pace. Just 10 minutes after going 2-0 behind, Walcott cut inside from the right wing, after being put through by Nicklas Bendtner, before sliding the ball past visiting goalkeeper Victor Valdes to bring Arsenal back into the game. Then, with the clock showing five minutes left to play, a superb Arsenal move resulted in captain Cesc Fabregas being bundled over by his opposite number Carlos Puyol in the penalty area. Puyol was sent off for the challenge, which deprived Fabregas of a goal-scoring opportunity, and the Arsenal No.4 dusted himself down to fire home the resulting spot-kick against the club where he started his career and is constantly being linked with regarding a possible return to the Nou Camp. Fabregas, who was rated only 50-50 to play in the match because of a knee injury, finished the match limping heavily but a yellow card he picked up in the first half means he will miss the return leg regardless of whether he is fit or not. A thrilling encounter also saw Arsenal lose both William Gallas and Andrey Arshavin through injuries, while Barca defender Gerard Pique also collected a booking which means he joins Puyol and Fabregas in missing the Nou Camp clash. Meanwhile, former Arsenal hero Thierry Henry, who is the Gunners' record goal scorer after eight sensational years with the club, was given a heroes reception by the home fans for his first return since leaving London for Barcelona in 1997. Although happy with the draw, Wenger was annoyed with the manner that the two goals were conceded. He told ITV Sport: ""We had a difficult start and Barcelona could have scored two or three goals in the opening 20 minutes when we lost the ball too cheaply. ""But my players kept going and both sides missed chances. We played against a great side tonight but gave away two very cheap goals which is really beyond my understanding."" The winners of the tie will face either Inter Milan or CSKA Moscow in the semifinals and Italian champions Inter hold a slender advantage after winning the first leg 1-0 at the San Siro. A largely disappointing match was settled in the 65th minute when Wesley Sneijder found Diego Milito, and the Argentine striker found the bottom corner of the net with a shot from the edge of the area.","Arsenal fight back to earn a 2-2 home draw with Barcelona after going 2-0 down .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona left it late before struggling to a 2-1 victory at home to Malaga on Saturday night that restored the defending Spanish champions to the top of the table. Rivals Real Madrid had climbed to the summit with a 5-1 thrashing of Tenerife earlier in the evening, but the Catalan giants ended round 24 two points clear thanks to a late winner from world player of the year Lionel Messi. The Argentina forward slotted home from close range in the 84th minute after a superb diagonal pass from Xavi allowed fullback Daniel Alves to provide a precise low cross. Mid-table Malaga had surprisingly equalized three minutes earlier through substitute Valmiro Valdo as the home side looked like paying for failing to turn their dominance of possession into a handsome lead. The former Real Madrid player netted coolly on the counterattack after a neat one-two at the halfway line sent him clear of the Barca defense. Pep Guardiola's team had needed 69 minutes to break the deadlock as striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic headed over from Messi's delicate chip and then the midweek savior had another effort cleared off the line by defender Weligton. Young winner Pedro Rodriguez finally settled the home fans' nerves when he cut in from the left and curled a right-foot effort in at the near post for his seventh league goal this season. It was morale-boosting win for Guardiola after his team needed to come from behind to draw 1-1 with Stuttgart in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Germany on Tuesday. Real Madrid, beaten by Lyon in the Champions League the week before that, followed up last Sunday's 6-2 thrashing of Villarreal with another goal frenzy on the island of Tenerife. Gonzalo Higuain netted the first two, set up Kaka for the third and also hit the bar in a win that slightly flattered Manuel Pellegrini's team. Higuain broke the deadlock in the 29th minute and was set free by Marcelo for the second three minutes before halftime, then Tenerife scored a controversial goal a minute after the restart when Ayoze Garcia appeared to head the ball out of the hands of goalkeeper Iker Casillas and into the net. But Brazil star Kaka ran onto Higuain's clever pass to restore Real's two-goal lead two minutes later, then the Argentine lobbed a shot onto the Tenerife crossbar. Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1 from the penalty spot with 11 minutes to play after Rafael Van der Vaart's cross hit the hand of unlucky defender Ezequiel Luna. Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart also laid on the fifth goal in the second minute of time added on as substitute Raul netted the 322nd goal of his long career. In Sunday's games, third-placed Valencia travel to Atletico Madrid and fourth-placed Sevilla host Athletic Bilbao. In Germany, leaders Bayer Leverkusen set a new Bundesliga record of 24 matches undefeated following Saturday's frustrating 0-0 draw at home to Rhine rivals Cologne. Leverkusen moved one point clear of Bayern Munich, who can take top spot with victory at home to fourth-placed Hamburg on Sunday. Werder Bremen maintained sixth place with a 2-1 win at Mainz, Stuttgart beat Eintracht Frankfurt by the same score thanks to a first-half double from Cacau and Hoffenheim won 2-0 at bottom club Hertha Berlin. In Italy, 10th-placed Fiorentina snatched a 1-1 draw at struggling Lazio as on-loan striker Keirrison scored his first goal in Serie A in time added on to cancel out Sebastiano Siviglia's seventh-minute opener. Catania moved above Lazio into 15th place with a 4-0 victory at home to Bari, who stayed in 12th.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona hope to welcome back Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta to their depleted team for Tuesday's second leg of the European Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal. The influential Iniesta missed last week's 2-2 draw in London with a hamstring injury, but has been named in the titleholders' 19-man squad after receiving medical clearance. ""He has got better over the last few days. It will depend a lot on how he feels after training this evening and tomorrow morning"" coach Pep Guardiola told Barcelona's Web site on Monday. However, Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who scored both goals in England -- misses out after suffering a calf injury in the warm-up before Saturday's 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Teenager Bojan Krkic, who scored two goals after stepping up in that match, will compete for a starting place alongside Lionel Messi with former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry.

Barcelona blew a two-goal lead in the first leg despite dominating the first hour, and Guardiola said his team had to focus on the game and not be distracted by Saturday's showdown with Spanish title rivals Real Madrid. ""Making it through this round or not will decide everything,"" he said. ""So we have to stay alive in the Champions League in order to be optimistic about the eight league matches we have left.

Arsenal have suffered another injury blow with midfielder Alex Song ruled out with a knee problem, joining captain Cesc Fabregas, France defender William Gallas and Russia forward Andrei Arshavin on the sidelines. Cameroon international Song was substituted during Saturday's Premier League win over Wolverhampton due to a groin worry, but a scan on his knee has revealed cartilage damage. Song had filled in for Gallas in central defense against Barcelona, but was caught out for both of Ibrahimovic's goals. Manager Arsene Wenger said he was unsure whether veteran Sol Campbell would partner Thomas Vermaelen in Song's place, as the former England international was struggling to recover from his weekend exertions. ""That is a decision I have to make after speaking to him tomorrow,"" he told Arsenal's Web site on Monday. ""Today he was still not completely available although he managed to get a warm-up. ""To go into such a game you must be completely fit or not play at all."" Whichever team progresses to the last four will face a semifinal against either Italian champions Inter Milan or Russia's CSKA Moscow. Jose Mourinho's Inter team hold a slender 1-0 lead going into the second leg on Tuesday, which will be played on CSKA's artificial pitch. Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder may miss the match after injuring an ankle in training on Monday, while goalkeeper Julio Cesar and center-back Ivan Cordoba also face late fitness tests after picking up knocks in Saturday's 3-0 win over Bologna. CSKA, seeking to become the first Russian team to reach the semifinals of Europe's premier club competition since Moscow rivals Spartak in 1991, will be without the services of suspended midfielders Evgeni Aldonin and Milos Krasic. ""The most important thing is the result. If we qualify without playing spectacular football, I am sure everyone at the club will be happy,"" coach Leonid Slutsky told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Champions League holders Barcelona survived a scare in Germany on Tuesday evening as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's second-half equalizer earned them a 1-1 last 16 first leg draw against Stuttgart. The Catalan giants failed to produce the free-flowing football that has become their trademark under coach Pep Guardiola and they fell behind in the 25th minute. Stuttgart had warmed up for the match by hitting five goals past Cologne at the weekend, with striker Cacau helping himself to four of them. And the Brazilian-born forward maintained that form by opening the scoring here, powerfully heading home Timo Gebhart's cross. The home side had chances to double their lead before the break, with only goalkeeper Victor Valdes depriving Cacau of a second -- although Lionel Messi did strike the post with a long-range effort for the visitors. However, Barca regrouped after the break and levelled just seven minutes into the second period, when Swedish striker Ibrahimovic was on hand to finish from Gerard Pique's nod down. The result means Barcelona will be strong favorites to reach the quarterfinals when the teams meet again at the Nou Camp in a fortnight's time. Meanwhile, in the night's other match, Bordeaux look well set to reach the quarterfinals after a narrow 1-0 victory against Olympiacos in Athens. Laurent Blanc's side are unbeaten in the competition this season and look genuine contenders to win the trophy after Michael Ciani nodded home Yoann's Gourcouff's free-kick from close range on the stroke of half time. In the only Europa League match played in Tuesday, Portuguese giants Benfica cruised into the last 16 after thrashing Hertha Berlin 4-0 for a 5-1 aggregate victory.

"(CNN) -- Teenager Bojan Krkic scored twice as Barcelona overcame the pre-match loss of key striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to defeat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 on Saturday night and move three points clear in Spain. Ibrahimovic scored both goals in the Spanish champions' 2-2 draw with Arsenal in midweek, but is now ruled out of the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal at home to the English club after picking up a calf injury in the warmup, according to the UK Press Association. The 19-year-old Bojan stepped up for just his third league start this season in a much-changed Barca line-up, and staked his claim for a place on Tuesday with an assured performance. It is a big week ahead for the European champions, who face second-placed Real Madrid in a key clash next Saturday which will have a massive bearing on who wins the La Liga title. Real can return to the top on goal difference ahead of that match by winning by two scores at Racing Santander on Sunday. Barca coach Josep Guardiola made several changes against sixth-placed Bilbao, and ended the match with eight youth-team products on the pitch after midfielder Yaya Toure went off injured. Winger Jeffren celebrated his call into the senior team with the 26th-minute opening goal as the 22-year-old netted his first league goal of the season from Eric Abidal's cross after Lionel Messi sent the recalled France fullback free down the left. Bojan made it 2-0 five minutes before halftime after captain Carles Puyol -- playing at right-back in the absence of the suspended Daniel Alves -- intercepted a stray pass and picked out the young forward, who has played once for Spain despite having a Serbian father. He doubled his tally just before the hour mark with a fierce right-foot shot after Abidal again provided the ammunition, while Messi made up for an uncharacteristic first-half miss from close range when he netted from Pedro's 67th-minute cross. It was the Argentina forward's 26th league goal of the season and his 35th overall. Bilbao pulled a goal back through Markel Susaeta, and goalkeeper Victor Valdes twice denied Ander Iturraspe to prevent a repeat of the lapse that saw Barca blow a two-goal lead against Arsenal. Managerless Sevilla claimed fourth place with a 3-0 victory over lowly Tenerife in Saturday's late match, with strikers Fredi Kanoute and Luis Fabiano netting in the first half before Jose Carlos curled in an 87th-minute free-kick. Mallorca can go back ahead of Sevilla with a draw against Almeria on Sunday, while victory would lift the islanders two points clear. Tenerife were left third from bottom and deep in relegation trouble, seven points behind closest team Santander. Real Zaragoza moved seven points clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 victory at home to Malaga, moving one place above their opponents. Zaragoza followed up last weekend's 3-0 upset of third-placed Valencia as Argentine midfielder Leonardo Ponzio smashed in the opening goal just before halftime and Chile striker Humberto Suazo sealed victory with a volley from Javier Arizmendi's header with 14 minutes to play.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic ruled out of Barcelona's Champions League clash with Arsenal .

The man was identified as Stuart Haverty, 23, of Chicago, and an autopsy Monday concluded that the cause of his death was multiple injuries from a fall, the spokeswoman said. Haverty fell from the upper level of the Bears' Soldier Field to the ground outside the stadium, police said. The incident happened around 5 p.m. Sunday while the Bears were playing the Philadelphia Eagles, said Veejay Zala of the Chicago Police Department. Haverty was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 5:27 p.m. The incident marked the second such deadly fall during a pro sports game in as many weeks. Last week, a 2-year-old boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The boy fell at the conclusion of a National Basketball Association game and later died at the hospital.

"London, England (CNN) -- British police questioned four members of the Pakistani national cricket team after allegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a match against England, the manager of the Pakistani team said Sunday. They arrested a different man in connection with the allegations late Saturday. The investigation comes after a British tabloid newspaper reported that two Pakistani players deliberately bowled ""no balls"" -- a foul -- while playing against England in London last week. A ""no ball"" is when the bowler -- the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball -- steps over the line as he throws the ball. The batting team gets a run when that happens. A chance lost for Pakistan's cricketers? The British tabloid News of the World posted what it said was a video of an undercover reporter meeting with a man identified as Mazhar Majeed, who tells the reporter exactly which bowlers would bowl ""no balls"" and when, then lays out 14 thick stacks of bills on a table. The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would. The tabloid also says the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 British pounds (U.S. $232,800) in the scam. London's Metropolitan Police said a 35-year-old man was arrested late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. A source familiar with the investigation named him as Mazhar Majeed. Without identifying the suspect by name, London police said Sunday in a brief statement that the 35-year-old man was released on bail ""until a date in the future."" No date for a hearing or further proceedings was given in the statement. No players or team officials have been arrested, the International Cricket Council said Sunday. But police questioned team captain Salman Butt, manager Yawar Saeed and two other players, Saeed told reporters Sunday. He did not name the other two players at the news conference, but Britain's Press Association earlier reported that he had said they were bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asaf. Police refused to confirm to CNN who was being questioned. Team captain Butt said Pakistan gave 100 percent throughout a match. ""We have given our best,"" Butt said after his team lost to England. The team manager refused to comment on the report that Pakistani players intentionally committed three fouls during the . match. ""No allegations are true until they are proved either way,"" said Saeed. ""So that this point in time they are just allegations. Let's wait until the case is complete."" England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's cricket ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday. He directed the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board to submit a preliminary report ""immediately,"" Farhatullah Babar said, adding that Zardari asked to be kept informed about any British investigations as well. Sam Peters, News of the World's cricket correspondent, told CNN that the tabloid did not ""drive these events ... These events were going to happen regardless of whether the News of the World was involved."" But, he said, staffers believed the story was in the public interest. ""It's a legitimate story to get to the bottom of something that's been plaguing our sport,"" he said. ""... It's swirled around, and the innuendo's been there."" ""People need to know this is going on,"" he said, ""what they're watching when they're paying money to go to sports events ... it's not always what they believe it to be."" However, Shakil Shaikh, president of the Islamabad Regional Cricket Association, told CNN that while he is ""shocked"" at the news, ""no proof has been given of the involvement of these players in the match-fixing issue"" and he has seen no concrete evidence against the cricketers. He said if evidence does surface, an investigation will be launched. It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year. The International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit was set up in response to allegations against the captains of Pakistan, India and South Africa in 2000. All three were banned from the game for life. News of the World does not allege that gamblers fixed the results of the match -- only that specific moments in the match were fixed, a practice known as ""spot-fixing"" rather than ""match-fixing."" Betting on cricket matches is legal in England. International and local cricket officials will not be issuing further comment ""as this is now subject to a police investigation,"" the council said in a statement. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN the arrest came in response to information provided by the newspaper. Andrew Miller, a cricket expert and the U.K. editor for ESPN's Cricket website, told CNN on Sunday morning that since a major scandal involving match fixing between India and South Africa in 2000, things appear not to have changed much. ""What we're discovering is that corruption has never gone away,"" Miller said via telephone from London. ""It's resurfacing this year -- during the 10th anniversary of the biggest scandal ever to hit cricket."" Miller said though it remains to be proven, it appears this newest scandal could be on par with the scandal from 10 years ago. He added that cricket's many aspects of play and rules make it susceptible to betting. And in a five-day test match, such as the one under way between Pakistan and England at the Lord's cricket ground, there are a lot of possibilities for placing bets that players can manipulate. ""If you were going to invent a game that you could corrupt -- it would be cricket because you can bet on every aspect of the game,"" he continued. For example, there are up to 2,700 deliveries per game and if a gambler were to plop down $10,000 on the 827th delivery, predicting it correctly, the payoff for that particular bet could be handsome. ""We believe this is really huge, and could be affecting other areas of cricket,"" Peters said. The News of the World report was co-authored by Mazher Mahmood, a controversial figure in British journalism who has exposed several previous scams. He was responsible for a report in May that revealed Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson offered to sell access to her former husband, Prince Andrew. According to the UK Press Association, the tabloid's reporters were able to gain access to the alleged ring by posing as ""Far Eastern businessmen."" CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Phil Black, Caroline Paterson, Bharati Naik, Les Neuhaus and Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.","NEW: London police say man arrested in case is released on bail .

"(CNN) -- News that Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested as a suspected terrorist came as a shock to the woman who lived across the street from him and his family until about a year ago. Stephanie Napier played cards with Mohamud's mother, Myriam, and Mohamud's sister, Mona, walked Napier's youngest son to school. Napier's son Tyler played basketball with the 19-year-old accused of planning to detonate a vehicle bomb outside a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. Napier said Monday that Mohamud was a ""quiet kid"" who came from a ""normal middle-class family,"" not the man a federal grand jury now has charged with plotting to blow up the Friday night ceremony. ""I think that's why it's so shocking,"" said Napier, whose son woke her up in the middle of the night with news of her former neighbor's arrest. The news came just hours after her husband, a staff sergeant with the Army Reserve, left on his second tour of duty in the Middle East. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia, pleaded not guilty Monday to a single count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. A federal grand jury in Portland indicted him on that charge shortly before his Monday afternoon court appearance, and he could face life in prison if convicted. About 100 people, including several members of the area's Somali-American community, packed the small hearing room and the hallway outside. Mohamud did not acknowledge them during the hearing. The Oregon State University student was arrested Friday after he attempted to detonate what he believed was an explosives-laden van parked near a tree-lighting ceremony in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square, law enforcement officials said. But the bomb was fake, thanks to an undercover operation designed to undermine the plotter, and officials said the public was never in danger from the mock device. Mohamud's lawyer, Stephen Sady, said government agents entrapped his client into the plot, ""grooming"" him as a potential bomber and providing him with money and transportation to support the plot. ""The government used the complaint as a press release, timed for maximum publicity and impact,"" Sady said. The Justice Department has said Mohamud's arrest came after a long-term undercover operation during, which the teen had been monitored closely. Dwight Holton, the U.S. attorney in Portland, said Mohamud's own actions dictated the timing of his arrest and ""led him here today."" ""It's what the defendant did that created the timing,"" Holton said. U.S. Magistrate John Acosta set a February 1 trial date for the suspect, who wore a light-colored shirt, dark-blue pants an shackles during his brief appearance Monday. No bail has been set. Napier said that neither she nor her son ever ""heard anything negative or derogatory"" from Mohamud. He could be ""just a messed-up kid, you know, who made a bad decision,"" Napier added. But Arthur Balizan, the FBI special agent in charge in Oregon, called the threat posed by the reported plot ""very real."" ""Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale,"" Balizan said. ""At the same time, I want to reassure the people of this community that, at every turn, we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack."" According to an arrest warrant affidavit by an FBI special agent, Mohamud was in e-mail communication in August 2009, with a person believed to be involved in terrorist activities. In December, that person was ""located in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan,"" the affidavit states. The two communicated regularly, the affidavit states, and ""using coded language, they discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to prepare for violent jihad."" Mohamud attempted to contact another associate who he thought would help facilitate his travel overseas, the affidavit states, but ""because Mohamud used the wrong e-mail address in his efforts to contact [the second associate], he never successfully contacted him to arrange travel."" An undercover FBI employee contacted Mohamud in June under the guise of being affiliated with the associate in Pakistan, according to the affidavit. Mohamud met with the undercover operative July 30 in Portland. Mohamud allegedly told the undercover operative that he had written articles published in Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad. ""Mohamud also indicated that he wanted to become 'operational,' "" the Justice Department said. ""Asked what he meant by 'operational,' Mohamud stated that he wanted to put an 'explosion' together, but needed help."" But Sady noted that government agents failed to record their first contact with Mohamud due to what the affidavit said were technical difficulties, questioning why a meeting so critical to the case wasn't captured on video or audiotape. At a meeting in August, the Justice Department said, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives that he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15. According to the affidavit, Mohamud then told undercover operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Pioneer Courthouse Square tree-lighting. Authorities said an FBI operative pointed out that lots of children would be at such an event, but Mohamud said he was looking for a ""huge mass that will ... be attacked in their own element with their families celebrating the holidays."" Officials said Mohamud also stated, ""It's in Oregon, and Oregon like, you know, nobody ever thinks about it."" According to the affidavit, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives went to a remote area in Lincoln County, Oregon, on November 4 and detonated a bomb hidden in a backpack as a test. During the drive back to Corvallis, the agents asked Mohamud whether he could look at the bodies of those who would be killed in the upcoming attack in Portland, the Justice Department said. Mohamud said, ""I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured,"" according to the affidavit. On Friday, Mohamud met one of the FBI operatives at a predetermined location, the affidavit states. Mohamud called a phone number ""in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate the device,"" it says, and then dialed the number again before he was taken into custody. Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson, who said police officers got involved in the investigation several months ago, said the arrest took place several blocks from the tree-lighting. Muslims in the Portland area have decried the alleged plot and thanked police for reaching out to mosques in the area. And Somali leaders in neighboring Washington state also condemned the alleged plot, calling it ""heinous"" in a statement issued Monday. CNN's Thelma Gutierrez and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: Mohamud pleads not guilty; trial set for February .

"(CNN) -- World champion Jenson Button fired a warning to his 2010 title rivals that he will be just as quick with new team McLaren after setting the fastest time of the pre-season testing sessions in Jerez. The British driver, who left Brawn ahead of the manufacturers' champions takeover by Mercedes following the capture of his maiden drivers' crown, ended the eight days at the Spanish circuit top of the timesheets on Saturday following a best effort of one minute 18.871 seconds. That run put the 30-year-old ahead of the 1:19.299 set by Red Bull's Mark Webber on Friday and the 1:19.583 recorded by new McLaren teammate and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton last week. McLaren reported on their Web site that Button was ""very comfortable and confident in the car"" as he completed 108 laps in his third test with the team ahead of the final sessions in Barcelona next week. ""Both drivers will spend alternate days in the car evaluating the new bodywork and aerodynamic components ahead of the season-opener in Bahrain on March 14,"" McLaren said. Renault's new signing Robert Kubica was second fastest in Saturday's sessions, completing 117 laps in long runs in the R30. Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi was third quickest over a similar distance ahead of Force India's Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg in a Mercedes after the German took over from Michael Schumacher. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was sixth, while Webber was back in eighth after his RB6 could manage only 88 laps after an engine failure. Meanwhile, struggling new team Campos hope to be on the grid in Bahrain after confirming that shareholder Jose Ramon Carabante has now taken a controlling stake. The Spaniard has appointed former Force India boss Colin Kolles as team principal of an outfit which has just one confirmed driver, Bruno Senna. ""I would like to thank Bernie Ecclestone, who worked tremendously to support our efforts to keep the team viable,"" Carabante told F1's official Web site. ""The whole rescue operation has been a race against time with the goal of always having the team run two competitive cars at the first Grand Prix of the F1 season. ""We have a lot of hard work still ahead of us but we are excited about making our F1 debut and looking forward to a competitive season.""","World champion Jenson Button sets fastest time of the eight pre-season testing sessions .

"(CNN) -- French club Lyon kept up their hoodoo over Real Madrid with a 1-0 win on Tuesday night as the Spanish giants face the prospect of exiting Europe's premier competition at the last-16 stage for the sixth successive season. Lyon will take a narrow lead into the second leg of the Champions League tie thanks to a stunning second-half strike from Jean Makoun. Real, who have lost their last three trips to the Stade Gerland without scoring a goal, will battle to overturn the deficit next month at their Santiago Bernabeu Stadium -- which will host the final in May. Madrid president Florentino Perez spent a fortune on players such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka in pre-season with the stated goal of winning the Champions League, as the club did in his first reign, and ending the dominance of rivals Barcelona. But coach Manuel Pellegrini has seen his side languish in second place to Barca in La Liga and suffer an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey, so will be hoping his expensive legion of stars can bounce back from this defeat. After both sides went close with several half-chances, Lyon almost took the lead five minutes before halftime when winger Cesar Delgado lashed a volley against the left-hand post as Miralem Pjanic's corner was only half-cleared. Two minutes after the break, Cameroon midfielder Makoun was allowed to surge to within 25 meters of the Real goal and he fired a right-foot effort that sailed past keeper Iker Casillas and into the top corner of the net. Ronaldo went close for Real with a deflected effort from similar distance, but the visitors were almost caught on the counter-attack as Casillas did well to deny Aly Cissokho. Gonzalo Higuain tested Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris before being replaced by former Lyon star Karim Benzema with 15 minutes left, but Real were unable to force an equalizer.","French club Lyon keep up their hoodoo over Real Madrid with 1-0 home victory .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Angry protests greeted the acquittal Wednesday of a former Indonesian intelligence official accused of killing a respected human rights activist four years ago. Muchdi Purwopranojo was accused of plotting the murder of lawyer Munir Said Thalib. A court in Jakarta cleared Muchdi Purwopranojo of murder charges in the September 2004 death of Munir Said Thalib, a lawyer heavily involved in human rights work. Protesters outside the courthouse chanted, ""Who killed Munir? Muchdi killed Munir."" Munir's widow, Suciwati, said she was angry and disappointed in the verdict. And Usman Hamid, head of the National Commission on Missing Persons, said the family ""is hurting from the verdict."" ""The decision has turned people's faith in the justice system upside down,"" said Hamid, who now leads Munir's organization. Munir died after being poisoned while on a flight to the Netherlands. Munir's supporters say he was the victim of a conspiracy by Indonesia's national intelligence agency, the BIN. Two other people have been charged and convicted in Munir's death -- a pilot for the national airline Garuda Indonesia who was directly linked to the poisoning, and a former Garuda official who authorized him to be on the same flight. Prosecutors argued that Muchdi gave the orders in the conspiracy. But Hamid said judges treated the case as a personal vendetta by Muchdi, and he said more people from the agency should have been implicated.","Protests greet acquittal of a former Indonesian intelligence official .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has captured seven suspected pirates in the Gulf of Aden, the first arrests by a U.S.-led task force set up to curb rampant piracy off the Horn of Africa, a Navy spokesman said Wednesday. Seven men suspected of trying to pirate a tanker raise their hands before their arrest in the Gulf of Aden. Sailors from the cruiser USS Vella Gulf arrested the men Wednesday in the western Gulf of Aden -- a waterway between Africa and the Middle East -- after a distress call from the 420-foot (128-meter) tanker Polaris. The tanker reported that men aboard a small skiff were attempting to board the ship using ladders, but its crew removed them before the would-be hijackers could get aboard, the Navy said. The Vella Gulf found and boarded the skiff, and the tanker's crew identified the men aboard the skiff as their would-be hijackers. The skiff's men were taken aboard the Vella Gulf, the flagship of the task force now patrolling the western Gulf of Aden, and eventually will be transferred to Kenya for trial, said Lt. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Piracy has become a chronic problem off the Horn of Africa in recent years, with some pirates operating from largely lawless Somalia. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The task force led by the Vella Gulf was set up in January in an effort to clamp down on the attacks in the region, the southern approach to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.","Seven men captured after failed attack on ship, U.S. Navy says .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, will boycott runoff parliamentary elections scheduled for Sunday, a member of the party said Wednesday. Mohamed Beltagy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a former legislative candidate, said the boycott is a protest against irregularities in the first round of voting last Sunday. The party was wiped out Sunday, going from 88 seats in the legislature to zero. Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party won 217 seats in the first round of voting, the semi-official Al-Ahram newspaper said. The opposition parties won a mere handful of seats in the 508-seat parliament. Twenty-seven candidates affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood qualified for runoff elections. Muslim Brotherhood candidates run as independents because the group is illegal under to Egyptian law, which bans parties based on religion. The runoff will involve 377 candidates from the National Democratic Party of longtime President Hosni Mubarak. On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama criticized the elections, saying there had been ""numerous reported irregularities"" and ""restrictions on basic freedoms."" National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer called the reports ""worrying"" and said the United States is ""disappointed."" Critics had predicted that Sunday's race would be tainted by fraud and intimidation, but the government declared it ""a success."" Egypt's official MENA news service reported that 6,000 members of 76 civil groups monitored the elections. The country rejected international monitoring of the vote as interference in its internal affairs. Egyptian election commission spokesman Sameh al-Kashef said Tuesday that, although the committee had received numerous complaints, irregularities did not affect the results of the election. The complaints included reports of riots, fraud and forgery, denying citizens their right to vote, and difficulties faced by the media. There were riots in 16 constituencies, he said. He said voter turnout was 35 percent. Various opposition groups have accused the ruling National Democratic Party of using its power to suppress voices critical of Mubarak's nearly three-decade rule. The ruling party has dismissed the accusations. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: The largest opposition group is protesting irregularities in the first round .

"New York (CNN) -- A 19th-century artwork by French artist Edgar Degas will be returned to France nearly four decades after it was stolen, officials said Thursday. The painting, ""Blanchisseuses souffrant des dent"" (""Laundry Women with Toothache,"") was taken in 1973 from the Malraux Museum in Le Havre, in Normandy, France, according to a statement from the US District Attorney in Eastern New York. It had been on loan from the French government, which considers the painting a national treasure. The piece did not resurface until October this year when it appeared in a catalog from the auction house Sotheby's, it said. U.S. customs officials, working with authorities from INTERPOL, said the painting was consigned to French art collector Ronald Grelsamer. Grelsamer said his father gave him the painting as a gift, but was unaware that it was stolen, the statement said. Sotheby's said they had nothing indicating that the painting was stolen, saying it did not appear in any of its lost art databases, said company spokeswoman Diana Phillips. The auction house had a longstanding relationship with Grelsamer without incident, she added. ""Sotheby's is happy to have been able to be involved in this discovery, and we are pleased that this painting will be returned to the government of France,"" Phillips said. The U.S. District Attorney office says that Greslamer intends to seek compensation for the painting. ""The return of this masterpiece to the French government reflects our commitment to ensure the return of stolen artwork and cultural patrimony,"" it said in a written statement. The 6.25-inch-by-8.5-inch piece -- painted between 1870 and 1872 -- has an estimated value of $350,000 to $450,000, the statement said, quoting the company catalogue. The painting reflects a break from the academic focus of Degas' early years when he dedicated himself to the ""search for the essence of modern life,"" said Sotheby's spokeswoman Lauren Gioai. ""The 1870s gave rise to some of Degas most celebrated works,"" she said.","19th-century painting will be returned to France almost four decades after it was stolen .

"Washington (CNN) -- Among the volumes of diplomatic communications released by WikiLeaks are frank observations about the character of world leaders, their quirks and their weaknesses. In an initial review of the documents turns up a number of observations from U.S. staffers that provide unusual insight into foreign leaders' thinking and behavior, from ""voluptuous"" companions to attention-seeking personalities. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah proposed to U.S. officials that a Bluetooth-like device be implanted in Guantanamo detainees. During a March 22, 2009, meeting between Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan and King Abdullah, the king suggested that an ""electronic chip"" would allow the tracking of the detainees' movements, as with Saudi horses and falcons. Brennan deflected the idea, saying that "" 'horses don't have good lawyers' and that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the U.S."" Another communication dated February 10 said the Saudi king ""tends to express himself tersely"" because of his lifelong struggle with a ""speech impediment"" but added that he is a ""wry and forthright interlocutor."" The foibles of Libya's leader get a lot of attention in a cable from the American Embassy in Tripoli. Under the subject line ""A glimpse into Libyan leader [Moammar Gadhafi's] eccentricities,"" there is an extensive discussion of his ""various proclivities and phobias"" and his almost obsessive reliance on his nurse, a woman described as a ""voluptuous blonde."" The document goes on to detail the relationship between the 38-year-old Ukrainian nurse, Galyna Kolotnytska, and Gadhafi, touching on rumors of a romantic relationship. It also discusses the lengths the Libyan leader will go to ensure that Kolotnytska travels with him, saying that only she ""knows his routine."" The cable says Gadhafi is ""almost obsessively dependent on a small core of trusted personnel."" Also among his quirks: Gadhafi's dislike of flying long distances, his fear of flying over water and his need to stay on the first floor of any building. These diplomatically embarrassing cables extend beyond the Middle East and North Africa. They include observations from around the world, including Europe and longtime allies Germany, France and Italy. Of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, one cable gave this open assessment: ""An activist on the international scene, with an opportunistic eye for grabbing attention and credit, Sarkozy will remain a challenging partner despite his desire to improve the bilateral relationship."" Some news outlets have reported that U.S. diplomats called Sarkozy an ""emperor with no clothes."" On Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his relationship with Russia: The Italian leader ""appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of [Prime Minister Vladimir] Putin,"" according to a report from the New York Times. Regarding German Chancellor Angela Merkel: ""When cornered, Merkel can be tenacious but is risk-averse and rarely creative. This suggests she will remain a very circumspect ally until the election."" Although these cables may provide the U.S. with some uncomfortable moments with global partners, they are not limited to foreign leaders. American officials are also a topic of discussion. An almost prescient communication dated February 10 talks about the fallout from Gen. Stanley McChrystal's interview with the German news outlet Bild; four months later, his controversial interview with Rolling Stone was published, and he was forced to resign as head of the mission in Afghanistan. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle asked to express his concerns ""confidentially"" about McChrystal's interview. According to the cable, Westerwelle was particularly worried about a portion of the interview ""in which the general is quoted as urging the Germans to take more risks. Westerwelle recounted that he himself had to answer questions about this article for 10 days, explaining that the Germans were not 'peace soldiers' while other countries provided combat troops."" Westerwelle went on to stress that it was ""important that German troops not be 'relativized' and cast as second-class troops."" Another document paints Westerwelle in a less than flattering light, noting that the foreign minister, ironically, ""has never harbored a fascination for international affairs.""","Communications discuss Libyan leader's relationship with nurse .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Five American security contractors were detained in connection with the killing of another American contractor last month inside Baghdad's Green Zone, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Saturday. The body of James Kitterman was found in a car in Baghdad's heavily protected Green Zone. Iraqi and U.S. personnel took the five into custody in an operation inside the Green Zone before dawn on Friday, according to an Iraqi official involved in the investigation into the killing of James Kitterman. The five, who have not yet been charged, were being held by Iraqi security forces Saturday at a jail inside the heavily protected zone, he said. The troops also confiscated weapons during the raid on the suspects' firm at about 4 a.m. (11 a.m. ET), said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The names of the suspects and the company they work for were not released. The U.S. military declined comment and referred questions to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Embassy officials did not immediately respond to request for comments. Kitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in the district, formally known as the International Zone, on May 22. The 60-year-old Houston, Texas, resident owned a construction company that operated in Iraq. The five suspects knew the victim, a source inside the Green Zone familiar with the investigation said. Both the Iraqi and the Green Zone sources noted that the FBI has been involved in the investigation from the start. Once the suspects are charged and referred to trial, the case would be sent to Iraq's Central Criminal Court, the Iraqi official said. If that happens, it would be the first time U.S. citizens were tried in Iraq since the United States returned the country's government to the Iraqis.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's spy chief said Wednesday that there is a high chance that North Korea will attack again following a strike last month that has led to renewed tensions on the peninsula, the Yonhap news agency reported. South Korean lawmaker Rhee Beum-Kwan quoted National Intelligence Service chief Won Sei-hoon as making the prediction, Yonhap reported. ""North Korea pushed for reckless actions as internal complaints grew over its hereditary power succession and economic situations worsened,"" the lawmaker quoted Won as saying. Meanwhile, South Korea and the United States wrapped up joint military exercises on the Yellow Sea, while South Korea carried on with plans for artillery firing drills next week amid simmering tensions with Pyongyang. The live fire drills are a routine monthly exercise aimed at securing the safety of ships in the area, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN. They are scheduled to begin Monday. Officials said the planned firing drills are expected to take place in waters around the Korean peninsula, including those close to the Yellow Sea border, Yonhap reported. But the Yellow Sea locations are not close to Yeonpyeong Island, where four South Koreans were killed by North Korean shelling on November 23, Yonhap reported officials as saying. North Korea has said the South provoked the attack, which also left 18 people injured, because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. Meanwhile, South Korea and the United States are reportedly in talks about more joint naval exercises for this year or next year. ""We have been in consultations with the U.S. to carry out several rounds of joint military drills to deal with a limited provocation by the enemy,"" said Col. Kim Young-cheol of the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yonhap reported. ""The timing and participating military assets have not been decided yet."" North Korea warned Tuesday that the military drills by the United States and South Korea could lead to ""all-out war any time."" The firmly worded message was published by North Korea's state-run KCNA news service. ""If the U.S. and the South Korean war-like forces fire even a shell into the inviolable land and territorial waters of the DPRK, they will have to pay dearly for this,"" the news service report said. The DPRK is the acronym for North Korea's formal name: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meet with ministers from South Korea and Japan next Monday to discuss the Korean crisis, among other issues. That encounter comes amid calls from China for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the Korean peninsula. The six countries are China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the United States. South Korea has said it doesn't think the time is right for a resumption of the six-party talks, but promised it would ""bear in mind"" the Chinese proposal. In Washington, a State Department official said the United States is consulting with its allies but that resuming the six-party talks ""cannot substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations."" The Japanese government said one of its envoys is in Beijing, China, for discussions on the situation. As North Korea's largest trading partner and strongest ally, China has been urged by the international community to confront the crisis. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that China has ""a duty and an obligation to press upon the North Koreans that their belligerent behavior has to come to an end."" A top Chinese envoy met with South Korea's president over the weekend, and a top North Korean official arrived in Beijing, China, on Tuesday, the first visit to China by a North Korean official since the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island. CNN affiliate YTN reported that Choe Tae Bok, chairman of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, is on a five-day visit to China. Amid the international attempts to avert warfare, the strident and saber-rattling rhetoric between the Koreas remained the region's background noise. This comes after South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned this week that North Korea would face severe consequences if it launched another military attack across its southern border. ""If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail,"" Lee said in a nationally televised address.

"New York (CNN) -- High-end clothing retailer Juicy Couture shut the doors of its Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan, New York, after employees discovered bedbugs there. The 15,000-square-foot clothing store closed Tuesday but is expected to reopen Friday, after an exterminating company removes and treats all of its merchandise. It's the latest bedbug problem to affect stores and hotels across the city. Employees discovered the bugs after hours Monday, company spokesman Joseph Assad said. Juicy Couture is owned by Liz Claiborne Inc., a New York-based fashion company. Customers affected by the outbreak may make returns to the store, Assad said. ""Our primary concern is to our customers, store employees and their well-being."" The retailer's three other stores in the city were also tested as a precaution, but no bedbugs were found at any of those locations, he said. The average bedbug is a wingless blood-sucking insect that grows up to 7 millimeters (a little more than a quarter inch) in length, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bugs leave itchy bite marks on the skin, and some people are allergic to them. Calls to exterminators concerning bedbugs have increased 81 percent since 2000, according to the National Pest Management Association, which conducted the 2010 Comprehensive Global Bed Bug Study with the University of Kentucky. Last month, lawmakers and industry leaders met in Washington to discuss the outbreak at the Congressional Bedbug Forum, hosted by Reps. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, and Don Young, R-Alaska.","The clothing company temporarily closed its Fifth Avenue store .

"(CNN) -- The military operation to clear a Rio de Janeiro slum of drug traffickers will effectively turn into an occupation of the area at least through October of next year, Gov. Sergio Cabral said in a radio interview Tuesday. Rio state Gov. Sergio Cabral said that at least 2,000 troops will remain at the Alemao slum -- called a favela in Portuguese --  to keep up the effort to pacify the area. He announced the move after meeting with Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president-elect, in the capital, Brasilia. Originally, he had requested the troops for only six months. Rousseff offered her support for the security work being carried out in Rio, Cabral said. The troops are needed so that the government doesn't have to delay future operations in other communities overrun by drug traffickers, he said. The troops will remain until a police unit and station are installed in Alemao, slated for the middle of next year. Brazil, which will host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, is under increasing pressure to crack down on violent crime and clean up its slums. Over the weekend, armored vehicles followed by police trucks rolled into the favela to restore order. The police to be placed are known as Pacifying Police Units, a special force designed to live and work in the favelas they protect. Such units are already in operations in some favelas, but this most recent operation is the most ambitious to date. Authorities have been trying to dislodge traffickers from their hiding places for two years, but the operation in Alemao is the first time the government has tried to regain territory run by the criminals in earnest, said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars. At the outset, the events appear to be a victory for the government, but winning over the locals, who were living under the rule and services of the traffickers, will be a challenge. ""This is just the beginning. [Police] will have to work with people to convince them that you will not abuse their rights,"" Sotero said. That is the goal of the Pacifying Police. Reaction inside and outside Brazil to the success of the current operation has been positive, with speculation that the country is trying to clean up its streets before the World Cup and Olympics come to town. Sotero, however, suggests that it is domestic pressure that is leading to police work. As a whole, Brazil's economy is growing, and so is the middle class. As people find themselves in better situations, they also begin to demand better quality of life, Sotero said. People want things like better education and security. ""This, I think, is what created the pressure to try to find new solutions for a very old problem,"" he said. The slums became dangerous places during a period when the city and state of Rio had poor government, something that was exploited during the drug boom in the 1980s, Sotero said. Conversely, one of the factors behind the efficient action today is the fact that the local and state leaders are from the same political party and are allies with the federal government, said Thomas Trebat, executive director of the Institute of Latin American Studies at Columbia University. While Brazil as a whole is doing well, economic and social indicators in the city of Rio have lagged, Trebat said. This is significant because Rio is often seen as a representation of Brazil as a whole. ""This isn't Las Vegas. What happens here doesn't stay here,"" he said. The perception is that ""if this iconic city is undergoing social chaos, how can it be that Brazil is a BRIC?"" Trebat said, referring to the designation given to rapidly rising countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The World Cup and Olympics may be an impetus for acting now, but the pressure comes from Rio's need to reflect the better side of Brazil, he said. Whatever the reason for the incursion and occupation of Alemao, residents there are optimistic about the future. ""We have already weathered many difficult situations here, but thank God things improved,"" said Jose Maria Pereira, a retiree. Dilsa Maria, a maid, said, ""We lived a very repressed life. Now we have more freedom. We can come and go. This is important not just for me but for everyone here.""

"(CNN) -- Police are asking that the volunteer searches for three missing Michigan brothers be stopped by Friday night. Local authorities and federal investigators have been trying to find 9-year-old Andrew Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 5-year-old Tanner Skelton last seen on Thanksgiving. The end of the volunteer searches will allow authorities the opportunity to process what has been done and collected and to ""re-evaluate our direction for the following week,"" said Larry Weeks, police chief of Morenci, Michigan. John Skelton, the boys' father who has been charged with parental kidnapping, is fighting his extradition from Ohio, authorities said Wednesday. A hearing is set for December 14. Skelton was arrested Tuesday upon his release from a mental health facility where he was being treated after a suicide attempt, Weeks said. Although investigators have found ""a number of items,"" they still do not know the children's whereabouts, Weeks said. Asked whether he believes that the boys are dead, Weeks said Wednesday, ""I refuse to believe that at this point,"" saying he wanted to maintain hope. He did, however, repeat his Tuesday statement that a positive outcome is not anticipated. Investigators have not spoken with Skelton ""in some time,"" he said, or developed any additional information. He previously said authorities are skeptical of the information Skelton has provided. Skelton said he left the three boys with a woman, whom he identified as Joann Taylor, the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide attempt. Skelton said Taylor was supposed to take the boys to their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, Friday afternoon, Weeks said. But the boys never arrived. Earlier, authorities determined that Skelton had no ""established relationship"" with the person he named as Taylor, and they aren't certain that she even exists. Authorities continue to ask for the public's help, hoping someone saw Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan, in which he was believed to be carrying the boys along a 25-mile stretch of road between Morenci and Holiday City, Ohio. The last time someone other than a family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on November 25, according to the chief. Police say Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall with strawberry blond hair and blue eyes, and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds.","Police are asking that volunteer searches stop Friday .

"(CNN)  -- A clinical second half strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a famous Champions League victory for Inter Milan over Chelsea to cap a triumphant return to Stamford Bridge for their coach Jose Mourinho. The Cameroon striker seized on a fine through pass from Wesley Sneijder to score the only goal of the second leg in the 78th minute to give the Italian champions a 3-1 aggregate victory. It was no more than Mourinho and his men deserved after having several excellent chances to put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach. Inter led the last 16 clash 2-1 from the first leg in the San Siro, but many were expecting English Premier League title challengers Chelsea to overturn the deficit. But they reckoned without the tactical wiles of their former manager Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti's men scarcely created a chance throughout the 90 minutes as the prolific Didier Drogba and strike partner Nicolas Anelka were blunted. To cap a dismal evening for Ivorian international Drogba, he was sent off five minutes from the end for a stamping incident on Thiago Motta in the Inter penalty area. Former Barcelona star Eto'o had begun his evening by wasting an opportunity to put his side further ahead in the opening skirmishes as a John Terry mistake left him to head tamely at Ross Turnbull from close range. A feature of the first half was a number of last-ditch blocks by Inter defenders, the first by Maicon as Drogba was left with a clear sight of goal. Walter Samuel also denied Florent Malouda and Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty when Motta tangled with Branislav Ivanovic after a corner. Chelsea ended the half besieging the Inter goal and their prospects looked bright for the second half, but it was Inter who proved the more dangerous on the break. Sneijder exploited gaps on the Chelsea defense and from his pass the best chance fell to Argentine Diego Milito but he scuffed his shot wide of Turnbull and the goal. Motta also headed wide from close range, but when Eto'o was given the same opportunity he showed his quality and might have added another but for a fine save by Turnbull after Drogba had left Chelsea with 10 men. Mourinho said his team had given the ""perfect performance"" but was growing concerned after they had wasted several excellent chances. ""When we did score, Chelsea were completely out of the game. I thought everything was superior, not just our tactics but our attitude on the pitch,"" the Portuguese coach told Sky Sports.","Inter Milan beat Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to win last 16 tie 3-1 on aggregate .

"New York (CNN) -- A nearly 200-year-old copy of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" is set to hit the auction block Friday at Christie's auction house in Manhattan. The famed sheet music is one of 11 known copies of Francis Scott Key's patriotic tune, said to be written after he witnessed the British naval bombardment of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812. ""This is very exciting,"" said Christie's spokesman Chris Coover. ""Things like this are once in a lifetime to collect."" Key, then a young lawyer and amateur poet, is said to have boarded a truce vessel in the Chesapeake Bay in an effort to negotiate the release of a detained American doctor, according to documents from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. But Key was himself detained, the documents said. His vantage point aboard the British ship is said to have offered sweeping views of the ensuing battle, spanning the night of September 13 to the morning of September 14, 1814. ""By the dawn's early light"" Key saw that the fort's flag -- torn and burned from near constant shelling -- had remained erected above its walls, inspiring words later printed by Baltimore music publisher Thomas Carr. Carr is said to have rushed to publish the song, leaving first copies with a typographical error in the works' title. The copy at Christie's bears that first edition hallmark, Coover said. The print reads: ""The Star Spangled Banner. A Pariotic Song,"" rather than ""patriotic."" The copy will be sold as a part of the auction house's autumn ""Fine Printed Books and Manuscripts including Americana"" sale. It is the only privately-owned copy, Coover said. The other 10 copies are in institutions or university libraries. ""In a sense this is a last opportunity to own a copy of the American national anthem in its first appearance,"" Coover said. The copy's original owner kept the document with 49 other pieces of sheet music in an album used as a song book for family gatherings, according to Coover. Once purchased for $50, the two-paged copy is currently valued between $200,000 and $300,000. Congress named ""The Star Spangled Banner"" the country's national anthem in 1931.","A nearly 200-year-old copy of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" set to hit the auction block .
