"A secret stash of BBC files containing information about journalists and their ties to communism was shredded at the end of the Cold War, according to a former employee. Michael Hodder, who worked in the organisation's covert vetting unit in the 1980s, before later running the division, has broken his silence on the practice in a bid to repair the reputation of a former colleague, who died last week. The controversial process saw the BBC scrutinise thousands of people's backgrounds while working alongside MI5 over a period of seven decades. The BBC destroyed a stash of files at the end of the Cold War after years of vetting current and potential employees for links to communism . When the intrusive process was first exposed by The Observer in 1985, Brigadier Ronnie Stonham, the BBC's liaison with MI5 at the time, saw his reputation tarnished and his career cut short as a result of the revelations. Speaking to The Times, Mr Hodder - who took over the vetting division from Mr Stonham in 1988 - now wishes to set the record straight in regards to his former friend and colleague. He said: 'They did not reflect what he was trying to do, which was to cut down on all the vetting. 'He was disappointed that the story had been leaked when all he was trying to do was get the matter progressed and be less of an encumbrance for people at the BBC.' When Mr Hodder took over he claims he 'shredded the lot' - referring to the secret stash of files. The BBC worked alongside MI5 (headquarters pictured above) over several decades of screening . The documents, amassed over decades, were designed to keep a record of current or potential BBC employees who may have sympathised with extreme left-wing groups. Mr Hodder claims that when news of the practice was first leaked to the media, the operation had shrunk significantly. The former Royal Marine also claims that not one person was blacklisted after being screened in the 17 years that he worked for the company. The vetting first began in 1937 - initially to ensure that the BBC's staff did not have connections to Oswald Mosley's fascist political party, The British Union of Fascists, also known as the 'Blackshirts' The secret division operated from room 105 of the BBC's old Broadcasting House and was officially disbanded after the end of the Cold War in 1992 when it was deemed no longer necessary. The intrusive documents the division produced were known as 'Christmas tree files' because the symbol stamped on the front of the folders resembled one. The vetting first began in 1937 - initially to ensure that the BBC's staff did not have connections to The British Union of Fascists, led by Oswald Mosley. The Berlin Wall comes down in 1989 as the Cold War comes to an end - Michael Hodder claimed all covert files relating to BBC reporters' communist links were destroyed three years later in 1992 . The division continued to operate during the Cold War - screening for potential communist sympathisers. Thousands of staff were screened during the its peak. When The Observer article was published in 1985 the BBC was accused of compromising its journalistic independence by working with MI5. On the BBC's website an historical entry refers to the scandal, admitting that 'scope of the vetting had become too wide' and that it would have to be scaled back. The BBC has declined to comment.","Michael Hodder worked in BBC's covert vetting unit in 1980s and 1990s .

"Gus Poyet says he is not responsible for the strength of his squad at Sunderland as the fallout from their 8-0 humiliation at Southampton continues. Captain John O’Shea has confirmed that the players will refund supporters the cost of their match tickets - an estimated £60,000 – or make a donation to charity. The defender said: ‘We win and lose as a team, players, staff and fans. However, we wanted to acknowledge and thank the supporters who travelled such a long way to give us their backing and despite everything, stayed with us until the final whistle.’ Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has distanced himself from criticism over the Black Cats' squad . Santiago Vergini picks the ball out of the net after Southampton's eighth goal on Saturday afternoon . Sunderland fans had a staggering 653.4 mile round trip to watch their team lose 8-0 to Southampton . Poyet, meanwhile, has indicated that he has been left short this season despite nine new faces arriving at the Stadium of Light. But the Uruguayan wanted more having seen several senior players leave on free transfers - including Jack Colback, Phil Bardsley, Craig Gardner, Carlos Cuellar and David Vaughan - and Fabio Borini return to Liverpool following a successful loan stay. Sporting director Lee Congerton is the man responsible for overseeing recruitment – answering to owner Ellis Short - and he stated during the close-season that ‘quality’ and not ‘quantity’ was the club’s summer strategy. The Black Cats subsequently spent £14million – headlined by £10m Jack Rodwell from Manchester City – but Poyet repeatedly warned that a difficult season would lie in store unless key areas were strengthened. And the former Chelsea and Spurs midfielder now appears to have distanced himself from the club’s transfer business. ‘I’m a head coach,’ he said. ‘I don’t make the squad, that’s not my job. ‘I’ve got four defenders, I play what I’ve got. ‘I’ll take responsibility at a set-piece – it was me, I pick the team and put it on the pitch. ‘The rest, I’m sorry, I’m not going to take.’ Saturday’s scoreline equalled Sunderland’s worst defeat in their history and they now take on Arsenal at home on Saturday where Poyet is set to make changes to the starting XI.

Goalkeeper Vito Mannone faces the axe with deputy Costel Pantilimon – a free-transfer signing from Manchester City – poised to come in having made his first start for the Under-21s during Monday’s 1-0 win over Leicester City, a match watched by Poyet. The head coach, however, remains short of options with defenders Billy Jones and Sebastian Coates and attacking midfielders Ricky Alvarez and Emmanuele Giaccherini currently sidelined because of injury. Will Buckley was brought in by Poyet for £2.5m from his former club Brighton and the winger says the team has to make amends for their ‘Sunday League’ display at St Mary’s. ‘We need to pick ourselves up and make sure our performance is 100 times better than it was at Southampton,’ he said. ‘I’ve never experienced anything like that professionally. It’s a horrible feeling, especially for how many fans we brought down. ‘It’s gutting for us and we let ourselves down. We need to make it right on Saturday. ‘Those are the kind of results you see in Sunday League, so we have to make sure that doesn’t happen again. ‘We let the manager down and all the staff who have shown good faith in us.

"The former girlfriend of George Soros tearfully begged judges not to throw out her  $50 million lawsuit against the billionaire. Brazilian soap star Adriana Ferreyr, 30, claims 83-year-old Soros for broke his promise to buy her a $1.9 million apartment in Manhattan, New York. She has also alleged he intentionally inflicted emotional damage to her by slapping her during a fight and having security guards 'stalk' her. Soros's lawyer argued that Adriana Ferreyr exaggerated and mischaracterized what Soros did as their five year romance was cracking up in 2010 . Yesterday, at the Appellate Division court in Manhattan, she said: 'I deserve to have my case be heard. I . deserve to have a trial. 'I believe in America. I believe in justice. I . deserve to have a life ... to defend my reputation.' In court papers, Ferreyr claims Soros gave the Upper East Side apartment he promised her to another girlfriend, Tamiko Bolton, who married Soros last year. A lower court ruled that Ferreyr could not sue to enforce the promise but her case could continue on the claim that Soros intentionally inflicted emotional distress. Soros appealed that ruling. His lawyer, Gary Stein, argued that Ferreyr exaggerated and mischaracterized what Soros did as their five year romance was cracking up in 2010. Billionaire: Hungarian-born George Soros has five children with two different wives and married his third, Tamika Bolton, last year . In court papers, Ferreyr claims Soros gave the Upper East Side apartment he promised her to another girlfriend, Tamiko Bolton (pictured), who married Soros last year . For example, he said, Soros didn't try to hit her with a lamp but rather it crashed to the floor during altercation. 'There’s no question that Ms. Ferreyr was really distressed that Mr. Soros did not buy her an apartment,' Stein said. The $50 million suit was launched in 2011 after Soros gifted the apartment to his now-wife Tamika Bolton, 42. Papers filed by Singer say Ferreyr screamed that Soros was a 'f***ing a**hole,' before lunging at him 'suddenly and without warning,' the New York Daily News reported. Composed: Adriana Ferreyr leaves the courthouse with her lawyer William Beslow after allegedly causing a scene during George Soros' deposition . She struck the octogenarian on the head, knocking off the headphones he was wearing to amplify the audio before she was restrained by Singer, according to the papers. 'I let go of her arms. Ms. Ferreyr immediately swung at my face, knocking off my glasses. She then moved toward my glasses that had landed on the floor as if she were going to jump on them,' Singer alleges. 'I again grabbed her arms and moved her away from my glasses. After I let go of her arms, she resumed swinging at me and attempted to kick me.' Another aide who stepped in to help, Jose Santos, received a slap across the face and a kick in the shins from Ferreyr for his efforts, claims Singer.","Adriana Ferreyr, 30, claims Soros broke promise to buy her a condo .

"The best commercial aired during the Super Bowl was one most of the country didn’t see – until now. Personal injury attorney Jamie Casino’s two minute, sledgehammer-wielding, heavy metal blasting, tombstone-smashing shot at the Savannah (GA) Police Department after the shooting death of his brother only aired locally. Mr Casino was a criminal defense attorney until the 2012 killing, and he told WTOC he made the ad ‘to vindicate my brother’ against allegations he was involved in criminal activity. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Based on real events: The ad is based on real events that happened in 2010, and first shows Jamie Casino as a 'wealthy' criminal defense attorney . Shot dead: Casino's younger brother Michael was shot dead along with three other people in 2012, police said 'no innocent people were shot' ‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, ensure justice for those being crushed,’ reads a bible passage that begins the advertisement. ‘I wasn’t always a personal injury lawyer,’ Mr Casino says. ‘I once was a notorious criminal defense lawyer who was employed by some of the most cold-hearted villains – my art brought me great wealth.’ This all changed when his younger brother Michael and friend Emily Pickels were two of four people gunned down in the city in a single weekend, he explains, adding that police had ‘deceived’ the public about the circumstances surrounding the shootings. ‘No innocent people were targeted,’ former chief Wille Lovett’s voice can be heard saying while a caricature is shown on-screen. Not truthful: Casino accuses former Savannah Police Chief Willie Lovett of misleading the public about the circumstances surrounding the shootings . Gravesite: Casino is shown in the beginning making a solemn visit to his brother's grave . The innocence of childhood: Casino's son is shown asking what he does at work - causing him to change . His son is then shown asking ‘daddy, what do you do when you go to work?’ ‘At some point a man must ask why God created him,’ says Mr Casino just before heavy metal thrashes into the forefront and shows him standing over a grave holding a rose. A metal montage shows Chief Lovett again, this time on a fictionalized newspaper with the headline ‘Chief’s comments disgrace victims’ families, a picture of his brother, another fictionalized headline that reads ‘Casino says he forgives but never forgets’ and a sledgehammer with his brother’s name lying on top of his grave. The sledgehammer is normally used in his other ads to ‘smash money out of stingy insurance companies’ for injury victims, according to the Savannah Morning News. Now they've made him mad: The mood immediately goes dark, heavy metal kicks in and revenge is in the air . The coverup: Casino flat-out accuses police of lying about his brother's death . Always there: Casino says the incident never leaves his mind . Time to pay: The sledgehammer appears over his brother's grave . First he drags it through the dirt while flames trail behind and the song screams out ‘the time has come to make things right,’ then he uses it to smash his brother’s tombstone. ‘I’m attorney Jamie Casino, and I don’t represent villains anymore,’ he says. ‘I speak for innocent victims who cannot speak for themselves.’ Reactions to the ad have been mixed, but Casino remains unfazed. He did it ‘to let people know in Savannah that there’s some people that won’t keep their mouth shut, some people that will take their point to the Super Bowl… I think I pulled that off.’ Many people on Twitter loved the spot, calling it ‘the ad of the Super Bowl’ and the ‘ad of the year.’ ‘I’m buying what this guy’s selling,’ tweeted one person. ‘He outdid the big advertisers with this one,’ another person tweeted. Flaming: The sledgehammer bears his dead brother's name and leaves a trail of fire as he drags it through the ground . Starting over: Casino symbolically smashes his brother's tombstone to show he's not to be remembered the way police characterized him . Smash!: Guitars scream and flames roar as the gravestone explodes across the screen - he then walks away and tosses the sledgehammer to the side . Several others begged for it to be made into a movie. ‘This is awesome,’ a fan commented on the lawyer's YouTube page. Not everyone agreed. ‘Although it is sad what happened to his brother, in my opinion, he exploited it for his own personal gain,’ one person wrote on the Savannah Morning News Facebook page. ‘Like all his commercials, offensive,’ another person wrote. ‘It makes all lawyers look bad,’ a senior partner at a local law firm commented. The former police chief declined to comment when reached by WTOC, the station said. Famous: Locals know the sledgehammer from Casino's numerous television spots where he uses it to 'smash money out of stingy insurance companies' En fuego: Fire is also often used in Casino's ads .","Savannah, Georgia lawyer Jamie Casino bought the whole two minute local advertisement block for the Super Bowl .

"An Old Etonian who was viciously lampooned as 'Mr Toad' by locals on Facebook after taking over a much-loved Cotswold pub, has won a £9,000 libel damages payout. Christopher Horne, 68, was hit with a torrent of 'offensive and salacious' abuse on a Facebook page set up by Alistair Dempster - who had previously worked at The Bell, in Moreton-in-Marsh, Judge David Mackie told London's High Court. The two men 'fell out very substantially' over the running of the 18th Century coaching inn, the court heard, and the page became a platform for Mr Dempster and others to vent their spurious allegations. Former accountant Christopher Horne, pictured (left) here outside the High Court in London, was awarded libel damages over former Cotswold publican Alistair Dempster's 'Mr Toad' slur . It was originally intended to advertise the pub, but Mr Dempster, 49, re-branded the page, 'Toad of Bellenders - how not to run a Cotswold pub'. The page had over 100 members, many of whom - along with Mr Dempster - posted a string of venomous comments about Mr Horne and his management of the popular hostelry. Judge Mackie said Mr Dempster, now a barman at 'The Gate Hangs High' pub, in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, who was battling with Mr Horne for control of the page, constantly referred to him as 'toad of toad hall'. Comments posted made 'serious allegations about his competence and sobriety' and of 'sexual impropriety during a cricket tour of Spain'. All those accusations were groundless, the judge told the court. Although Mr Dempster had now issued a full apology, at one point he had refused to back down from his comments, telling Mr Horne in a letter, 'I continue to regard you as flatulent, foul and distasteful, but ultimately as hot air'. Mr Dempster's campaign lasted from May to November 2012, when Mr Horne secured a court order closing down the page. Slur: Mr Horne was likened to the character Mr Toad in The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame . Although he was not the only one to post comments, the judge ruled Mr Dempster 'responsible' for the web page and held that the campaign of abuse was 'motivated by malice'. Mr Horne, who once stood as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate, said of the most offensive slurs: 'I could hardly go anywhere in Moreton without some of these matters being referred to.' He was 'born and bred' in the Gloucestershire town, he said outside court, and had played for the local cricket team for over 50 years. His family has lived in the area for nearly 300 years. Alistair Dempster had previously worked at The Bell, in Moreton-in-Marsh . In a series of postings, Mr Horne was unjustly branded an 'inveterate liar', also facing claims of poor 'management skills', mistreatment of staff and of shutting the pub for several hours 'because he can't seem to pull a pint by himself', said Judge Mackie. One incendiary comment in July 2012 read: 'It p****s me off that people like this can get pubs and keep hold of them 'cos they have money', the court heard. Another suggested that, while on a cricket tour, Mr Horne had been 'chased around a hotel in Spain' by a 'local pimp chasing payment for the whores Toad had failed to pay'. Judge Mackie said that accusation was groundless and based entirely on gossip. Mr Horne said the 'fabrication' was 'designed to do him damage' and had been acutely embarrassing for him. 'There were allegations, by implication, of sexual harassment,' said Judge Mackie, who added: 'There were also allegations of consorting with pimps and prostitutes, and so on.' Given the damage to Mr Horne's reputation, and the 'serious libels' involved, £9,000 compensation was appropriate, the judge ruled. That amount would have been doubled but for the apology proffered by Mr Dempster, said the judge, who added: 'This was a campaign which continued for some months and must have been motivated by malice.' Mr Horne told the judge he had had no choice but to come to court to vindicate his good name. A spokesman for The Bell Inn said outside court: 'Obviously, it is a source of some gratitude that the judge has accepted that the conduct of Alistair Dempster was unacceptable and caused damage to The Bell. 'It is a great shame that one of the several offers to settle without the need for this quite awful lengthy legal action was not accepted.' It is understood that no further action will be taken against anyone else who posted libelous statements on the Facebook page, unless they are repeated.","Christopher Horne hit with torrent of 'offensive and salacious' abuse .

Allaster said in a statement: 'The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport. 'Serena Williams and Venus Williams are champions on and off the court - outstanding human beings, incredible sportswomen and amazing role models who have done so much to inspire women and girls around the world to achieve their dreams. 'The WTA was founded on the principles of equality, opportunity and respect, and Venus and Serena embody all of these attributes. 'Mr Tarpischev's statement questioning their gender tarnishes our great game and two of our champions. His derogatory remarks deserve to be condemned and he will be sanctioned.

However, Mr Tarpischev owes Venus and Serena Williams a personal apology, as well as other players and tennis fans everywhere, a public apology.' Dave Haggerty, the president, chairman and CEO of the United States Tennis Association, also issued a statement calling on Tarpischev to apologise. He said: 'As the president of the USTA and a member of the board of directors of the International Tennis Federation, I call on Shamil Tarpischev to issue a formal apology to Venus and Serena Williams. 'As the president of the Russian Tennis Federation and a member of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Tarpischev is expected to conduct himself with the highest degree of integrity and sportsmanship. 'Unfortunately, his comments do not embody either of these traits and in fact were reprehensible.' Tarpischev, who made the comments on a chat show, is reported to have claimed his words were intended as a joke.","Stars including Serena Williams pose for glamorous unveiling ahead of next week's WTA Finals in Singapore .

"Fast food giant McDonalds will trial late-night home delivery in Victoria, prompting concerns from a health campaigner about the easy accessibility to unhealthy food. A McDonalds store in South Melbourne will begin to offer the delivery service late next month, with other locations expected to follow. There will be a minimum $25 on order and a $4.95 delivery fee, which customers can place online, and will cater for customers in a 2.5km radius including South Melbourne, Port Melbourne and Albert Park. Hervey Bay residents will be able to order McDonald's to their front doorstep which has incensed medical professionals as the town has an obesity crisis . Deliveries will operate from Sunday to Thursday from 5pm-11pm and Friday to Saturday from 5pm-10am the following morning, the Herald Sun reports. The McDelivery service is already being tested at two Sydney stores. But Obesity Policy Coalition executive manager Jane Martin has concerns about the easy accessibility to 'unhealthy' food. Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for the fast food chain to decide to run the trial seven days a week . 'The concern is it creates even more convenience. It’s expanding the market at a time when people are already eating poorly, particularly young men who consume large amounts of chips and burgers,' Ms Martin said. Many of the items on McDonalds regular menu will be available with the delivery service, including Big Macs, french fries and healthy options like wraps and salads.

"Serena Williams has labelled Russian tennis federation president Shamil Tarpischev's comments about her and her sister Venus 'sexist, racist and bullying'. Tarpischev, who is also the Russian Davis and Fed Cup captain and a member of the International Olympic Committee, referred to world number one Serena and Venus as 'the Williams brothers' on Russian television. He has been fined over £15,500 and suspended from any involvement with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for a year while the governing body is also seeking his removal from his position as chairman of the board of the Kremlin Cup for a year. Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev has been fined £15,500 and banned from women's tennis for one year following his 'Williams brothers' remark about Venus and Serena on a TV talk show . Tarpischev faced a backlash after making the offensive remarks about Serena (left) and Venus (right) Williams is preparing to play in the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore, where both she and Russia's Maria Sharapova addressed the issue. Williams, quoted in the New York Times, said: 'I thought (the comments) were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time. I thought they were in a way bullying. 'I've done the best that I can do, and that's all I can say. So I just wasn't very happy with his comments. I think a lot of people weren't happy as well. 'The WTA and the USTA (United States Tennis Association) did a wonderful job of making sure that - in this day and age, 2014 - for someone with his power, it's really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks.' Sharapova, Russia's five-time grand slam champion, backed up her fellow professional. She said of Tarpischev's remarks: 'I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for, and I'm glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA. 'It was very inappropriate, especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in this sport, but being part of the Olympic committee. It was just really irresponsible on his side.' Stacey Allaster, chairman and CEO of the WTA, on Saturday called for Tarpischev to apologise both publicly and personally to the Williams sisters. Serena Williams poses with the U.S. Open trophy on top of the Empire State Building after winning her 18th Grand Slam singles title in New York last month . Venus Williams celebrates winning a point in her third round US Open match with Sara Errani . He subsequently paid tribute to the pair's playing careers, which have brought them a combined 25 grand slam singles titles, but was insistent that his derogatory comment was a joke and should not be the focus of such attention. In a statement from the Russian Tennis Federation on Saturday, Tarpischev said: 'Serena and Venus, of course, are outstanding athletes. They show the highest class of tennis. You can see - they are on a different level. 'The Williams sisters will always stand out on the tour and in the sport as a whole due to their achievements and their skills. They represent strength and perseverance and achieved results that for a long time will be considered as the highest bar for other players. 'I regret that that joke, which when translated into English has been taken out of humorous context, was the focus of so much attention. I do not think that this story deserves such hype. After all, everything said on the air was said without malice.' Serena Williams will begin her Singapore campaign against Ana Ivanovic on Tuesday.

"A British man has appeared in court in Dubai accused of getting drunk and running naked through a building on the Palm Jumeirah. The 33-year-old tourist, identified as RS, was said to have entered the reception of the building on the Palm Jumeirah in his underwear after consuming eight rums. He was then allegedly seen by a security guard naked in a corridor on the second floor of the apartment block, Dubai Court of Misdemeanours has heard today. The 33-year-old British man has been jailed for running naked through the corridors of a building on the Palm Jumeirah (file picture) The man has been charged with consuming alcohol without a licence and committing an indecent act. He denies committing an indecent act but admits drinking alcohol. The court today heard how it took police 30 minutes to talk him from his hiding place on December 20, according to The National. It was reported that a Nepali security guard, identified as NT, 34, said he noticed the defendant arguing with other security guards, dressed only in his underwear, when he started his shift. He said the tourist pushed him aside and ran to the second floor of the building after he tried to calm him down. He said: 'I called our control room to contact police and then I followed him to the second floor, where I found that he had taken off his underwear and stood there in the brightly lit corridor, completely naked.' The tourist was drinking at Le Meridien Mina Sey hotel (pictured) before returning to his accommodation on the Palm Jumeirah . RS is reported to have said he was unable to remember anything because he 'was too drunk'. He had allegedly been drinking at Le Meridien Mina Sey hotel before returning to the Shoreline, on the Palm, where he was staying. The next hearing is due to be held on March 27. It is the latest in a string of court cases involving Britons in Dubai, home to a significant British resident population and a popular holiday spot. Foreign residents in Dubai must have a licence to legally drink alcohol in the Gulf emirate. Officials in the Gulf state have prosecuted several British tourists for indecent behaviour and for swearing in public over the past few years.

"Kieron Dyer has revealed that Newcastle manager Graeme Souness offered to fight both him and Lee Bowyer following their infamous on-field punch-up. The team-mates were sent off during a 3-0 defeat against Aston Villa at St James’ Park in April, 2005 after coming to blows when Dyer refused to pass to Bowyer. Angry scenes followed in the dressing-room with captain Alan Shearer delivering a verbal volley to the disgraced pair, while Jean-Alain Boumsong invited them to settle their differences there and then. Lee Bowyer (second left) and Kieron Dyer (third left) come to blows on the pitch while playing for Newcastle . Dyer, manager Graeme Souness and Bowyer speak at a press conference to apologise for their behaviour . But the threat of Souness getting involved put a stop to that. ‘I was sent off first and I was waiting in the tunnel to get some revenge. He came in, and we had two massive masseurs and they just dunked us on their shoulders,’ said the 35-year-old former England international, who retired last year. ‘It was like a cartoon when your feet are dangling off the ground and we were trying to get at each other. We are sat in the changing room and they were in the middle of us. ‘I was thinking how I could get to him. Then we heard the final whistle. ‘Boumsong came in and said, “If you want to fight, fight now”. I was wanting to fight and get the revenge. ‘Then Souness came in and said, “If you want to fight I’ll beat both of you”. Al came in and I never saw him lose it like that – he went mad and called us selfish and a disgrace. He knew we’d have a three-match suspension and miss the FA Cup semi-final that was coming up.’ Dyer has revealed that Souness offered to fight both of his players after the match in the dressing room . Dyer says that the argument with Bowyer originated when his team-mate asked why he did not pass to him . Gareth Barry (left), Nicky Butt (third left) and Steven Carr (third right) drag the quarreling pair apart . Dyer says a lot of swear words were exchanged between the two, including him telling Bowyer he was 's***' Newcastle were already trailing by three with eight minutes remaining when referee Barry Knight dismissed the duo. And Dyer, appearing on Sky Sports, reflected: ‘He was like, “Give me the ball” and I was like, “I haven’t given the ball away, what you talking about?”. ‘Five minutes later he came again and I gave it to somebody else. And he said, “You never pass to me.” I said, “The reason I don’t pass to you is because you’re s*** basically”. ‘There were a lot of swear words. And that was it then, you just saw him lose his head. ‘He said, “You what?”. And I said, “You heard me”. Alan Shearer was furious with the behaviour of his team-mates, leaving them suspended for a cup semi-final . Souness is quoted by Dyer as telling the pair 'If you want to fight I’ll beat both of you' when he arrived . ‘As he was walking towards me I just thought he was going to grab me or push me. ‘When he was raining the punches in I thought, “You need to get on the weights because they aren’t hurting”. ‘Secondly, I was thinking, “I can’t believe he’s doing this in front of 50,000 people”. ‘I didn’t know you could get sent off for fighting your own team-mate, so when the red card came out I thought, “What the hell!”.’ Dyer was banned for three matches while Bowyer was hit with a four-game suspension and £200,000 fine having been deemed the aggressor. Although Dyer joked: ‘I still see him now, we are friends. That’s just the way Lee was. But I still want to beat him up.’ Dyer retired from football last year after finishing his career with Newcastle's local rivals Middlesbrough .

"Kevin Pietersen's allegations of bullying within the England team have been dismissed by the former chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board. The batsman's autobiography went on general sale on Thursday and makes a series of claims against a number of figures within the England set-up, with former head coach Andy Flower and wicketkeeper Matt Prior the two most heavily criticised. But David Collier, who until the summer held the top job at the ECB, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme that it would not have been possible for England to enjoy so much success over the last decade had Pietersen's claims had any substance to them. Kevin Pietersen has spent the week self-promoting his controversial new book, KP: The Autobiography . Pietersen celebrates a double century during an Ashes Test against Australia in December 2010 . Pietersen has voiced his claims on a 'bullying culture' he believes has long undermined the dressing room . 'No accusation of bullying was ever made to me,' he said. 'In any professional sport certain managers and leaders do have intensity from time to time. People that we respect as some of the greatest football managers have been known to be fairly robust in dressing rooms. Andy (Flower) is an intensely passionate man, he has the most superb integrity. 'There is no way we could have had the success over his long and successful period if there hadn't been huge respect within that dressing room. 'In any professional sport players will get frustrated with each other - that's a fact of life. I didn't see that as in any way affecting the team atmosphere. 'That team were very, very close as a team and one of the frustrations at the moment for some of the senior players is they have created so much for English cricket over the past decade that they want that to be remembered. One of the reasons why is that they were all perfectionists, and if you want perfection you have to be hard on yourself.' Pietersen (left) enjoyed happy times with the England team, but says there was bullying behind the scenes . One victim of Pietersen's main literary attacks is on England's former head coach Andy Flower (left) Pietersen, whose England career was effectively ended by the ECB in February after a disastrous Ashes tour, was particularly disdainful towards Flower in his book, claiming he allowed the 'bullying' culture to grow and describing him as 'Contagiously sour. Infectiously dour' and a 'mood hoover'. England captain Alastair Cook said on Saturday that Pietersen's allegations had 'tarnished' a period for English cricket which had been largely successful. Collier also said allegations made in the summer of 2012 that three England players were linked to the 'KP Genius' Twitter account which lampooned Pietersen - and clearly caused him a great deal of upset - had been 'fully investigated' at the time. Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Tim Bresnan have all denied any involvement in the parody account, which had been run by an acquaintance of Broad's, Richard Bailey, until its closure. Former ECB chief executive David Collier claims Pietersen's accusations of bullying are unfounded .

"Andy Murray knows there can be no let up in his quest to secure a place at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals as he heads to Valencia on the back of a hard-earned victory over David Ferrer in the final of the Erste Open in Vienna. The British number one recovered from losing the opening set to break serve three times in the decider and clinch a 5-7 6-2 7-5 victory in two hours and 40 minutes, which earned him crucial points in the Race to London. Murray, 27, is now the holder of the eighth and final qualifying berth for tournament hosted at The O2, with Tomas Berdych's win against Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the Stockholm Open later on Sunday consolidating the Czech's seventh position. Andy Murray lifts the Erste Open trophy in Vienna after a three set victory against David Ferrer . The Scot is now in position to reach the World Tour Finals after moving into the eighth qualifying position . The margins, though, are slim heading into the last two ranking events of the regular 2014 season, the Valencia Open 500, where Murray will play, and the Swiss Indoors Basel preceding the BNP Paribas Masters, which carries double the qualification points. Some six players are realistically left chasing the three remaining places, with Marin Cilic, who on Sunday won the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, qualified as a Grand Slam winner, from the US Open. 'The next few weeks are extremely important, everyone is playing next week,' said Murray on www.atpworldtour.com. 'I just need to win as many matches as possible to keep hold of the eighth spot or go higher.' Murray will now compete at the Valencia Open 500 as he bids to secure his position in London . Murray has been battling to regain top form again this year, the 2013 Wimbledon champion having fallen down the world rankings to number 11, but he claimed the inaugural Shenzhen Open title at the end of September and now after Vienna has some 30 ATP Tour wins. He added on BBC Radio Five Live: 'I was starting to feel good at the US Open a few months ago and I wanted to try and continue that through until the end of the year. 'Obviously, London would be very nice if I can get there, but it is also important for seedings at the Australian Open. 'To be seeded in the top eight there can make a big difference to the draw and hopefully I will be able to do that.' David Ferrer, pictured playing a backhand shot against Murray, could also make the World Tour Finals . Ferrer, meanwhile, still harbours genuine hopes of making it to London - the Spaniard is currently in ninth place but only 100 points behind the Scot going into Valencia. 'I have reached the final (here), so it is positive,' said Ferrer, who had beaten Murray in the third round of last week's Shanghai Rolex Masters. 'Andy played more aggressively than I did in the crucial moments and he deserved to win. 'Of course, I am disappointed as I lost the match having had a 5-3 lead (in the third set). 'I have a chance (to qualify for London). There are two more weeks, which are important to get to London. I will try and be more positive next week.'","Andy Murray beat David Ferrer to win the Erste Open in Vienna .

"A carer who stole nearly £10,000 to go on a spending spree including clothes, shoes and handbags was jailed yesterday. Laura Nichols, 26, sobbed as she was sent to prison for plundering the life savings of a vulnerable man she was meant to be looking after. Nichols was team leader for a care company, but also worked as a barmaid to help pay for her love of fashion. A court heard that she stole £9,831.99 over a year from the man’s bank account. Theft: Laura Nichols, 26, of Houghton, Pembrokeshire, plundered the bank account of a vulnerable 41-year-old man she was looking after while working as a team leader for a care company . Alongside her job as a carer, Nichols worked as a barmaid to help pay for her love of fashion . Ellie Morgan, prosecuting, said: ‘Police found clothes, shoes and handbags at her parents’ house. ‘Nichols said she had bought them herself, but admitted supplementing her account with the stolen money. ‘When interviewed, Nichols told police she used the money for bills and loan repayments.’ Her victim, 41, could not manage his own finances and received 24-hour care at his home in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire. Nichols had full control of his finances because he could not remember his pin number to use a cash machine. The court heard large sums had been withdrawn across Pembrokeshire and in Cardiff. Magistrates . at Haverfordwest were told withdrawals were also made when the victim . was visiting his parents in France. She even transferred the man’s ISA . into a current account to get access to it.

Jailed: Nichols was sent to prison for eight months after stealing £9,831.99 over a year-long period from the man’s bank account. She spent the money on her love of fashionable clothes, shoes and handbags . Geraint Walters, . the barrister representing Nichols, said: ‘She found herself living . beyond her means.’ Mr Recorder Ian Wyn Lloyd Jones, sitting at Swansea .

"Alastair Cook broke his silence on Saturday on the Kevin Pietersen affair to deny allegations of a bullying culture in the England cricket team and reveal his sadness that an era which saw three Ashes victories had been ‘tarnished’. The England captain resisted the temptation to hit back at Pietersen but strongly defended Andy Flower and Matt Prior, the main targets in Pietersen’s new autobiography. ‘It’s been a really sad week for cricket,’ said Cook. ‘After talking to quite a few of my team-mates we want to draw a line under it. Kevin Pietersen (left), with captain Alastair Cook (centre) and Matt Prior (right) before the fall-out . Pietersen pictured during his playing days for England, before he was sacked by the ECB . Pietersen (left) was very critical of coach Andy Flower (right) in his autobiography . ‘I am very proud of the era I have played in. To win three Ashes, to become the best side in the world, to play with some great players. I only have fond memories of that. ‘To play under Andrew Strauss, to have played under Andy Flower as coach, I have only got respect for these guys. That era has been tarnished and I am sad about that.’ Flower is believed to be hurt and angered by Pietersen’s attack on his legacy and astonished that anyone could accuse him of condoning a bullying culture. ‘I have known Andy since he took me under his wing at Essex,’ said Cook. ‘I only have respect for him as a man and coach. He was an amazing coach. Chatting to some of the guys about it, they feel the same. A lot of the success was down to his drive and determination to make us a tough England side.’ Pietersen has spent the last week plugging his new book in various interviews . Cook is angered at comments about Prior, one of his closest friends in the England team. ‘That was probably the biggest shock for me,’ said Cook. ‘Matt is a great man who has been a fantastic servant for English cricket. ‘Hopefully if he can get through his really nasty injury, we could see him again in an England shirt. ‘He put his heart and soul on the line for England and the team was all that mattered to him. He should be incredibly proud of that.’ Asked in an interview with the BBC’s Joe Wilson if he recognised the accusations of a bullying culture in the book, Cook said: ‘No, I don’t. International cricket is a tough place and you’re striving for excellence at all times. At some stages those frustrations probably boiled over more than they should have, but that was only people desperate to succeed and wanting to know the other 10 blokes around them were committed 100 per cent. ‘Did it overstep the mark a couple of times? Possibly but we addressed those issues. It certainly wasn’t a bullying environment at all in my eyes.’ Pietersen has alienated himself from the England camp with his strong literary claims .","Alastair Cook has broken his silence in the wake of Kevin Pietersen's damning claims in his autobiography .

England will name Fijian-born soldier Semesa Rokoduguni in their Elite Player Squad on Wednesday, leaving Chris Ashton’s World Cup dream hanging by a thread. Head coach Stuart Lancaster will unveil his core 33-man squad ahead of the four-Test QBE Series with Bath’s uncapped 27-year-old set to be included at Ashton’s expense as England search for some attacking X-factor ahead of next year’s global tournament. On Tuesday night it was understood Ashton - capped 39 times and England’s starting No 14 at the 2011 World Cup - will not be one of four wings in Lancaster’s squad, with Rokoduguni set to be named alongside Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell and Jonny May. In-form Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani is another high-profile absentee, with Lancaster expected to name Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler as his No 10s, while Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees is also expected to be omitted, barring an 11th-hour reprieve. Semesa Rokoduguni is set to be included in England's Elite Player Squad on Wednesday . Fijian-born soldier (centre) is in sparkling form for Bath with six tries in seven Aviva Premiership games . Rokoduguni is a serving solder with the Scots Dragoon Guards and has served the army in Afghanistan . November 8 vs New Zealand . November 15 v South Africa . November 22 v Samoa . November 29 v Australia . Sportsmail also understands Northampton flanker Calum Clark - banned for 32 weeks in 2012 for breaking Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins’ arm - will be named along with fit-again Saracens centre Brad Barritt and Bath centre Jonathan Joseph, who replaces the injured Manu Tuilagi, ruled out on Tuesday with a groin problem. There is still a chance Ashton could be called up as one of seven additions to the training squad on Sunday, but the Saracens player has clearly dropped down the pecking order. Leicester’s uncapped lock Graham Kitchener is the favourite to replace concussion victim Geoff Parling. Rokoduguni’s inclusion will complete an extraordinary transition for the Afghanistan war veteran, who only signed professional papers with Bath in 2012 after director of rugby Mike Ford spotted him playing for the Army in a friendly against Newcastle and brought him to the Recreation Ground on trial. Saracens winger Chris Ashton is set to be omitted in favour of Rokoduguni by head coach Stuart Lancaster . ‘It has been my target to play international rugby with England,’ Rokoduguni said on Tuesday. ‘I’m confident with the way I’m playing. I feel ready for the step up. Back in my village I played rugby but I wasn’t the first-choice winger. I trained hard every single day and still didn’t get picked.’ Rokoduguni, who is a serving soldier with the Scots Dragoon Guards and lives in military accommodation in Warminster, sends a significant chunk of his salary back to his family in Fiji, where he was born and raised. ‘The Army came to Fiji with the intention of getting guys to join up,’ he said. ‘I came over in 2007. ‘I am full-time rugby at the moment but if the Army wanted to deploy me in Iraq or Afghanistan then the Army comes first.’ Rokoduguni, who featured for the Saxons last season, has been the form wing in the Aviva Premiership with six tries in seven matches. His inclusion in the full England squad is a clear indicator of attacking intent. Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani (right) is also expected to be omitted when the squad is announced . Ford said: ‘Can he handle it? I don’t know. The key is not to try to change him. He is a free-style, free spirit rugby player and that is what makes him exciting.’ Rokoduguni’s Bath team-mate Joseph, first capped two years ago against South Africa, is another player set to bring some attacking verve to England’s three-quarter play after convincing Lancaster he has improved his breakdown work to complement his undoubted qualities with ball in hand. ‘JJ’s been outstanding,’ Ford said. ‘You could tell in pre-season he had the bit between his teeth. Before he came here I’d only seen him play at England Under 20s and I thought he was a bit soft. But you meet the kid and he’s not.’ Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill on Tuesday confirmed Tuilagi’s groin injury will see him miss the autumn series, which begins against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8. Bath say Kyle Eastmond’s rib injury is not as serious as first feared.

"Ireland have been served a fitness blow ahead of the autumn internationals and possibly the Six Nations after winger Andrew Trimble was ruled out with a toe injury. Irish province Ulster said that the 30-year-old had suffered 'significant ligament damage' to his big toe during a recent PRO12 clash with Glasgow and is expected to miss 'a period of months'. A statement from the province read: 'Andrew Trimble suffered significant ligament damage to his great toe playing in the PRO12 game against Glasgow Warriors. Andrew Trimble, in action against England at Twickenham last season, will miss the autumn internationals . 'Ulster Rugby, in conjunction with the national medical staff, will seek second opinion on the management of the injury, however it's is expected that he will be out of rugby for a period of months.' There was further bad news for Ireland after Trimble's club and country team-mate Luke Marshall was confirmed to have sustained medial ligament damage to his left knee during a clash against Yorkshire Carnegie. The six-cap centre is expected to miss six weeks with the problem.

"Christian Wade's wonder try against Leinster in Dublin on Sunday is unlikely to earn him an immediate England recall, but the Wasps wing believes it will reignite his game after a difficult year. The 23-year-old brought the house down at the RDS Arena by leaving three opponents in his slipstream to produce a glorious solo strike in his club’s European Champions Cup defeat. Hours later, he was feted by Irish and English fans alike as he walked through Dublin airport with his team-mates, but it is understood that his latest scoring feat has not convinced the England coaches to include him in their autumn Test squad. Christian Wade of Wasps breaks clear to score a try against Leinster but will not be recalled by England . Sportsmail has learned that Wade is due to be included in the Saxons squad and will have to bide his time in the hope of winning a second international cap. But having missed most of last season with a foot injury which proved tough to overcome, the Lion feels that his try on Sunday will serve to kick-start his game again. ‘I was really excited and happy to score,’ he said. ‘Scoring tries like that makes me feel like my old self again and that will give me real confidence going forward. I’ve just got to play as much rugby as I can and see what else I produce. ‘For me it’s been a difficult last year really. I had the injury and was out for about nine months. In the first few games I played after that I was obviously trying to feel my way back into it. I wasn’t holding back, I was trying to do my best but I was making mistakes. I have kept trying to get better every week and put some good performances together.’W . Wade made his one and only England appearance against Argentina in June last year . Recalling his blistering run to the line, Wade added: ‘It was in broken-field play and the boys got it out to me. I had a bit of space and I think it was Madigan who was in front of me. I had a one-on-one with him and I was able to stand him up, get on the outside and from there it was straight run – a race into the corner. ‘For wingers, our main job is to finish off tries and also to get over the gainline. That is something that I have always done but I know that I can’t just rely on scoring tries – I also have to have the right defensive mind-set. I know that as a winger I have to be good at defending, at the wide breakdowns, the high balls and the kick-chase. I have to make sure I get my all-round game right.’ Wade is destined to miss out when Stuart Lancaster names his autumn squad on Wednesday. Wing is among the most open areas of the field in terms of England selection, with Marland Yarde, Chris Ashton, Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson believed to be the leading four candidates, while Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonny May are also in the mix.","Christian Wade burst back on to the scene with a wonder try for Wasps .

"England centre Manu Tuilagi has been ruled out of next month's autumn series because of a groin injury. Tuilagi limped off after 15 minutes of Saturday's 25-18 Champions Cup victory over Ulster and will now miss the Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia. 'I'd be very surprised if Manu plays any part in the autumn. He'll clearly be missing for a few weeks as a minimum,' Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said. England centre Manu Tuilagi has been ruled out of next month's autumn series because of a groin injury . Tuilagi limped off after 15 minutes of Saturday's 25-18 Champions Cup victory over Ulster . Tuilagi was outstanding against the All Blacks during England's three-Test tour in New Zealand last summer . A time frame for Tuilagi's return is expected in the coming days with the British and Irish Lion having suffered a different groin injury to the one that sidelined him for three Aviva Premiership games last month. Cockerill stresses that Tuilagi's rehabilitation will not be rushed to enable him to make the end of England's QBE Series, which begins against the All Blacks on November 8. 'Manu's had scans and we're still waiting for the exact prognosis. He won't be fit for the autumn internationals for sure,' Cockerill said. England coach Stuart Lancaster (left) will have to plan for November without his hard-running centre Tuilagi . 'You'd imagine it being four weeks plus before he's back on the field. He'll struggle to be involved. 'We had the England doctor in and everybody's aware of the situation. It's a continual dialogue. 'We know how good Manu is, he doesn't need to prove himself, he just needs to get himself fit. That's the key for me. If he's right and fit then he's as good as there is. England v New Zealand, November 8th . England v South Africa, November 15th . England v Samoa, November 22nd . England v Australia, November 29th . 'It's not about him playing at the back end of the autumn, it's about him being fit and making sure he's 100% so he can come back and do what Manu does.' Tuilagi first damaged his groin in the 24-20 Premiership victory at Exeter on September 13. 'It's a slightly different injury. He went to push off and accelerate and he thought he was going to score,' Cockerill said. 'He backed himself, felt his groin go and there was no power. For Manu to come off immediately is unusual - he was in a fair bit of pain. Bath centre Jonathan Josepth is set for a call-up to replace Tuilagi in Lancaster's England squad . 'At this point we just need to find out exactly what the problem is and find the right treatment. 'Before his groin was very tight so we rested it, rehabilitated it and he was feeling good. He trained properly and there were no issues. 'But clearly there was something there that there shouldn't have been and he's done something else now.' The news is a major setback for England, who have been robbed of their main strike weapon for the entirety of a key part of their 2015 World Cup preparations. If fit, Tuilagi was a guaranteed starter against New Zealand and his absence leaves a gaping hole in the midfield. 'Manu did his pectoral muscle last year, but these things happen,' Cockerill said. 'He's a powerful man and a powerful athlete who is still developing and growing to a certain degree. 'Of course he's frustrated but he's pretty level headed and is a good pro. His concern is to get fit. 'The World Cup is a huge thing at the end of next year and he wants to be a part of that.' England head coach Stuart Lancaster names his 33-man elite player squad for the autumn on Wednesday lunchtime.","'I'd be very surprised if Manu plays any part in the autumn,' says Leicester coach Richard Cockerill .

"Germany's Martin Kaymer defeated Bubba Watson in a sudden-death play-off to win the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda on Wednesday. Kaymer, who held a two-shot lead over Masters champion Watson following an opening 65, birdied the first extra hole at Port Royal Golf Course after the pair had finished tied on six under par.

Germany's Martin Kaymer poses with the trophy after winning the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda . Kaymer (left) shakes hands with Bubba Watson after beating him in the first hole of the play-off . 'Yes, of course I was surprised that he missed it,' said Kaymer, who also beat Watson in the singles in Europe's Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles last month. 'I had a similar putt earlier in the regular round, just half an hour before we were standing there in the play-off. But his was a little bit longer and I knew that it's not an easy putt. 'On my putt it was quite an advantage that I had the similar putt earlier, just a little bit longer, but pretty much the same line and I knew it didn't break as much as I thought. So that helped me a lot. It was a good stroke and so it went in. 'But I was surprised about him, obviously, you don't want to win a golf tournament that way. Of course I will take it, but you don't really want the other guy missing a short putt.' Kaymer hits his tee shot on the 16th hole of the stunning Port Royal Golf Course in Bermuda . World No 1 Rory McIlroy plays out of the bunker on the second hole on his way to finishing third . Watson added: 'I thought I hit a great putt. There's no way that ball should go that way, unless it's wind forced. It's just one of those things. It was Martin's time and not my time.' Watson also held a two-shot lead with two holes to play following birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th, only to drive into water on the 17th and run up a bogey six, while Kaymer birdied the same hole.

"Sam Tomkins would be happy to switch to his old half-back role for England in the Four Nations Series but he expects Gareth Widdop to claim the number six jersey. Tomkins is a certainty for England's opening match against Samoa in Brisbane on Saturday week but has come under pressure for his full-back spot from Leeds' Zak Hardaker. The former Wigan favourite, who now plays in the NRL for New Zealand Warriors, has noted the form of Hardaker, who took his spot in the Super League Dream Team this year, and welcomes the competition for the number one shirt. Sam Tomkins (left) expects to face competition from Leeds' Zak Hardaker (right) for England's full back jersey . 'I've seen a number of his games this year and he's been brilliant,' said Tomkins, who returned home when the Warriors failed to reach the play-offs but will be on the plane to Brisbane with his England team-mates on Tuesday night. 'Zak's progressing the older he gets and he's put himself in a great position. 'He has obviously been outstanding this year and (head coach) Steve McNamara's going to have some tough choices to make I think. 'But that's good. It means every week we're going to put a good team out.' With only two specialist half-backs in McNamara's 24-man squad, Widdop is expected to partner Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith but Tomkins, who began his career as a stand-off, is ready to step in if required. 'I've not spoken to Steve about that,' he said. 'It will be up to him. 'But the way I play at full-back, I do a bit of ball handling anyway so it's not massively different. I'd just get a bit more ball and try and create more than run. 'I wouldn't be bothered if I did or didn't, either one or six, if I had an England shirt on I'd be happy.' Widdop, who made the switch from full-back to stand-off after being behind Billy Slater at Melbourne Storm, was belatedly handed the England number six jersey for the World Cup semi-final last November and, according to Tomkins, has impressed in the role during his debut season with St George Illawarra. But Tomkins believes that Gareth Widdop will stay at half-back and he will not be switched there . 'Gaz has been brilliant this year,' Tomkins said. 'There were a lot of questions being asked because at Melbourne, Cooper Cronk had always been the dominant half leading the team and Gaz got the ball when Cronk didn't want it. 'People wondered whether he'd be able to do it without those others around him, but he's been the dominant half. His kicking game is pretty immaculate a lot of the time and you'd think Gaz would be that first choice at six.' Widdop and Tomkins are among six NRL-based players in the national squad, with Josh Hodgson set to join them when he links up with Canberra ahead of the 2015 season, and the former Man of Steel reckons that will help England's chances of breaking their Four Nations duck. 'They'll know a bit more about our players but being in the environment of the NRL, with tough games week in, week out, that will prepare people well for the Four Nations,' Tomkins said. 'We've got a good squad together. We're missing a couple of experienced blokes in Kevin Sinfield and James Roby that have been there in previous years but there's a lot of young lads in this team that have really stepped up in Super League and some in the NRL this year so I think we've got a great chance.' Tomkins is especially delighted with the appointment of his former Wigan skipper Sean O'Loughlin as the successor to Sinfield. 'Lockers is the ideal choice for captain,' he said. 'He's captained Wigan for a number of years and has recently been successful at doing that. 'I couldn't think of anyone else better suited to captaining their country.' Tomkins runs clear to score his hat-trick try during the Four Nations at Leigh Valley in 2011 .","Sam Tomkins moved to the NRL to play for the New Zealand Warriors .

"Back-row forward Julien Bardy will answer a charge of striking England No 8 Billy Vunipola with his knee in Clermont's 30-23 defeat at Saracens on Saturday. The 29-year-old will appear before a European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) disciplinary panel in Dublin on Thursday. Bardy is alleged to have struck Saracens loose forward Vunipola with his knee in the 78th minute of the Champions Cup Pool One match at Allianz Park. Clermont forward Julien Bardy has been charged for allegedly striking Saracens' Billy Vuinpola (centre) Bardy (right) will go before a disciplinary panel on Thursday in Dublin to answer the alleged charges . Saracens eased past Clermont in north London to open their cup campaign with a hugely-creditable victory. Mark McCall's men thrashed Clermont 46-6 in the semi-finals of last year's Heineken Cup, with Chris Ashton claiming a brace of tries at Twickenham in April. The England wing helped himself to two more against the same opponents at the weekend, with back-three partner David Strettle claiming a double for himself as Saracens climbed to the top of Pool One. Bardy (left) is alleged to have committed the offence in the 78th minute of last weekend's European clash . Match citing commissioner John Charles brought the charge against Bardy, while Simon Thomas has been appointed as the independent judicial officer for Thursday's hearing.

"Kit Symons could move a step closer to landing the permanent Fulham manager's job with victory over Charlton on Friday. Symons has guided the Cottagers to four wins from seven matches since taking over on a caretaker basis from the sacked Felix Magath last month. Chairman Shahid Khan has a five-man committee to advise him over the club's next managerial appointment, with names such as Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke thought to be on the shortlist along with Symons. Kit Symons (above) has four wins from seven games since becoming caretaker manager at Fulham . Former Norwich manager Chris Hughton (above) has also been linked with the vacancy at the London club . But while Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Co mull over the options, Symons has quietly gone about transforming a side who had collected just one point from their previous seven Sky Bet Championship games under Magath. One player benefiting from the former Fulham defender's spell in charge is Dan Burn, whose late equaliser secured a dramatic 3-3 draw at Rotherham on Tuesday. The 22-year-old told the club website: ""We just had the desire to at least come away with something. We took a point - yes, we wanted it to be three, but it wasn't a defeat so it means we can build on that going into the Charlton game on Friday. ""You can't keep getting a win, a defeat, a win, a defeat - you've got to keep the momentum going so it's really important we didn't get a defeat on Tuesday. We've got a lot of games coming up, so hopefully we can carry on."" Dan Burn (right) is desperate for Fulham to continue their improvement against Charlton . Symons will hand a late fitness check to defender Tim Hoogland, who missed out in midweek through illness, while captain Scott Parker will return to the starting line-up to face his old club. A point would lift Fulham out of the relegation zone for the first time this season, while Charlton are looking for a win which would move them to within a point of leaders Derby. But Addicks boss Bob Peeters is well aware of the stark contrast between Magath's confidence-drained team and the in-form side he will face at Craven Cottage. Scott Parker (right) is set to return to Fulham's starting line-up at home to Charlton on Friday . ""I saw them in one of the last games under Felix Magath, (a 1-0 defeat) at home to Wolves, and at that time they were struggling, there was no mentality, nothing in the team,"" he said. ""Then I saw them against Bolton at home and it was another team completely - they won 4-0. So it's going to be a very tough night for us, especially because it's a proper derby."" The visitors will be without suspended midfielder Yoni Buyens, while winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson and six-goal top scorer Igor Vetokele are injury doubts.","Symons has improved Fulham's results since taking over in temporary role .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson is helping him adapt to the demands of Premier League management. Ferguson singled out Dyche for praise in an interview he gave to United’s in-house television station earlier this week, saying: ‘He phoned me not so long ago. I think he is one of the promising managers in the game. The job he has done at Burnley has been fantastic.’ Dyche, who has known Ferguson’s son Darren since his playing days, admitted that he has been speaking to the former Old Trafford boss ‘on and off for a few years’ but was happy to keep it confidential. Sean Dyche and Burnley are yet to win a Premier League game this season . The 43-year-old has yet to win a game in the Premier League since leading Burnley to promotion last season, but hopes that Fergie’s input can make a difference. And he said: ‘There are a number of people I speak to and he is one of them. He is obviously a very important figure and always gives you really good, honest, helpful advice – no holds barred reality as he sees it, and he has been very good to me like that. ‘The last time I spoke to him, I said: “Can you win me a game now!”. Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken out in support of Dyche in a recent interview on MUTV . 'More or less whenever I’ve needed it he has answered the call. He has always got time for you. He was like that when he was active as well, not just because he has retired. When he was manager he always took a phone call and always gave you sound advice. ‘He has experienced virtually everything in the football world and I ask him advice and pick his brains. It’s great that he thinks that I talk a bit of sense and try and get the best out of what we have. 'He had to do that himself many moons ago. It wasn’t an easy pathway and I don’t think there is one in football management to be honest. Dyche is friends with Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren . ‘There are certain people in the game you gravitate towards for an opinion. I am aware that you need that and he is one of them and he has been very helpful for me and honest with any view I have asked him about. ‘Sometimes I touch on many different challenges. As you can imagine he doesn’t beat about the bush. ‘I also speak to Darren. Me and Darren get on well and have done for a number of years. He almost signed for Nottingham Forest as a kid when I was there so we have known each other for a long time.’ Dyche is still adapting to life as a Premier League manager. Only this week, a photo was posted online of him travelling on the Tube to the Leaders In Sport Business summit at Stamford Bridge. Dyche made the trip to the Leaders In Sport summit by Tube . He added: ‘I was on the Tube and a young man said hello. I could see him and I just laughed, although the grimace picture looks more me. I was aware of him. I’m just a bloke you know but it was one of those funny little quirks. ‘There is a big profile difference, of course. It was slightly building last year because of what we did and all the players have noticed it. ‘At the golf club where I live, it’s amazing the people who say ‘hello Sean’. But I’m the same fella they have seen there for eight or nine years’.","Sean Dyche is receiving some advice from Sir Alex Ferguson .

"Radamel Falcao was benched by Louis van Gaal for Manchester United's Barclays Premier League draw at West Brom on Monday night. The reason? 'Jet lag', according to the Dutchman. The striker had travelled all of 6,760 miles during the international break to play in Colombia's friendly victories against Ecuador and Canada in New Jersey, so was deemed not fit enough to play at the Hawthorns. Fair enough, you might say. But consider Sergio Aguero for a second. Manchester City's star striker travelled a whopping 12,214 miles to play for Argentina against Brazil in China and then watch his country's win in Hong Kong. That's nearly double the distance Falcao travelled - yet Aguero played against Tottenham last Saturday. He managed to scrape four goals too.

CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's insight into how Brazil, Argentina and Chile players clock up over 12,000 air miles for friendlies . Also consider the fact that Aguero has also played more minutes over the past two weeks than Falcao too. Taking in to account the last Premier League matches before the international break and the first round of fixtures following it, Aguero has played 241 minutes for club and country. Falcao has managed just 220. So was Falcao really too tired to start for United on Monday? Van Gaal told Sky Sports: 'I think Robin van Persie was (back) two days before Radamel Falcao came back and he was in South America. It's a big difference with jet lag and that's the reason he's out the team.' Sergio Aguero travelled 12,214 miles to play for Argentina. Radamel Falcao completed 6,000 fewer miles .

Consider, too, Hull midfielder Mo Diame. The Senegal captain did not enjoy ideal preparation for the Tigers' trip to Arsenal on Saturday. 'Diame, he didn't come to the hotel until yesterday, he came straight from Heathrow to the hotel,' Hull boss Steve Bruce said after the match. Yet Diame scored at the Emirates Stadium and Hull managed to grab a highly creditable 2-2 draw. 'You just have to go on a long-haul holiday yourself,' said Bruce when describing the effects of jet-lag on players and the mental and physical demands of travelling to play international football.

Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong has said his rehabilitation from injury will take at least another eight weeks. De Jong was a £6million arrival from Ajax in the summer but he suffered a major setback almost immediately when he suffered a serious thigh injury just three games into his Magpies career. The initial prognosis was that he would not be fit to return until after Christmas and that does not appear to have altered significantly during his time on crutches. Siem de Jong started well at Newcastle but picked up a thigh injury after just three games for the Magpies . Newcastle's attacking midfielder de Jong posted on Facebook he has been ruled out for a further two months . The 25-year-old Holland international posted an upbeat message on his Facebook page but admitted he was still a long way from returning. It read: 'On my way back to Newcastle. Just saw the surgeon in London and all looks good. 'I can slowly start building up strength again and start walking without crutches. Still a couple of months to go but I'm going to work hard and I'm sure I will get back stronger!'

Ally McCoist’s men booked their place away to Alloa Athletic in the semi-finals of the Petrofac Training Cup with something to spare, eventually running out comfortable enough winners against East Fife. Goals from Jon Daly and Ian Black ensured the Fifers’ 41-year wait for a win over Rangers would go on. And, in Black, the visitors had the outstanding performer on view. One goal and an assist, plus a vital clearance, tell only part of the tale. The midfielder’s all-action performance brought a great deal to a quarter-final played in front of a small and slightly subdued crowd; this was never going to be one for the history books, more an opportunity for the diehards to prove their loyalty. Some of those with sharp memories may have recalled that, almost exactly a year ago, Dave King had made his most recent appearance at a Rangers game right here at Bayview. Back in the country for talks about a £16million rescue package for the club, he eschewed the delights of a bitterly cold night in Methil in favour of … well, take your pick. This postponed tie — put off from the weekend of the Germany-Scotland game because Rangers had lost too many players to international call-ups — was up against some pretty decent telly fitba, which perhaps contributed to East Fife’s decision not to repeat their experiment with temporary stands in expectation of a bumper crowd. Ian Black fires home his side's second goal of the night in their cup victory against East Fife . Black (second left) is congratulated by his team-mates as Rangers ease through to the semi-finals . Just over six weeks on, the hosts were content to bank the takings from a sell-out attendance of 2,000, all huddled into the one stand of this still-new stadium. If it remains a little exposed to the elements, there are plenty of worse places to watch a game in Scotland. The pitch is perfect, too. No excuses, then, for a visiting team expected to storm into the last four of a tournament offering the chance to win a trophy, be it ever so humble. Against a team severely depleted by injuries, to the extent that manager Gary Naysmith filled only four of the seven available substitutes’ places on the bench, Rangers showed three changes from the side who thrashed Raith Rovers at Ibrox on Saturday — including handing David Templeton a first start since August 23. Nicky Clark and Daly also started in place of Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd, one strike partnership replacing another. A pretty astute switch by McCoist, as it turned out. Having begun brightly enough, Rangers were actually beginning to toil just a little when Clark and Daly — aided and abetted by Black — combined for the opener with 29 minutes gone. Up to that point, we had seen Templeton show a great deal of willingness and intent, Lee Wallace rampaging forward from left-back to some effect — and a couple of good saves from home keeper Allan Fleming, his best from a low Templeton shot. Rangers strikers Kenny Miller (left) and Kris Boyd keep warm on a cold night in Methil . But East Fife’s man-marking, lying deep and letting the Rangers central defenders enjoy as much possession as possible, seemed set to stymie Rangers. Everything was becoming a little congested in and around the danger area. The breakthrough came as a great relief to the large away support, then. And it was well created, Black knocking the ball into Clark, who darted into the box and picked out a cross. Black’s attempt on goal was deflected — but Daly was right where he needed to be, virtually standing on the goal line, to nudge the ball home from inches. The Fifers, who had looked more than a little threatening in possession themselves, rallied after going a goal down. Black had to look sharp to block a deflected Allan Walker free-kick at the near post moments after the opener. Lee McCulloch had the ball in the net three minutes before the break, although he had been flagged for offside — one of three Rangers players on the wrong side of the line — well before finishing. Rangers manager Ally McCoist gestures on the touchline during his side's comfortable victory . Wallace had to look sharp to deny Nathan Austin a crack at goal from a Caolan McAleer cross as half-time approached, a reminder for Rangers they couldn’t relax on a 1-0 lead. Templeton’s pace began to cause serious problems for the hosts after the break, both Ewan Moyes and Ross Brown finding themselves booked for fouls on the quicksilver winger within the space of five minutes. The second of those offences led to a near thing in the home box, as a Black free-kick from the left wing resulted in a flashing Clark header that just cleared the far post. Another set-piece opportunity, this time for a Moyes foul on Clark, gave Black a more direct sight on goal just before the hour mark. One he wasn’t about to waste. Lining up his chance from the edge of the box, the midfielder simply drilled the ball past the wall and through goalkeeper Fleming. That was effectively the end of an unequal contest, with the introduction of former Scotland stars Miller and Boyd for Rangers emphasising the gulf between the sides. Why, it was almost like watching Bayern dominate in Rome. Almost.","Rangers cruised to a 2-0 victory against East Fife in the semi-finals of the Petrofac Training Cup .

"Denver quarterback Peyton Manning broke Brett Favre's NFL record for career touchdown passes when he threw his 509th scoring pass during the second quarter of the Broncos' game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. Manning's eight-yard pass was caught in the end zone by wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to eclipse the record of 508 regular season touchdowns Brett Favre set in 2010 while playing for the Minnesota Vikings. Manning acknowledged rapturous applause from the home crowd, who rose as one to salute the 38-year-old as his team-mates briefly played keepaway to keep the record football from Manning before finally handing the ball to the future Hall of Famer.

Manning, who added a 510th touchdown before leaving the game early as the Broncos demolished the 49ers 42-17, typically downplayed his accomplishment and said he planned to place a telephone call to Favre in the next day or so.

"Gus Poyet says he is not responsible for the strength of his squad at Sunderland as the fallout from their 8-0 humiliation at Southampton continues. Captain John O’Shea has confirmed that the players will refund supporters the cost of their match tickets - an estimated £60,000 – or make a donation to charity. The defender said: ‘We win and lose as a team, players, staff and fans. However, we wanted to acknowledge and thank the supporters who travelled such a long way to give us their backing and despite everything, stayed with us until the final whistle.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gus Poyet label the defeat the most embarrassing of his career . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet gestures on the touchline during the humiliating 8-0 defeat by Southampton . Sunderland fans were left stunned as their side was thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on Saturday . Poyet, meanwhile, has indicated that he has been left short this season despite nine new faces arriving at the Stadium of Light. But the Uruguayan wanted more having seen several senior players leave on free transfers - including Jack Colback, Phil Bardsley, Craig Gardner, Carlos Cuellar and David Vaughan - and Fabio Borini return to Liverpool following a successful loan stay. Sporting director Lee Congerton is the man responsible for overseeing recruitment – answering to owner Ellis Short - and he stated during the close-season that ‘quality’ and not ‘quantity’ was the club’s summer strategy. The Black Cats subsequently spent £14million – headlined by £10m Jack Rodwell from Manchester City – but Poyet repeatedly warned that a difficult season would lie in store unless key areas were strengthened. And the former Chelsea and Spurs midfielder now appears to have distanced himself from the club’s transfer business. ‘I’m a head coach,’ he said. ‘I don’t make the squad, that’s not my job. ‘I’ve got four defenders, I play what I’ve got. ‘I’ll take responsibility at a set-piece – it was me, I pick the team and put it on the pitch. ‘The rest, I’m sorry, I’m not going to take.’ Graziano Pelle celebrates the fifth goal with Dusan Tadic as Southampton ran riot . Saturday’s scoreline equalled Sunderland’s worst defeat in their history and they now take on Arsenal at home on Saturday where Poyet is set to make changes to the starting XI. Goalkeeper Vito Mannone faces the axe with deputy Costel Pantilimon – a free-transfer signing from Manchester City – poised to come in having made his first start for the Under-21s during Monday’s 1-0 win over Leicester City, a match watched by Poyet. The head coach, however, remains short of options with defenders Billy Jones and Sebastian Coates and attacking midfielders Ricky Alvarez and Emmanuele Giaccherini currently sidelined because of injury. Will Buckley was brought in by Poyet for £2.5m from his former club Brighton and the winger says the team has to make amends for their ‘Sunday League’ display at St Mary’s. Sunderland players look dejected as Southampton score their eighth goal at St Mary's on Sunday . ‘We need to pick ourselves up and make sure our performance is 100 times better than it was at Southampton,’ he said. ‘I’ve never experienced anything like that professionally. It’s a horrible feeling, especially for how many fans we brought down. ‘It’s gutting for us and we let ourselves down. We need to make it right on Saturday. ‘Those are the kind of results you see in Sunday League, so we have to make sure that doesn’t happen again. ‘We let the manager down and all the staff who have shown good faith in us. We need to make sure we put that right.’","Head coach Gus Poyet says he is not responsible for squad strength .

"Ally McCoist has revealed he is ‘extremely hopeful’ that rival businessmen Dave King and Mike Ashley will join forces to save troubled Rangers from fresh financial chaos. King jetted into Scotland earlier this week to address the Ibrox board on his £16million rescue package. The South African-based millionaire, who has teamed up with ex-Blue Knight Paul Murray and wealthy fan George Letham, spent around two hours spelling out his plans for investment which would also secure a 51 per cent stake in the club. Ashley, in the meantime, is trying to push through his own change and wants an egm that would remove King allies Graham Wallace and Philip Nash from their posts. Rangers manager Ally McCoist (C) takes part in a training session at Murray Park . McCoist is optimistic that business rivals Dave King and Mike Ashley can join forces to save the club . McCoist, however, remains optimistic the warring factions can strike a peace deal and secure the future of the Glasgow giants. ‘I’m delighted that now, for the first time, we have a serious opportunity of investment from a couple of areas,’ he said. ‘It’s been well documented that Mike Ashley has increased his shareholding and it has been well documented there has been a series of meetings with Dave King’s team and the board. ‘I would be extremely hopeful that a compromise and a deal can be done, involving all parties, allowing us to move forward. ‘If you are asking me whether I’d rather take two investors instead of one, or two instead of three, then I would obviously go for the greater amount of investment. ‘I don’t really know both personalities and I don’t know exactly what they want but I would imagine if they could work together it would increase investment. ‘So it would make sense to say if you have two great businessmen on board then it is better than one great businessman.’ Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (R) has increased his shareholding at the Ibrox club, despite fan's protests . Ashley’s increased involvement has proven unpopular with Rangers fans who last weekend staged protests at his Sports Direct stores after objecting to his growing influence at the club – with more ‘flash mob’ activities planned for coming weeks. It makes McCoist’s declaration on Friday that he would back an Ashley-King ‘dream team’ all the more noteworthy. ‘I spoke to Dave on the phone before his meeting,’ he said. ‘As you know I go back with Dave from the previous time he was on the board. ‘All he told me was that he was in meetings with the board. He hasn’t told me anything confidential in terms of the business side of things. Former director Dave King has started negotiations over a £16million rescue package . ‘He said he was hopeful of pushing things forward. He said he was very, very keen to get a deal done that will push the club forward. Other than that there was no indication of what the meetings where about and I haven’t spoken to him since. ‘Graham Wallace hasn’t put a specific timescale on it, but he was also hopeful that something would be sorted out sooner rather than later. ‘I’ve said all along that at some point in the near future we are going to need investment in the club. ‘You hear concerns about money running out and people not getting wages. That has never been said to us at all, but in terms of the team and club, whether it is Murray Park, Ibrox or strengthening the team we will definitely need investment. ‘The more investment we can get the better and now we have two fantastically respected businessmen hovering about the club with a view to taking it forward.’ McCoist insists that the only certainty regarding Rangers' future is that the club needs investment . McCoist however warned Ashley that his attempts to oust Wallace at an egm would cause further instability. ‘Of course it’s a concern,’ he said. ‘We’ve had more chief executives and potential owners in the last three years than we have done in the previous 30 years. ‘What would be concerning would be that it would create uncertainty and instability again with more changes at boardroom level. That wouldn’t be ideal. But that’s totally and 100 percent outwith my control.’","Rangers manager wants rival investors to form a 'dream team' to save club .

"FedEx Cup winner Billy Horschel admits missing the Ryder Cup was actually a blessing in disguise on a personal level. It was not so much avoiding another United States defeat as the fact it meant he could spend time at home following the birth of his first child. Horschel's final three finishes of last season were second, first, first as he claimed the 10 million dollar (£6.2million) FedEx Cup first prize but he was just too late for selection on to Tom Watson's team. That prevented him having to make a difficult decision as his daughter Skylar was born just two days' after he won the Tour Championship. Billy Horschel poses with the FedEx Cup after his victory at the East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta in September . Horschel, in action with Rory McIlroy (right),  during the final round of the Tour Championship . 'If I happened to be chosen we (he and his wife Britanny) were going to see what our doctors recommended, whether they could induce early or anything,' said Horschel, speaking ahead of his first start of the new season at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas. 'But it was a blessing in disguise. I loved it that she (Skylar) came when she did and that I wasn't picked because I was home for two weeks and I got to be with her for four weeks total. 'Those are four weeks early in her life that I'm happy I could be a part of because I'm going to miss a lot of weeks, unfortunately, with playing golf. It meant more to me than it did to her.' Having watched the Ryder Cup defeat at Gleneagles on television Horschel admits the US side has reached the point where something drastic has to be done. 'Like every American I think we're sort of tired of it. We're at a breaking point, and that's what you saw,' he added. 'You saw some players (referring to Phil Mickelson's open criticism of Watson's captaincy) that were frustrated and all they wanted to do was vent a little bit. 'I think that the process needs to change. I've been a little hard on the PGA of America but I feel like they need to do a better job than what they have done already.' Billy Horschel hits a shot from the fairway during the final round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla . Horschel finished last season with 12 successive sub-60 rounds and despite his new-found success he has no plans to alter his approach. 'Obviously with being the FedEx Cup champion you can have expectations soar but that's not going to change,' he added. 'I'm just going to keep that same mental approach. I don't expect anything less, I don't expect anything more from myself with being a FedExCup champion. 'I'm just going to have the same expectations I've had ever since I started playing this game. 'I'm going to keep getting better. I'm going to keep working hard, and if I just keep making small strides at improving in this game then hopefully everything else will take care of itself - that's the way it did at BMW and TOUR Championship.'","Billy Horschel missed out on selection for Tom Watson's American squad .

"Ibrox legend Barry Ferguson wants Dave King to be the new power behind Rangers. Speaking after King arrived in Glasgow this week for talks with directors and insisted he was confident of brokering a £16million funding package for the Championship outfit, Ferguson threw his weight behind the Castlemilk-born tycoon. The former Scotland and Rangers skipper would like the South African businessman to eventually gain control of the club - but is refusing to raise his hopes after seeing too many false dawns in Govan. Barry Ferguson (centre) joins radio hosts Peter Martin (left) and Alan Rough at Arnold Clark in Glasgow . ‘It’s good to see somebody like Dave King, who’s been at the club and knows what it’s all about, in talks,’ said Ferguson. ‘Ideally, somebody like him would come in but, until it’s actually signed and sealed, we just don’t know. ‘Until I see it in black and white and it’s done, then you can talk about it. Things have happened in the past and nothing has come of it. We don’t know how this will go. ‘That’s the biggest frustration for Rangers fans - my mates and people I meet on the street. One minute you think things are going well. The next minute it all falls flat on its face. ‘I don’t think any Rangers fans will be getting too excited right now. I’m the same as the vast majority. Until we see something happening, we can’t get excited because we have hit brick walls before.’ Dave King, pictured here in March, arrived in Glasgow this week for talks with Rangers directors . With the club in danger of running out of cash before the end of the year, King is trying to convince the board to accept his £16m bailout deal. Allied with former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham, he spoke with directors on Tuesday about his rescue package in which he would assume a 51 per cent stake in the club through a new share issue. But the situation has been complicated by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley’s ongoing move to oust chief executive Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors, who are both favourable to King’s plan. King was a director of Rangers for 11 years after investing £20m in 2000 and although Ferguson doesn’t claim to be close to him, he feels he is the right option for Rangers. ‘Mike Ashley has done a hell of a job at Newcastle but if you ask the vast majority of the Rangers fans they would want a Rangers supporter to take over and that would be Dave King,’ he said. Barry Ferguson had two spells with Rangers totalling 11 years and was once captain of the Ibrox club . ‘We visited his house in Johannesburg with Rangers once. He had a lot of memorabilia but I remember the size of his wine cellar more than anything. It was massive! ‘I spoke to Dave a few times. We never ever sat down and discussed things as he kept himself to himself. ‘But what I do know is he’s a Rangers fan and that’s what you want. ‘It’s a hard one because about a year ago, it looked as though Dave was coming back. Then it went quiet. ‘I said then that we needed someone like him to come in, take control and put the club back on the map. ‘Everyone is sick of it - from the fans to the players, management and staff at the club, they just want it sorted.’ Barry Ferguson was promoting Arnold Clark’s sponsorship of the Peter and Roughie Football phone-in show on Central FM, STV Glasgow and online.","Barry Ferguson supports Dave King's bid to gain control of the Ibrox club .

"Former England manager Steve McClaren has praised Roy Hodgson for the way he handled the 'nightmare' situation following Raheem Sterling's omission from the Estonia qualifier. Liverpool winger Sterling sparked controversy when he asked to sit out England's Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday because of fatigue and the Derby manager admitted some of his players were 'tired' when they reported for international duty this week. Derby manager and former England boss Steve McLaren has experienced demands of both club and country . But McClaren, who had a 16-month spell in charge of the Three Lions from 2006 to 2007, expressed sympathy for England boss Hodgson on Thursday as he attempts to deal with the latest club versus country debate. He said: 'I think Roy's handled the situation very well. Raheem looked as though he came on and changed the game and England got the win, so everybody's happy. 'At the end of the day once the players are in your care and you've got them and you think they're fit then you play them because you've got to win football matches - you're not bringing these players to look after them for the club. McClaren backed England boss Roy Hodgson for the way he handled Raheem Sterling controversy . 'Ultimately the club do suffer in the end because they do play an extra two games that you could do without at club level. 'We look at our players at Derby and they're tired. We've just played seven games in 20 days before this international break. 'I would love to phone Martin O'Neill and Gordon Strachan and say 'look our players are too tired', but I'm afraid once they go with the international teams we're relying on them. 'Everyone's honest and open and I'm sure we do look after the players, be that international or at the club, we want the best for every player. But they have to win football matches so if they're deemed fit to play they have to play and we can't do anything about it.'

"Sam Rush stopped short of a bunch of flowers and a candlelit dinner for two but, one year on, the Derby chief executive clearly remains enamoured with his head coach.

Will Hughes looks to get things ticking for Derby during the first half against Bournemouth . Hughes slotted home confidently to give the Rams the lead late on against Bournemouth . The 19-year-old wheels away in celebration after giving Derby the advantage at the IPro Stadium . Derby (4-3-2-1): Grant 6; Christie 7.5, Shotton 7, Keogh 6.5, Forsyth 7; Bryson 7, Eustace 7.5 (Best, 73, 4), Hughes 8; Ward 8 (Hendrick, 73, 4) Ibe 5 (Russell, 46mins, 6 ); Martin 7.

Sent off: Camp. Referee: Scott Mathieson 6 . Attendance: 26,725 . Man of the match: Hughes . They were hard-earned points too, with late goals from Will Hughes and Chris Martin after Bournemouth goalkeeper Lee Camp (right) was sent off for handling outside the area. Camp is a lifelong Derby fan, having been born and brought up in the city. He will be cast in the role of villain forever at the iPro Stadium, because he once also played for Nottingham Forest. There was little sympathy, therefore, when Camp went rushing out of his area to stop Jamie Ward, who emerged from the clash to shoot into an empty net. That is when the trouble started. Referee Scott Mathieson pulled the play back, disallowed the goal and dismissed Camp. Both sets of players argued for several minutes before Chris Martin took the free kick and hit a post. ‘We feel quite hard done by,’ said Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe. ‘We would have preferred to go one goal down and keep 11 men on the pitch.’ McClaren’s verdict was similar, although from a vantage point of fourth in the table. ‘We’ve put down a big marker, a big statement,’ said the Derby manager. Craig Bryson takes aim at goal during Derby's goalless draw against Bournemouth . On-loan Liverpool forward Jordan Ibe takes control off the ball as he looks to set up an attack for Derby . ‘The sending off was a bizarre decision. We would have taken the goal and kept it at 11-11. The players knew that this was important and they were a little nervous. But we were patient and controlled the game and it’s all about the result.’ Even down to 10 men, Bournemouth defended well and made it difficult for the home side. Hughes finally made the breakthrough after a one-two with Martin, who then scored his seventh of the season deep into injury time after a great cross from Russell. McClaren joked afterwards that Hughes has been practising his shooting ‘and his shots reach the goal now’. Bournemouth had to perform with a tiny band of followers as the Football League piloted a scheme in which the match was broadcast live at the Goldsands Stadium.

"Andrew Flintoff has revealed his infamous pedalo incident in the Caribbean was an attempt to get out to sea and find the boat on which he believed Ian Botham was enjoying a late-night drink. England's former dual Ashes-winning all-rounder said he still regrets the moment - and the consequences when England's then coach Duncan Fletcher found out about his drunken expedition. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Freddie Flintoff crashes rally car in A League Of Their Own (archive) Andrew Flintoff (left) was trying to find Ian Botham (right) when he had his misadventure in 2007 . In 'Piers Morgan's Life Stories: Andrew Flintoff', to be screened by ITV at 9pm on Friday, 'Freddie' relives many of his escapades. As well as his revelation that he suffered, during his playing days, from bulimia, Flintoff recalls his misadventure in St Lucia at the 2007 World Cup - as well as his post-Ashes trip to Downing Street in 2005, and meeting the Queen. England's Andrew Flintoff and coach Duncan Fletcher (left) arrive for press conference in 2007 . It was an intended date with cricketing royalty, though, that got him into trouble in the Windies - not least with Fletcher, who swiftly banned him from England's next match and put him before the press to explain what had happened. What Flintoff did not tell them at the time was that his reason for boarding a pedalo - from which he was eventually rescued - was his decision, on a late-night whim, to head out across the bay by whatever means for an impromptu nightcap with Botham. Flintoff said: 'We'd played New Zealand on the Friday, the first game of the World Cup, and things hadn't being going well. Andrew Flintoff, left, and Duncan Fletcher answer questions about pedalo incident in 2007 . 'We'd just come off the back of the Ashes (whitewash defeat under his captaincy in 2006-07), and I was so desperate to do well in this World Cup. 'I went out, I got a duck, out first ball actually ... then I didn't get a wicket, and then we got beat. 'I went back to the hotel room ... I thought ... 'I'm not going out' ... but I was in my room, I was smashing the room up, I was gutted and then I thought ... 'I'm going to go out for a bit'.' That was his first mistake. A pedalo on Reduit Beach where drunken, non-swimmer Andrew Flintoff fell into the sea . 'About 1.30am I thought ... 'I'm hammered here, go home'. 'I had to walk partially across the beach. 'For some reason I had this idea these boats out to sea - it sounds bizarre - but I knew Ian Botham was on one (boat) and I thought ... 'I'm going to have a nightcap with Beefy'. 'I thought 'I can't swim ... that would be dangerous', so I was going to get a kayak.' Botham, the Flintoff of the 1980s, was on the tour as a television pundit. Andrew Flintoff was stripped off the vice-captaincy at the 2007 World Cup . Their meeting on this occasion never happened as non-swimmer Flintoff had fallen into the sea and could easily have drowned. 'I couldn't find the oars, so I dragged this pedalo into the water,' added Flintoff. 'The next morning I woke up, I was on my bed and ... still wet and ... sand between my toes. 'Then the door knocked. The door had these slats, and I thought it was the maid wanting to clean the room. 'So I said 'can you come back?'. Escapade revealed In 'Piers Morgan's Life Stories: Andrew Flintoff', to be screened by ITV on Friday . 'But it was the coach. I pulled the slats down and answered the door, and then Duncan just said 'my room - now'.' What followed, even eight years on at the age of 36, remains a hugely embarrassing wake-up call for Flintoff. 'It was a real low point ... I had this press conference and walked across the hotel reception - and the England fans, who were only a months previously cheering my name and high-fiving me ... were shaking their heads. 'I couldn't make eye contact with them and I thought 'this isn't good'.'","Andrew Flintoff says pedalo incident in the Caribbean was an attempt to get out to sea and find a boat .

"Records tumbled across Europe on Tuesday night, as the sixteen sides in Champions League action showed little regard for defending. Forty goals were scored, the most on an eight-game Champions League evening ever. The Stadio Olimpico offered the best value for money in terms of goals-per-minute, as Roma were thumped 7-1 at home by Pep Guardiola's imperious Bayern Munich. That was not the only record to be broken though, so read on to find who else etched their names in Champions League folklore, and where and when the forty goals flew in... Bayern Munich trio Juan Bernat, Philipp Lahm and David Alaba applaud their travelling fans after the 7-1 win . Roma boss Rudi Garcia looks dejected  at the Stadio Olimpico after seeing his team get torn apart by Bayern . The Bavarian giants' starting XI vs Lille on November 7, 2012: . Bayern (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Lahm, Dante, Boateng, Alaba; Schweinsteiger, Martinez; Ribery, Muller, Robben; Pizarro. Subs used: Shaqiri, Kroos, Tymoshchuk. Eight of the players that helped dismantle Rudi Garcia's Lille side played at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma, with Thomas Muller, Franck Ribery, Xherdan Shaqiri and Arjen Robben responsible for five of the seven goals. DEJA-VU FOR RUDI GARCIA . Rudi Garcia must hate the sight of Bayern Munich. The Roma boss watched Pep Guardiola's side smash five past his hapless team before the break - and remarkably it wasn't the first time the Frenchman has been in that position. Two years ago he was in the Lille technical area when Claudio Pizarro ran riot in the first half at the Allianz Arena, scoring the fifth-fastest hat-trick in Champions League history, as Bayern led 5-0 at interval, before easing off in the second half to win *just* 6-1. Xherdan Shaqiri set a record for the visitors as they roared t victory. The Swiss forward scored the fastest goal via a substitute this season in the Champions League, in just 71 seconds. Arjen Robben, who played when Bayern beat Lille 6-1 in 2012, scored the opening goal at the Stadio Olimpico .

Shakhtar racked up the biggest half-time lead in Champions League history, by putting six goals past BATE Borisov, while their striker Luiz Adriano became only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game. Lionel Messi was the first, the Argentine magician achieving the feat in a 7-1 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. In Shakhtar's astonishing opening 45 minutes, Adriano also scored the third quickest hat-trick in Champions League history (12 minutes). The Ukrainian side went on to win 7-0. Luiz Adriano walked away with the matchball, and some, after scoring five in Shakhtar's 7-0 win over BATE . The Brazilian was unstoppable for his team, scoring the third quickest Champions League hat-trick ever . Adriano also matched Messi by scoring five in a Champions League game, which the Argentina did in 2012 . They were 40 goals on Tuesday night in the Champions League. This is the most on a Champions League evening featuring eight games – the record is 44 set on October 1997 (12 games played). Along with Bayern's 7-1 rout of Roma and Shakhtar's 7-0 win away to BATE Borisov, Schalke and Sporting Lisbon served up a seven-goal thriller which the Germans edged 4-3, while in the early kick-off CSKA Moscow and Manchester City played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in front of fewer than 1,000 people at the Arena Khimki.

"Neil Warnock is under investigation by the FA for his comments about referee Craig Pawson following Crystal Palace’s home defeat by Chelsea on Saturday. The FA are looking at the interview during which Warnock claimed Pawson had been looking to ‘even up’ the teams by sending off Damien Delaney two minutes after showing a red card to Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta. Neil Warnock looks on prior to the Barclays Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Chelsea . Warnock claimed the officials had been influenced by the Chelsea players, including John Terry, on Saturday . The Palace manager also claimed the officials was influenced by the Chelsea players and inferred they had been operating double-standards, failing to book John Terry but showing Delaney the first of his two yellow cards for a similar foul. The FA must rule on whether any of his comments have questioned the integrity of Pawson and his assistants, before deciding to charge him, issue an official warning or say there is no case to answer. In his press conference, Warnock told reporters: ‘They buzzed me down from upstairs saying it’ll be evened up if we’re not careful. Delaney shouldn’t have given him a chance but it was wrong that four or five Chelsea players surrounded the referee. 'I thought he was influenced by one or two things. John Terry’s (non) booking — if that’s one of my players, it’s a booking. I don’t understand why it’s not an even platform.’ Cesar Azpilicueta was shown a straight red card for a two-footed challenge on Mile Jedinak . Referee Craig Pawson then sent off Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney two minutes later . Warnock has a history of disciplinary trouble for criticising referees but this is his first scrape since returning to Palace.

"Chelsea take on Slovenian opponents for the first time on Tuesday when NK Maribor visit Stamford Bridge. The Blues – held 1-1 by Schalke in their last home outing – cannot afford another slip-up if they’re to enjoy a smooth passage into the knockout phase of the Champions League. So who are the visitors from the former Yugoslavia? Sportsmail brings you more… . First things first, a bit of history? Maribor's Muamer Vugdalic (right)  takes on Lazio's Dejan Stankovic in the Champions League back in 1999 . In recent times they have been the dominant force of Slovenian football and are currently defending what would be a fifth straight title. They were only formed in 1960 in the wake of NK Branik’s closure. Branik were another club from Maribor who were accused of poisoning their opponents ahead of a playoff match and were subsequently disbanded. The newly-formed club survived a bribery scandal in the early Eighties – for which they were relegated to the Yugoslav third division – and following independence won the first Slovenian Cup in 1992. Twelve titles and seven more cups have followed, as has participation in the Champions League, this season’s entry being their second in the competition’s group stages. So how are they faring this season? Luka Zahovic, son of Slovenian football legend Zlatko, has been in great form for NK Maribor this season . They are six points off top in third position but have a game in hand over leaders Domzale and remain strong favourites to take the title, although they were beaten 2-1 at home to Celje on Saturday in what was a shock result. They do, though, boast the league’s top scorer in the form of eight-goal Luka Zahovic. Zahovic? I recognise that name… . Yes, the 18-year-old is the son of Slovenia’s greatest-ever player and record goalscorer, Zlatko, who is now the director of football at Maribor, his hometown club. Luka was born in Portugal during his father’s playing career in the country and joined Benfica’s youth ranks before moving to Maribor as a teenager. He is now a Slovenia youth international but qualifies to play for Portugal and is fluent in Slovenian, Portuguese, English and Spanish. Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovic celebrates scoring against Spain at Euro 2000 in Belgium . Who else should we look out for? Brazilian striker Marcos Tavares is a club legend. The captain has scored 121 goals in eight seasons with Maribor and became the club’s record marksman in May. He is skilful and daring and is the one to watch, for sure. Maribor's Brazilian striker Marcos Tavares has scored 121 goals in eight seasons with the Slovenians . Who is the boss? Ante Simundza was assistant to Darko Milanic – the current Leeds boss – for three seasons before taking the reins himself in 2013. He was a player back in 1999 when Maribor made it to the Champions League group stages and finished bottom after picking up four points from Lazio, Dynamo Kiev and Bayer Leverkusen. NK Maribor's Slovenian manager Ante Simundza speaks to the press before his side's clash with Chelsea . Leeds boss Darko Milanic spent five seasons in charge of Maribor before leaving for England . What can we expect from them? They’ll be well organised and compact with Tavares probably operating as a lone striker. They’ve forced two draws against Schalke and Sporting Lisbon and beat Celtic to reach the group stages. They’ll try to frustrate Chelsea in the hope that Tavares – or perhaps Zahovic from the bench – can nick a goal. But given the disparity in quality of the two squads, the hosts should run out easy winners.","Chelsea take on Slovenian opponents for the first time .

"It was perhaps meant to be that Didier Drogba's first goal in his second spell at Chelsea came from the penalty spot in the Champions League - just as his first period at the club ended. And the Chelsea legend went for the same corner of the net as his winning spot kick in Munich just over two years ago, this time marking the 12th consecutive season in which he has scored in the Champions League. Only Real Madrid and Schalke's Raul has a better record, notching in 14 campaigns back-to-back, while Ryan Giggs managed 11.

Drogba started his run in the 2003/04 season with Marseille before scoring in all eight of his previous seasons in the competition with Chelsea. He then grabbed goals in the past two seasons for Turkish club Galatasaray during his time there. And his 23rd minute penalty made it 12-in-a-row as well as giving Chelsea a 2-0 lead that Maribor never looked likely to overhaul. It was his seventh appearance of the season in a bit-part role in Jose Mourinho's squad, but the Ivorian could end up starting at Old Trafford against Manchester United on Sunday with Diego Costa and Loic Remy both nursing injuries.

The last time John Terry and  Drogba scored in the same match for Chelsea was back in March 14, 2012, in the 4-1 Champions League win over Napoli. Chelsea went on to win the competition that year. What chances of Terry and Drogba replicating the feat again this season? Loic Remy limped off to be replaced by Drogba against Maribor and it is feared he could miss the next game .

"England boss Roy Hodgson has been getting some social media stick for his decision to watch Chelsea's Champions League clash with Maribor at Stamford Bridge.

So who was Hodgson keeping tabs on at the Bridge? Roy Hodgson beams before kick-off at Stamford Bridge alongside his England assistant Ray Lewington . John Terry makes it 3-0 for Chelsea after running the length of the pitch to add the finishing touch to a counter . England's next Euro 2016 qualification match is on November 15 against Slovenia, where Chelsea's opponents on Tuesday, Maribor, hail from. They were unbeaten in eight Champions League games this season before they ventured to west London, and three of their starting XI on Tuesday were included in the Slovenia squad for qualification matches against Switzerland and Lithuania earlier this month. Mitja Viler . The left-back was at fault for the first goal as Loic Remy cut in from the right-hand side, pushed the ball on to his left foot and then curled a shot into the far corner.

The left-back gets his legs tangled as Eden Hazard's effort flicks off his heel and ricochets in to make it 4-0 . Ales Mertelj and Zeljko Filipovic . Maribor's central-midfield pair were always going to struggle against the likes of Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas, two of the most in-form midfielders in not just England but also Europe. Chelsea dominated the centre of the pitch as Mertelj and Filipovic failed to cope with their pace and power. The visitors also created very little going forward as their midfield repeatedly gave the ball away cheaply. So, all in all, not much to worry about for Roy.

The frontman believes the current Chelsea squad is packed with quality and told ITV after the victory: 'The winning spirit is coming. The desire to score goals together as a team is good. Didier Drogba claims the 'winning spirit is coming' and believes the current Chelsea squad is full of quality . 'We have a lot more quality than in previous Chelsea teams I played with. The team is younger but there is still room for improvement.' Drogba - who doubled Chelsea's lead after requesting usual penalty taker Eden Hazard step aside - was desperate to get off the mark. 'I have to be honest I wanted to score. I asked (Hazard) and he said yes. 'This is the spirit we have in this team. We share goals and they help with my confidence,' laughed the 36-year-old. Didier Drogba scored his first goal for Chelsea since his return to Stamford Bridge from the penalty spot . While Chelsea boss manager Mourinho wasn't initially impressed with Hazard's decision to accept Drogba's request, the Portuguese admitted it was good to see the striker complete 75 minutes after coming on for the injured Loic Remy. With Diego Costa and Remy expected to miss Sunday's trip to Manchester United, Mourinho may have to turn to Drogba. Asked if he expected to play at Old Trafford, Drogba replied: 'I don't know, the manager will decide. I'm available for the team as always. Loic Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who travel to Manchester United next Sunday .","Didier Drogba believes the current Chelsea team is one of the best he has been a part of at Stamford Bridge .

"Lancashire skipper Paul Horton has been suspended from the opening two matches of next year's NatWest t20 Blast after showing dissent to the umpires during this year's final against Birmingham Bears. Horton was handed the punishment by the England and Wales Cricket Board's Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) after being reported by the match officials for his actions during the August 23 clash at Edgbaston. The 31-year-old batsman was visibly angry at being given out caught down the leg-side off the bowling of spinner Jeetan Patel for one in Lancashire's four-run defeat to Birmingham. Banned: Lancashire captain Paul Horton has been banned for two games for dissent . Joy: Horton celebrates the wicket of Ian Bell with team-mates Andrew Flintoff during last year's final . The penalty for the Level Two breach of the ECB's Discipline Code - showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision by word or action - is three penalty points, but the CDC deemed further action was necessary on this occasion and has handed Horton the two-match ban. Horton, who has accepted the punishment, said: 'I apologise to the umpires for my actions. I realise that these were unacceptable, particularly given the high profile nature of the match, watched by millions around the world on TV and a full house at Edgbaston. 'As players we must be aware of our responsibilities as role models, none more so than the captain.'","Horton suspended for first two matches of next year's Natwest t20 Blast .

"Wigan have locked up the futures of head coach Shaun Wane and captain Sean O'Loughlin on three-year deals. News of the deals comes on the eve of Wigan's Super League Grand Final showdown against St Helens at Old Trafford on Saturday. Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan said: 'The contract extensions of Shaun and Sean are very important to the Wigan Club. It is very symbolic that we have jointly announced these deals as it is very evident that they work very well together. Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin has agreed a new three-year deal at the club . 'There is a lot of trust between them and we couldn't have two more committed people in the key positions of head coach and captain of Wigan.' Wane, who made more than 150 appearances for his hometown club between 1981 and 1990, has been head coach since 2012 and won the League Leader's Shield in his first season before a Grand Final and Challenge Cup double last year. His new contract includes a clause which will see it roll on after the initial three-year period expires. O'Loughlin's association with the club is almost as long, and longer if you consider both his father Keiron and uncle Kevin played for the Warriors. The England captain has made 342 appearances for Wigan since his debut in 2002. 'Shaun Wane has earned his extension on the back of the 2013 Super League and Challenge Cup double and now leading his team to the 2014 Grand Final,' Lenagan added. 'Anyone who saw the recent World Club Challenge documentary will see the passion that he carries into his role and will understand why we have extended his contract for a minimum of three years and rolling thereafter. Head coach Shaun Wane has also agreed a new three-year deal with the Warriors . 'In Sean O'Loughlin, we are lucky to have one of the world's most respected rugby league players. He is still producing high level performances and we are confident that he can continue this in the coming years. 'The recent announcement of him becoming England captain is a reward for having a career of consistency and quality. He is a fine role model and we are proud that he leads us.' Wigan are strong favourites for Saturday's contest at Old Trafford against a Saints side who have lost in their last five appearances on the ground . Wane, a Manchester United fan who is eager to add to his success at Old Trafford, said he was happy to commit himself to a club with the same ambitions as his own. 'I am really pleased to sign an extension to my present contract with my hometown club,' he said. 'I am very happy here, working with a group of people whose desire to win and improve completely matches mine. 'There is still a lot I want to achieve at Wigan and I will always be totally committed to achieving those goals. I would like to thank everyone involved at the club; the players, all the staff and in particular Ian Lenagan for their continued support.' St Helens captain Paul Wellens holds the Super League trophy with Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin . O'Loughlin, 31, revealed he has agreed to move into coaching with Wigan at the end of his playing career. 'I am delighted to have extended my stay with Wigan,' he said. 'The club has been my life. I have been through some tough times but it has all been worth it to experience the great times that the club is now enjoying. 'I love working with this group of players and coaching staff and I am confident that the club will continue to grow and improve. I still have a lot of personal ambition and I am as hungry as ever to win more trophies with this great club, before moving on to my agreed coaching position at Wigan.'","News of the deals comes on the eve of Wigan's Super League Grand Final showdown against St Helens .

"Wigan and Saints is a fierce rivalry befitting of Saturday evening’s Grand Final. It divides families, villages and, this year in particular, the staff room of St Edmund Arrowsmith High School in Ashton-in -Makerfield. Just 200 metres over the border into Wigan from St Helens, its pupils come from both towns. On weeks like these, the split between supporters of the rugby league teams is accentuated and feelings at the school, known fondly as Eddies, are heightened by the presence of two of their former number on opposing sides. Wigan’s brilliant young winger Joe Burgess and Saints’ robust forward Luke Thompson, both just 19, have earned their starting places in the biggest game of the year. It is just three years since they were classmates turning out in the same school team. Joe Burgess surges through the Warrington defence as Wigan close in on another Grand Final appearance . Luke Thompson (C) of St Helens fights off London Bronco's Luke Dorn during a Super League match . Headteacher Mark Dumican is a born-and-bred Wiganer. ‘The rivalry is incredibly fierce, it’s all-on even from school level,’ he said. ‘It’s in your blood, you get it knocked into you that whatever happens the rest of the year doesn’t matter as long as you beat St Helens. My best scenario will be for Joe and Luke to both play really well and Joe to score in the corner with 10 seconds to go.’ Incredibly, the last time Wigan and Saints met in the season- ending showpiece in 2010, Eddies again had a former pupil on each side with Darrell Goulding playing for Wigan and Jamie Foster for Saints. John Griffin, head of rugby, proudly highlights the school’s wall of fame. Pictures of Burgess, Thompson, Goulding and Foster are displayed alongside recently retired England star Shaun Briscoe and Scotland’s John Duffy. Jane O’Donoghue, a former British tennis player who once faced Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon has her spot. But in these parts nothing gets blood pumping like rugby league. ‘It’s a 60-40 split in favour of Wigan,’ Griffin informs me with a wry smile. ‘There’ll be plenty of friendly jibes and staff-room bragging rights are at stake.’ Burgess (C) has been tipped for great things after scoring the winning try for Wigan in the semi-final . Wigan teammates pile on top of Burgess as they seek to retain their title in the Grand Final . Griffin will take his seat in the executive box at Old Trafford as a guest of the Rugby Football League, in acknowledgment of his service to school rugby. ‘They always really stood out but for different reasons,’ he added, ‘Luke was quieter but always a big, strong lad. Joe has always been very quick but he’s grown four inches and put on five stone since joining Wigan.’ Barrie McDermott, a hall of famer turned pundit, identified Burgess and Thompson as players who would break through this season. Burgess has made an instant impact with his speed and clarity of thinking — notably scoring the winning try in last week’s semi-final victory over Warrington. Thompson, meanwhile, has impressed in an injury-hit side. Thompson and Burgess (R) were former teammates at the St Edmund Arrowsmith High School . It was Burgess’s dedication that most impressed PE teacher Sean Bradley. ‘We were playing our big rivals St Peter’s and Joe was really sick and off school. But I called his mum (Cath) and said, “We really need him,” so she brought him down. He was white as a sheet but he played well, we won, then he went back to his sick bed, poor lad. But that’s the mark of the man.’ Bradley, who has been goalkeeping coach at Wigan Athletic’s academy for nine years, considered putting Burgess in goal. ‘He was an all-round athlete, a runner and a footballer. He was over six foot, had great wingspan and handling skills, so could have been a goalkeeper. He could have been earning millions in the Premier League and he gets peanuts in comparison. But he had so much passion for rugby league.’ Jamie Foster (L) and Darrel Goulding also went to the same school as Burgess and Thompson and played on opposing sides of the 2010 Grand Final . Five miles down the road at amateur club Ince Rose Bridge, where Burgess played from seven to 16, when he then joined Wigan, he was often subject to mistaken identity. ‘A lot of people asked if he was another Burgess brother,’ said coach Chris Prescott, referring to the four brothers from Dewsbury who moved to Australia to ply their trade. ‘He was so talented, he’d score five tries a game and was hugely popular.’ He might not be a relative but Joe could soon be following his namesakes down under. Several NRL teams have shown interest in signing him and he could make the move as soon as next season.","Joe Burgess and Luke Thompson were schoolmates only three years ago .

"Paul Wellens is convinced that St Helens’ eight-year run without a Grand Final win will count for nothing when they face Wigan at Old Trafford on Saturday. The 34-year-old is one of only two survivors — along with James Roby — from the club’s last victory in 2006, which was followed by five consecutive final defeats. But despite the bad run, Wellens is upbeat. The Saints skipper, who was raised in the town and has played for the club since he was 18, said: ‘If you’d told me in 2006 that we wouldn’t win another then I wouldn’t have believed it. We have no trouble in getting there because we have done it numerous times in the past. St Helens fullback Paul Wellens is confident the Saints will finally find success again in the Grand Final . ‘When players come to Saints they have to realise that a club of this stature has expectations to be successful. ‘This is a very different group of players to the ones that played in those Grand Final defeats. We are confident, in great mood and looking forward to the challenge.’ Saints have lost three of their best players to injury this season — Jon Wilkin with a dislocated shoulder, Luke Walsh with a broken leg and Jonny Lomax with a knee injury and Wellens said people ‘were quick to write us off’. But he added: ‘It’s tested our resolve and we’ve passed with flying colours.’ Wellens (left) holds the Super League trophy with Wigan Warriors captain Sean O'Loughlin .","St Helens have gone eight years without Grand Final success .

Paul is a stalwart of the game, playing in his tenth Grand Final. He is the eyes from the back. He can see where the attacks are coming from and he’ll be barking at the guys all game to make sure they get up and shut Wigan down. St Helens captain Wellen poses with Saints skipper Sean O'Loughlin ahead of the Grand Final . Sean is almost like a coach on the field. He can execute game changing passes when the pressure is on and when things don’t go their way, he has the experience to calm the troops and put plan b into action. He will be talking to the younger players and making sure their mindset is right. Coaches – Shaun Wane v Nathan Brown . Shaun is a born-and-bred Wiganer so he knows the importance of winning this game to the town. He certainly doesn’t mince his words. He wants honesty from his players and if he doesn’t get performances he drops them. Wigan's Shane Wane (L) is a no-nonsense coach while Nathan Brown has coped well with St Helens injuries . Nathan has faced season ending injuries to three of his key players – Jon Wilkin, Luke Walsh and Jonny Lomax. They’re players who make the team tick. The fact he’s been able to adjust midway through the season marks him out as a special coach. VERDICT – I believe Wigan have the edge because of their experience and power.

"Beijing’s Bird’s Nest Stadium is gearing up for the first Superclásico de las Americas to be held outside of Argentina or Brazil on Saturday and interest from Chinese fans is massive ahead of the historic tie. Fans mobbed Lionel Messi and his Argentina team mates  as they arrived into Beijing International airport and China’s Yangtze Evening News reported an accident was prevented following one fan’s decision to switch escalator’s to get close to the players. Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency has also revealed that the Argentina squad skipped a trip to Beijing’s famous Forbidden City due to security worries. VIDEO Scroll down for footage of Argentina and Brazil training in China . Kaka is back in the Brazil squad and he is more popular with Chinese fans than Barca superstar Neymar . Messi, still the biggest attraction, gears up for the glamour friendly with Brazil in Beijing with some kick ups . For more from Peter Davis follow him on Twitter, @peteydavis . This isn’t the first time China has experienced enthusiastic crowds, the visit of David Beckham caused a stampede at Shanghai’s Tongji University last year injuring 5 people. The Brazil squad was also greeted by huge crowds as they arrived into Beijing but surprisingly it’s not Neymar the Chinese fans were most excited for but his more experienced team mate Kaka. The 32 year old with three World Cup appearances to his name returns to the Brazil set up following an 18 month exile. Despite the looming shadow of 22-year-old Barcelona star Neymar, Kaka is held in high regard by Chinese fans. Brazil coach Dunga called up Kaka to replace injured Cruzeiro midfielder Ricardo Goular; he signed autographs and posed for pictures on his arrival into the airport and at his hotel. Hundreds of fans greeted Messi's arrival, and many more were reported to be at the players' hotel . Neymar and Brazilian team-mates Willian and Oscar try to get through Beijing Capital International Airport . Kaka chats with Brazil team-mates, including Willian, at the National Stadium ahead of his international return . Ifeng, the official Chinese website of the Superclásico, polled fans on their favorite players from the two squads with Argentina’s Lionel Messi the clear winner on over 212,000 votes. In second place though is Brazilian Kaka with 76,000 votes way ahead of compatriot Neymar on 24,000 in third place. AC Milan and Beijing Baxy fan Jincheng Xu explained to Sportsmail the fascination with the recalled Brazil star. ‘Kaka has good qualities and a good personality as a man, there is never any negative news about him. He is the perfect professional football player in our eyes.’ ‘Both Kaka and Neymar are talented players but Kaka is more humble and experienced than Neymar and that is what is important to Chinese fans, having that kind of role model’ said Xu. Messi is the most popular player in China and was mobbed by fans as he arrived at the airport . Dunga is building on a new era for Brazil after a humiliating exit at the World Cup last summer . Kaka loses out in the Chinese social media stakes though where he has only 0.71 million followers on social networking site Tencent Weibo in comparison to Messi with nearly 20 million on rival site Sina Weibo. Saturday’s game is a friendly but that’s hardly the appropriate word for this rivalry. Since 1914 there have been 95 meetings between the two nations with results almost even, Argentina on 36 victories, Brazil with 35 and 24 matches finishing in a draw. In terms of Chinese public opinion on Saturday’s result, things are not as close. Chinese website Sohu is reporting 74.3 per cent of fans in a 14,000 strong online discussion are going for Argentina in the clash which has been the focus of heavy advertising in recent weeks. Sergio Aguero, Messi and Angel di Maria take part in Argentina's training session on Thursday . Messi and Di Maria will be hoping to continue their fine club form in the Chinese capital . Not just the first on foreign soil, Saturday is also the first Superclásico de las Américas to allow call up’s from foreign countries. Argentina have taken full advantage of this with just three of their 24 man squad based at home while Brazil bring nine. Dunga replaced Chelsea’s Ramires with uncapped Sao Paulo midfielder Souza while Botafogo goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe was also added late due to a finger injury to Jefferson. Following the clash Brazil will face Japan in Singapore on the October 14 while Argentina face Hong Kong the same day. While games like this are not often treated seriously abroad, Chinese fans are not lacking in commitment as the game approaches. Kaka poses with PSG defender David Luiz ahead of the Brazil squad's arrival in Beijing . The returning Brazil star trains but there are fears about pollution in the Chinese capital this week . Student Fan Xiao of Shandong University traveled 460km from Jinan to Beijing not just for the game itself but for glimpses of her idols. ‘I am a big Brazil fan, I don’t want to miss this opportunity to see them,’ says Xiao. ‘In the last three days I went to the airport three times and saw the team train every day. I got the autographs of five players including my hero Mario Fernandes. This will be one of the best memories of my life.’ Despite the excitement over their arrival and anticipation of the game, something far beyond Chinese fans' control may have a big effect on the game - pollution. The Brazilian team trained on Friday but are spending as much time as possible in their hotel before the game . Beijing has had a tough few years with the issue and since Wednesday, levels have been labeled ‘Hazardous’ with masks recommended, hardly ideal for a professional football match. Conditions have apparently kept Brazil inside their hotel, aside from a brief training session, but despite the threat Chinese fans remain upbeat. Chinese social media users have suggested that Lionel Messi should wear a mask when he plays so they still get to see the Argentine turn out; fingers are crossed for the pollution to clear for Saturday’s clash.","Chinese fans in a frenzy over Brazil vs Argentina clash .

"Liverpool will not sell the naming rights to Anfield but will consider re-branding their Main Stand. Last season's Premier League runners-up are on the cusp of getting the final all clear to proceed with the expansion of Anfield - changing the stadium's capacity to 59,000. Pivotal to this is the £75million expansion of the club's Main Stand. Liverpool chief commercial officer Billy Hogan says the club will not sell the naming rights to Anfield . Anfield could look like this should its potential 13,000 seats be added to bring its capacity to about 58,800 .

Chief commercial officer Billy Hogan said: 'We wouldn’t consider selling naming rights for the stadium as a whole but in terms of the name of the Main Stand that’s something we will look at. 'The new main stand is going to be a big focus for all of us. The process is still ongoing. We’re getting closer to certainty but we’re not there yet.' Talking to the Liverpool Echo, he added: 'When that certainty arrives from a commercial standpoint we’ll be ready to get to work on that. 'We’ll be looking to bring in a number of new partners.

"Jolyon Palmer is extremely confident he will compete in Formula One after becoming the first Briton since Lewis Hamilton in 2006 to win the GP2 title. Palmer - the son of Jonathan Palmer, who competed in 83 grands prix between 1983 and 1989 - clinched the championship in style with victory in the feature race at Russia's Sochi Autodrom on Saturday. It was the 23-year-old's fourth win of the season, and 11th podium of his fourth campaign in GP2, and now there is only one goal. Jolyon Palmer celebrates after winning the GP2 title following victory in Russia . Lewis Hamilton was the last Brit to win the GP2 championships after taking the title in 2006 . 'Formula One! I'm confident,' said Palmer, from Horsham in Sussex. 'The first priority was to win GP2, and I was always confident if I did win GP2 I was going to be in Formula One. 'Now that's done and I'm confident I'll be in Formula One. I'm not saying it is going to be easy, but this title is a big help. 'We're going to have to wait for a few weeks and see what happens, but I feel ready for it. I'm driving at the top of my game right now. 'GP2 is the perfect series to feed into Formula One - the same tyres, the same tracks, the cars are even now a similar speed, especially into the corners. 'I feel absolutely ready for it and I am confident it can happen.' Palmer insists he is 'absolutely ready' to step up and compete at the highest level . Nico Rosberg 2005 . Lewis Hamilton 2006 . Timo Glock 2007 . Giorgio Pantano 2008 . Pastor Maldonado 2010 . Romain Grosjean 2011 . Palmer is the 10th GP2 champion since F1's feeder series began in 2005, and of the previous nine, six have graduated to the upper echelon of motorsport. Whatever the future holds for Palmer, he knows no one can take away his success this season. The DAMS driver added: 'We fought for every pole and every feature race win. We barely made any mistakes. 'It's been an absolute dream season and to be champion at the earliest opportunity for me is the icing on the cake.' British motorsport could be celebrating a double triumph in Russia this weekend as 21-year-old Alex Lynn is on the brink of being crowned GP3 champion. Jolyon will be boosted by the fact that six of nine previous GP2 winners have gone on to race in F1 . Lynn - from Great Dunmow in Essex and who is currently on Red Bull's books as one of their junior drivers - is 52 points clear of his nearest rivals. Three of the four past GP3 champions have gone on to race in F1 - Esteban Gutierrez, Valtteri Bottas and Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat notably jumped straight from GP3 into F1 after his triumph last season, and there is every chance Lynn could do the same. There is currently a vacancy at Toro Rosso after the young Russian was recently announced as Sebastian Vettel's replacement at Red Bull, with the four-time champion on his way to Ferrari.","Jolyon Palmer became first Brit since Lewis Hamilton to win GP2 title .

"Lewis Hamilton dedicated his victory at the Russian Grand Prix to Jules Bianchi, the Marussia driver whose desperate condition in a Japanese hospital cast a shadow over Sunday’s race. His team-mate Max Chilton pulled out of the race after nine laps because he felt ‘uncomfortable’ in his car, which was vibrating. Marussia did not race their other car out of respect to Bianchi, who hit a tractor seven days before in Japan and remains in a life-threatening condition. Lewis Hamilton, lifting his trophy, won the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, dedicating the win to Jules Bianchi . Before the race, the drivers stood in silence in a show of support for the Frenchman. Jenson Button, who came fourth for McLaren, said: ‘When you put on the helmet and get in the car and race, it is a nice place to be because you are in another world. ‘On the grid was emotional for everyone and we, the drivers, had our time together. We were there for Jules. ‘Then getting back into the car was the trickiest bit. Every driver feels the same pain but when we get into the car and close our visors we get on with it. It is good we drive our hearts out. ‘Different things go through your head and you have your emotional moments. For us drivers, we weren’t thinking about the national anthem; we were thinking about Jules.’ McLaren driver Jenson Button, whose helmet showed support for Bianchi, said the grid was emotional . Max Chilton (centre) and the Marussia F1 Team present their 'Racing for Jules' sign on the grid . Yesterday’s race passed without incident. It was dry and the safety car was not needed. Hamilton, the race winner, said: ‘All week there has been just one person on my mind, and that’s Jules. Without a doubt every time I’ve got in a car, I’ve been thinking about him and his family and keeping him in my prayers. ‘Whether it means anything or whether it doesn’t, it would be great to dedicate this to Jules and his family. It will make a very small difference to them, for sure. But every bit of positive energy hopefully will help. ‘All you guys in the media, and all us teams are sending him our positive vibes that way because positive energy is actually real.’ The words 'Jules, we are all supporting you' are seen from above on the Russian Grand Prix track .

"Lewis Hamilton not only lengthened the gap between him and Nico Rosberg after winning the Russian Grand Prix, he has also equalled a British record. Nigel Mansell secured his 31st race win in Australia 20 years ago, a feat which no man has looked close to breaking. But after taking the chequered flag in Sochi, Hamilton has pulled level with the 1992 world champion, and will expect to break the record before the end of the season. Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi on Sunday . Hamilton has equalled Nigel Mansell's British record of 31 race wins (Mansell pictured in Australia, 1994) Hamilton finished ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg and collected the trophy from Vladamir Putin . The 29-year-old is now 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, and realistically one more race win should see him take the drivers' championship for the second time. Hamilton's first race win came in just his sixth race in Formula One at the Canadian Grand Prix, and he ended the 2007 season with four victories. Five would follow in 2008, two in 2009, three in 2010 and 2011, four in 2012, one in 2013 and EIGHT so far this season. His win in Russia was also his fourth in succession, and no driver has failed to win the championship after achieving that feat.

"Nigel Worthington has resigned as manager of York City. The club is one place above the League Two relegation zone after losing 3-1 at Newport County on Saturday and have won just once in the league all season. The former Northern Ireland boss, 52, said: 'After Saturday's result and in the best interests of York City, I have made the difficult decision to leave. York boss Nigel Worthington has resigned from the club after a disastrous start to the season . 'In recent weeks, performances have not been up to my high standards and I take full responsibility for this.' Worthington took over at Bootham Crescent in March 2013 and guided the club away from relegation danger in their first season back in the Football League. They finished seventh in the table last season after ending the campaign on a 17-match unbeaten run, but were knocked out of the play-offs by eventual winners Fleetwood. After starting the new season with four successive draws, a win at Stevenage in September stretched their unbeaten run in regular league matches to a club record 23. Wothington's final game in charge for the League Two outfit saw them lose 3-1 at Newport on Saturday . However, that remains their only league victory of the season to date and Saturday's loss left them above of the League Two drop-zone on goal difference only. Worthington, who has also had spells in charge at Blackpool and Norwich, added: 'I have enjoyed a wonderful time at York City over the past 18 months. 'The fans have been fantastic throughout and I have appreciated their support. The experience would not have been the same without the friendship of all the staff at the club.' 'It has been an absolute pleasure and honour to have been manager of York City and I very much wish the club every success for the future.'","Nigel Worthington has quit as manager of League Two outfit York City .

"Romelu Lukaku says he has no regrets in passing up a move to Serie A champions Juventus to sign for Everton in the summer. The former Chelsea striker arrived at Goodison Park for a club record £28million after attracting interest from a host of European clubs. Although he has struggled to scale the heights he reached on Merseyside during his loan spell last season - where he scored 16 goals in 33 appearances - the 21-year-old insists he has made the right move. Romelu Lukaku insists he made the right decision to sign for Everton this summer . Lukaku shares a joke with Belgium teammates during the international break . Speaking to the Sunday People, Lukaku said: 'I thought about Serie A and Juventus because they are a big club. But for me Everton was perfect. 'I'm here and I'm happy. I don't regret any choices I've made. Everton was the best choice I could make as a young player who wants to progress and develop. The 21-year-old could not break into the first team among Chelsea's all-stars at Stamford Bridge . Lukaku has struggled to score this season while Everton have only won one game game from seven . Despite only scoring two goals from 10 games this campaign, while Everton are languishing in the bottom three after just one win, the Belgium international believes the Toffees can qualify for the Champions League.

"Who is the only Englishman to manage five national teams? Here’s a clue: he once scored a hat-trick in a trial match for Chelsea and played in goal for Millwall twice. Any closer? The answer is Stephen Constantine, who in May was appointed as manager of Rwanda. He was born in London’s East End to an English-Irish mother and Cypriot father but his football career has taken him to more than 80 countries. As a player, it never quite worked out for Constantine. He was 16 when he played in that trial match for Chelsea and scored a hat-trick from central midfield — even though he was a striker. Six weeks later, the knock-back letter arrived. Stephen Constantine is carried by his Rwandan players after victory over Congo Brazzaville in Kigali . Constantine is all smiles and seems to be enjoying himself as coach of Rwanda . The 51-year-old, pictured in Brighton, has been halfway across the world in his management career . Constantine's managerial or coaching roles . 1994–95 Achilleas FC (Cyprus) 1995–96 APEP FC (Cyprus) 1996-98 AEL (Cyprus, youth coach) 1998–99 APEP FC . 1999–2001 Nepal . 2001-02 Bournemouth (youth coach) 2002–05 India . 2005-06 Millwall (first-team coach) 2007–08 Malawi . 2009–10 Sudan . 2010 APEP FC . 2010–12 Nea Salamis (Cyprus) 2013-14 Apollon Smyrni (Greece, coach) 2014- Rwanda . Two years on, Constantine, then a goalkeeper, had unsuccessful trials for Millwall. He relocated to Cyprus and signed for AEL Limassol. He was called up to the Cyprus Under 23 side but turned them down after being ordered to do national service. ‘I told them I’ll wait for Ron Greenwood, who was England manager at the time, and I’m still waiting,’ he jokes. When he was 19 he joined his brother Costas in America and spent a decade playing for Pennsylvania Stoners and New York Freedoms but had to give up when he snapped a ligament in his knee. Constantine’s footballing desire was undiminished so he gained his coaching badges. It was while he was back in Cyprus coaching that he met his wife, Lucy, who was there on holiday. ‘On the first date we went to Pizza Hut and I told her I like my football,’ he explains. ‘She asked how bad can that be? I said if there’s a match on telly I’ll watch it, if there’s a game within 1,000 miles of the house I’ll be there and if I get offered a job anywhere in the world I feel is right I’ll do it.’ Mrs Constantine couldn’t complain she hadn’t been warned. When Nepal came calling, in 1999, offering him his first international job and a contract worth $3,000 a month, Constantine accepted. Constantine (second right) talks to his India players during a training session in 2004 . The Englisman (right) watches over a training session at the Yubabharati Krirangan Stadium in Kolkata in 2004 . HUGGING THE CROWN PRINCE OF NEPAL . At the South East Asia Games, which we were hosting, we met the Maldives in the semi-final. I wore traditional Nepalese dress. We won 2-1 and on the lap of honour, the Crown Prince had come on to the pitch and people were falling to the floor. He hugged me and everyone was gasping as you’re not allowed to touch the royal family. 70,000 NORTH KOREAN FANS — BUT NO NOISE . Travelling to North Korea for an Olympic qualifier was surreal. At the airport we all had to hand in our mobile phones and weren’t allowed them back until we left. We lost 2-0 in front of a 70,000-capacity crowd but there was no noise until they scored, when they all stood up, clapped politely then sat back down again. 10,000 AT KOLKATA AIRPORT . After my first three months as India’s manager, we travelled to Vietnam for the LG Cup. We were 2-0 down after 22 minutes in the final against them, but in the 90th minute scored the winner. When we landed back in Kolkata , 10,000 fans greeted us. It took more than two hours to get from the baggage carousel to the team bus. His wife and first daughter, Paula, followed three months later, flying into unrest among Maoists in the country. Constantine called on a favour from his goalkeeper, who was also a policeman. They drove in an armoured truck straight on to the runway to meet Lucy and baby Paula off the plane. As they departed, the pair were flanked by four policeman with shotguns. Two years later, Constantine left with the highest honour available to a foreigner, the Prabal Gorkha Dakshin Bahu, awarded to him by the Nepalese royal family — and a second child, Christiana. He worked as assistant director at Bournemouth’s Centre of Excellence before, within a year, the Indian national team asked him to take charge. When he arrived in India, the team didn’t have a kit sponsor, but Constantine managed to negotiate a £5million deal with Nike. He led them to their first international tournament win in 42 years, coming from 2-0 down to beat Vietnam in the final of the LG Cup. Constantine’s eyes light up as he discusses a brief spell as Millwall’s first-team coach and the family’s decision to move to Cyprus. They flew over followed by 130 boxes. Then he received a call saying he was wanted by Malawi. ‘I told my wife I’d see her in three months and left before the boxes arrived,’ he recounts. ‘She is a saint.’ He endured a frustrating year: the players were indisciplined and the national team accommodation had wooden beds with sheets that barely covered the players’ midriffs. The mosquito nets were patchy — and the mosquitoes over there can kill. Constantine packed his bags again, heading back to Cyprus, and within a year was in charge of Sudan. Constantine receives a handshake from Brazilian legend Zico, then managing Japan, in 2004 . The day he touched down in Khartoum he visited the British embassy. They warned him to stay off the streets because a warrant for the arrest of president Omar al-Bashir was expected and they couldn’t guarantee his safety. He had to have a police escort to scout a left back and could only stay at the ground for 15 minutes, despite driving hours through the desert to get there. That job, too, lasted a year, and he returned to Cyprus. Not long ago he met Roy Hodgson at King’s Cross in London. ‘I told him to bring England to Rwanda and play us instead of pointless friendlies,’ Constantine says. ‘The feelgood factor you will generate will be unbelievable. He laughed and said he didn’t even know where Rwanda is. I told him not to worry about that.’ At this point in the interview, Constantine’s family arrive. Paula is now 16, Christiana 14 and Isabel nine. They surround their father in the cafe in Brighton where we meet and hear him recall working as Lawrie Sanchez’s assistant at Greek side Apollon Smyrni before taking the Rwanda job in the summer. Constantine addresses his India players at a training camp in 2003 . Constantine, now 51, is already growing into a hero there. His target is to prepare the team for when the country hosts the African Nations Championship in 2016 — similar to the Africa Cup of Nations but a tournament only players from African clubs can participate in. ‘Before I took over, in their last 17 games they had won once, drawn five and lost the rest,’ he says. ‘I thought the only way is up.’ The country went mad when Constantine led them to shock victories against Libya and Congo Brazzaville to reach the qualification stage for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations. But they have since been disqualified after Congo complained that striker Daddy Birori had a passport for both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In August, they lost an appeal against the decision. For Constantine, it seems, the adventure is never over.","Stephen Constantine has travelled to all four corners of the globe in an extraordinary coaching career .

Secondly, if you have, the crucial question is when you can safely return to play. 'A concussion is a brain injury that is feared because it may affect your memory, concentration problem-solving and more. In real life, it is not at all easy to recognise that you have suffered a concussion. 'Contrary to common belief, you do not need to have lost consciousness to suffer concussion.

She asked me the questions she needed to ask and I could repeat immediately so I was feeling well and didn’t have to come off. 'I didn’t feel I was knocked out but I was hit. 'I didn’t have a headache or anything, but after a few minutes I felt worse and worse. 'Then I started to feel a little dizzy and I couldn’t see the ball anymore, and there was a little blood coming from my ear. 'Because I saw trouble, I went off.

I think I am getting everything out of the players. ‘There has been a lot of tough days, I have got to say. So I haven’t put up with that for over two years just to walk away.’ But hours later the decision was made for him, as the clubs Hong Kong-based owners decided defeat at home by Bolton on Saturday was the tipping point. The board, led by executive director Panos Pavlakis, brought an end to Clark’s tenure with Birmingham one point and one place above the relegation zone. Clark has been forced to work on a tight budget with top-earning players on no more than £5,000 per week, one of the lowest wage bills in the division. But he had only overseen one victory at St Andrew’s in more than 12 months and narrowly avoided relegation to League One in the final seconds of last season.

"Michael Dawson is confident Hull have the squad depth to cope with their bruising encounter at Arsenal. The Tigers expanded their squad in the summer to cope with the demands of the Europa League although an early exit from that competition has left several senior players struggling for game time. But that could change following Saturday's 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium, which saw Dawson hurt his ankle and goalkeeper Steve Harper join regular number one Allan McGregor on the sidelines with a bicep injury. Michael Dawson (right) beats Jack Wilshere to a header during his side's 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Saturday . Striker Nikica Jelavic also sustained a knee injury in the warm-up, leaving manager Steve Bruce to count the cost ahead of the weekend trip to Liverpool. And Dawson is sure the players are there to keep Hull's standards up at Anfield. 'The only disappointment (from the weekend) was the injuries we picked up but that is where the squad comes in. We overcame those against Arsenal,' Dawson told the Hull Daily Mail. Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper was forced off the field at the Emirates with a bicep injury . 'You need a good squad because injuries come along and the manager has built that now. We pick ourselves up and see how we are but there is strength in depth to cope.' Former Tottenham captain Dawson had been enjoying his return to regular football under Bruce and is hoping not to miss too much football. 'We will have to see how it is in the week. I tried to play on. I got back on the pitch but the swelling was already coming up,' he said. Striker Nikica Jelavic sustained a knee injury in the warm-up and did not feature against the Gunners . 'I love playing, which is why the ankle injury is so frustrating. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. 'I am loving my time and this is a great club with great lads and a great gaffer. You can't ask for a lot more than that. We also have a good team striving to be successful.' Alex Bruce and Paul McShane are in line to challenge for Dawson's place in the side, Eldin Jakupovic is set to retain the gloves after coming off the bench against the Gunners, while Sone Aluko or Tom Ince could return to the squad in place of Jelavic.","Hull centre back Michael Dawson hurt his ankle at the Emirates while Steve Harper injured his bicep .

"Forgotten man Gabriel Obertan has insisted he never doubted himself after easing the pressure on beleaguered Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a priceless winner. The 25-year-old winger secured a 1-0 victory over the Foxes with a decisive 71st-minute strike which underlined both the talent he has and the fact that it has remained largely unfulfilled during his time on Tyneside. But former the Manchester United midfielder revealed he never lost faith in himself as he redoubled his efforts to to persuade Pardew he still had a role to play at St James' Park after it appeared that his days in the North East were over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gabriel Obertan score a fine goal for Newcastle United . Gabriel Obertan of Newcastle scores the game's only goal against Leicester City at St James' Park . Obertan scores the winning goal past Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel on Saturday afternoon . Newcastle United celebrate a priceless goal and Obertan (centre) insists he never doubted his own ability . Obertan told NUFC TV: 'I have always been confident in myself and my ability, so it might be a surprise for some people, but not for me. I have been grinding quite a while for this and it's just a great feeling at the moment. 'I just kept on working hard. I know the most important thing is working when people don't see you. 'It's easy to train when you have got the coaches patting you on the back, but these moments when you are by yourself are the moments when you really have to work hard and dig deep.' Obertan appeared to be surplus to requirements at St James' as Pardew re-shaped his squad during the summer, and he was not even on the plane when the Magpies headed for New Zealand as part of their pre-season preparations. However, he was the toast of the Toon on Saturday evening after finally ending the club's wait for a first Barclays Premier League win of the campaign at the eighth attempt, in the process sparing them from a worst ever start. Obertan celebrates securing a precious three points with his Newcastle team-mates on Saturday afternoon . Obertan: 'I just kept on working hard. I know the most important thing is working when people don't see you' On an eventful day on Tyneside - there are rarely any other kind - Obertan and his team-mates had to wait an hour to set about their task after the dressing panels surrounding a newly-erected giant TV screen were loosened by the wind, requiring a speedy repair job by hastily-summoned engineers. Thereafter, it proved far from straightforward as stubborn Leicester defence and sub-standard finishing kept the scoreline unchanged until 19 minutes from time. Leicester full-back Richie de Laet strode forward and unleashed a long-range shot which cannoned back off midfielder Jack Colback and the ball dropped kindly for Papiss Cisse, who fed Obertan on the left. The winger, as he had done repeatedly during the game, exploited the space ahead of him at pace and cut inside before setting himself and blasting an unstoppable shot past keeper Kasper Schmeichel and into the bottom corner, his first goal for almost two years and just his third for the club. Obertan's strike prompted a huge sigh of relief, but it took a determined rearguard action to hang on to the points as Tim Krul denied Danny Drinkwater and Steven Taylor blocked substitute Anthony Knockaert's last-ditch effort.

It was great to get the three points and we get a breather for the next game.'

I know that they are very disappointed with aspects of certain performances, but we have given, for the most part this season so far, a very good account of ourselves and I think we are very capable. 'We will get better, so that's just part and parcel of dealing with the demands of a league which requires quality on lots of different levels.'

"England's best young talents should be involved at the European Under 21 Championship next summer to gain valuable tournament experience, according to the FA's former director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking. There have been increasing calls over recent weeks for at least a selection of England's senior stars who are still eligible for the under-21s - the likes of Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Luke Shaw - to be included in Gareth Southgate's squad for the finals in the Czech Republic. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and his Everton counterpart Roberto Martinez sounded sceptical about the idea when asked about it on Thursday, but Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has said he was happy that Shaw had been included in the under-21 group for the play-off ties against Croatia. Raheem Sterling is an established senior England player but, at 19, is still eligible to play for the Under 21 side . Brooking told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'You need tournament experience - you play a game, there's another game every four days. You pick up a card, or you pick up an injury...you have to have a squad because 11 players aren't going to get you through. 'At times during qualifying you have just 10 days, you play two games and then you get another break. 'Tournament football is totally different so that's why it's crucial that we qualify and try to play a lot of our best players. Gareth Southgate will take his England side to the European Under 21 Championships next summer . 'The debate is interesting with the current crop because we've got probably more (eligible) players than ever in the seniors. Gareth and (senior team manager) Roy (Hodgson) will debate with the managers - it will depend on how many matches they play during the season. '(Manchester United defender) Phil Jones has been injured a lot over the last two seasons - he might benefit from a tournament.' Brooking felt how well placed England's senior side were in their Euro 2016 qualifying group by next June should also be a factor in how the younger places are utilised, adding: 'Is it worth playing them in the (Under 21) tournament or just one qualifier (away to Slovenia), because the other game is a friendly (against the Republic of Ireland)?' Luke Shaw played for England at the World Cup but Louis van Gaal said he could benefit from Under 21 football . Brooking, who stepped down from his FA role at the end of August, felt the dialogue between his former employer and the Premier League was now a lot more likely to end favourably for the England under-age teams. Asked if the FA had been reluctant to have a row with the Premier League in the past, Brooking added: 'To be fair, we did have the row. But it was one that we didn't win at that stage. 'What I think we have done over the last few years is we have increased the structure fantastically. We have recruited a lot of people now where there is a lot of credibility within the FA staff and I think clubs accept that and respect that.' Sir Trevor Brooking (left) said that players will benefit from playing as much tournament football as possible .","England will play in European Under 21 Championships next summer .

"Ludogorets defender Cosmin Moti was forced to go in goal for the Bulgarian champions and made two penalty saves to send his side through to Champions League group stage back in August. Former Southampton and Stoke defender Wayne Thomas kept a remarkable clean sheet for Conference North side Worcester on Saturday. The 35-year-old, who has played over 500 professional games, started the 2-0 victory over Harrogate on the bench. However Worcester were left without a recognised goalkeeper after Jose Veiga picked up a knee injury just 30 seconds into the match, prompting Thomas to take the gloves.

The 35-year-old, back in his Burnley days, was in goal after Worcester's only keeper picked up an injury .

'We've got two good keepers,' Worcester manager Carl Heeley told BBC Hereford & Worcester. 'And 99 times out of 100, when you have a spare keeper on the bench, he's not used but that's the way it goes.' 'So I got the boys together and asked 'How many of you have ever played in goal?' - that was the selection process. Tommo put his hand up and off he went,' added Heeley.

"Louis van Gaal has become the first manager of a major Premier League club to encourage his players to go to the European Under 21 Championships with England this summer. The Manchester United boss wants Luke Shaw, Phil Jones and other United youngsters to be picked in Gareth Southgate's squad for the finals in the Czech Republic at the end of the season believing it will help further their careers. 'That tournament is a very good education and I said that as the coach of the Dutch national team as well,' said Van Gaal. Louis van Gaal wants his Manchester United youngsters to feature at the Under 21 European championships . Phil Jones (left) and Luke Shaw are two United players who would be eligible to play for England's U21s . Van Gaal points to the success of his Holland side (including Daley Blind) at the World Cup as proof . Gareth Southgate could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the Under 21 European Championships next year: . Raheem Sterling, Liverpool . Jack Wilshere, Arsenal . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal . Calum Chambers, Arsenal . Luke Shaw, Manchester United . Phil Jones, Manchester United . John Stones, Everton . Ross Barkley, Everton . 'My defenders at the World Cup (who reached the semi-finals) Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Daley Blind had all played in the European Under 21 championship. It's a good experience not many players have.' Van Gaal's support is in direct contrast to the reservations of fellow Premier League bosses Roberto Martinez and Arsene Wenger and will be a huge boost to The Football Association who are trying to make international competitions taken more seriously within English football. Following England's qualification last week for the finals, Martinez questioned why England should call up his young star at Everton Ross Barkley for the tournament while Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has regularly opposed full internationals like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere dropping back into the U21s. Former U21 manager Stuart Pearce recently hit out at Roy Hodgson for picking Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey for the full England squad after he'd turned down the chance to be with the U21s. Pearce is convinced England's weak performances in junior competitions has had an impact on recent World Cup showings. In contrast, the German side that triumphed in Brazil was packed with U21 champions such as Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Mats Hummels and Mesut Ozil. Van Gaal, who has worked with several top-class youngsters in his career including Patrick Kluivert, Andres Iniesta and Thomas Muller, has five United players in contention for the finals; £27million left-back Shaw who played in the play-off win against Croatia, Jones, brothers Michael and Will Keane, and Tyler Blackett. And the Dutchman doesn't see any problem with young players extending their season. Arsene Wenger is one of the managers who has come out and said he doesn't want his players going . Van Gaal has worked with several top youth stars, including Patrick Kluivert (centre) at Ajax . 'I don't think it is even a question or worth having a discussion. But that's my view because I think all the players want to play. 'For me as a trainer-coach of a club, I am very happy that Shaw is playing with the U21s. He played for the U21s while (Adnan) Januzaj was on the bench for the Belgium senior team. That is not a benefit for him, it was a two-week holiday. 'He would have been better at the U21s. I think youngsters have to play. When they are free, they need to play. Shaw was also happy to be with the U21s as he needs match rhythm. 'So it was good for everyone – the national U21 team, for me and for Luke.' England went to the last U21s final under Pearce in Israel without 17 eligible players and failed to qualify from their group. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling would be eligible to play in the Czech Republic . Gareth South gate would be grateful to have several senior stars in his squad next summer . Roy Hodgson chats to Sterling prior to England's game against Estonia last week . Southgate is anxious to avoid a similar drain on resources next year but will only include players who have won full caps if they are mentally ready to rejoin the Under 21s. Shaw, 19, went to the last World Cup in Hodgson's squad but would happily play for the junior team to try and help England win their first U21 title since 1984. Raheem Sterling, Wilshere, Jones, John Stones, Barkley and Oxlade-Chamberlain are also young enough to be eligible but Van Gaal accepts you shouldn't force individual players to go if they themselves think they are fatigued. 'Not every player is the same and I, as a manager, have to know that. Some players are too tired to play so the managers and the medical departments or the club and federation have to communicate better,' he said.","Luke Shaw and Phil Jones would be eligible for Gareth Southgate's squad .

"Arsenal winger Theo Walcott's imminent return cannot come soon enough for Gunners teammate Jack Wilshere. Walcott needed surgery after rupturing knee ligaments against Tottenham Hotspur in January but his rehabilitation is almost complete and England midfielder Wilshere believes the winger's comeback will spark the north London club's season. 'I've never played with someone before who times their runs so perfectly and keeps doing it, time after time,' Wilshere told arsenal.com on Monday. Theo Walcott made his return to match action in an U21 match against Blackburn last week . Walcott also returned to first-team training, as he steps up his recovery from knee ligament damage . The Arsenal Twitter account tweeted Walcott after his first training session back last week . 'He gives us something different, he gives us pace. I know we've got Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who gives us pace but Theo gives you something different without the ball. 'It's a dream for a midfielder.' With Arsenal short on firepower and languishing 11 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea after eight games, Walcott's return will be a major boost. Especially as Wilshere believes he has returned from injury as an even speedier player. 'He's got physically stronger and he looks quicker than he did before, that might seem impossible but he does,' Wilshere said. 'He's done a lot of work on his quads and his power so he's going to come back fine.' Walcott was injured against Tottenham in January, where he signalled to the away fans while leaving the pitch .

"Nico Rosberg put a brave face on it. ‘Lewis was quicker today, all weekend, really,’ he conceded after his team-mate Hamilton dealt another psychological blow in this season’s title race. The deficit at the top after Rosberg's failure to finish in Singapore was three points. That became 10 after he struggled with the balance of his Mercedes in the wet in Japan. And he is in danger of seeing Hamilton extend his lead to 17 – perhaps even more – with only three races, after the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, remaining. While the Briton, who secured his 38th career pole on Saturday, appears to have raised his game, Rosberg has plateaued. He cannot hide from his winless stretch which now stands at five races; it has been 83 long days since he last took to the top step of the rostrum in Germany. Nico Rosberg congratulates Lewis Hamilton after he secured pole for Sunday's Russian Grand Prix . Of course, there have been poles during the interim, in Hungary, Belgium and in Japan. He also would have certainly challenged Hamilton in Singapore after finishing just seven thousandths of a second shy of his team-mate in qualifying. Yet his failure to convert any of those pole laps into victories has somewhat thwarted his chances of emulating father Keke and claiming his maiden championship win. It would be unfair and probably inaccurate, to say that the pressure is getting to the  ice-cool Rosberg. it would be daft, too, to write him off. But we should note that Hamilton has challenged for Formula One championships before, in 2007, 2008 and even in 2010. Rosberg hasn’t. Will those experiences benefit Hamilton? Only time will tell. But one thing’s for sure, the title momentum is firmly in the Briton's favour and Rosberg must wrestle it back, starting with tomorrow’s race in Sochi, if he want's to win this championship. Hamilton finished the session two tenths clear of Rosberg as he bids for his fourth straight victory . It’s been a dark week for all those concerned in Formula One as Jules Bianchi’s life hangs in the balance after his horror crash in Japan. The paddock has paid tribute to the stricken Frenchman with tributes adorned on crash helmets and cars up and down the pit-lane. And the FIA showed their support for the 25-year-old with a computer-generated message displayed during  Saturday’s qualifying session. The message was displayed on the exit of the final corner throughout Saturday's qualifying session . ‘Jules, we are all supporting you’ was displayed on the exit of the final corner on the world feed which is controlled by Formula One Management (FOM). Rather poignantly an image taken from the side of Rosberg’s Mercedes, showed both the ‘Tout Avec Jules’ sticker on his helmet and 'keep fighting Michael' hashtag, in support of seven-times world champion Schumacher,  on his car. Saturday also marked the first anniversary of Maria de Villota’s death which came as a consequence of the injuries the Spanish racer sustained in a testing crash at Duxford in 2012. Rosberg's helmet with the 'Tous Avec Jules' sticker and Keep Fighting Michael hashtag on his Mercedes . Russia is hosting its first Formula One grand prix and the ever-impressive Daniil Kvyat gave the home crowd something to cheer when he qualified a staggering fifth. It was a career best for the rookie, who has enjoyed a week to remember, after he was announced as Sebastian Vettel’s replacement at Red Bull for 2015 ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. The 20-year-old, who became the sport’s youngest points scorer after he finished ninth on his debut in Australia, was a whopping seven tenths quicker than team-mate Jean-Eric Vergne. Daniil Kvyat qualified a career-best fifth in front of his home crowd -  the Russian has impressed this term . Vettel endured another difficult day at the office after he failed to progress to the top-10 shootout for the fourth time this season. The quadruple world champion, who will join Ferrari to become the highest-paid driver in the sport’s history next season, could manage only 11th. ‘It wasn’t comfortable, so I am glad it looked like that,’ said Vettel when he was told it appeared as though he was battling his Red Bull during both Q1 and Q2.  ‘We were too aggressive and I did not have the grip at the rear I wanted. I am unhappy that we did not get the best out of the car,' a glum Vettel added. Kevin Magnussen’s grid penalty for a gearbox change sees Vettel promoted to 10th for tomorrow’s race, but it marks the 10th meeting where he has been out-qualified by Daniel Ricciado this season. He is 54 points behind his team-mate, a three-time winner this season, in the championship. Sebastian Vettel will start only 10th for the Russian Grand Prix after he failed to make it into Q3 . Hamilton’s pole rounded off a brilliant day for British motor racing in Sochi after Jolyon Palmer was crowned GP2 champion and Dean Stoneman stormed to a lights-to-flag victory in this morning’s GP3 race. Palmer claimed his fourth win of the season to build an unassailable 66 point lead over Felipe Nasr to become only the second Briton, after Hamilton's triumph in 2006, to win Formula One's feeder series. Earlier, Stoneman after securing pole,  led from the front before posting the fastest lap of the race. All of this on his debut for the Koiranen team.","Hamilton holds momentum over Rosberg in race for this season's title .

Part of the problem was the load on midfielder Daley Blind as United attempted to spring forward using the three-pronged attacking midfield of Januzaj, Mata and Di Maria. Januzaj, starting his first game under Van Gaal and not known for his defensive capabilities, was cemented to the right wing for the first-half, moving slightly inward in the second-half as United improved ever so slightly. Mata, playing in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney, saw very little of the ball throughout, and was bypassed by United's deeper midfielders and defence. MORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE . Juan Mata started in the middle of the three-pronged attacking midfield at the Hawthorns . Mata spent much of the first-half helping Adnan Januzaj on the right of midfield, and struggled to impact . On the opposite wing Di Maria was not an individual problem. In fact the Argentine was superb again, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini's equaliser and delivering several dangerous balls having found himself in space. He did exactly what Januzaj didn't when 'stuck out' on the wing - making use of the situation to full effect - with the Belgian picking up a 5.5/10 rating bySportsmail. Di Maria at least attempted to move in and penetrate the penalty area more than once, as shown in his heat map. Mata, meanwhile, is an ongoing dilemma - a £37.5million midfielder without a defined place in Van Gaal's system to justify the price tag - and it showed again at the Hawthorns. MORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE . Januzaj, on his first start for United under Van Gaal, hardly had an effect on the game on the right wing . The Belgian hugged the right wing for United, and his delivery into the box was often poor . The only man directly between Mata and goal, striker Robin van Persie, was given no support by the Spaniard and nothing to feed off. The two played too far apart, forcing (or enabling, Van Gaal would argue) United to use the flanks even more. Too wide and not clinical enough, United were stretched. Space behind the striker that Rooney would often fill was vacant, meaning United struggled to win the ball high up the pitch. Albion's only roadblock to goal when winning the ball in midfield was an out-of-position Ander Herrera and an exposed Blind. The Januzaj-Mata-Di Maria trio made just one tackle between them, compared to five by West Brom's attacking midfield three of Chris Brunt, Stephane Sessegnon and Graham Dorrans. It was no surprise both goals came on the break with the  trio chasing shadows, and the second goal in particular cut through the heart of United, as can be seen below. MORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE . West Brom's second goal, scored by Saido Berahino (18) came from United being cut right down the middle . Fellaini was brought on for the second half and had a big impact on the match, scoring the equaliser . Van Persie was often playing off the last West Brom man, but Mata struggled to connect with him . Van Gaal got his tactics wrong at 8pm, but the game quickly changed complexion after the first-half. As is not often the case, there weren't too many question marks over Fellaini's introduction at the expense of Herrera at half-time, giving Blind more physical support. It worked in an attacking sense, too. United finally had some control going forward, but none when tracking back. Two goals each was a rather predictable scoreline. Berahino celebrates putting West Brom ahead in the second half at the Hawthorns .

"Alan Pardew joked with owner Mike Ashley about the ‘cheap telly’ which threatened to postpone the game, but they both knew that the subsequent victory had been priceless. Ashley made his first visit to the home dressing-room in more than four years to congratulate his manager and players and, as he returned to the chairman’s suite, remarked: ‘That was a relief’. Pardew, too, had used the word ‘relief’, as did every Newcastle player who emerged to speak to the press. VIDEO Scroll down to watch We were desperate to win - Pardew . Under pressure Newcastle manager Alan Pardew (right) celebrates Obertan's winner at St James' Park . The game was delayed by an hour after a problem with the new electrical scoreboard at St James' Park . Newcastle: Krul 6.5, Janmaat 6.5, Steven Taylor 7, Coloccini 6, Dummett 6 (Haidara 72 6), Anita 5 (Perez 59 6), Colback 6.5, Obertan 7.5, Sissoko 5.5, Gouffran (Cabella 90), Cisse 6. Subs Not Used: Ferreyra, Elliot, Abeid, Armstrong. Goal: Obertan 71. Leicester: Schmeichel 6.5, De Laet 5.5, Morgan 6.5, Moore 6.5, Konchesky 5, Cambiasso 5.5 (Knockaert 79 6), James 6, Drinkwater 6.5, Schlupp 5.5 (Nugent 56 6), Ulloa 5.5. Subs Not Used: Hammond, King, Hamer, Wasilewski. Booked: Moore, De Laet, Ulloa. Att: 51,886 . Ref: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). Man of the match: Gabriel Obertan. And there was relief on a bizarre afternoon at St James’ Park; relief that the club’s new giant screen which became dislodged before the match did not force its cancellation and instead delayed kick-off by an hour, relief at a first win of the Premier League season and relief at Gabriel Obertan’s first top-flight goal in more than two-and-a-half years. Pardew, though, took even more satisfaction from the post-match appearance of his paymaster, further reinforcing the support he has shown during the team’s recent toil. ‘It was a surprise - we didn't expect to see him,’ said Pardew. ‘I teased him about the cheap telly and he took that in good spirits. We all had a bit of a laugh about it. ‘But he spent about 10 minutes congratulating everyone. If anyone has ever doubted his commitment you saw it there. He was as happy as any fan at the win. ‘That is the first time since I have been here that he has been in the dressing-room straight after the game. It shows what that result meant to him. The new electronic scoreboard came loose, forcing the Premier League clash to be delayed until 4pm . Supporters wait outside St James' Park as the ground was temporarily closed due to the scoreboard problems . October 18 is the latest Newcastle fans have ever had to wait for a first Premier League victory of the season. ‘I hope the fans understand that we’re not as great as we should be, but a win will help us.’ The result, of course, meant Pardew avoided the ignominy of a club record eight without victory from the start of a Premier League season. But that it was achieved thanks to forgotten Frenchman Gabriel Obertan – a player left behind when United travelled to New Zealand in pre-season – serves to highlight the depths Pardew has trawled to unearth a match-winner in his squad. For while £12million Remy Cabella sat on the bench and £6m signings Emmanuel Riviere and Siem de Jong watched on injured, it was Obertan who passed his screen test on what was his first home start in more than 20 months, darting infield in the 71st minute before arrowing into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. And Pardew said: ‘He’s all about self-confidence. When he believes in himself he’s unplayable. This will only boost his confidence. ‘He’s still young with such great potential and, if we can get that out of him every week, we’ll be very fortunate.’ VIDEO We were desperate to win - Pardew . Pardew gives out instructions to his Newcastle side during the game against Leicester . Obertan struck with the only goal of the game at St James' Park as Newcastle beat the Foxes . Defender Steven Taylor – whose last league start came in May - was another brought in from the cold, and he says the squad have never doubted their team-mate. ‘If you speak to any of the players, they’ll all tell you that Gabby is a top quality player,’ he said. ‘He’s in there all the time, in the gym, working hard, his work-rate has been spot on. ‘He was brilliant. He caused so many problems for them. He was an outlet and that’s something we’ve not had. He’s just not had the chances.’ Newcastle, however, remain in the bottom three with a trip to Spurs and the visit of Liverpool either side of a Capital One Cup tie at Manchester City. Victory in any of those three and Ashley might just be paying another visit to his team’s dressing-room. Before then, though, he has to pay someone to fix that cheap telly.","Newcastle's won first Premier League game of the season against Leicester .

"Pick Jack Wilshere and Co for a dash at European U21 glory next summer . Arsene Wenger seems to be against young Arsenal players Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers joining up with the England Under 21s next summer. All would be eligible to play at the European Championship in the Czech Republic, and many have suggested that the senior side's younger players should drop down and get tournament experience under Gareth Southgate. But Wenger believes full internationals shouldn't consider it, partly because they 'won't play with the same quality.' Arsene Wenger doesn't want Jack Wilshere (L) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (C) playing for England's U21s . The Arsenal boss believes a player is 'never good' when he drops down from his senior international side . Calum Chambers will be another Gunner who would be eligible for the European Championship in 2015 . ‘Once a guy has moved up to the full national team, you put him down and he is never good,’ Wenger said. ‘On the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it is better he has a good rest during the summer. But, most of the time, when they move down, they are not completely at their quality.’ Wenger's comments seem to contradict those of Oxlade-Chamberlain's, who said he would be delighted to play for the Under 21s in 2015. Arsenal star Oxlade-Chamberlain's comments seem to contradict those of his manager's . 'Yes (I’d play at the Euros if I was asked), you’d never turn your nose up at something like that,’ said the 21-year-old, who has 18 England caps. ‘But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament. So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide what he wants. ‘There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide. ‘When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth (Southgate, England U21 manager) might not even want me. It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.’ The line-up in red is the one that beat Croatia in the play-off, but the blue team is what England could field .

"Stuart Peace believes the strongest possible England U21 side should contest the Euro 2015 tournament next summer if the senior side are to have a successful future. The former U21 manager fails to see why the likes of Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers should not be among the senior players included in Gareth Southgate's squad next year, despite them being part of Roy Hodgson's senior set-up. Pearce, now manager of Nottingham Forest, said: 'If you want a successful international side, you're going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments, which I've said time and time again.' Raheem Sterling is one of England's senior players that could feature for the U21 side at Euro 2015 . Arsenal attacker Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another exciting talent who is eligible to play in Czech Republic . Former England U21 boss Stuart Pearce thinks Gareth Southgate should take the strongest possible squad . He believes players gain valuable experience by participating in tournaments through each tier of the national set-up. 'There will be a concern at football clubs, with football managers and the interest of club supporters definitely, but it's where you see the trade-off. 'For me, we've got Jamaal Lascelles in the U21 squad and if Gareth Southgate wants to take him next summer, he can go with my blessing because I think it's right and proper that they play.' Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sterling, pictured on senior duty this week, are both regulars at Arsenal and Liverpool . Arsenal full-back Calum Chambers could also get the call from Southgate having only recently been promoted . Asked if Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers should be picked as Southgate's senior players for Euro 2015, Pearce said he does not think their recent first-team duties should prevent them taking part in the Czech Republic. 'I'm not going to change my tune now. The bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they're age appropriate and available in my opinion and that doesn't change,' he explained. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger does not think dropping Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers to the U21 set-up would be beneficial to the players, particularly with both featuring heavily for the Gunners this season . But Arsene Wenger has questioned whether dropping players from the senior squad to the U21 set-up will have a positive influence on their progression. 'Once a guy has moved to the full national team and you put him down, he's never good,' said Wenger. 'On the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it's better he has a good rest during the summer, but most of the time when they move down they are not completely at their quality.'","Ex-England U21 manager Stuart Pearce says Gareth Southgate should take the strongest possible squad to the Czech Republic next summer .

"A new and potentially deadly form of bird flu has claimed its first confirmed human victim - a woman in China . A new and potentially deadly form of bird flu has claimed its first confirmed victim. Tests revealed that a previously unknown sub-strain of the H10N8 virus killed a woman who was admitted to hospital in China with fever and pneumonia. The woman, from Nanchang City in Jiangxi province, died nine days after becoming ill despite antibiotic and antiviral treatment. Experts believe the strain spread from poultry and may pose the threat of a pandemic. The dead woman had visited a live poultry market a few days prior to her illness, suggesting an incubation time of around four days - similar to that of other bird flu strains. Reports suggest the victim was not an isolated case. At least one other person is believed to have been infected by the same strain in Jiangxi Province. Dr Yuelong Shu, from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, said: ‘A genetic analysis of the H10N8 virus shows a virus that is distinct from previously reported H10N8 viruses, having evolved some genetic characteristics that may allow it to replicate efficiently in humans.’ The strain is thought to have emerged from multiple re-assortments of genes from different bird flu viruses. Notably, it shares genes with three other bird flu strains, H9N2, H7N9 and H5N1, the last two of which have spread to humans. Scientists conducted tests on swab samples taken from the woman victim's windpipe. Their results, reporting the first human death associated with H10N8, appear in The Lancet medical journal. Co-investigator Dr Qi Jin, from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, said: ‘Importantly, the virus had a mutation in the PB2 gene that is believed to be associated with increased virulence and adaption in mammals, and could enable the virus to become more infectious to people.’ The H10N8 strain was previously found in a water sample taken from Dongting Lake in Hunan Province in 2007. In 2012, it was detected at a live poultry market in Guangdong Province. The woman is believed to have become infected while visiting a live poultry market in China . Co-author Dr Mingbin Liu, from Nanchang City Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the threat should not be taken lightly. ‘A second case of H10N8 was identified in Jiangxi Province, China on January 26, 2014,’ said Dr Liu. ‘This is of great concern because it reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future.’ Dr John McCauley, director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Influenza at the Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London, said: ‘This case reminds us to be aware of human infections from animal influenza viruses. ‘Previously we did not think that H7N9 infections might be so lethal. ‘More human infections by avian H10N8 viruses cannot be ruled out. H10N8 viruses are of low pathogenicity in poultry and so infection in birds is not easy to detect. Whether humans are frequently exposed and infected is also not known. ‘ . He added that the underlying condition of the dead woman was likely to have worsened her infection.","A woman in China died after contracting a new sub-strain of H10N8 .

"Steffon Armitage's dream of playing at next year's World Cup for England could be over after he was named in Toulon's squad for their European Champions Cup opener against Scarlets on Sunday. Armitage's proposed move to Bath, which would make him available for selection for England, hit the rocks this week after a breakdown in negotiations between the Aviva Premiership side and back-to-back European champions Toulon. Steffon Armitage (centre) is held back by Toulouse defenders playing for Toulon in the Top 14 last weekend . The back row forward was named European player of the year as Toulon won the Heineken Cup last season . If the flanker plays on Sunday, which looks almost certain given his inclusion in the squad, then he will be ineligible for European games for Bath, making the prospect of signing him far less attractive. Head coach Mike Ford insisted earlier this week that such a scenario would terminate their interest. Bath had moved to bring in the European player of the year, 29, due to a back row crisis. Francois Louw, Carl Fearns, Matt Garvey and Alafoti Fa'osiliva are all injured, while Leroy Houston is banned. Under the Premiership's injury dispensation rules, clubs are permitted to spend up to £400,000 on cover for a like-for-like player who has been ruled out for at least 12 weeks. Armitage made five appearances for England while at London Irish in 2009 . The move had the backing of England head coach Stuart Lancaster and the RFU, whose rules stipulate no-one playing their rugby outside of the Premiership can wear the Red Rose. With the World Cup in England less than a year away, Armitage, who earned five caps for England in 2009, would need to move to the Premiership this season to fit England's criteria. The former London Irish man had been exploring the possibility of playing for France - where he has lived for the past three years - but had a recent change of heart and began searching for an English club with the reluctant blessing of Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal and head coach Bernard Laporte. The back row forward looks set to stay at Toulon and not play for England at next year's World Cup . It looks like it is back to square one though for one of the world's best back row forwards, who returned to Toulon training this week and looks set to feature in their European opener on Sunday. Armitage was recently included in a provisional France squad, subject to his selection by their Sevens team for Olympic qualification. If his route back with England is denied, he may revisit his interest in representing Les Bleus at the World Cup.","Steffon Armitage looked set for move to Bath from Toulon .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he is ready to unleash Raheem Sterling on Real Madrid – even though the teenager played 95 minutes against QPR on Sunday. Rodgers has rejected claims that Sterling said he was 'tired' while on England duty although he has talked himself about the dangers of burn-out facing the 19-year-old. Sterling certainly looked fresh when he embarked on the injury-time run that set up Liverpool's goal in a 3-2 win at Loftus Road and Rodgers is confident he can show the same verve and energy on Wednesday night despite having only 72 hours to recover. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool host Real in European epic . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) shakes hands with Raheem Sterling . Sterling (second left) helped Liverpool to a last-gasp victory at QPR on Sunday when he set up the winner . 'Raheem has shown over the last couple of years he has the ability and quality to reproduce performances like that,' said Rodgers. 'He was a real catalyst but it was no surprise to see him at that level. 'He showed wonderful speed, technique and, of course, hard work. So there is no doubt he can arrive into this game (v Real) like he's done since I've been here.' Rodgers has had to regularly field questions about why Liverpool have fallen short of last season's standards when they ran Manchester City close to winning the Premier League. A big turnaround in personnel over the summer has created inconsistent results and in the Champions League a home win against Ludogorets was followed by a disappointing 1-0 loss in Basle. Rodgers (second right) addresses the media ahead of his side's crucial Champions League game this week . The Liverpool manager believes that Sterling (pictured) will be fine to play, rubbishing claims he is tired . Rogers feels the arrvial of The Galacticos could inspire his players. 'We understand it is a very important game for us and obviously a great challenge,' he said. 'This group really lift ourselves for the big games. 'We haven't got to the levels of last season but this is a special game in a special competition. But knowing the competitors we have in our team, I am confident we will rise to the challenge of Real Madrid. 'It is still going to be a difficult game. They are a squad of top-class players. Of course Ronaldo is arguably the best in the world, his evolution from a soloist who scored goals to a goalscorer has been impressive. 'But we need to have a plan for our team first to cause them problems, and then work out a way of stoppoing them, as a team.' Real Madrid are the visitors to Anfield on Wednesday, in a Champions League Group B match . There were claims that Sterling told England manager Roy Hodgson he was tired while on international duty . VIDEO Liverpool host Real in European epic . On Gareth Bale's injury, Rodgers added: 'He is a world-class player, he's got fantastic speed so of course if he is not playing it can be an advantage. But their squad is fantastic, they can bring players like Isco so the advantage isn't significant and certainly they will test us in the game. 'For us, although it is a difficult tie for us and we aren't playing as well as we have done, people haven't focussed on our character and spirit and it's that which is allowing us to win games. 'We need that on Wednesday to go with quality of our football to take another step to qulaifying from the group.' Captain Steven Gerrard called on the team to improve from their win at QPR if they want to trouble Madrid. And on Tuesday night at the official pre-match Champions League press conference, he explained: 'We have been a bit up and down, in a bit of a stuttering season. Everyone is well aware we have lost a phenomenal player in Suarez and struggled getting Sturridge on the field, so it is only natural we would have teething problems. 'But I have huge confidence in these players we can get back to the level we had last season. It won't be very long.'","Brendan Rodgers has rejected claims Raheem Sterling has been tired .

"Piercing the skyline and sprouting branch-like balconies, an apartment block resembling a giant tree is set to come to life in Montpellier, France. Aptly called The White Tree (L’Arbre Blanc), at 17-storeys, the high-rise building embodies the capabilities of 21 century architecture. As its name suggests, the building's unusual shape takes inspiration from the tree form, with endless stair-step balconies protruding off the building's trunk-like core in the same way branches do on trees. Appearing to grow out of the ground, the plans for the structure draw further comparisons to a tree. In addition to the balconies jutting off in different directions like branches, these will be complimented by functional decks that provide shade for adjoining units, thus creating a tree-like set of stairs that encase the building. Tree in the sky: An apartment block unlike others, the building's balconies are inspired by tree branches, which draw natural light and create an open atmosphere for vegetation . Construction on the mixed-use high-rise building is set to start in July next year, with completion expected by December 2017 . The unique 56-metre tall tower will feature 120 residential units and office space along with a restaurant, panoramic bar and art gallery. Visitors and guests will be welcomed to the tower by the restaurant and gallery while the penthouse bar will offer views of the coastline and mountains. Its design will invite vegetation on balconies to thrive due to the open atmosphere, which is ideal for plants. Against the buildings white facade, this will create a vertical garden with bring colour and contrast. Bringing life to the tree building, residents will have the impression they are outside when they are indoors by mixing the two settings. With the outdoors an important part of life in Montpellier, the structure's balconies draw natural light, absorbing sunshine the same way leaves do. Gizmodo.com.au reported the building's architects were inspired by a tree's efficient properties and the city's tradition for outdoor living, hence the name L’Arbre Blanc, which translates from French to English as The White Tree. Standing tall at 56 metres, the building will pierce the Montpellier skyline, with a penthouse bar offering spectacular views of the coast and nearby mountains . Offering 120 apartments, The White Tree will offer residents the chance to pick from various units with different floor plans due to structure's unique form . Piercing the skyline, the building will be set between Montpellier's new and old districts, sitting halfway between newly developed districts Odysseum and Port Marianne and the city center. From the building, residents will have easy access to nearby the pedestrian and cycling paths. It was announced in March that the 10,000 square metre French-designed building will be built by Japanese architects and fittingly, the building will draw and blend influences from both countries. With a modular design, this allows the mixed-use building to feature many different layouts with stunning panoramic views of a nearby mountain range and the ocean. Design Boom reported this will allow residents to choose a floor plan from many varying layouts and encourage free choice architecture. The White Tree will become Montpellier's second folly structure because if it's extravagant form and ability to challenge the traditional notions of architecture . A restaurant will greet people on the ground floor, while nearby pedestrian and cycle paths will encourage residents to connect with the environment . But the project is getting attention for all the right reasons, after being dubbed the second architectural folly of the 21st century. Part of Montpellier's plans to build 12 new follies across the city, Architects Journal reported that it will join the first building that won a competition to be built. Selected last year, with construction due to start this year, the 11-storey holiday apartment building features curved and stack levels. An architectural folly is when a building's purpose is considered to be for aesthetic pleasure. While the White Tree building is still functional, it's extravagant design and ability to challenge traditional notions of architecture help qualify it as an architectural folly. Construction is set to start on The White Tree in July 2015 and is expected to finished in December 2017. The 10,000 square metre French-designed building will be built by Japanese architects and draw influences from both countries . Stunning: The tower will sit between Montpellier's new and old districts, spurting out of the ground like a giant tree with branch-like balconies in every direction .

"For a typical young sportsman, returning from a lengthy injury lay off to be thrown into back-to-back European ties before a date with the All Blacks might be a daunting prospect. But Owen Farrell is not a typical young sportsman. Barely six years after becoming the youngest Englishman to play professional rugby union aged 17 years and 11 days — a mantle since taken by his fly-half rival George Ford — Farrell has won 25 England caps and scored 271 international points. Assuming he passes muster against Clermont this Saturday and Munster next Friday, Farrell looks set to start at fly-half against the world champions at Twickenham on November 8. Last week Jonny Wilkinson called for the 23-year-old to be England’s first-choice No 10 during next year’s World Cup. England No 10 Owen Farrell has declared himself fit after recovering from a quad injury . Farrell is looking forward to taking on the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8 . Jonny Wilkinson, who won the World Cup in 2003, believes Farrell should be handed a key role . ‘I’m not worried about anything,’ said Farrell, who has not played since injuring his quad against London Irish in Saracens’ third game — and his only start — of the season. ‘I’m looking forward to getting back out and playing. I feel ready to go.’ The indications at Saracens’ training ground on Tuesday were that Farrell will start on the bench at Allianz Park. Veteran Charlie Hodgson is expected to continue at No 10 before handing over to Farrell against Munster at Thomond Park. Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, said: ‘Owen looks really sharp. We probably could have played him a fortnight ago because he was running well, which is why he’s so frustrated. We’ve been conservative with him. ‘I think in the long term for us and for England it’s been a break that Owen probably required. He’s played a lot of rugby at a very young age. He’s 23. Every question he’s been asked he’s answered. I think the world is his oyster.’ Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall believes the world is at Farrell's oyster . Farrell, who suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of last summer’s third Test against the All Blacks before his latest setback, has been spending his time on the sidelines studying opposition teams and England rivals. ‘The fact you don’t play doesn’t mean you don’t learn,’ he said. ‘I’ve watched more rugby over the last three weeks than I’ve ever watched. ‘I’ve watched a lot of Clermont already.’ Saturday’s clash will see a repeat of last season’s European semi-final, which Saracens won with one of the most breathtaking displays ever produced by an English club. ‘I’ve watched it back a few times this week and two things stood out to me. Our game was joined up: set pieces, kicking game, defence, attack, counter attack were all as one. ‘Coupled with that was the energy we brought. We’ll need to be like that again this week.’ Three Wales stars, Jamie Roberts, Mike Phillips and Dan Lydiate, could quit Racing Metro and return home. Racing coach Laurent Labit told French newspaper L’Equipe: ‘We have raised the subject with them. They have never really been that effective.’ Wales coach Warren Gatland has denied that the Welsh Rugby Union had ‘instigated contact’ with the players. Centre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing before the 2013-14 season and scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed by Bayonne. Any move could collapse if they play for Racing in the European Rugby Cup against Northampton on Saturday and are cup-tied.","The 23-year-old looks set to start at fly-half against the world champions .

"Click here for Chris Foy's look at the opening weekend of Europe's new club competition and his predictions ahead of the pool stage . As European rugby enters a new era with the Champions Cup set to kick off after a dark period behind the scenes for the code, Sportsmail rugby correspondent CHRIS FOY focuses on the stars of the show to pick out five potential standouts for this year's competition. WILL FRASER  (Saracens) An horrendous run of injuries have severely hindered Fraser’s progress, but at 24 he is still young enough to have a long international career. Very highly thought of by England’s management, Fraser (right) could yet put pressure on Chris Robshaw for the No 7 shirt. Will Fraser is back near his best after a nightmare run of injuries and set to shine for Saracens in Europe . JOE LAUNCHBURY (Wasps) Hugely gifted English second row who some believe has the potential to emulate Martin Johnson in one of the toughest positions in the sport. Out of contract at the end of the season, the young lock is attracting attention from all quarters. Second rower Joe Launchbury will be the highest of priorities for Wasps to keep now their new home is set . STEFFON ARMITAGE (Toulon) Will he? Won’t he? The English qualified flanker was one of the players of the tournament last season as Toulon retained the European Cup. He is considering a move to Bath, but wherever he plays Armitage is likely to have a big impact. Steffon Armitage's rumoured move back to England from Toulon appears to have fizzled, but he's a superstar . SEMESA ROKODUGUNI (Bath) The former soldier has dodged bullets in Afghanistan, but has turned his attention to professional rugby union in recent years and is proving to be a huge success. Rokoduguni  has sensational feet and pace and could yet make Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup squad. The Fijian-born former Army star Semesa Rokoduguni has made his mark for Bath big time this season . ELI WALKER (Ospreys) George North may be the most talked about Welsh winger, but young Eli Walker has a huge future ahead of him if he can stay fit. The speedster has pace to burn and a mesmerising side-step which make him a constant try-scoring threat. Eli Walker may not be the household name of other Welsh wingers, but the Ospreys flyer is one to watch .","The first European Rugby Champions Cup kicks off on Friday .

"Formula One driver Jean-Eric Vergne has revealed he was admitted to hospital after the Australian Grand Prix due to an extreme weight-loss regime for the 2014 season. The 23-year-old driver has been on a strict diet regime to meet new weight regulations this season. Frenchman Vergne, who drives for Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso, says he needed hospital treatment after the season opener in Melbourne as a direct result of his dieting. Concern: Jean-Eric Vergne says he was admitted to hospital after the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . 'The weight difference between myself and my teammate was making me lose four tenths (per lap),' Vergne told French media. 'I did a diet this winter but you get to certain limits that the body can no longer take,' said Vergne. 'I was in hospital between the Grand Prix in Australia and Malaysia because of a lack of water and a little bit of lack of everything. I was very weak. On track: The Frenchman, who drives for Toro Rosso, described the weight regulations as 'stupid' Adrian Sutil, who is one of the . tallest, and subsequently heavier drivers on the grid, revealed he would race without a water bottle in yesterday's Bahrain Grand .

Kevin Magnussen: 10st 7lbs . Felipe Massa:  9st 2lbs . Vergne, who was came in 21st position on Sunday, admitted the issue has been discussed among his fellow . drivers, but a resolution is yet to be found. 'Frankly, the situation is stupid', added Vernge. 'Some lighter drivers want to keep their edge, and we have not reached a solution. 'Formula One cars are very difficult to drive and we need all of our skills. Being forced to lose weight is not good.' Vergne said that while the minimum car-plus-weight limit was raised by the FIA this season for the new turbo V6 rules, the 692-kg figure is still far too low. Out of juice: Adrian Sutil will race without a water bottle at Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix . Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, said he is dieting and 'has eaten no sugar since early December' According to the rules cars are weighed with the driver in the cockpit and fellow F1 DRIVER Lewis Hamilton has previously spoken of the need . for drivers to slim down due to turbos and hybrid systems being heavier . than ­engineers expected. 'It’s hardcore what people are doing,' admitted Hamilton. 'I’m . OK but for the really heavy drivers, I can’t imagine how it is for . them. There’s a minimum they can physically get to without cutting their . arm off. 'You can go into qualifying a little bit dehydrated. I heard someone was doing that, exhausting themselves.

'And then the next day they can drink some more because the race is different. It’s like jockeys do.' Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, said he is also dieting to reduce his weight. 'I had to make the sacrifice if I want to balance the car perfectly,' he said. 'The diet alone is easy, but training with little food is hell,' Rosberg told Germany's Bild am Sonntag. 'I have eaten no sugar since early December -- for my dream I'm living like a monk'. Clayton Green, Manager of the Human Performance Programme at McLaren previously told The Telegraph: 'The minimum weight limit of the car this year is 691kg. With the changes in technology, teams are struggling to get the cars down to the minimum limit - but they want to be as close to it as possible. 'Any extra weight equates to time per lap and they don’t want to give anything away to competitors.

"General Sir David Richards, the former Chief of the General Staff, said there was a 'grand strategic solution' to the Middle East . David Cameron could have squeezed ISIS 'out of existence' two years ago if he had accepted a top secret plan presented to him by the army, the former head of the British military revealed today. General Sir David Richards said he gave the Prime Minister a strategy to defeat Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2012, but it was rejected. He said the plan would have removed the dictator from power and allowed the moderate Syrian opposition to crush ISIS radicals before they established a foothold. The revelation comes as Nato leaders consider plans to launch bombing raids on ISIS rebel commanders holding key towns in northern Iraq and Syria, where they claim to have carved out there own 'Islamic State'. Speaking this morning, Lord Richards said ISIS had grown in power because the West had failed to help moderate opposition rebels topple President Assad. The bombshell claim comes amid mounting criticism of President Barack Obama after he admitted that he did not have a 'strategy' to deal with the growing threat posed by ISIS. Two US journalists - Steven Sotloff and James Foley - have been beheaded by fanatics from the self-proclaimed Islamic State and a British hostage, David Haines, has been threatened with execution over Western intervention in the region. Lord Richards, speaking to the BBC's Today programme, said ISIS was finally being confronted - but suggested it had come far too late. He said if Britain had acted in 2012 ISIS would not now exist. ‘Back in 2011/12 when focussing on Assad I did offer a coherent military strategy to deal with that,' he revealed. Lord Richards added: ‘It was too much, as someone said, more than the market would bare. People hadn’t really understood the significance of what was happening in Syria at the time. And hadn’t really realised that ISIS could grow into the hydra that it has.’ He said his plan - which was presented to the Prime Minister and considered at the 'highest levels in Washington - envisaged supporting the opposition groups fighting Assad while growing and training a ‘government in waiting’. He said this would have taken around a year to put in place. He added: ‘At the point of committal I can tell you we would have beaten Assad. ‘And the Islamist extremists would have been squeezed out of existence by their own people in the process because everyone just wants to win. ‘The reason ISIS has developed in the way it has is in part through frustration at the lack of coherent and really meaningful assistance to the Arabs.’ Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama watched a military flypast with David Cameron at the NATO summit at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales, this morning . The Government will not be deterred from launching air strikes against ISIS by threats to the life of a British hostage, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said. ISIS militants have threatened to kill Scottish aid worker David Haines who they are believed to be holding in Syria. They have already beheaded two American journalists, posting the evidence on line in gruesome videos featuring a masked jihadist with a British accent. Mr Hammond said: ‘We will do everything we can to protect this individual (Mr Haines) but we have to be clear about the nature of the organisation that we are dealing with. ‘They are utterly brutal, they are ideologically driven - almost pathological in the way that they behave. We cannot allow our strategy to be driven by their behaviour. ‘We have to approach the challenge of Isil with focus purely on what is in Britain’s best interests - protecting our citizens and our security from the threat that Isil poses from foreign fighters, from potential attacks on our soil, destabilisation of the region.' Lord Richards' remarks came after Mr Cameron last night indicated British involvement in air strikes against jihadists in Syria and Iraq could begin within weeks. The Prime Minister spoke publicly for the first time about striking Islamist targets in Syria without President Assad’s consent. He also signalled that British attacks on ISIS forces could come as soon as the country agrees a new government this month. The development came after it emerged three senior members of ISIS have been killed in a US airstrike in northern Iraq, according to senior security officials. Two days after a video showing the execution of US journalist Steven Sotloff was released, US warplanes struck at the heart of ISIS in Mosul, northern Iraq, killing the wanted jihadist Abu Hajar Al-Sufi – the right hand man to terror chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Lord Richards welcomed the growing evidence that a plan to beat ISIS was finally emerging. He said: ‘Things have moved on pretty well.’ He added: ‘If you think about it ISIS has been contained which is the key first element of any strategy and has even started to be shrunk which I think is the next bit. After that you defeat.' But he warned: ‘We haven’t got a coherent generational strategy yet. ‘I do think that strategy, which we came up with in 2012, could be the bare bones of how to deal with ISIS. ‘It was discussed at the highest levels in Washington. But it was more than the market would bare, as I was told, and we got on and did what has happened between then and now. ‘It wasn’t accepted, I don’t think it could be the basis for something today.’ Lord Richards said the first thing Britain had to do was to ‘contain’ ISIS. He said you then start ‘squeezing the problem’ before ultimately defeating it. He added: ‘It’s no good the world only thinking that ISIS is the problem. This is happening all over the world. It needs to be the first stage in a much more grand strategic plan to once and for all deal with Muslim extremism.’ He said we would have to deal with Nigeria, Kenya, Yemen, Pakistan and Myanmar. The second stage is for ISIS to be ‘squeezed’. He said that was not all about military. But he said: ‘You’ve got to get all nations in the world on side and most importantly the Gulf Arabs.’ The former military chief said the plan needed Western leadership. He said ‘one way or another’ Britain and US would have to deal with Assad.","General Sir David Richards  gave the PM a strategy to defeat Assad in 2012 .

"We are seeing the evolution of Lionel Messi in this World Cup. The new version is not as dynamic, but is equally devastating. He has become more of an old-fashioned playmaker, with everything coming through him. He’s on the prowl, smelling danger, waiting for the opportunity to pounce and to come alive at the point of maximum impact, but  conserving his energy until such an opening presents itself. He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball. His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi's brother Rodrigo say Lionel feels he owes success . Under pressure: Messi has dragged Argentina to the last eight with a string of sensational performances . Assist: Against Switzerland he showed a burst of pace when it mattered to set up Di Maria's goal late on . Is he protecting his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona, or is this more evidence of the new Messi? He’s been like that in La Liga since Christmas and I wondered if he was protecting himself for the World Cup, but now we are seeing more of the same. My first thought in the opening games was ‘he’s quiet’, but the more I study his performances, the more I believe he’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference. We have seen him make an impact, with the last-minute winner against Iran, the brilliant run that created the goal against Switzerland - he has still won the man of the match four times in four games and nobody has ever done that before in a World Cup. Leader: His team-mates have repeatedly looked to their captain for inspiration at this World Cup . Withdrawn: Messi was subbed off against Nigeria to preserve him for the knockout rounds . With four goals in those four games, he’s carried Argentina to this stage. But we haven’t seen a 90-minute performance like we used to see for Barcelona when Pep Guardiola was manager and Messi was forever on the ball. People may say he is too young to have to change his game. He is only 26, after all, but playing at the top with that pressure and intensity takes its toll and in terms of games played he’s probably closer to 30. So we may never see the old Messi again, but we should champion him for changing. Top of the world: Diego Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986 . He is the most important player in his team and, while he has been in the shadow of Diego Maradona, who won the World Cup single-handedly in 1986, Messi can go some way to emulating him if he can take this team to victory in the land of their fierce South American rivals. His Argentinian attacking colleagues have been, in the main, disappointing. Aguero isn’t fully fit, Higuain has struggled, Lavezzi has shown flashes and, apart from the Messi-inspired winner against Switzerland, Di Maria has failed to show. So Messi has a heavy weight to carry. Fully focused: Messi works with a ball in training on Friday ahead of Argentina's clash with Belgium . Smiling assassin: Messi trains with his Argentina team-mates in Brasilia on Friday . Pablo . Zabaleta of Manchester City and Argentina said after the game against . Switzerland that everyone wants to pass to Messi and then watch him work . his magic, as if his own team-mates are in awe of him. So the change in . his play is not weakening his standing, nor his output. Remember . his performance against City in the Champions League, where he was . magnificent while barely breaking out of a jog? We are seeing that . repeated here. His . battle with City’s captain Vincent Kompany that night made for . excellent viewing in the Nou Camp and I hope we see the same today when . they face Belgium in the quarter-final. Marked man: Messi has managed to shine despite his team-mates failing to perform at their best . Glory: The Argentine star celebrates scoring his team's first goal against Nigeria with a thumping effort . Technique: Messi strokes home the winner in Argentina's first group match versus Iran . Better than 'God'? If Messi wins the World Cup with Argentina he could surpass the legend of Maradona . Messi will have to come out on top if Argentina are to progress. For many, this is the tournament that will define him. He has been brilliant so far, but there will be better opponents from now on. How will the new model Messi fare? If he delivers, we will be asking: ‘Where does he stand alongside Pele and Diego Maradona?’","The attacker has scored four goals in four games so far and has been named man of the match in each of Argentina's matches .
The shadow of Diego Maradona hangs over Messi after he led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986 .
But if this new, remodelled Messi repeats Maradona's fete in Brazil, he will be right on par with his mentor ."
"After two years of turmoil, rebellion and bitter conflict, a new era of European rugby is about to begin. On Thursday night,  Gloucester and Brive launch the Challenge Cup and then on Friday  night at The Stoop, the main event begins when Harlequins take on Castres in the Champions Cup. For all the angst and animosity that so nearly led to the collapse of continental competition, there is a sense of familiarity about the tournaments that have hastily emerged from the wreckage. Representatives of the England clubs competing for the new European Rugby Champions Cup, which starts on Friday - (from left) Chris Bell (Wasps), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ed Slater (Leicester), Alistair Hargreaves (Saracens), Stuart Hooper (Bath), George North (Northampton) and Dan Braid (Sale) Reduction from six pools to five with the three best runners-up qualifying for last eight knockout phase. Qualification now solely dependent on league position with winners this year not guaranteed a spot next year. No drop-down qualification from main competition to the Challenge Cup. Tournament will be televised on Sky and BT Sport following a lucrative new television deal. Asked on Wednesday if the revamped competition feels much different from its predecessor, the Heineken Cup, Northampton’s England flanker, Tom Wood, said: ‘No, not at all. It feels exactly the same. It doesn’t change anything - we prepare the same, it’s still a great competition and it’s still a long old haul to get here.’ In terms of front-of-house alterations, there are now 20 teams involved in five pools, rather than the old format of 24 sides in six pools, which should - in principle - lead to a strengthening of the pool stages, now that some of the weakest links have been removed. The tournament’s greater meritocracy is a definite plus point. ‘This competition is meant to be an elite competition and it certainly has the feel of that this season,’ said Mark McCall, the director of rugby at Saracens - who have been the Aviva Premiership’s standard-bearers in Europe in recent seasons. They are bracing themselves for a pool of staggering quality. Northampton flanker Tom Wood says the new competition name won't change anything for the players . Toulon's English flanker Steffon Armitage (left) makes a destructive run in last year's Heineken Cup final . The last time the Heineken Cup was won by an English side was on May 20, 2007 when Wasps beat Leicester Tigers 25-9 in front of 81,076 fans at Twickenham. Wasps captain Lawrence Dallaglio (centre) leads celebrations with his team-mates at Twickenham . ‘Ourselves, Clermont and Munster were in the semi-finals last year and the year before, so we know it’s going to be incredibly difficult to get through the group,’ McCall added. ‘Last year, we got a more favourable group and there was an expectation that we would get into the quarter-finals. This year, it would be an achievement in itself to get through the pool.’ Bath are back at the top table after years among the second tier in the Challenge Cup. Their form suggests they can mount a compelling quest to reach the quarter-finals, but captain Stuart Hooper knows they have their hands full against Glasgow, Montpellier and Toulouse in Pool 4. ‘The way the competition is set up, teams qualify on merit so you’ve got the 20 best teams in Europe,’ said the lock. ‘With the French teams in our group, you’re going to come up against some of the best players in the world.’ The English clubs may soon recognise the wisdom of the old adage — be careful what you wish for. Premiership Rugby led the Anglo-French breakaway in order to secure wide-ranging reforms of the European game, but the immediate up-shot is that they may find it even harder to make their mark in the leading tournament. While the inaugural Champions Cup represents a fresh start, the backdrop has not radically shifted. The new format with 20 teams instead of 24 ensures the best sides in Europe are going head-to-head, says Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall, who led Owen Farrell and his side to last year's Heineken Cup final . French clubs have the biggest budgets and therefore the greatest depth of players, but what they don’t necessarily have across the board is extreme motivation. Some Gallic sides will once again react to early defeats by sending out weakened line-ups and focusing on domestic matters. One reason for English struggles in recent times has been the impact of the Irish, based on careful management of their players, in order to peak for these European windows. Now that qualification reform has put a greater emphasis on Pro12 results, Leinster, Munster and Ulster may have to work their stars harder, which may undermine their continental prospects. Champions Cup's Pro 12 representatives (left to right)  Ken Owens (Scarlets), Rory Best (Ulster),  Jamie Heaslip (Leinster), Peter O'Mahony (Munster), Jason Harris Wright Connacht, Henry Pyrgos (Glasgow), Antonio Pavanello (Treviso) and  Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys) at the competition's launch in Dublin . To take an example from each province, Paul O’Connell has played just three full Pro12 games for Munster so far this season, but Jamie Heaslip and Rory Best have each made four starting appearances and one off the bench for Leinster and Ulster respectively. Welsh hopes seemingly rest with the Ospreys, who are the only unbeaten team in Europe. There are just two regions involved this time and one side from each of Scotland and Italy. The standards may rise, but the lack of variety will be most keenly felt in three pools featuring two teams from the same nation. Sale v Saracens, Wasps v Harlequins and Toulouse v Montpellier lack the novelty value of classic European fixtures. Still, the Champions Cup promises to be fascinating. It has been a mad rush to put arrangements in place and there will be a period of transition behind the scenes, but the hope must be that the new era delivers the glorious drama that the Heineken Cup became adored for. POOL BY POOL GUIDE AS RUGBY STARTS A NEW ERA . Classic pool of death, containing three of last season’s semi-finalists.

"A new image released by NASA reveals a previously unseen view of Saturn and its rings using a navigation technique called a 'pi transfer'. The picture was taken by the space agency’s Cassini probe during a flyby past the planet's largest moon Titan when it was about 764,000 miles (1.23 million km) from Saturn. A pi transfer uses the gravity of the moon to alter the orbit of the Cassini spacecraft so it can gain different perspectives on Saturn and achieve a wide variety of science objectives. This Nasa picture taken on January 19, 2007, shows a view of Saturn and its rings - the visible documentation of a technique called a 'pi transfer' completed with a Titan flyby . Nasa said taking in the rings in their entirety was the focus of this particular imaging sequence. Therefore, the camera exposure times were just right to capture the dark-side of its rings, but longer than that required to properly expose the globe of sunlit Saturn. As a result, the sunlit half of the planet is overexposed. The view is a mosaic of 36 images - that is, 12 separate sets of red, green and blue images - taken over the course of about 2.5 hours, as Cassini scanned across the entire main ring system. This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees above the ring plane. Among the interplay of Saturn's shadow and rings, Mimas, which appears in the lower-right corner of the image, orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing spokes appear in the B ring (just to the right of centre) The images in this natural-color view were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.23 million km from Saturn. Image scale is 70 kilometers (44 miles) per pixel. Last week Nasa released pictures taken on October 22, 2013, which showed the planet’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail, along with its 'Death Star' moon seen glowing in the distance. The planet’s moon Mimas, also known as . the ‘Death Star’ because of its resemblance to the space station, is . visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right. The image also shows the mysterious ‘spokes’ in Saturn's B ring, just to the right of centre. An image taken by Cassini in 2012. A shadow cast by Saturn's moon Tethys across the A ring as Saturn's own shadow block light from the lower part of the rings (bottom right). Cassini captured the view at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles from Saturn . Saturn and her rings as the rings cast shadows on the planet. Nasa's probe Cassini captured the view at a distance of approximately 621,000 miles from Saturn . In a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn's A ring, has been named 'Peggy' after Professor Murray's mother-in-law . Mimas is an inner moon of Saturn and averages 246 miles (396 km) in diameter.  Mimas and another Saturn moon, Rhea, have been called ‘the most heavily cratered body in the solar system.’ Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn’s rings date back more than four billion years. Its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years. For instance in a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft. The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law. Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon. It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight. Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow. The planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit.","Cassini probe took previously unreleased image when it was about 764,000 miles from Saturn .

"A man is lucky to be alive after he miraculously survived for 14 hours trapped in a tiny air bubble after his car flipped upside down and into a ditch of water. Mark Beckford was reported missing by his wife Lesley, 60, on Tuesday morning when he failed to come home. The 45-year-old was driving at about 2am when his red MG ZR came off the road and into the ditch near Hamstreet in Kent. Miracle: Martin Beckford is lucky to be alive after his car flipped upside down and into a ditch filled with water . But the taxi driver was not discovered until shortly before 4pm. He was found trapped with just an air pocket at the back of the car to keep him from drowning. Kent Fire and Rescue Service crews were called after a lorry driver spotted the back wheels of a car upside down. Wife Lesley, 60, of New Romney, said: 'We were in a panic. We were ringing everyone. Nobody knew where he was. 'I rang him up to five times from work and all I got was the voicemail service. When I got home he was still not there and then I reported him missing.' Mrs Beckford’s daughters Melanie Wellman and Nichola O’Shea, were among the family members who spent the night calling friends, the hospital and police to find Mr Beckford. Miss Wellman said: 'Mark was never able to call for help because his phone was lost in the ditch during the accident. It was never even found when they rescued him.' Romney Marsh Watch Manager, Alan Brown, said: 'The car was almost submerged in 4ft of water and the firefighters used hydraulic cutting equipment to release the hatchback door so they could check if there was anyone inside. Kent Fire and Rescue Service crews were called after a lorry driver spotted the back wheels of a car upside down . 'In order to release him, crews winched the car partially up the bank so it was far enough out of the water to safely remove him through the hatch back door.' The Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) attended the scene and two HART paramedics also entered the water to assist in dry suits. The driver was treated at the scene by paramedics and a doctor before being taken by ambulance to the William Harvey Hospital where he is currently in a stable condition. Rob Sherwood of Kent Fire and Rescue Service praised emergency crews for their hard work. He said: 'This was a very unusual rescue and they all did a good job in difficult circumstances. 'I would like to praise the lorry driver for spotting the car and calling 999. If he hadn’t stopped for a look then the man would have been in there even longer and it might have been a different outcome. 'Our firefighters managed to get into the car and provided an initial medical response until the ambulance teams quickly took over. All the emergency services at the scene worked as a team to achieve this rescue.' The A2070 between Hamstreet and Brenzett was closed in both directions while police recovered the vehicle. Kent Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash.","Mark Beckford was reported missing when he failed to come home .

"George Ford and Stephen Myler will be given the opportunity to challenge Owen Farrell’s status as England’s premier playmaker, as long as they emerge unscathed from European matches this weekend. National coach Stuart Lancaster is due to name his autumn Test squad next Wednesday and the five-way contest for No 10 places has been a subject of constant intrigue during the early stages of the season. Farrell’s place is assured, but Sportsmail has learned that Ford and Myler have done enough to earn selection ahead of the other prime candidates; Danny Cipriani and Freddie Burns. That pair are set to be named in the Saxons squad, barring any fly-half injuries in the coming days. Bath fly-half George Ford is expected to make the squad after missing England's summer tour through injury . Danny Cipriani is set to be left out after making his comeback on England's summer tour of New Zealand . Saracens's Owen Farrell (left) and Northampton's Stephen Myler are expected to make the cut . Leicester fly-half Freddie Burns (left) is also expected to be left out of Stuart Lancaster's (right) squad . Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward caught up with Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani to exclusively talk all things England . Ford is the form man, based on his exploits in the first six rounds of Aviva Premiership matches. He has played every minute of every game for Bath – a total of 480 – and tops the scoring charts, with 84 points and 33 successful kicks. The 21-year-old has recovered ground rapidly, having missed England’s June tour of New Zealand, in order to have shoulder surgery. In his absence, and with Farrell initially delayed and then injured, Burns started the first and third Tests – with Cipriani making replacement appearances on those occasions, in Auckland and Hamilton. Both men returned from the trip with renewed hope about their World Cup prospects, but the delayed announcement of the England squad has apparently counted against them. Cipriani has shone in patches but has been hampered by Sale’s unconvincing start to the season, while Burns made a good early impact for new club Leicester, but his momentum was knocked during the Tigers’ run of three defeats and Owen Williams has taken over goal-kicking duties. On form alone, Ford would surely start the autumn opener against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8, based on his all-court attacking game, allied to improved defence and composure under pressure. Myler would also be ahead of Farrell on the basis of recent exploits alone – having added layers of subtle variety under the tutelage of Alex King at Northampton, while maintaining his trademark precision. Farrell was eased into the new campaign gently after a knee injury ended his tour and he has played a total of just 99 minutes for Saracens so far, scoring 21 points. But he has repeatedly proved his big-game credentials and providing he returns to action this weekend, as his club insist he will, then the Lion will no doubt force his way back to the head of the queue. Danny Cipriani sits down and talks to Sir Clive Woodward about his England career . Danny Cipriani, in action for Sale against Northampton, has been in good form for his club . Another often-discussed option would be for England to unleash Ford and Farrell in tandem, as a 10-12 combination which was hugely effective at junior level. Asked on Monday if it was a possibility, Lancaster told Sky Sports News: ‘Yes, we did that in the Italy game (at the end of last season’s Six Nations). ‘Owen was starting at 10 and George was on the bench. We brought George on and Owen moved to 12, so it has been done and obviously as age-grade players they played together all the time so they understand each other and they are best mates as well.’ Another man who may soon emerge as an England No 12 contender is the union convert-in-waiting, Sam Burgess. The rugby league icon will join Bath in the coming weeks, when he has recovered from facial surgery and Lancaster knows that the newcomer is aiming high, saying: ‘Having spoken to him, his mind-set obviously is to make the World Cup squad. ‘We have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn the game quickly. But he also doesn’t want to come just for the World Cup, we talked about the Six Nations 2016, the Australia tour at the end of 2016, the Lions in 2017; these are all goals for him.’ Sam Burgess has been an rugby league star, and hopes his code switch will ready him for the union World Cup . Sam Burgess fractured his cheekbone and eye socket playing his last match for the South Sydney Rabbitohs . Lancaster is hugely enthused by Burgess’s potential, adding: ‘What struck me when I met him is obviously he is an exceptional rugby player, but a leader too. He is mentally tough, mentally strong and when we talk about that experience and that leadership that you need in your team, if he can learn the game he will bring an invaluable amount to the group. Obviously he has got to learn the game first but he is a very, very good player and an impressive person. ‘He has a desire to dominate his opposite number and he’s played against some huge stars in rugby league. He’s taken the decision to go out to Australia at 18 years old because he wants to test himself and that’s a big thing to do. He’ s done that, he’s achieved it and now he sees another challenge in front of him and you’ve got to admire someone who has that sense of mental strength. It will be fascinating to see how he goes.’ Yet, one of those current England centres who will doing their utmost to block Burgess’s path to the top is another cross-code international and Bath player – Kyle Eastmond. Last week, he was named Aviva Premiership Player of the Month for September and he has evidently made a strong impression on Lancaster after a disappointing end to his tour of New Zealand. ‘He is rather good and he has really developed this season,’ said the coach. ‘Obviously he had a great first Test and things didn’t go for us as a back line in the third Test. I had a good chat with him afterwards and he had a steely determination in his mind, I could see him at that point saying, “Right, I’ll be back next season and I’ll be ready”. Kyle Eastmond of Bath skips away from Wasps prop Matt Mullan in the Aviva Premiership on Sunday . Exeter youngster Henry Slade has also played himself into England contention with his club form . VIDEO Exeter Chiefs v London Irish . ‘He said the same thing to Bath and he’s been outstanding this season so he’s really putting a marker down for the November internationals. But I watched Brad Barritt at the weekend and he was outstanding. There’s also Billy Twelvetrees, Luther Burrell, Henry Slade’s playing well at 13; the list goes on.’ Lancaster and his assistants will prepare for the gruelling series of four Tests next month with the added reassurance of new, long-term deals with the RFU, running until the end of the 2019-20 season. The union’s announcement of the contract extensions prompted speculation about how they might respond in the event of World Cup disappointment next year, but the management still expect to be judged on merit. ‘We’re delighted that we’ve got the support of the RFU and the Board,’ said Lancaster. ‘I don't think when you’re a coach of a national side you ever get room for complacency. I don’t want to leave any stone unturned so I don't think there will be any complacency. We are judged, as we know, by results and we will be judged that way, and for me there will be no complacency.’ VIDEO .","Sale fly-half to be snubbed as George Ford makes England return .

"The mystery as to why our galaxy’s supermassive black hole is dormant has stumped scientists for decades. But new evidence suggests that the ‘sleeping dragon’ was in fact active at some point- we just weren’t around to see it. Astronomers claim that the supermassive black hole erupted two million years ago in an explosion so immensely powerful that it lit up a cloud 200,000 light years away. Scroll down for video... Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy . While scientists had previously predicted that such an outburst had occurred, this is the first time they have been able to say when it happened. The finding is a confirmation that black holes can 'flicker', moving from maximum power to switching off over, in cosmic terms, short periods of time. ‘Now we know when this sleeping dragon, four million times the mass of the sun, awoke and breathed fire with 100 million times the power it has today,’ said Professor Joss Bland-Hawthorn, lead author of the study published in the Astrophysical Journal. ‘It's been long suspected that our Galactic Centre might have sporadically flared up in the past. These observations are a highly suggestive “smoking gun”,’ said Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, who was one of the first scientists to suggest that massive black holes power quasars. The evidence for the findings comes from a lacy filament of hydrogen gas called the Magellanic Stream. It trails behind our galaxy's two small companion galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. ‘Since 1996, we've been aware of an odd glow from the Magellanic Stream, but didn't understand the cause. ‘Then this year, it finally dawned on me that it must be the mark, the fossil record, of a huge outburst of energy from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy.’ The region around the galaxy's supermassive black hole and the black hole is called Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). It emits radio, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray emissions. Flickers of radiation rise up when small clouds of gas fall onto the hot disk of matter that swirls around the black hole. But scientists had been puzzled by evidence contrary to this activity that revealed there was a cataclysmic event in the past. ‘In particular, in 2010 NASA's Fermi satellite discovered two huge bubbles of hot gas billowing out from the centre of the galaxy, covering almost a quarter of the sky,’ said Professor Bland-Hawthorn. The large image contains X-rays from Nasa's Chandra Observatory in blue and infrared emission from the Hubble Space Telescope in red and yellow. The inset shows a close-up view of our galaxy's supermassive black hole in X-rays only, covering a region half a light year wide . Earlier this year, computer simulations of the Fermi bubbles made by the University of California Santa Cruz controversially suggested that they were caused by a colossal explosion from Sagittarius A* within the last few million years. ‘When I saw this research I realised that this same event would also explain the mysterious glow that we see on the Magellanic Stream,’ Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. ‘Together with Dr Ralph Sutherland from Mount Stromlo Observatory and Dr Phil Maloney, from the University of Colorado, I calculated that to explain the glow it must have happened two million years ago because the energy release shown by the Santa Cruz group perfectly matched, to our delight, that from the Magellanic Stream.’ The realisation that these black holes can switch on and off within a million years, which given the universe is 14 billion years old means very rapidly, has been described by researchers as a ‘significant discovery’. Professor Bland-Hawthorn said it is certain that this event will happen again. ‘There are lots of stars and gas clouds that could fall onto the hot disk around the black hole,’ he said. ‘There's a gas cloud called G2 that astronomers around the world are anticipating will fall onto the black hole early next year. It's small, but we're looking forward to the fireworks.’","For 20 years scientists had suspected that a huge outburst had occurred .

"Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes wants Kentuckians to know she is most definitely not President Barack Obama, and she even wields a gun in her latest campaign ad, released today to prove it. The entire 30-second ad takes place in a field where Grimes shoots skeet while she mocks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, her opponent in the race, and lists off the issues she disagrees with the unpopular Democratic president on. 'Mitch McConnell wants you to think I'm Barack Obama. Mitch is the same guy who thought Duke basketball players were UK,' Grimes says, referring to an ad the McConnell campaign released that confused the state's two college basketball teams. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not Obama: Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes is so afraid of being associated with President Barack Obama that cut an ad explicitly telling voters she's not him . 'I'm not Barack Obama,' Grimes later says straight to camera. 'I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA. 'And Mitch, that's not how you hold a gun,' she says, flashing a photo of  McConnell holding a gun upside down at the Conservative Political Action conference in March. McConnell's gesture was a throwback to actor Charleston Heston's presentation at the National Rifle Association's annual convention in 2000, not a befuddled attempt at holding a fire arm. The Grimes campaign sunk it's teeth into into the move however after a conservative news publication revealed that McConnell may not own a gun. 'Of course Sen. McConnell has shot a gun,' a spokesperson for McConnell's campaign told The Washington Examiner, 'but as a matter of principle he's not interested in helping the left bully people into revealing what protection they may keep in their own homes.' McConnell's Senate staff wouldn't confirm to reporters whether the Republican politician owned a gun either. In response to Grimes' ad hitting McConnell over the gun incident, Team Mitch campaign spokesperson Allison Moore said: 'An inexperienced Obama liberal with a gun is no less dangerous ‎for Kentucky families than one without. 'Much of Alison Lundergan Grimes' financial support comes from those seeking to implement gun control and wage the war on coal but cynically she believes a recycled TV ad idea will fool Kentuckians,' she added. Grimes shoots skeet in her video, however a handful of other House and Senate candidates released ads of themselves shooting copies of Obamacare and other legislation backed by the president to distance themselves from his policies. In her ad Grimes makes fun of McConnell for not knowing his way around a firearm, as evidenced by this photo of him at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in March. McConnell was purposefully holding the gun upside down, however, in a throw back to a move made by actor Charlton Heston at another conservative conference more than a decade ago . While Grimes may know her way around a firearm better than her opponent, it's McConnell who has the backing of the largest gun lobbying organization. The NRA endorsed McConnell in the race last week and gave him an A+ - it's highest rating - on Second Amendment rights. 'The true measure of leadership and courage comes during moments of adversity and Leader McConnell has stood steadfast with America’s law-abiding gun owners during the most trying of times,' Chris W. Cox, chairman of the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund said in a statement. 'He has fought against sweeping gun and ammo bans and supported substantive efforts that rightfully place the burden of our justice system on violent criminals. Leader McConnell also led the effort in the U.S. Senate last year to defeat Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg’s gun control agenda.' Grimes skeet shooting ad is the candidate's response to a 30-second ad McConnell's campaign put out last week that seeks to tie Grimes to Obamacare, the rising national debt, the flood of unaccompanied minors coming over the U.S.' southern border and Obama's claim that 'we don't have a strategy yet' to deal with ISIS in Syria. As side by side photos of Obama and Grimes appear on screen, the ad's narrator claims that 'Obama needs Alison Grimes. Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell.' The president has had a low approval rating among all Americans for several months, but he is especially unpopular in Kentucky. A poll taken in May by several Kentucky news organizations found that just 29 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of the president. A majority, 57 percent, said they did not have a positive opinion of him. At the time, McConnell also had a low favorability rating, but Kentuckians have since warmed back up to McConnell faced with the prospect of electing Grimes instead. 'The people in Kentucky made up their mind about Mitch McConnell a long time ago. ... They would be happy to replace him but ... she hasn't given them any reasons to be for her,' Democratic consultant Danny Briscoe told The Courier Journal on Sunday. 'Something's got to be done a lot different,' he added, 'because what's happening isn't working.' With less than 50 days until the election, McConnell is now leading Grimes by an average of five points in polls, according to multiple polls taken in the several weeks.","Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes is running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Mitch McConnell .

"A prosecutor who shot himself on camera in his office has said his life was being threatened because he was investigating a plane crash that killed Poland's president in 2010. Colonel Mikolaj Przybyl had been defending a military investigation into leaks related to the crash that killed then-president Lech Kaczynski and 95 others. But he asked reporters to leave his office in Poznan, Poland, while he took a five-minute break, and after they left the still-rolling cameras captured the sound of him loading a pistol and a single gunshot. Scroll down for video . Polish prosecutor Mikolaj Przybyl at the start of the news conference in Poznan, western Poland . He defended a military investigation into leaks related to a plane crash that killed Poland's president two years ago . Speaking from hospital, where he is being treated for facial injuries, he told PAP news agency: 'I could accept the fact that my car had been demolished, that my tyre had been loosened in an attempt to kill me, that my dog had been killed. 'I also knew a bounty of (zlotys)1million had been put on my head but I couldn't accept the fact that I had been accused of an illegal action. 'I wanted to commit suicide. I put the pistol barrel in my mouth but my hand shook because I saw the door handle move. 'A man who wanted to shift the cables saved me... the bullet hit my cheek and didn't go through my head.' Col Przybyl was referring to to reports that the prosecutor's office for which he worked had illegally attempted to obtain the telephone records of journalists suspected of being given leaked information on the Smolensk air disaster investigation. He then asked the reporters to leave as he 'needs a rest' With the camera still rolling, he crosses to the other side of his office after the journalists have left . After shooting himself, his body slumped to the floor, with just his shoe visible in the frame (arrowed) It comes after new footage shows the moment panicked journalists realised what Col Przybyl had done after hearing a loud bang from his office. The recording shows one reporter reentering the room and trying to lift up a stricken Col Przybyl, before seeing the injury caused by the gunshot. He then signals to other journalists to get help and minutes later the prosecutor is carried to an ambulance and rushed to hospital. One reporter told Polish TV: 'We heard a loud thud and we went back into the room thinking one of the cameras had fallen over. 'Then we saw the prosecutor lying motionless on the ground in a pool of blood, his military gun beside him.' Concern: After hearing a loud thud, one of the reporters reenters the room and finds Col Przybyl slumped on the ground . Injuries: The reporter tries to turn the man over, but quickly realised he had shot himself . Panic: He then gestures for other journalists in the room to get help as the man lies bleeding on the floor . Przybyl was taken to hospital, where he is in a stable condition with injuries to his face . The death toll from the plane crash included the country's president and wife, its central bank head and the country's military chief along with other senior government and military figures . Dead: Polish President Lech Kaczynski and wife Maria were among those who perished in the crash . Moments before the shooting, the prosecutor said: 'During my entire service as a civilian and later military prosecutor, I have never brought shame to the Republic of Poland and I will protect the honour of an officer of the Polish armed forces and prosecution. 'Thank you, please give me a five-minute break, I need to rest.' Col Przybyl is a deputy head of the prosecutor's office and the head of a local department investigating organised crime in the army. During his brief news conference, he said the military prosecutor's office had the right to seek phone records of journalists covering the investigation of the crash. He read a statement to reporters in which he objected to plans by Prosecutor General Andrzej Seremet to put military prosecutors under civilian authority. Mr Seremet said that such a decision has not been made yet. Col Przybyl also said that military prosecutors were proving themselves competent in the many probes that they have opened into organised crime cases inside the army. The probes primarily concern suspicions of corruption in buying equipment for Poland's troops on missions in Afghanistan and, earlier, in Iraq. The media has alleged that the prosecutors had sought billing lists and text message content of mobile phones of some reporters to determine the source of leaks to the media. Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski said in a statement he was 'concerned' about the suicide attempt and asked the head of the national security bureau to monitor the situation. Some lawmakers are calling for a special parliamentary probe into the case. Col Przybyl has a damaged skull and his being treated at Poznan's HCP hospital. The plane taking then president Lech Kaczynski's delegation to a memorial service for the 1940 Katyn massacre of Polish officers by Soviet secret police crashed in thick fog in Smolensk, western Russia on April 10, 2010. The wreckage of the Polish president's plane lies in woodland near Smolensk airport in Russia . Russia fully blamed Poland for the deadly plane crash which killed the Polish president. Russian . officials investigating the plane crash that killed Lech Kaczynski said the crew was pressured to land in bad weather by an . air force commander who had been drinking. Kaczynski and 95 . others, including his wife, died in April 2010 when their plane crashed . while trying to land in Smolensk, Russia. There were no survivors. Officials of the Interstate Aviation . Committee, which investigates crashes in much of the former Soviet . Union, said that the pilots were pressured to land by Poland's . air force commander, General Andrzej Blasik, who was in the cockpit. They said he had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.06 percent, enough to impair reasoning. Blasik's . presence in the cockpit 'had a psychological influence on the . commander's decision to take an unjustified risk by continuing the . descent with the predominant goal of landing against the odds,' the . committee chairwoman Tatiana Anodina told a news conference last January. The report found no fault with Russian air traffic controllers. Polish officials have already complained that previous . drafts of Russia's report should have questioned whether controllers . should have allowed the plane to land in poor visibility. In December 2010, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused the Russian investigators of negligence and mistakes. Kaczynski . and his delegation were on their way to attend a ceremony commemorating . the victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre, in which 20,000 Polish officers . and other prisoners of war were killed by the Soviet secret police. The symbolic importance of Kaczynski's planned visit apparently . increased the pressure to land the aircraft despite the poor conditions. But the head of the committee's technical commission, Alexei . Morozov, said there was no 'concrete command' from Kaczynski to land. The blood-alcohol content found in Blasik was lower than what is generally considered outright intoxication. But . the professional pilots and physicians group says 'the number of . serious errors committed by pilots dramatically increases at or above . concentrations of 0.04 percent,' lower than Blasik's level.","Mikolaj Przybyl claims tyre on his car was loosened, pet dog was killed and bounty placed on his head over investigation into plane crash that killed Polish president .

"A cardiologist is being sued by a New York City strip club for not paying over $135,000 - and says he  was drugged by the club's employees. Dr. Zyad Kivarkis Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey, has claimed that he did not authorize $135,303 worth of charges to his American Express card at Scores New York because, he claims, he was 'drugged' by an employee of the club and was incapable of approving the charges. According to the lawsuit, Scores claims Younan 'contested the charges alleging that he was drugged by plaintiff’s employees and thus did not authorize the charges and/or he was not at plaintiff’s place of business on the aforesaid dates.' The club, however, says it has Younan on video at the club four times over a 10-day period in November. 'Drugged': Dr. Zyad Younan, pictured, said he was drugged by employees at Scores New York and did not authorize over $135,000 charged to his credit card . In a lawsuit filed with Manhattan Supreme Court and obtained by the New York Daily News, the strip club says Younan came of his own accord during his four trips to the jiggle-joint in November. It alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services.' Club manager Stephen Hyman told the paper that it's not unusual for a person to run up a big bill at Scores. He says, however, that it is unusual when someone doesn't pay. 'We get a lot of very wealthy people here. You can run up a bill,' he said. Just to get in the door at Scores will cost you $20. Bottles of champagne can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club, the paper reports, will easily run you $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips for the dancers on their credit cards. 'We charge reasonable — for us — prices for liquor. We don’t cater to beer drinkers,' Hyman said. Plaintiff: Scores New York has filed a lawsuit against Younan for the money, and says he came 'voluntarily' to the club . As for Younan's claim that he was incapacitated when he was at the club, Hyman says, 'he was coherent until he saw the bill - or his wife saw the bill.' Scores representative Steven Sabbeth told the NY Post 'This happens every once in a while, people get out of control with their credit cards, and then they wake up the next morning and realize what they’ve done.' 'They knew it the night before, but I guess it didn’t bother them because they were enjoying themselves.'","Dr. Zyad Younan, a New Jersey cardiologist, say he was drugged by employees at Scores New York .

"Tourists on a big wheel ride in Budapest were left befuddled when the commentary described the city of Plymouth over a thousand miles away. While gazing down at the banks of the River Danube, passengers heard a voice inside their pod waxing lyrical about the beauty and history of Smeaton's Tower, the Mayflower steps, the Devonport Naval Base and Sir Francis Drake. But there's a simple explanation: The big wheel completed its final rotation on Plymouth Hoe almost a year ago -  and is now entertaining visitors 1300 miles away in the centre of the Hungarian capital. Confused: Tourists on the wheel heard commentary describing a city over a thousand miles away . The commentary promised 'a bird's eye view of Plymouth' as it was heading up and over the River Danube . The commentary, by Radio Plymouth's Tim Mans and Jon White and city historian Chris Robinson, promised riders 'a bird's eye view of Plymouth', before explaining what they should be looking at asthey went around. The company which runs the wheel admitted to the mix-up, but says it has since been rectified. Merv Metcalf, aged 42, from London, visited Budapest in June with his friend Alexan Palamountain. A different location: The big wheel completed its final rotation on Plymouth Hoe almost a year ago . 'We had some time to kill before flying back so we went on the wheel,' Merv said. 'There were four of us in our pod, you can put the commentary on or off so we put it on, expecting to hear about the sights and sounds of Budapest. 'But instead we had a welcome from a couple of DJs telling us about the sights and sounds of Plymouth and its history. 'There was no alternative, so someone must have forgotten to swap the commentaries over. It was quite a surreal, strange experience.' Smeaton's Tower, left, and the famous Mayflower steps in Plymouth were two of the landmarks described . Plymouth's Devonport Naval Base, another landmark which featured in the commentary used in Budapest . Plymothian Steve Dykes, who visited the city in July, added: 'They have forgotten to change the tape, so if you select 'English' when the wheel moves it spouts all about Plymouth's history and views of the Hoe.' Historian Chris Robinson, whose voice could be heard on the commentary, said the revelation was news to him. 'It must have been somewhat bizarre, especially if anyone listening to it spoke English,' he said. The 214-ft-wheel is now in Erzsebet Square in the centre of Hungary' beautiful capital, Budapest . The wheel opened in Plymouth in 2011 and was taken over in September 2012 by Dubai-based Freij World Attractions. The 214-ft-high attraction is now in Erzsebet Square in the centre of Budapest, forming the centrepiece of the Sziget Festival. Tamas Kadar, CEO of Sziget Cultural Management, said the Plymouth commentary was mistakenly added to the wheel when it opened in Budapest in May and has since been turned off.","Plymouth's famous big wheel completed its final rotation almost a year ago .

"Thieves are pocketing a staggering 2,000 smartphones a day in a national crimewave – and iPhones are the most likely to be stolen. The flagship Apple devices make up the bulk of the 742,000 phones pinched across England and Wales over the past two years, a study shows. The most recent iPhone models take the first four places in a new ‘most stolen’ league table aimed at encouraging owners to keep a closer eye on their valuables. Target: iPhones make up the bulk of the 742,000 phones pinched across England and Wales over the past two years, a study shows . The next most popular phone among thieves is the BlackBerry 9790, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S3 and the HTC One X also feature in the top ten. Police chiefs suspect that many phones are stolen to order by crime gangs who export them overseas – where they can fetch more than £500 each – and evade blocking technology which makes them useless in Britain. In some cases the personal information on phones is harvested and passed on to other criminals, who use it for identity theft and fraud. The figures were contained in a new report by the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, sometimes dubbed the ‘Nudge Unit’. The findings were based on detailed crime data collected by the Metropolitan Police between August 2012 and January 2014. Analysts discovered that the typical victim of phone theft is a woman aged between 14 and 24 who is pickpocketed or leaves her phone unguarded in a cafe or bar. There were 742,000 victims of mobile phone theft in England and Wales during 2012 and 2013, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. In London alone last year, almost 100,000 mobile phone thefts were reported to the Metropolitan Police. Manufacturers have introduced new measures to make their phones less attractive to thieves. Many can be remotely locked and wiped if stolen or even traced using satellite tracking technology. Home Secretary Theresa May said mobile phone theft remains a ‘concern’ despite the efforts of the industry to protect phones. She added: ‘People are increasingly carrying their lives in their pockets, with bank details, emails and other sensitive personal information easily accessible through mobile phones. This is why it is vital that government, police and industry work together to tackle this crime. We are also working with industry to stop the reactivation of phones overseas, thereby killing the export market.’","More than 742,000 phones taken in England and Wales over past two years .

"McDonald's is blaming the ‘severe winter weather’ after announcing a 1.7 percent drop in customer traffic in the United States during the first quarter of 2014. The Oak Brook, Illinois-based fast food giant attributed the drop in the flagship U.S. market to ‘challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather’, while global sales fared only slightly better and edged up 0.5 percent. The world's biggest hamburger chain is however predicting that global sales for April will be modestly positive. McDonald's is blaming the 'severe winter weather' after announcing a 1.7 percent drop in customer traffic in its flagship U.S. market during the first quarter of 2014. April is the first full month that Taco Bell has offered its national breakfast menu, which it has pitched to challenge McDonald's dominance in the morning. The decline in sales and customer traffic in the U.S. reflects the increasing struggle McDonald's is facing as eating habits change and competition intensifies. After a decade of growth, annual sales at established U.S. locations fell for the first time last year. The continued decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 is in stark contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which last week said sales at established locations rose 13.4 percent. The fast-food restaurant chain posted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 on revenues of $6.7 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $1.26 on revenues of $6.61 billion . McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has noted in the past that there is a split appearing in the fast-food industry, with people who have more spending money heading off to chains that charge more. He said McDonald's will focus on underscoring value for its more cash-strapped customers, but the chain is also offering more premium offerings such as its new Bacon Clubhouse Burger. In a statement on Tuesday, Thompson said McDonald's is focusing ‘creating the best overall experience for our customers.’ To adapt to shifting trends, for instance, the chain has been rolling out new prep tables in its U.S. kitchens that can hold more sauces and toppings. The idea is to eventually offer greater customization on its menu while keeping orders easy to assemble for workers. McDonald's is predicting improved sales in April despite it being the first full month that Taco Bell has offered its national breakfast menu, which it has pitched to challenge McDonald's dominance in the morning . Speed and accuracy have been an issue for McDonald's as it stepped up the pace of new menu items in the past year. In Europe, McDonald's said sales rose 1.4 percent at established locations in the latest quarter. The figure rose 0.8 percent in the unit that encompasses Asia, the Middle East and Africa, despite a decline in traffic. For the quarter ended March 31, net income fell to $1.2 billion, or $1.21 per share. Analysts expected $1.24 per share. A year ago, the company earned $1.27 billion, or $1.26 per share. McDonald's Corp. noted that the year-ago results were boosted by income tax benefits. Revenue edged up to $6.7 billion, but was shy of the $6.71 billion Wall Street expected. Shares of McDonald's edged up 83 cents to $100.50 in pre-market trading.

"Defensive: Sir Hugh Orde, pictured, blamed Government cuts for the criticism in a damning report . A police leader sparked disbelief last night by insisting officers still took crimes seriously even when they did not bother turning up to investigate. Sir Hugh Orde blamed Government cuts for criticism in a damning report that found officers were not attending crime scenes – and were often telling victims to make their own investigations. The former Northern Ireland chief constable said senior officers had to make ‘risk-based decisions’ because of limited resources. He slammed the report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for failing to accept that forces had shrinking budgets, and sending police to all incidents came at a cost. Sir Hugh spoke out after a nationwide review found a postcode lottery over whether officers attended crimes. In one area, officers turned up to fewer than one in ten vehicles thefts and only two in five of all crimes. Many forces are instead asking people to become ‘DIY detectives’ and find their own clues such as witnesses, fingerprints and CCTV footage. Sir Hugh, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said forces had lost a quarter of their budgets, adding: ‘Every chief officer has to make risk-based decisions. I’m afraid there is a connection between austerity and what we can do. ‘The simple fact that an officer does not turn up does not mean that an offence is not being taken seriously.’ Victims are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property, according to the report . The row began after chief constables were accused of effectively ‘giving up’ on some crimes. Many victims of so-called ‘low-level’ or ‘volume’ crimes are bitter that officers did not bother attending. Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said offences such as shed burglaries, vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly . Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said offences such as shed burglaries, vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly. Instead, officers carry out ‘desk-based investigations’ in which reports are filed and forgotten if victims cannot come up with their own leads. They are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property. Mr Baker refuted Sir Hugh’s assertion that the practice was the result of limited police resources. He said he noticed the damaging ‘mindset’ in the 1990s when he was seconded to Acpo – but was told to keep quiet when he flagged up his concerns about the trend. Experts pointed out that low-level offending often spiralled into more serious and violent crimes, and early intervention was an opportunity to prevent this escalation. They said asking vulnerable residents to ‘turn detective’ could put them at risk. Professor Craig Jackson, of Birmingham City University, said: ‘Many victims of low-level offences know the offender. ‘We may be sending women victims of low-level early-stage stalking offences to investigate the crimes and meet the offender. It’s like sending the fly into the spider’s web.’ Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said: ‘This isn’t a question of austerity. The public have a right to have their crimes investigated.’","Damning report found police officers were not attending crime scenes .

"One of the country’s most senior police officers was accused of ‘sheer incompetence’ last night over his handling of the raid on the home of Sir Cliff Richard. The BBC and South Yorkshire police clashed in Parliament over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of a raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home last month. The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in ‘a very difficult position’ after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault. Mr Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert said it was a ‘rather remarkable blackmail attempt’. But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked. Scroll down for video . South Yorkshire police chief David Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee the BBC would have published a story on the Sir Cliff Richard raid if his force did not cooperate . Home Affairs Select Committee Chairman Keith Vaz suggested that South Yorkshire police had been blackmailed by the BBC . Chief Constable David Crompton was questioned during a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing in the House of Commons today . Sir Cliff's apartment was searched by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police last month as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on a young boy at a religious event in 1985. A BBC crew reportedly arrived on the scene before the police, while Sir Cliff was abroad in his holiday home in Portugal. Mr Crompton told MPs that his concern was that 'if we showed the BBC the door, the very clear impression which had been left with my staff in the media department was that they were likely to publish the story'. He said: 'That would have impeded our investigation.' Chairman of the committee Keith Vaz put it to the senior officer that the broadcaster had blackmailed him, but Mr Crompton replied: ‘Blackmail is a very strong word. It put us in a very difficult position.’ Mr Crompton also apologised Sir Cliff if the force was ‘insensitive’ about the search of his home. He said: ‘We had a job to do but I do apologise to Sir Cliff if we were insensitive about the way that we did that. We had a job to do, and we have an investigation. The problem is that investigation could never be done in a low-profile way because it was fatally compromised from the outset.’ Mr Crompton added: ‘The coverage was disproportionate and made our actions look heavy-handed and intrusive. I do regret that.’ But in subsequent evidence to MPs this afternoon, BBC director general Lord Hall told the Committee: ‘Had the chief constable come to a news editor, head of news gathering, James Harding, director of news or myself and said to us “if you run this story you will hamper this investigation, it would be damaging to this investigation” we would not have run the story. ‘I want you to be absolutely clear about that. We would not have run the story.’ Lord Hall added that reporter Dan Johnson went to South Yorkshire Police to discuss ‘a number of stories’ and had a tip off from a source which he will not reveal referring to Cliff Richard. He said there was ‘no hint in any of that of us knowing any more than the name Cliff Richard’. Lord Hall said: ‘The reporter didn't have a story until he went to South Yorkshire Police... and they gave him the story.’ The BBC boss added: ‘South Yorkshire Police had given us a story, had made no attempt to stop us running the story’ He said: ‘It was a proper story for us to cover, in the right matter, proportionately, which I think is what we did. I wasn't surprised the police didn't ask us not to broadcast the story.’ Following the evidence Mr Vaz said that as far as far as the committee was concerned, the BBC 'have acted perfectly properly in respect of this matter'. BBC Reporter David Sillito covered the Cliff Richard raid by police live . A BBC News helicopter filmed police arriving to search Sir Cliff's Berkshire property . Sir Cliff, who was in Portugal when the search took place, firmly denied any wrongdoing and hit out at the fact BBC journalists were apparently tipped off about the plan. He has cancelled a series of public appearances since the search, and has been interviewed under caution by police, but not arrested or charged. The BBC's head of news gathering Jonathan Munro said that the information did not come from South Yorkshire Police, while the force said it had decided to work with the broadcaster to protect its investigation. Sir Cliff Richard was at his home in Portugal when police raided his Berkshire property . Mr Crompton has revealed that the force was approached by a BBC journalist with detailed information about its investigation, and ‘reluctantly’ the reporter was give notice of the planned search to dissuade the corporation from publishing details in advance. He objected to an analysis piece published on the BBC website that he felt suggested that there had been a deliberate attempt to 'ensure maximum coverage' by the force, and accused the broadcaster of trying to ‘distance itself’ from the fact it had initiated contact with them. Thames Valley Police said it had no contact with the media before the search warrant was executed. The appearance before the committee today comes at a turbulent time for South Yorkshire Police, which last week came under fire for failing to protect vulnerable victims of crime. South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit, which handles sex crimes such as rape, honour-based violence and domestic abuse, had an 'unacceptable' culture that saw officers spending a lot of time trying to disprove allegations, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said. The area's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright is also facing increasing pressure to quit over the child abuse scandal in Rotherham. Mr Wright was the Labour council cabinet member responsible for children's services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010, during a 16-year period when 1,400 youngsters suffered wide-scale sexual exploitation including gang rapes, grooming and trafficking. He has apologised to victims, insisting he had no knowledge of the scale of the problem when he was a councillor in the South Yorkshire town, but has refused to quit his GBP85,000-a-year elected post as PCC. This is despite calls by the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary for him to resign, his deputy having quit, and being forced to leave the Labour Party. Sir Cliff was questioned under caution last month by South Yorkshire Police but not arrested or charged. He said the allegation of an assault at a religious event in Sheffield in 1985 is ‘completely false’. A letter from his lawyers sent to MPs confirmed he was not told in advance of the search and found out about it only from a concierge at the property. Details of text and email exchanges between police and the BBC before the raid are due to be published today and Mr Crompton will answer questions again next week.","South Yorkshire Police chief said BBC put his force in 'a difficult position'

"Police are routinely telling victims of crime to become ‘DIY detectives’ and investigate offences themselves. Officers are washing their hands of thousands of crimes unless the public can provide them with clues. Victims are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property. On the beat: A report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary has said police are increasingly staying at their desks and asking victims of crime to investigate offences themselves - even by looking for fingerprints or CCTV . If no leads are found police will not even leave their desks to investigate, and cases are closed within hours. The approach to crimes such as car thefts, vandalism and shed burglaries was revealed in a damning report by the police performance watchdog. Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said officers had ‘nearly decriminalised’ many low-level offences. ‘Unless you’ve got the powers of Mystic Meg, or something like that, [without] turning up and using your skills it’s going to be mightily difficult to bring people to justice,’ he said. ‘Effectively what’s happened is a number of crimes are on the verge of being decriminalised. It’s not the fault of the individual staff, it’s a mindset thing that’s crept in to policing to say “we’ve almost given up”.’ His report also found that forces are losing track of thousands of suspects, and often do not know who has failed to answer bail. Worrying: Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said lives are being put at risk . Some 17 forces were caught deploying community support officers (PCSOs) to investigate serious offences, including assaults, even though they have little training and no powers of arrest. Officers were also accused of inappropriately arranging interviews at their convenience, instead of seeing crime victims immediately. Senior staff were criticised for having little idea of what their employees actually do all day. But officials saved their most scathing comments for the ‘emerging trend’ of asking victims to solve their own crimes, and so-called ‘desk-based investigations’. They highlighted how victims are being told to make their own enquiries, from hunting for fingerprints to checking second-hand sales websites. Mr Baker said: ‘HMIC finds this expectation that the victim should investigate his own crime both surprising and a matter of material concern. 'The police have been given powers and resources to investigate crime by the public, and there should be no expectation on the part of the police that an inversion of that responsibility is acceptable.’ Officials said that if ‘properly carried out’, investigations by an officer at his or her desk can be a ‘cost-effective’ way of dealing with a report of a crime. However, in the vast majority of cases the practice is merely an administrative procedure that sees a crime recorded, then filed away and forgotten. ‘All too often, “desk-based investigation” appears to mean little or nothing more than recording a crime without taking further action,’ Mr Baker warned. His report found attendance rates at crime scenes varied widely between forces, from 39 per cent in Warwickshire to 100 per cent in Cleveland. Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said many senior officers lack the basic information they need to direct their staff effectively. He said lives are being put at risk because forces are not deploying their assets to the ‘highest level of efficiency and effectiveness’. Last week it emerged that millions of card fraud cases were left out of figures used by the Government when claiming crime has fallen. Researchers found nearly 4million offences were ignored in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. When added to that data, they show crime has risen by 50 per cent, from a record low of 7.3million offences a year to 11million – with seven people defrauded every minute.","'Concerning' findings revealed in report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary .

"A former tabloid reporter walked free from court yesterday after he was cleared of illegally accessing celebrity text messages. Ben Ashford, 35, was accused of trawling through racy exchanges between a married BBC star and a high profile PR agent. Prosecutors claimed he knew an iPhone which contained the messages was stolen and he did not have permission to view the material. The jury at the Old Bailey took less than five hours to clear former Sun reporter Ben Ashford, 35, of illegally accessing text messages during hacking trial . But a jury took fewer than five hours to throw out the case against him and bring to an end his two year ordeal. The verdict is a blow for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Metropolitan Police which were accused of acting with ‘messianic zeal’. Prosecutors face questions over why it was necessary to use one of the country’ s most senior QCs to prosecute two relatively minor offences. Previous cases led by Peter Wright QC include the prosecution of serial killer Harold Shipman, corrupt cop Ali Dizaei and the airline liquid bomb plotters. Police must also explain why it was necessary to subject Mr Ashford to a criminal inquiry two years after the phone theft in 2009. The woman who stole the phone, who was only identified thanks to information provided by The Sun newspaper, was simply handed a caution. The five-day case also left taxpayers with a hefty bill, it costs an estimated £30,000 a day to put on cases at the Old Bailey, the UK’s top criminal court. The acquittal follows the not guilty verdicts in the cases of former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks after a seven month trial. Mr Ashford looked relieved as the jury pronounced its ‘not guilty’ verdicts on the two charges in the five-day trial yesterday. He was the first journalist charged under Operation Tuleta, the investigation into alleged criminal breaches of privacy and computer hacking. The jury had heard how Ashford had been handed the phone when he was working for The Sun in October 2009 in Manchester. He was told to investigate claims that the celebrity had been cheating on his long-term partner and spent hours trawling its contents. He wrote a lengthy memo and returned the iPhone the next day when he realised it was stolen after its owner, a PR agent, posted a message online about the theft. Mr Ashford was interviewed as a witness, not a suspect, the next month. Three years later he was arrested after News International handed a dossier of emails to police. The information included the 18-page memo written by Mr Ashford detailing his findings on the phone. No story was ever published. In court, Mr Ashford said the device had no security code and he suspected the situation was a ruse to leak the story without it being traced back to the woman. His barrister, Orlando Pownall (LEGAL_INSERT)QC(LEGAL_INSERT), said his client was a victim of an over-zealous prosecution that pursued an inappropriate case against him with ‘messianic zeal’. The jury cleared Mr Ashford of possession of criminal property and an offence under the Computer Misuse Act. Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Ashford said: ‘I’m immensely relieved that the jury have reached a just verdict. ‘I’d like thank my family, friends, and my legal team for their unwavering support, and my thoughts remain with my friends and former colleagues who face a similar ordeal.’ His father Frazer added: ‘I’m just so relieved that justice has been done.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ben Ashford, 35, accused of accessing text messages of married BBC star .

Its coverage included a pre-recorded interview with a uniformed senior officer standing outside the Sheffield headquarters of South Yorkshire Police. The avalanche of publicity sent shockwaves around the world and clearly surprised Sir Cliff, who is currently staying in Portugal. In an indignant statement released several hours later, in which he vehemently protested his innocence, he also revealed his anger over the wall-to-wall live coverage. He said: ‘ ... the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.’ Waiting: A BBC cameraman outside Sir Cliff's home. A phalanx of journalists from the national broadcaster were waiting for officers as they arrived at the property in Sunningdale, Berkshire . The BBC was well prepared for the arrival of eight officers at Sir Cliff’s penthouse flat yesterday morning. The team of plain-clothes detectives were filmed walking into the complex and even donning blue latex gloves as they searched a desk in his home. A helicopter chartered by the BBC hovered above the scene for several hours, filming officers as they carried materials outside. The news was broadcast simultaneously across the BBC network and tweeted by a handful of journalists and producers near Sir Cliff’s home. Before the bombshell exploded, one regional radio presenter commented: ‘Watch the news at 1pm please. Or listen to the radio. Any channel.’ Unaware: Richard, who is believed to be at his home in Portugal, said he was unaware the police raid at his Berkshire property would be taking place . One reason the access is so controversial is the furious reaction in some quarters to the presence of a tabloid photographer at the arrest of Harry Redknapp. The Sun was pilloried by the liberal media after it caught the football manager being driven from his home in 2007 over corruption allegations. Redknapp was acquitted and later sued City of London police and spoke of his ‘bitter disappointment’ at the way the raid and his arrest were handled. A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman strongly denied that the force officially passed any information about the search to the broadcaster. She said: ‘The BBC had their own source and the information categorically did not come from South Yorkshire Police. ‘The BBC were the first to request an interview with a senior officer and all subsequent media requests were accommodated.’ A BBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the source of their story. The Rev Richard Coles, a regular on BBC Radio 4, criticised the broadcaster’s coverage. He said: ‘What an amazing coincidence that the news media had cameras outside Sir Cliff Richard’s house and in a helicopter when the cops arrived.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","BBC journalists outside singer's home as officers arrived .

"An Islamic terrorist has stopped Britain deporting him – by refusing to give his name for 21 years. A judge ruled that the Algerian is a ‘trusted and senior’ member of a violent terrorist group and has helped suspects abroad. But his lawyers have used human rights laws to prevent the Government from throwing him out of this country. Officials cannot draw up crucial paperwork guaranteeing his safety without knowing his true identity. Scroll down for video . 'Running rings round deportation laws': The Algerian has relied on human rights laws to stay in the UK. Pictured is the European Court of Human Right . Meanwhile, taxpayers have been left to pick up the multi-million pound bill for his legal aid and months of NHS hospital care. Astonishingly, the terrorist, known only as B, is free to walk the streets because his bail conditions were ‘relaxed’ to allow him to go swimming and worship at a mosque. The legal stand-off provoked a furious response from a senior Tory who branded human rights laws ‘a farce.’ Dominic Raab, MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘It is a damning indictment of the human rights farce in this country that this man has been able to run rings around the deportation system. 'Damning': Conservative MP Dominic Raab . ‘If a dangerous criminal or suspected terrorist can frustrate deportation, by spewing out human rights objections while refusing to give his name so the claims can be checked, it turns the system on its head. ‘Even the human rights lawyers should be embarrassed, it’s so ridiculous.’ The saga emerged in a recent court ruling when B tried to halt deportation proceedings. But judges struck out his appeal. His lawyers had said the failure to resolve the stand-off was a breach of his human right to an ‘effective remedy’ by the State to his legal limbo. But the judges criticised the failure of the mystery man to identify himself as a ‘deliberate distortion of the evidence’. They said his ‘manipulation of information, his contempt and abuse of process’ must not succeed because it would encourage others to ‘behave in a similar way’. The terrorist arrived illegally in Britain in 1993. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission found he bought a satellite phone and airtime for extremists in Algeria and Chechnya in 2000. The terrorist originally gave his name as Nolidoni, later claiming to be Pierre Dumond. Both identities were false. He then refused to identify himself, as his lawyers cited two sections of the European Convention on Human Rights. They said revealing who he is would put his family in Algeria in danger, a breach of article eight, and he could be at risk of torture, a breach of article three. In response, the Government spent huge sums trying to independently establish his identity with a global investigation. His fingerprints and DNA were taken but the Algerian authorities, as well as international counter-terrorism agencies, were unable to find a match. An Algerian language expert was employed to study his speech to pinpoint where he was from. Officials were even sent to Canada to speak to a fellow Algerian whose identity he stole after obtaining his passport. But no progress has been made. One source close to the case said: ‘He has admitted the name he was using is not his real name and the Algerians confirmed this. ‘Because of this the Government cannot obtain the individual assurances needed to secure his removal. It is not possible to deport him without these assurances because of our international human rights obligations.’ The terrorist is now on bail, with a nine-hour curfew and is banned from leaving a defined area without giving prior notice. He is also banned from meeting a list of named associates, using his mobile phone or accessing the internet. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We continue to pursue every avenue to ensure this dangerous man is removed from the UK.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Judge ruled Algerian man is 'trusted and senior' member of violent group .

"Police were at the centre of a furious row last night amid claims they acted unlawfully by demanding the arrest of the parents of dying Ashya King. Officers are accused of over-reaching their powers by issuing a European Arrest Warrant for the five-year-old’s parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45. Senior lawyers said there was little evidence the pair had committed any offence or that police undertook a satisfactory criminal inquiry. Scroll down for video . Devoted: The Kings with Ashya at Southampton hospital before they took him to Spain . Officers are accused of over-reaching their powers by issuing a European Arrest Warrant for the five-year-old's parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45 . One said the actions of the Hampshire force, apparently under the direction of hospital doctors, throws into question the role of police in modern society. Barrister John Cooper said police risk appearing as the ‘enforcement arm of medical opinion’. ‘The police are there to protect citizens and the easy transition to uncritical enforcers of other powerful interest groups is troubling,’ he said. ‘We should remind ourselves that this was a case of two adults who had parental control, who lawfully took their child from a hospital, and by all accounts cared for his welfare in an attempt to give him a chance at life.’ The Kings are now being held in a Spanish jail five hours’ drive from their son who is alone and under guard in hospital. By obtaining a European Arrest Warrant, investigators accused them of ‘child cruelty’. Now the Kings find themselves trapped in a legal nightmare, following their arrest on Saturday night at a hotel in Malaga. Counter-argument: Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, laywer for British couple Brett and Naghemeh King speaks to the press outside National Court in Madrid and said the couple were victims of false detention and libel . Lawyers said the arrest warrant appears to have been used as a ‘tool’ to find the family, rather than as a method to catch suspected criminals. They said warrants are normally granted only when officers are ready to lay charges, whereas any inquiry in Southampton had barely got under way. Edward Grange, who specialises in extradition cases at London law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said he was deeply concerned at the Kings’ treatment. He said: ‘My concern is that they are seeking to use this warrant while their investigations are ongoing and that is most unusual. We have not been told if the couple involved have committed any crime. They cannot be charged with abducting their own child. There was no protection order in place regarding the boy so they have not absconded with the child against the orders of a court.’ In a further twist, lawyers said Ashya could have dual nationality because he was born in Spain. As a result, the authorities may regard him as Spanish and refuse to allow him to be returned to Britain against the wishes of his parents. Yesterday Portsmouth City Council revealed that Ashya was made a temporary ward of court on Friday. This will be reviewed at the High Court tomorrow. It is not clear whether this will involve the controversial Court of Protection. Last night, Hampshire Police refused to discuss its actions and said the matter was now in the hands of the Spanish police. At the weekend Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead said the force would not apologise for the way it conducted the search for the Kings. He said it was acting on ‘explicit medical advice’ that Ashya’s life was in danger and said the warrant was based around ‘neglect’. It is understood that once Ashya had left Britain, senior officers felt they had no choice but to apply for the arrest warrant to secure the co-operation of other forces. The Crown Prosecution Service said the warrant was issued on the grounds of ‘child cruelty’ and the case remained ‘under immediate review’. The National Crime Agency, which clears European Arrest Warrants, said it looks only at the ‘legal validity’ of the paperwork. In effect this means officials simply check that the 11-page document is correctly filled in. Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Hayes defended the county’s force against accusations of being ‘heavy handed’. He said: ‘I think if Hampshire Constabulary had ignored the professional medical advice and opinion then they would have been negligent in their responsibilities to safeguard Ashya.’","Brett and Nagmeh King took Ashya from Southampton General Hospital .

"Conman: Dr Yilkyes Bala was a conman who led the high life and was chauffeur-driven in a black Bentley . Posing as a member of the Nigerian Royal family, he mingled with diplomats, captains of industry and senior police officers. Dr Yilkyes Bala was chauffeur-driven in a black Bentley and hosted sumptuous dinners at the Dorchester to mix with society’s elite. But the supposedly flourishing businessman was in fact a criminal mastermind responsible for an ambitious immigration racket. Investigators . believe he helped more than 100 of his countrymen, including most of . his extended family, to enter the UK illegally under false and stolen . identities. At . the centre of the scam was a corrupt Home Office worker who sold him . genuine, but improperly issued, refugee passports for £1,500 each. Bala then used his network of security companies to give the illegal immigrants references and jobs. They . could then ‘hit the jackpot’ and obtain a National Insurance number, . giving them full citizen’s rights and access to State benefits. But the racket, which continued for up to 16 years, unravelled when the Home Office employee was caught out. This week . Bala, 55, was starting a seven year jail sentence from August 1st, after . a jury convicted him of conspiring to breach immigration laws. A . judge at Canterbury Crown Court said the charming fraudster was 'at the . hub' of a 'significant conspiracy' to beat UK border security. The . conviction is an embarrassment for those who mixed with Bala, including . the Nigerian Ambassador and senior officers at City of London Police. The charming conman referred to himself as ‘His Royal Highness Prince Yilkyes Bala Finok Tonglele PhD State Crown Prince’. He even carried an identity card claiming to be ‘prince of princes’ in the Nigerian Plateau State Council of Chiefs. Investigators . found he did not inherit the honour, but he claimed it was bestowed on . him later in life, and they have been unable to disprove this. Yilkyes Bala at an industry convention: The supposedly flourishing businessman had several companies which included Golden Shield and Mayfair and Knightsbridge Guarding . Deception: Yilkyes Bala poses outside the City of London Police Wood Street station, however, this week he started a seven year jail sentence . Bala travelled to Britain in the early 1980s before studying administration at Greenwich School of Management as part of a philosophy doctorate. He already . claimed to have a degree from the now-defunct Clayton University, in . Missouri, U.S., long suspected as a ‘buy-a-degree’ college. He . went on to set up a network of companies and claimed that at one stage . they employed 900 people across Europe, Asia and Africa. The . core business was supplying security guards to the construction . industry, including one firm based in Knightsbridge, Central London. His . companies, which included Golden Shield and Mayfair and Knightsbridge . Guarding, also provided alarm monitoring, VIP bodyguards and uniformed . guards for offices. Within two decades Bala, a father of six, was living in a £1.3million home in leafy Beckenham, South East London. He joined the Croydon branch of the Masons and sent his daughters to fee-paying Blackheath High School. But a huge investigation, which Bala claimed cost up to £10 million, unravelled his empire and exposed him as a ruthless conman. Accomplices: Bala's second wife Giwo Tonglele, 46, . left, was jailed for five years and Casmir Ekwuhga, 42, right, was jailed for four years for taking part in the conspiracy . Officials discovered a corrupt Home Office employee based in Croydon had improperly obtained more than 200 refugee passports. In genuine cases they are used as travel documents for those claiming asylum in Britain, often fleeing religious or political persecution. But the official was illicitly applying for them in the name of non-existent relatives of genuine refugees. At least 91 documents were posted to addresses linked to Bala, who ran the Armour Group chain of companies with offices across the capital. They were then used as the foundation for applications to remain in the UK as he and his accomplices ran rings around immigration officials. Those linked to Bala used every trick in the book to beat border controls, from urgent medical visas to travelling as domestic servants. Some were so shameless that they changed their names by deed poll back to their original identities within weeks of adopting the persona of a non-existent refugee. Among those given false identities so they could remain in Britain were Bala’s second wife and his brother. After his arrest, Bala boasted to officials that he was allowed up to seven wives, ‘and a few more on the side’. Investigators found his home stuffed with paperwork linked to his businesses, with documents in his garage filling two vans alone. Because of the complex web of his businesses it took the Home Office two years to prepare the case against him. The illegal immigrants caused chaos in Government systems once they had obtained their new identities. One man was uncovered by his fingerprints when he was caught drink driving on two occasions, first under his real name and then in a false one. In some cases, illegal immigrants had already failed to gain citizenship under one name so simply adopted a new identity to try again. Official company minutes for Bala’s security companies recorded the same people attending meetings under different names. Bala's second wife Giwo Tonglele, 46, was also convicted of conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry of persons into the UK and was jailed for five years. Their former employee Casmir Ekwuhga, 42, was jailed for four years for taking part in the conspiracy, holding a refugee passport illegally and using it to obtain a driving licence fraudulently.Jailing them, Judge Heather Norton said the scam was well organised. She said: 'These documents were created to order. Each one of you was involved in deceiving the immigration authorities. You were at the hub of the whole enterprise. 'The motive was simple.It was to provide identities for employees, relatives and friends. It was a significant conspiracy.' More than 100 illegal immigrants linked to the scam have been arrested, but only a small number are believed to have been convicted and deported. David Fairclough, of the Home Office, said Bala was brought to justice after a 'long, complex and painstaking investigation' and said the case should serve as a warning to others.","Dr Yilkyes Bala lived the high life and was chauffeur-driven in a Bentley .

"A leading consultant is to appear in court accused of using hidden equipment to spy on patients at a private hospital. Hearing specialist Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh is alleged to have secretly recorded intimate images of female patients, colleagues and visitors. The 61-year-old world-renowned expert was arrested at St Anthony’s Hospital in North Cheam, Surrey, after one potential victim raised the alarm. Potential victim raised alarm: Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh was arrested at St Anthony's Hospital in North Cheam, Surrey . Detectives were shocked to discover evidence that Yeoh may have used sophisticated equipment to amass a potentially huge collection of material. They are now trying to identify more than 70 women and have appealed for anyone who suspects they may have been covertly filmed to come forward. Yeoh, a father of three, is also accused of making indecent images of children and possessing extreme pornography. Last night the hospital said the doctor has been suspended from his duties as the Scotland Yard investigation continued. The arrest has shocked staff and patients at the historic hospital, which was recently bought by a private healthcare group. It was previously owned by Roman Catholic nuns, the Daughters of the Cross of Liege, who founded it in 1904. New Scotland Yard: The Metropolitan Police confirmed that Yeoh was arrested in April and that since then a number of further alleged victims had been identified . The investigation into Yeoh began in . April. Police were so concerned they arrested him at his workplace and . seized computer equipment. Yeoh was originally charged with one count of voyeurism but 29 further counts were brought against him as the inquiry widened. It is understood that some images are alleged to have been recorded in a toilet at the hospital, with others taken at unidentified locations. Yeoh, who is also known by the first name Robin, lives with his wife Ivy, 57, at a £750,000 home in Banstead, Surrey. His two daughters attended Cambridge University. He is a renowned expert in tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness, and has spent more than 20 years treating both children and adults.

"Stephen Lawrence: Secret Metropolitan Police unit the Special Demonstration Squad compiled information on the murdered teenager's family . A rogue undercover police unit ‘hoovered up’ a staggering amount of personal details during 40 years of secretive missions, a damning report revealed yesterday. Members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) compiled information about at least 18 justice campaigns, many made up of relatives fighting for the truth after the deaths of victims from ethnic minorities. But much of the intelligence they gathered was no more than worthless ‘community gossip’. Some Scotland Yard commissioners and their most senior colleagues were ‘possibly negligent’ in their lack of knowledge of the unit’s existence, the report’s author claimed. Yesterday, the chief constable leading the unprecedented inquiry into undercover policing said some top officers would face misconduct proceedings if they were still serving. The undercover officers themselves could face prosecution over illicit sexual affairs they had with targets and their appearances in court under false identities. Mick Creedon, who is conducting the inquiry, known as Operation Herne, criticised senior Metropolitan Police officers as being complacent and ‘possibly negligent’ in their failure to oversee the activities of the SDS. He said: ‘We have spoken to officers who held the rank of commissioner and deputy commissioner along with other very senior officers involved in covert policing and public order and the vast majority of them knew nothing of the existence of SDS. ‘This is astonishing given the suggested pivotal role the SDS played in reporting on violence and extremism and preventing disorder and the question has to be asked about the lack of executive scrutiny, of intrusive senior management and of effective supervision.’ The latest revelations about the controversial unit sparked fresh outrage about the activities of undercover officers. Investigators discovered officers gathered information about the families of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence; Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police after being mistaken for a suicide bomber; and mother-of-eight Cherry Groce, whose shooting sparked the Brixton riots in 1985. Some of those targeted said they will consider suing the Met again and one mother said she felt ‘stripped of my dignity’. Mr Creedon said his staff spoke to three former commissioners and an unknown number of their deputies and assistants. He declined to name them, but Lord Blair was in charge when Mr de Menezes was shot dead by police at Stockwell Tube station in 2005. Lord Condon and Lord Stevens occupied the commissioner’s office when the unit was reporting back on private matters involving the Lawrence family. The report found SDS officers improperly gathered and stored information on at least 18 justice campaigns between 1970 and 2005. But Mr Creedon said no documentary evidence or witnesses have been found to substantiate claims that the SDS deliberately targeted grieving families. Investigators found officers gathered information about the families of Cherry Groce, left, whose shooting sparked the Brixton riots, and Jean Charles de Menezes, right, who was killed by police on the Tube in 2004 . Operation Herne was sparked by incendiary claims last year from Peter Francis, a former undercover officer, in the Guardian that a spy was ordered to smear the Lawrence family. But Mr Francis repeatedly refused to be interviewed by Herne investigators, and Mr Creedon said: ‘There is no witness or documentary evidence that supports those allegations.’ He said SDS officers were never directly tasked to infiltrate or inform on families, but were targeting violent factions who wanted to hijack their justice campaigns. Mr Creedon said worthless information of no value to criminal probes was stored, for example details of someone attending a funeral. The Derbyshire chief said such information should have been destroyed, in line with modern laws governing secretive police operations and people’s right to privacy. The undercover police saga is far from over, as prosecutors examine whether officers perverted the course of justice by using false identities in court. There may also be criminal charges arising from sexual relationships between officers and activists. Mr Creedon said his team has another 12 months of work as they scour archives of secret material. Met Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: ‘I regret enormously the distress that has been caused to families.’","Former senior officers deny knowledge of the Special Demonstration Squad .

"A murderer who walked out of an open prison more than 17 years ago remains on the run, police admitted last night. Raymond Lenihan, 57, is one of 24 prisoners who are still missing after absconding from Sudbury Prison. But information about the killer, who was jailed for life in 1977 at Leicester Crown Court for murder, has only just been released. A murderer was allowed to walk out of Sudbury prison (pictured) before going on the run for 17 years . His disappearance in 1997 came to light during an urgent police internal inquiry into a series of prisoners who ‘slipped through the net’. It was ordered by Derbyshire Police Chief Constable Mick Creedon after the Daily Mail revealed one killer spent nine years on the run. Hell’s Angel David Richards, 53, was even able to claim benefits, obtain a passport and even go overseas on holiday thanks to blundering police. He was only re-arrested after this newspaper exposed how he had fallen through cracks in the system after simply walking out of his jail. Convicted murderer David Richards (pictured) was able to claim benefits, obtain a passport and even go overseas on holiday thanks to blundering police . The ensuing row forced Derbyshire Police to review its failings and it found 24 other offenders remain on the run from the same prison. They include an array of dangerous criminals including violent attackers, drug traffickers, robbers, gunmen and fraudsters. Details of those who escaped between 1992 and 2006 – 12 offenders, including Lenihan – had never been made public before. The oldest among these is Delroy Howe, 45, who failed to return to prison from temporary leave on December 29, 1992. He was serving a sentence for drug offences. Other wanted criminals include Michael Ashworth, 54, who disappeared in 1995 after being jailed for drugs offences, and violent criminal Leslie Warden, 58, who vanished in 1998. The recent discovery of the number of missing and potentially dangerous prisoners has been a serious embarrassment for police. Some chiefs fear that many more may be found if forces with open prisons in their areas examine their historical records. Privately, they blame a misunderstanding over who should take the lead in tracking down wanted inmates and inaction by the prison authorities. It is the force where the prison is located which is responsible for co-ordinating the manhunt, no matter where the prisoner is from or where his crime took place. It is the force where the prison is located which is responsible for co-ordinating the manhunt, no matter where the prisoner is from or where his crime took place . Yesterday, Richards was starting a further two-and-a-half year sentence after being told he may never be released. Judge Philip Parker branded his escape ‘serious’ and said it created ‘harm and fear’ among the public. Speaking at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Friday, he said it would be for the Parole Board to decide if it would ever be safe to release him. He said: ‘The sentence I have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you’ Richards was jailed for life in 1984 for hacking a teenage love rival to death and using his blood to write ‘Hell’s Angels’ on the wall. But in 2005, as he approached the end of his sentence, he walked out of Sudbury Prison, in Derbyshire, because he was fed up with waiting to be released. Local police refused to accept responsibility for finding him and simply logged the fact he had absconded on a national database. As a result, Richards was able to start a new life, renting a flat near his frail parents, claim thousands in disability benefits and undertake odd jobs for elderly neighbours. Shockingly, he even went to Ireland on holiday where he robbed a post office and was jailed for three months, without anyone realising he was on the run. He was re-arrested in June in Wolverhampton by a team of Met detectives who travelled to the West Midlands after being tipped off by this newspaper. The court heard that the authorities are still investigating how Richards, who is now held in a secure prison, was able to claim benefits and obtain a passport. His lawyer Simon Hanns said: ‘The dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today.” Derbyshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Martyn Bates said the force is now doing ‘everything possible’ to trace the remaining missing men. He said: ‘The men did not previously live in Derbyshire and they committed offences elsewhere. They could now be anywhere, living under different names, which is why we’re making this public appeal.’","Raymond Lenihan is one of 24 prisoners still missing after absconding from Sudbury Prison in Derbyshire .

"Ambushed: PC Nicola Hughes, who was killed aged just 23 in the line of duty when she was gunned down by fugitive killer Dale Cregan in Manchester . Two former Scotland Yard chiefs enraged frontline officers yesterday by opposing full life terms for police killers. Moves to make such murderers die behind bars are a PR exercise and the ‘contemporary version of hanging’, according to Lord Condon and Lord Blair. But Ian Hanson, whose police colleagues Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone were shot dead in 2012, said the peers should hang their heads in shame. ‘They sit in the splendour of the . House of Lords and do so only by virtue of having had the honour of . wearing the same uniform as those who have given their lives protecting . our communities,’ he said. ‘Yet now they forget their roots and speak in defence of the rights of police murderers.’ The . Greater Manchester Police Federation chairman added: ‘The men and women . of our police service put their lives on the line every day to protect . us all and need our protection. 'An attack upon a police officer is an attack upon every decent citizen.’ Ian . Pointon, who chairs the Kent Police Federation, said there was an . unwritten contract between our largely unarmed police service and the . public. He added: ‘Society . relies on police officers to get out there and protect them and they do . that unarmed, but in return if somebody does kill a police officer they . should die in prison.’ Home . Secretary Theresa May revealed the proposed change in the law at the . Police Federation annual conference last year. It was a popular move . with rank-and-file officers. Before the abolition of the death penalty, . the murder of an officer was a ‘capital homicide’ with an automatic . death penalty. Mrs May said: ‘We are clear – life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.’ The current minimum sentence is 30 years and in some cases police killers have been told they will die behind bars. Dale Cregan, the 31-year-old killer of Constables Hughes and Bone, was jailed for a whole life term in June 2013. But . American David Bieber, 48, who murdered PC Ian Broadhurst in Leeds in . 2003 by shooting him at point-blank range, had his whole life term . overturned on appeal. The . Court of Appeal later ruled he could apply for parole after 37 years, a . decision which led one police leader to accuse the judiciary of having . ‘blood on its hands’. Lord Blair, left, branded the move to make police killers serve whole-life sentences 'unnecessary and populist'. Lord Condon, right, said the change 'feels like a piece of symbolic, public relations legislation' Life tariffs are due to be enshrined in law in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill which is currently passing through the House of Lords. But, during debates, Lords Blair and Condon have both spoken out in strong terms to oppose the clause which introduces whole life tariffs. They were backed by Lord Paddick, who also served as a senior Met officer, and Lord Dear, who led West Midlands Police for five years. Lord Blair, whose tenure as Met commissioner between 2005 and 2008 was dogged by questions about his judgment, leadership and politically correct style, branded the change ‘unnecessary and populist’. He said there was ‘no evidence of judicial complacency’ when it came to sentencing police killers. And he said a whole life term is the ‘contemporary version of hanging’, adding: ‘This measure is simply dangerous, unhelpful and totally misguided.’ Lord Condon, who led the Met for seven years until 2000, said the change ‘feels like a piece of symbolic, public relations legislation’. He fears that a criminal on the run after a police murder might choose to ‘shoot, stab or bludgeon’ other officers as he has ‘nothing more to fear’. Both men pointed out that Harry Roberts, who killed three police officers in 1966, remains in prison and his accomplices have died. Policing minister Mike Penning said: ‘We are making this change because we recognise the unique and dangerous job that police and prison officers do on a daily basis and we place the highest value upon their safety. 'We recognise that the courts already treat these cases very seriously, and it will remain for them to determine the appropriate sentence in each case based on all the facts. But the Government considers that the starting point in these cases should be a whole life order.’ The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill has been working its way through Parliament for several months. It is in the committee stage in the House of Lords, in which peers propose amendments. They will continue their work after the summer recess. Dale Cregan: Killed WPCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, while the subject of a huge manhunt after murdering a father and son. The officers died in a hail of bullets and even had a grenade thrown at them after Cregan ambushed them in Manchester in September 2012. The gangster, who has a false eye made of onyx, later handed himself in at a police station. He was convicted of all four murders, plus three attempted murders, and jailed for life. David Bieber: Shot dead PC Ian Broadhurst after officers spotted  he was driving a stolen BMW in Leeds on Boxing Day, 2003. Bieber, an American, was eventually caught in a Gateshead hotel room. He was given a life sentence in December 2004 and told he will  never be released – however, this sentence was overturned four years later. Could be released in 2041. Magdi Elgizouli: The jobless drifter stabbed WPC Nina Mackay, 25, to death with a kitchen knife as she attempted to arrest him at a flat in East London in October 1997. Elgizouli, a schizophrenic  with a pathological hatred of police, was detained indefinitely after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of  diminished responsibility.  He was released in 2012, with officials ordering that he be housed in an area with few police patrolling the streets in order to protect his mental health. Harry Roberts: The 78-year-old  is one of Britain’s longest-serving and most notorious prisoners. He shot dead two officers, and an accomplice fatally shot a third, when his van was approached by plain-clothes police in West London in 1966.  The double-killer, who was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 30 years, remains in prison today. The slayings prompted calls to reintroduce the death penalty – abolished a year  earlier – for those who kill police. In the wake of Cregan's conviction, former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit said it was time to think again of the 'deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows' Calls to reintroduce the death penalty  for police killers have been made repeatedly since the punishment was abandoned in  the Sixties. Many believe the decision to end capital punishment in 1965 came with assurances that those who murder police would die behind bars. As recently as two years ago – in the wake of one-eyed gangster Dale Cregan’s murder of two WPCs – senior Tories said criminals who target those protecting the public should face the ultimate punishment. Former party chairman Lord Tebbit said it was time to think again of the ‘deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows’. His colleague Nick de Bois said: ‘Police officers potentially put their lives on the line every day, and therefore someone who murders a police officer should face the most severest of punishments. ‘Whether that is a life sentence without the possibility of release or the death penalty is something that I believe Parliament should debate, as there is a massive public interest in this.  The fact is that these killers don’t fear the law, and they need to.’ The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has long called for the death penalty for police killers – or, at the very least, automatic whole-life tariffs. Capital punishment was banned for an initial trial period in 1965, with the last criminal hanged in 1964. The death penalty was formally abolished in Britain in 1969. There was concern at the time, however, that the punishment should be retained for certain forms of murder – including the killing of a police officer.","Lord Blair brands the mandatory sentences 'unnecessary and populist'

Sources told the gossip site that Hernandez's alleged victim had been harassing the former football player, and the two men had been feuding all day prior to the attack. Hernandez faces murder charges in connection to the 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Llyod. He was arrested June 26, 2013, and kept in solitary confinement due to the high profile of the case. Most recently, a Massachusetts judge imposed a formal gag order to protect the ex-New England Patriot's right to a fair trial. Gaol: The alleged inmate brawl took place in a hallway inside the Bristol County House of Corrections . Earlier this month, Hernandez's attorneys had accused the state of allowing leaks and prejudicial out-of-court statements. They claimed the prosecution orchestrated a ‘publicity stunt’ last year when Miami Dolphin Michael Pouncey was served with a subpoena after a game at Gillette Stadium. Prosecutors denied that and say they have leaked nothing. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd.

"Changes: As the DVLA winds down its printing of tax discs before they are abolished in October, it is no longer printing them on pre-perforated paper . Motorists are being told to cut out their own tax discs as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is about to run out of the perforated paper they are usually printed on. The paper discs will be abolished completely from October 1, but as the DVLA winds down its printing process it will no longer make them on the pre-perforated paper which allows the disc to be easily torn out. Instead the discs will be printed onto normal paper, and sent to drivers who must cut them out themselves before placing them in their windscreens. 'DVLA is running down its pre-existing stock to ensure there is no wastage. To give value for money to the tax payer we have not replenished our stock for this short period but decided to print these discs in-house until October 1,' the DVLA told affected businesses, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'We have told the police and other enforcement authorities that we have issued these discs however the paper disc is no longer relied upon to check if a vehicle is taxed or not.' Drivers must continue to display tax discs in their vehicles until the law changes in just over a month's time, and the change in paper only applies to those discs issued by the DVLA, as the Post Office will continue to use its existing stock. A DVLA spokesman told MailOnline that the agency had always planned to wind down its stocks of pre-perforated paper prior to the change. 'Tax discs can be expensive to produce and we have always planned to run down stocks in the run up to 1 October,' she said. 'To make sure we deliver the best possible savings to the taxpayer we have not procured more stock for these last few weeks, and will instead print the remaining discs in house.” 'This applies to discs issued by DVLA only – the Post Office will continue to use their existing stock.' A recent survey has shown that half of drivers are unaware that the paper discs are to be replaced by electronic records. New approach: A recent survey has shown that half of drivers are unaware that the paper discs are to be replaced by electronic records . Police cameras will check number plates to catch owners who have not paid. Nearly a third of drivers questioned said they would not even try to find out what the new rules were, according to the poll by the price comparison website money.co.uk. And 6 per cent of motorists believe that the changes are not coming into force until next year. Almost a third of those polled said they would wait for instructions from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. But the comparison website claims that the DVLA has not yet started adding warnings to tax renewal reminders. The move away from paper discs, after 93 years, is designed to offer motorists more flexible payment options and make it harder for people to drive without taxing their vehicle. Estimates show that the changes could save the taxpayer £10million a year. Car owners will still need to have paid vehicle tax to drive on the roads. But under the new system, the tax will no longer be automatically transferred with a car when it is sold. Sellers are expected to tell the DVLA straight away of the change of ownership or face £1,000 fines. Shane Teskey, of the vehicle history website hpicheck.com, said: ‘Those who fail to inform the DVLA could be fined and they will still be liable for any speeding or parking fines and vehicle tax for a car they don’t even own any more.’ Around 53 per cent of drivers said they would use the new option of paying by direct debit, according to the survey. Those choosing to spread the cost by paying twice a year or monthly will incur a 5 per cent additional charge. However this is half of the 10 per cent surcharge currently applied to six-month tax discs, used by 23 per cent of drivers. Motorists can also pay annually with no extra cost under the new system. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, said: ‘Changes to the vehicle tax system are no bad thing and we fully welcome the introduction of direct-debit payments, particularly for consumers who may be struggling to keep up with the soaring cost of driving. ‘It will also help to eliminate the problem of people who genuinely forget to renew their tax and end up being stung with a hefty fine. ‘However, I suspect the new system may experience some teething problems, so drivers really need to make sure they’re on top of their game.’ The death of the disc has been well documented, and the change was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last year’s Autumn Statement. Automatic number plate recognition cameras will spot motorists who have not paid the tax. More than 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since 1921, and if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times. Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing more than 72 tonnes.","Paper tax discs will be abolished completely on October 1 .

"The frontman of Grammy-nominated Christian band As I Lay Dying has admitted to trying to hire a hit man to kill his estranged wife. Timothy Lambesis, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of solicitation of murder in Vista Superior Court, near San Diego, today. The father-of-three was arrested in May last year after giving an undercover agent acting as a hit man, money, gate codes and an alibi to kill his estranged wife, Meggan Lambesis. The Californian allegedly said he wanted his wife dead because she was going to get up to 60 percent of his income and would not allow their three young children to join him on tour. Scroll down for video . Tried to hire a hit man: Timothy Lambesis, co-founder of Christian heavy metal band 'As I Lay Dying', has pleaded guilty to hiring someone to kill his estranged wife . Jail time: Lambesis, 32, could spend nine years behind bars as a result of his plea agreement . NBC San Diego reported Lambesis could serve nine years behind bars as a result of his plea deal when he is sentenced on May 2. He is out on $2 million bail. According to court documents, Meggan Lambesis filed for divorce in September 2012 to end the couple’s eight-year marriage. In divorce records obtained by the Associated Press, Meggan Lambesis claimed the rocker had become 'obsessed with bodybuilding' and was distracted with the children, even falling asleep once while watching them. Last year, as their relationship further soured, Lambesis allegedly told a personal trainer at his gym, Brett Kimball, that he wanted to get rid of his wife. 'He wanted to know if maybe I could find someone to do it for him,' Kimball testified at a pretrial hearing. Police began an investigation in April following a tip-off. Unhappy: Timothy Lambesis (left) allegedly asked a trainer at his gym if he knew anyone who could kill his estranged wife Meggan Lambesis (right) Father: Lambesis complained his estranged wife wouldn't let him see the three children they adopted from Ethiopia, now aged four, eight and 10 . Lambesis was recorded telling an undercover agent that he wanted his wife killed, according to prosecutors. The . undercover agent, San Diego County Sheriff's Officer Howard Bradley, . testified last year that Lambesis met him at an Oceanside bookstore in . May and said he wanted his wife 'gone'. Bradley said he asked Lambesis directly if he wanted his wife killed, and the singer replied, 'Yes, I do'. The heavily-tattooed gym junkie allegedly said his wife had restricted his visits with their children aged four, eight and 10, . adopted from Ethiopia, after they separated in September 2012. The . singer also told the agent that he was angry that Meggan Lambesis would . get a large share of his income in a divorce settlement. Bradley said Lambesis told him at the end of their meeting, 'Just to clarify, just so you know, I do want her dead.' Lambesis . provided the undercover agent with an envelope containing $1,000 cash . for expenses, his wife’s address and gate codes, pictures of her and . specific dates when he would have the children and therefore, an alibi. Pleaded guilty: Lambesis is out on $3 million bail, with sentencing scheduled for May 2 . As . I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in 2000 and has released six albums, . including 2007's An Ocean Between Us, which reached No. 8 on . Billboard's charts. A single from the album, Nothing Left, was . nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance. The . band plays in an aggressive style that features lightning-speed metal . guitar riffs. The group's philosophical lyrics have attracted a . following of Christian rock fans. Lambesis has in the past openly declared he was Christian. He allegedly stated during an August 2010 radio interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast that his writing was inspired by his Christian faith. 'I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics,' he said.","Timothy Lambesis, 32, was recorded telling undercover cop he wanted Meggan Lambesis killed .

"Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia. The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signals the authority's intent to charge players. Scroll down for video . Cronulla Sharks player Wade Graham left his lawyer's office on Wednesday after reportedly being issued with a show-cause notice from the anti-doping authority . Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program . It's believed they varied in severity, with potential bans ranging between six months and two years. Players have been given 10 days to respond and may choose to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court. The Sharks skipper, Paul Gallen, was one of 17 past and present players involved in the club's 2011 supplements program to be reportedly offered suspensions of six months or less, instead of the usual two years for an anti-doping offence. Among some of the other players are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas, Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner. Sharks captain Paul Gallen is one of the majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal who have elected to accept the deal that will see them miss just three matches . The notices handed out to players, including Wade Graham (pictured), will only see players miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year's training before the 2015 season begins . Earlier on Wednesday Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accept reduced bans offered by ASADA, they'll automatically be labelled drug cheats. 'There is two ways to look at it,' Gallen Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast. 'Obviously there's a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it. 'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) ""thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life"". The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, including one for player John Morris (left) Players, including Nathan Gardner (pictured) were given 10 days to respond and could ahve chosen to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court . 'Because closure on this thing would just be unbelievable (after) what we've gone through the past two seasons. 'But then you say ""let's stuff this, we've done nothing wrong"". It's a real hard situation to be in.' Gallen was unsure if the players would be offered deals and whether it could be in anyway related to ASADA's progress in its investigation of AFL club Essendon which has been hit by court action. 'I've asked (my lawyer) about that and we're not 100 percent sure, because (my lawyer) believes that they're probably going to try and back us into a corner where we have to make a decision, basically ASAP before the Essendon thing is over,' he said. Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players, including Albert Kelly, have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority . The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night and lawyers for players like Anthony Tupou were issued the notices on Wednesday . 'But as I said we don't know that for sure yet. 'It's what you see in a movie. But it's actually happening and we're right in the middle of it. It's pretty tough to take.' Gallen was adamant he hadn't taken any banned substance. 'I'm 100 per cent positive I've never taken anything that's been on any banned list,' he said. It was pointed out to Gallen that, if he accepted a six-month ban, he would miss only one month of next NRL season, but he would also miss out on representing Australia in the Four Nations series later this year and potential lucrative off-season boxing bouts he hoped to have. Among some of the other players offered suspensions are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas (pictured), Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner . 'That's huge - you can't get those games for Australia back,' he said. 'But it's your reputation; it's what I've built over the last 15-plus years in training fulltime and getting to where I've got to in the game. 'It's tarnished now already, but no matter what, if we do this we're going to be labelled a drug cheat.'

"The garden entitled 'Stop The Spread' is the work of designer Jo Thompson . The taxpayer is to spend almost £100,000 designing and building a garden featuring an 'avenue of dead trees' at the Chelsea Flower Show, MailOnline can reveal. Ministers claim the extraordinary use of government money will help educate the public on the dangers of pests and diseases which threaten Britain’s flora and fauna. But critics condemned the 'frippery' of the ‘cock-eyed’ plan at a time when 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost-cutting. The embattled Department for . Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which signed off the idea, is . already under fire for cuts to flood defences and animal disease . controls, and its role in the system failure which saw horsemeat sold in . beefburgers. Now it has emerged ministers have agreed to a garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in May, entitled ‘Stop the Spread’. The . £95,000 cost for the design and build is largely coming from the . coffers of Defra, which suffered some of the deepest cuts of the . coalition austerity programme. Also chipping in are the Forestry Commission, the Welsh and Scottish governments and the Timber and Pallet Federation. It is the work of award-winning designer Jo Thompson who has been hired by the Food and Environment Research Agency to highlight the issue of plant disease 'in a way never seen before'. It comes after the government was heavily criticised for its handing of the outbreak of ash dieback disease which threatened Britain's 80million ash trees. Government agency FERA has hired award-winning designer Jo Thompson . to come up with the concept for the display . Publicity material for the bizarre stunt explains how the garden will be split into two zones: beautiful and ugly. A . sunken garden featuring 'quintessential native trees and lush . shade-loving planting' will be 'starkly contrasted with sinister and . shocking elements'. Ministers have rejected a tax on plastic bags, fearing a backlash from hard-pressed shoppers. England is set to be the only country . in the UK which allows free bags, with a charge already in place in . wales and both Northern Ireland and Scotland preapring to impose a levy. But environment minister Richard Benyon has again ruled out the idea. 'We are currently assessing various measures to reduce the distribution of single use carrier bags,' he said. 'However, we recognise the pressures on household budgets at this time; levying even a small charge may not be the best option.' These include 'an avenue of dead trees', an 'ominous' pool with an island holding a single sapling, and concrete-panelled walls. Dr David Slawson, head of plant . health public engagement at Fera, said: It’s really important that we . all work together to help protect the British countryside for future . generations to enjoy. This garden is a “call to arms” to the great . British public to help stop the spread by changing our behaviour, even . in small ways.' The message of the garden is: . 'British trees and plants are under threat from pests, diseases and . invasive species – help us stop the spread!' Organisers . hope it will persuade the public to wash their boots after walking in . the countryside, buy plants locally and dispose of garden waste . properly. But former . forestry minister Barry Gardiner, who unearthed the costs in . parliamentary questions, condemned the extraordinary use of public . money. ‘I love Chelsea Flow Show, I love all flower shows. I wish them to flourish,’ the Labour MP said. ‘But . the idea that we are sacking 60 people in forest research and spending . £95,000 on a show garden for two weeks at Chelsea trying to communicate . to people the danger of forest disease strikes me as the most cock-eyed, . inverted, upside-down, arse-over-tit, cart-before-horse proposal I have . ever heard.' More than 150,000 people attend the Chelsea Flower Show every year but the decision to use public money to design and build a garden at the event has been condemned . In the 2010 spending review Defra's budget by 30 per cent, well above the Whitehall average of 19 per cent. Mr Gardiner went on: ‘Where are . their priorities? It is absolutely typical. It is all about public . perception. It is all about putting a brave face on things. Environment minister Richard Benyon said the garden would 'deliver strong messages to the public' ‘How . any civil servant had the guile to go to a minister and say “wouldn’t . it be a really good idea that would show the public we are doing . something about pathogens to have a garden at Chelsea?” I just do not . know. And then the minister says “what a good idea”.’ Environment minister Richard Benyon . claimed the garden will ‘deliver strong messages to the public on the . scope for behaviour change to make a significant impact on the . prevention and identification of pests and pathogens that could affect . our trees, including the threat from non-native species’. The . show garden at the two-week event in central London is ‘just one . element of a campaign of public and stakeholder communication regarding . tree health and plant biosecurity’, he added. ‘All of these activities are aimed at addressing threats which have huge potential to change how our landscape looks, severely damage our biodiversity and wildlife, and can have significant impacts on the British economy.’ But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said:  'Taxpayers will be stupefied that ministers are shelling out nearly £100,000 on a show garden for a fortnight at the Chelsea Flower Show. 'Defra has got its priorities completely wrong if that is deemed to be the best use of the money as there are far cheaper ways of communicating messages about diseases in trees and plants. The Department needs to get its spending under control and cut out waste on this kind of frippery.' In a statement Mr Benyon said: Tree health is an issue of great importance and it is vital that we use international events such as this to help address the problems we are facing. 'Every leading organisation with which we need to engage will be at this event and the garden will highlight the importance of bio security and the impact tree diseases could have if we do not work together to tackle them.'","Environment department agrees to foot the bill to design and build 'Stop The Spread' show garden .

"An experimental surgery that implants an electronic device into the brain of people that are profoundly deaf to stimulate an awareness of sound has allowed a little boy in Canada to hear things for the time. And watching the moment that three-year-old Auguste Majkowski responds to music for the first time is sure to melt your heart. The Montreal toddler was born deaf but only properly diagnosed at 18-months-old. Doctors initially gave him bilateral cochlear implants, but following the surgery and six months of therapy, Auguste did not respond whatsoever, according to Fox News. Scroll down for video . Profoundy dead: Auguste Majkowski, 3, from Montreal, was given cochlear implants in both ears after he was diagnosed as at 18-months-old, but they did not work . Smart: Afer his mother Sophia Gareau (left) saw on Facebook that a child in North Carolina had received a brainstem implant to help him hear, she went about researching . Ready to go: In May, Auguste underwent brain surgery as part of a six-hour procedure to implant the ABI device . It wasn't until his mother, Sophie Gareau, stumbled across a viral video on Facebook featuring a deaf patient who had undergone a new procedure and began to hear again. The video showed North Carolina toddler Grayson Clamp hearing his father's voice for the first time. The surgery, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI), has only been performed about 1,000 times. Gareau began researching and believed her son was an ideal candidate. She tracked down the team of doctors in California who performed the operation. After a successful six-hour bran surgery in LA in May, Auguste has slowly been introduced to some sounds. But his biggest breakthrough to date was at a recent family gathering when he began - much to the marvel of his parents - to react to music. Priceless: This is the moment Auguste reacts to music, which he is able to hear for the first time . 'More, more': The three-year-old, who is learning to sign, does the symbol for 'again' when the song comes on . Dance time: Auguste jumps to his feet as the song, Ma Baker by Boney M., comes through the stereo . As the song, Ma Baker by Boney M., comes through the stereo, the look on Auguste's face is priceless. He immediately jumps up and begins to dance. 'It was an amazing moment ... I have shivers just thinking of that moment,' Mrs Gareau told Fox News. 'And we're really hoping that we'll get more with time.' Auguste's hearing will hopefully improve with time, however he will always be dead.

"The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has been urged to overrule the ""light"" punishments dished out to past and present Cronulla Sharks players, it's been reported. Despite lawyers for the players saying they received a guarantee from ASADA that WADA would not interfere in the sanctions process, News Corp Australia reports that WADA's chief executive is yet to review the evidence from the 17 doping cases. Former WADA boss John Fahey has said ASADA's ""light"" penalties made a joke of anti-doping integrity in Australia and he has strongly urged WADA chief executive David Howman to review and overrule the sanctions. Cronulla captain Paul Gallen and nine of his current and former Sharks teammates on Friday accepted backdated 12-month ASADA doping bans, which will expire on November 21. Scroll down for video . Sharks captain Paul Gallen is one of the majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal who have elected to accept the deal that will see them miss just three matches . Cronulla Sharks player Wade Graham left his lawyer's office on Wednesday after reportedly being issued with a show-cause notice from the anti-doping authority . They reluctantly agreed to doping rather than face the prospect of an even-lengthier suspension over the club's 2011 supplements program. NSW & Cronulla skipper Gallen says people can draw their own conclusions as to whether or not he was a legitimate drug cheat. 'You've just got to get on with life. I'll let people make up their own mind,' said Mr Gallen, according to Yahoo7.com.au . Reduced bans have been accepted by Gallen, his current teammates, Wade Graham, Anthony Tupou, Nathan Gardner and John Morris, Newcastle’s Jeremy Smith and Kade Snowden, Titans players Albert Kelly and Luke Doulglas, as well as North Queensland’s Matthew Wright. The ban will see the players only missing the last three games of the NRL season. Gallen will also be unable to represent Australia in the upcoming Four Nations campaign, whilst Smith will be unavailable for selection by New Zealand and Wright for Samoa. Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program . WADA's Howman has said the matter was far from resolved. 'The matter is not concluded. WADA has not received a brief of evidence and is yet to determine if the sanctions are appropriate based on that evidence and the application of the code,' he said in an email to Fahey, News Corps reported on Saturday. 'If they are not satisfied, we will ask to take the matters to the Court of Arbitration of Sport.' Fahey was angry over the backdated penalties. 'Nobody has had their record expunged ... they did not hand back their earnings from this year nor did they have their names wiped from the record books as so many convicted athletes are forced to do under the WADA code around the world,' he said. The notices handed out to players, including Wade Graham (pictured), will only see players miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year's training before the 2015 season begins . The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia. The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signaled the authority's intent to charge players. On Wednesday, Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accepted the reduced bans deal offered by ASADA, they would automatically be labelled drug cheats and be admitting to have taken  banned peptides. The admission could see notices also issued to the Shark's coaching staff for including the peptides in the team's supplement regime. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, including one for player John Morris (left) 'Obviously there are a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it,' Gallen told Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast. 'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) ""thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life"". 'Because closure on this thing would just be unbelievable (after) what we've gone through the past two seasons. Players, including Nathan Gardner (pictured) were given 10 days to respond and could ahve chosen to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court . Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players, including Albert Kelly, have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority . 'But then you say ""let's stuff this, we've done nothing wrong"". It's a real hard situation to be in.' Gallen was adamant he hadn't taken any banned substance. 'I'm 100 per cent positive I've never taken anything that's been on any banned list,' he said. Gallen expressed his fears at the possibility of being unable to represent Australia in the 2014 Four Nations series, before it was confirmed that the ban would rule out the opportunity. 'That's huge - you can't get those games for Australia back,' he said. 'But it's your reputation; it's what I've built over the last 15-plus years in training fulltime and getting to where I've got to in the game. 'It's tarnished now already, but no matter what, if we do this we're going to be labelled a drug cheat.' Players were given the opportunity to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night and lawyers for players like Anthony Tupou were issued the notices on Wednesday . Among some of the other players offered suspensions are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas (pictured), Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner .","The majority of the 17 Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal have agreed to a 12-month suspension .

"While rents in New York have long been at an all-time-high, those in San Francisco are even higher. According to a new report from online real estate marketplace Zumper, rents in the City by the Bay is officially the most expensive place to rent a one-bedroom apartment - even higher than the Big Apple. The firm looked at 500,000 active listings in cities across the country and calculated the median price for various types of apartments throughout August 2014. Zumper compared monthly median rents across major US cities and their constituent neighborhoods . The rent in San Francisco is high, and it keeps getting higher. The city is officially the most expensive place to rent a one-bedroom apartment, passing notoriously pricey New York City for the first time . The very low vacancy rate in San Francisco, alongside the tech boom and the slow pace of new construction coming to market, have all led to the spike in prices in the City by the Bay . The report found that San Francisco has the most expensive one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, with a median rent of $3,100 and $4,050, respectively. New York came in second, with median rents of $2,995 for a one-bedroom and $3,495 for a two-bedroom. San Francisco is the 14th-largest city in the country, with roughly 825,000 residents. 'For the first time we're seeing San Francisco rents trump New York,' said Anthemos Georgiades, San Francisco-based Zumper's CEO and co-founder. 'The very low vacancy rate in San Francisco, alongside the tech boom and the slow pace of new construction coming to market, have all led to this spike. New York's most exclusive neighborhoods, however, still rank as the most expensive in the U.S. That hasn't yet changed but we're watching it.' The chart above shows the median price of an apartment for 25 cities in the U.S compiled by  Zumper . In New York, the priciest neighborhoods are Tribeca in lower Manhattan (pictured) and Dumbo in Brooklyn . San Francisco's priciest area is Russian Hill (pictured) with a median of $4,000 for a one bedroom . In New York, the priciest neighborhoods are Tribeca in lower Manhattan and Dumbo on Brooklyn's waterfront. On the West coast San Francisco's priciest area is Russian Hill with a median of $4,000 for a one bedroom, followed by South Beach with $3,800. However, when it comes to the cost-of-living, New York still holds the crown. Monthly public transit passes in San Francisco are a mere $74 whereas a 30-day MetroCards currently runs at $104 in New York.","San Francisco has the most expensive one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments .

"Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, has been charged with killing his wife and the woman's sister . Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted. Prosecutors have not offered any motive for the slayings. Steele's attorney, Jessa Nicholson, said during a court hearing Friday that she plans to investigate Steele's mental stability. She appeared with Steele via video conference from the Rock County jail, where Steele is being held because of his close relationship with Dane County jailers. He sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit and looked directly at the camera as Nicholson spoke. Suspect: Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andy Steele, accused of killing his wife and sister-in-law, makes an initial appearance via teleconference in Dane County Court in Madison, Wisconsin, Friday . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . 'He wants to work within (the criminal justice) system to see this to its conclusion,' she said. According to a criminal complaint filed Friday, Tollefsbol, 38, called police August 22 from the Steele home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. She said Steele had shot her and she was dying. Police arrived and found Tollefsbol in the basement, shot in the back and covered with blood, the complaint said. She again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died at a hospital about an hour after making her call for help. A Dane County sheriff's SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, dead in the master bedroom. She had been shot in the head and had a zip-tie wrapped around her throat, cutting off circulation, the complaint said. The SWAT team found Andrew Steele in a laundry room with a handgun. The dryer was running but was vented back into the room. A portable grill was also in the room and was very hot and loaded with charcoal. An officer secured the handgun but Steele put up a fight before the team subdued him, the complaint said. Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor . No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than $20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative . Investigators had said previously that Steele suffered injuries consistent with a suicide attempt but didn't offer details beyond saying he wasn't shot. Assistant District Attorney Paul Barnett told reporters Friday that Steele was treated for smoke inhalation at a Milwaukee medical facility. The complaint does not suggest a motive, and Barnett declined to comment on the investigation. Court Commissioner Scott McAndrew set Steele's bail at $1million and ordered him to have no contact with his children or any members of his wife's family. Barnett had asked for $5million, arguing that Steele planned the slayings and would have nothing to lose if he were released and attacked other family members. Barnett also argued that Steele could use money his family raised for his medical bills on bail. Nicholson said the money has been placed in a holding account and will be transferred to a charity. She asked for $100,000 bail and that he be allowed to call the couple's two children, arguing that he doesn't have much time left to spend with them because of his disease. McAndrew said he was not comfortable with anything less than $1million. Steele's wife was spearheading a drive to raise $75,000 for his medical care; her Facebook page is full of videos of Steele's law enforcement colleagues taking ice bucket challenges on his behalf. They had raised about $23,000 when Ashlee Steele died. Steele's preliminary hearing is set for September 4. Steele was ordered held on $1million bail and barred from contacting his family . Fitchburg Police were called to the Steeles' home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1pm last Friday. According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots. Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Members of a sheriff's department SWAT team found Ashlee Steele dead in the home. She had been shot in the head. They found Andrew Steele in a laundry room and a 9 mm pistol on the counter. He had not been shot but had non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. The affidavit said two rounds had been fired in the house. The Steeles have two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband have four children. Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4. His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses. The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May. The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed. 'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said. It had got so bad, the website said, that the muscle-twitching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food. Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.' Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive . Tragic: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead on Friday, leaving six children behind between them . Young love: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.' The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael. Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.' According to the sisters' obituaries, Kacee Tollefsbol was studying to be a nurse and held a degree in English from the University of St. Thomas. A mother of four, she had just married Mark Tollefsbol a month before she died. Ashlee Steele, a mother of two, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and taught three-year-olds at a church preschool.","Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy Andrew P.

"Jose Riga lauded his Blackpool players for focusing on the task in hand as they ended a six-month wait for a victory amid protests against the club's owners in the stands. Fans disillusioned with the Oyston family's handling of the Seasiders since their top-flight demotion in 2011 targeted Friday night's home clash against Cardiff as a perfect opportunity to vent their frustrations publicly. After 53 minutes - a symbolic number for Tangerines supporters because 1953 was the year of the 'Matthews Final' - large swathes of the crowd poured down to the advertising hoardings or left the stadium, with three fans even forcing the game to be stopped as they invaded the pitch. Blackpool's manager Jose Riga celebrates at the end of the game against Cardiff City . Francois Zoko (centre right) scored the only goal of the game for Blackpool in their 1-0 win against Cardiff . Prior to that point Riga's men had been on top, but their concentration never relented as Francois Zoko fired home a 64th-minute winner in a deserved 1-0 victory which lifted them off the foot of the Sky Bet Championship table. 'I'm happy just because it's a result of good collaboration and we forgot all that's happened around to focus on our job; we deserve it,' the Belgian said. 'The fans were even more behind us (after the goal) because that was the message I delivered to the players: keep going and do your job. 'That's all what I ask and just what the fans ask, even those who protest. Blackpool team-mates congratulate Zoko (centre) on his 64th minute striker at Bloomfield Road . 'They did well because it's not so easy. Even with a reduced number of fans you feel the sphere and you have the will and the power to go until the end and that's what we do.' Blackpool now head into the international break on a high, having experienced a winning feeling for the first time this season. The last time Championship clubs took a two-week hiatus for international games, Riga's job was openly touted to Burton's Gary Rowett by chairman Karl Oyston. Riga and Oyston have since forged an uneasy alliance - although the tension continues to simmer - and the Belgian, as he has always done, reiterated his commitment to the Seasiders. Blackpool fans protested against chairman Karl Oyston ahead of the match against Cardiff City on Friday . He added: 'My idea from day one is not to leave the club. There are many things that have been said but I was there all the time working hard so why I have to leave now... 'As manager you never decide but I repeat I just want to do my job here and to succeed with Blackpool.' Riga's position was definitely strengthened by this win, but the defeat for Cardiff further emphasised their need to exit managerial limbo soon. Prospective boss Russell Slade was at Bloomfield Road and is expected to officially assume the role early next week when the final compensation issues are ironed out with his former employers Leyton Orient. Some fans left Bloomfield Road midway through a first half in which both sides failed to break the deadlock . With Slade's arrival seemingly imminent, joint caretaker managers Daniel Gabbidon and Scott Young were disappointed to know they were signing off with a defeat. 'With Russell's experience and the quality of players we have at the club, we can still be promoted,' Gabbidon said. 'I hope he has time to get his points across. There isn't much wrong. There are small things we must improve on. 'Game-management has to be better and we must improve on decision-making. That wasn't good enough at times. 'The new manager is experienced and will be ready for the test ahead.'

"Israeli authorities have located a body close to where American student Aaron Sofer, pictured, went missing Friday in the Jerusalem Forest . Israeli police said today there is 'a strong possibility' they have found the body of an American seminary student who disappeared while hiking in Jerusalem last week. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the body was found in the same area where Aaron Sofer disappeared last Friday. Sofer, 23, of Lakewood, New Jersey, had been hiking with a friend in a hilly, forested area on the outskirts of Jerusalem. 'There is a strong possibility that it is the body of the missing student,' Rosenfeld said, stressing that a forensics team was still trying to confirm the identification. Rosenfeld would not elaborate or say whether there had been any signs of foul play. Police have been conducting an extensive search for Sofer, an ultra-Orthodox student at a yeshiva - a Jewish religious school named for its founder, Rabbi Tzvi Kaplan. Sofer's parents flew to Israel to assist with the search, and made a heart-breaking plea for any information that would lead to his whereabouts. Today, authorities reported that they found a body in the Jerusalem Forest. There was no immediate confirmation whether the body found belonged to Aaron Sofer, though Israeli media quickly reported that this was the case. Local news outlets had earlier reported that some of Sofer's belongings were found by police dogs. The discovery comes after the family of the missing student called on the Israeli Defense Force to join the search on Monday, amid fears he could have been the victim of ongoing tensions with Palestinians. Scroll down for video . Forensics: Forensic team members work Thursday near the place where a body was found next to Ein Karem village . Body: Israeli police and volunteers found a body near a forest in Jerusalem on Thursday while searching for Aaron Sofer, but said no formal identification had yet been made . Sofer failed to return home on Friday after becoming separated from a friend on a wooded slope in the Jerusalem Forest, near to where a Palestinian boy was found burned last month in a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli students in June. His parents, who have flown to Israel, believe he could have been the victim of a reprisal attack and have openly questioned authorities attempts to locate their son, especially in light of the current Gaza-Israeli conflict. 'A physically, mentally and emotionally healthy young man does not go missing for 72 hours,' Dov Hirth, a spokesman for the family told the Jerusalem Post on Monday. 'The family is not satisfied with the way the search and rescue operation has been handled thus far.' Hundreds of officers and volunteers joined the search for Sofer since the alarm was first raised on Friday after he split from his friend while they were climbing in the Beit Zayit area of the Jerusalem Woods. Aaron Sofer disappeared around noon nearly a week ago while he was hiking with a friend . 'The fact of the matter is we have a young man missing for no apparent reason, and it was on page 1 of all the newspapers and then the coverage just stopped,' said Hirth to the Jerusalem Post on Monday.'This needs to continue to be a major story.' Last month, three Israelis were indicted for the sickening murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 16, whose burnt body was found near to where Sofer disappeared. 'This area is bordered by Jewish communities and by Arab communities, so it is very concerning,' said Meir Lichtenstein who is a member of the Lakewood Council in New Jersey, the Sofer's home town. The details surrounding the body have not been disclosed. Though concern was already rising amongst the Jewish community back in the United States before the grim discovery. Search and rescue teams have been scouring the area since for the 23-year-old student from Lakewood, New Jersey . Ultra-Orthodox Jewish 'Yeshiva,' or seminary students in the center of Moshav Beit Zait, just west of Jerusalem participated in the search Thursday, August 28 . 'It's scary to think what possibly could be the ramifications,' said neighbor Tzvi Meth to CBS Local. 'Great fear is that he was accosted; he was taken away, kidnapped.' Sofer, who is an ultra-Orthodox, was a student at a yeshiva - a Jewish religious school named for its founder, Rabbi Tzvi Kaplan. U.S. Rep. Chris Smith and other New Jersey politicians attended a news conference Tuesday to draw attention to the missing student. 'I want the community to know that I believe no stone is being unturned,' Smith, a Republican who has written to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asking for aid in the search, said at the time. At Tuesday's gathering in Lakewood, the missing man's brother, Yaahkov Sofer, pleaded, 'Please bring him back.' As their brother-in-law Yehuda Wicentowski, right, listens, Yaakov Sofer, center left,  answers a question about the disappearance, in Israeli, of his brother Aaron Sofer, 23, Tuesday, Aug. 26, 2014, in Lakewood, New Jersey . He declined to speak further about his brother, who is one of 10 children in the family where the parents are a rabbi and a school office worker. In Lakewood, there are growing worries about Sofer. 'Is he abducted?' asked Rabbi Yisroel Serebrowski, who leads a congregation in Cherry Hill and says he is a friend of the missing student's parents. 'Is he being tortured?' 'This is a real person who has real parents who are suffering,' Serebrowski said. The crisis between Israelis and Palestinians has spiked in recent weeks with the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which erupted on July 8. On Tuesday, Israel and Hamas announced that they had agreed to an open-ended cease-fire in the war that stemmed from the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank by Hamas operatives.

"Caroline Cici Bellis may not be a household name yet, but the 15-year-old Justin Bieber-loving tennis junior from California is about to be. Just three years after a tiny Cici posed with her idol Maria Sharapova, the wild card stunned Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova in the biggest upset of the U.S. Open so far, winning 6-1 4-6 6-4 against the 12th seed in her grand slam debut. But who is Cici - the number two junior in the world who became the youngest woman to win a match at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 and the youngest American to win a match at the U.S. Open since Mary Joe Fernandez in 1986? Delight: The young star celebrates her win against the 12th seed in the US Open first round . The bubbly teenager was born in April 1999 in San Francisco and lives in Atherton, California. She first picked up a racket when she was just three, and was naturally gifted thanks to her lineage - her mother played junior tournaments when she was younger. But it was just four years ago - when she was 11 - that she properly turned her focus to the game. 'I went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience, but I never thought I would come out on top,' said the teenager, who next plays Kazakh Zarina Diyas. Cici, ranked 1,208, is currently the No. 2 junior behind Ivana Jorovic of Serbia. Cute: An adorable 12-year-old Cici poses with Maria Sharapova on court just three years ago . She has won a series of prestigious junior titles including the Easter Bowl Championships, USTA International Spring Championships, and the Coffee Bowl.​ She's also playing the U.S. Open junior tournament. Cici's amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 US dollars in prize money for a first-round victory, but she is in no rush to turn professional. She said: 'I think I'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college, in case an injury or something happens. But I'd love to be a pro one day.' Cici's wild card wasn't charity, she earned it when she won the USTA Girls' 18s National Championship, becoming the youngest to win the title since Lindsay Davenport, according to Sports Illustrated. Serving up a shock: Although she is junior world no 2, little was expected of the 15-year-old wildcard . Strain: Cibulkova looked to have sorted out her problems in the second set but Bellis came back to win . Disbelief: Bellis sinks to her knees after winning the final point of a pulsating match . Her idol is Kim Clijsters and the youngster says she models her game style and energy after the four-time major champion, though an adorable picture shows a tiny Cici posing with Maria Sharpova just three years ago. 'It's crazy to think that I'm actually here right now with all these other people,' she said of Tuesday's match. 'I never thought I would be practicing or sharing a court with a player that I watch on TV frequently. It's crazy. But I love it.'","Wildcard Cici Bellis beats 12th seed 6-1 4-6 6-4 .

"A deputy prosecutor in Washington state allegedly exchanged more than a thousand text messages, including a photograph of herself in a bikini, with a convicted robber and girlfriend-beater who has 'criminal' tattooed on his forehead. Marriya Wright, who works for Spokane County, is accused of rendering criminal assistance to Matthew Baumrucker, an inmate in the Spokane County Jail. Court documents unsealed last week reveal the pair corresponded via text or phone calls 1,280 times between February 6 and March 5, and she visited him several times in jail, according to a statement from a Spokane County corrections officer. Their visits occurred in the attorney-client booth, despite the fact Wright was not assigned to any of Baumrucker's cases. Felon: Marriya Wright, who works for Spokane County, is accused of rendering criminal assistance to Matthew Baumrucker, picured, an inmate in the Spokane County Jail . That same officer told police Baumrucker had a picture of Wright in a swimsuit in his cell phone, adding that he had 'never seen an inmate in possession of a prosecuting attorneys photograph in a bikini.' Baumrucker has multiple felony convictions and has served prison sentences for robbery, assault and domestic violence. At the time police began their investigation, he was facing drug and assault charges. Wright has not yet been charged, but she has been suspended as police investigate the pair's relationship, which authorities discovered while investigating Baumrucker in an assault. According to KXLY.com, police were trying to find Baumrucker in connection with those charges back in March. Bikini-clad: The deputy prosecutor, pictured, allegedly exchanged more than a thousand text messages, and a picture of herself in a bikini, with Baumrucker . A woman who was in an apartment with Baumrucker at the time later told police he called Wright and said, 'Marriya, the police are chasing me, I am in an apartment.' She said he then relayed a message that she didn't have to let the police in to search if they did not have a search warrant, so they didn't answer the door. Another witness told investigators Baumrucker met Wright in a car at a nearby gas station, an account corroborated by surveillance video obtained by police. Court records seen by KXLY.com show state charges against Baumrucker were dropped on August 15, but federal prosecutors filed charges against him one day before for being a felon in possession of a firearm, a Hi-Point C9 semi-automatic pistol. A judge ordered that he remain in jail until the disposition of his trial in October. In the meantime, Wright is on leave from the prosecutor's office while the investigation continues.","Marriya Wright, who works for Spokane County, Washington, allegedly rendered criminal assistance to Matthew Baumrucker .

"Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, is accused of killing his wife . Police in Wisconsin say that before she died, a wounded woman called 911 and identified the person who shot her as her brother-in-law, who had been a sheriff's deputy. A police affidavit obtained Tuesday says Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 around 1 p.m. Friday and said Andy Steele had shot her in the back. When police arrived at Steele's home in the Madison suburb of Fitchburg they also found the body of his 39-year-old wife, Ashlee Steele, who had also been fatally shot. The affidavit says the 38-year-old Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota, also told a detective that Andy Steele had shot her before she died at UW hospital. Steele was arrested but hasn't been charged. The retired sheriff's deputy had recently diagnosed with ALS and his wife was responsible for raising more than $20,000 to help him battle the disease. Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy shot and killed the sisters in the couple's Fitchburg, Wisconsin, home. The Dane County Medical Examiner determined both deaths were homicides. Fitchburg Police were called to the couple's home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1 p.m. Friday. According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots. Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister .

As of Saturday, August 23, supporters had raised nearly $23,000 from 266 donations toward the $75,000 goal of the fundraiser, according to Twincities.com. There were 62 days left to raise the full amount. Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.' Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.'

"A young mother has committed suicide by walking in front of a semi-trailer the same day her 14-month-old son mysteriously died at their home, authorities said. Police in Canton, Ohio, discovered little Omoyele Gonzalez dead in a bed at the property in the 1600 block of 10th Street just after 7.30 p.m. Thursday. He had no obvious injuries and a subsequent autopsy has proved inconclusive. Officers were called to the home because the child's mother, Kayelisa Martin, 20, was threatening suicide, according to a Canton police press release. Around the same time, a family member went to the nearby Canton Fire Station No. 7 to report that the toddler was dead. When law enforcement arrived, however, Martin wasn't there. They tried to locate her, but soon received word that the devastated mother had died in a traffic incident in nearby Summit County. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Young mother Kayelisa Martin, pictured, committed suicide Thursday by walking in front of a semi-trailer the same day her 14-month-old son Omoyele, pictured with her, mysteriously died at a Canton, Ohio, home, authorities said . According to the press release, Martin 'committed suicide by walking in front of a moving vehicle on I-77 at Milepost 115,' near Akron-Canton Airport. A Summit County sheriff's office release states that she was struck when she stepped in front of a semi-trailer. The northbound lanes were closed for about four hours after the tragic incident and traffic was detoured around the scene. Stark County Coroner's office conducted an autopsy on the toddler Saturday and results released Monday offered little insight into how the adorable toddler died. 'Preliminary autopsy findings showed that the child did not die of any trauma,' coroner P.S. Murthy said in a statement. The office is awaiting toxicology results but confirmed X-rays showed there had been no recent or past abuse, nor did Omoyele die from injuries consistent with a fall or from an infection. The child's father does not live at the home. Police said they have interviewed him and they don't believe he was involved. Mystery: Stark County Coroner's office conducted an autopsy on the toddler, pictured left and right, on Saturday and results released Monday proved inconclusive . No abuse: The office is awaiting toxicology results but confirmed X-rays showed there had been no recent or past abuse, nor did Omoyele die from an infection . Gary Guenther, investigator for the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office, said Friday that Martin's autopsy showed she died of 'blunt force trauma to the head and torso.' He said she was pronounced dead at the scene. According to the Canton Repository, the child and his mother were involved in a car crash earlier Thursday in Canal Fulton, though its unclear if it has any relevance to their later deaths. The crash occurred at 6:35 a.m. Thursday in the 2100 block of Locust Street, according to a crash report released Friday by Canal Fulton police. Martin told police she lost control of her black 2007 Nissan Maxima when the wheel started to shake and she couldn't stop, the report said.

"A Stillwater, Minnesota, restaurant is under fire after it passed on a recent minimum wage hike by adding part of the extra 75 cents an hour to customers' checks. The state ordered a mandatory wage increase effective August 1, but Oasis Cafe owner Craig Beemer reacted by adding a 35 cent 'minimum wage fee' directly to diners' tabs, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Members of the community were outraged and took to Facebook to voice their fury. The phone was also reportedly running hot with complaints. Cafe: A Stillwater, Minnesota, restaurant, pictured, is under fire after it attempted to skirt a recent minimum wage hike by adding part of the extra 75 cents to customers' checks . However, Oasis Cafe manager Colin Orcutt defended Beemer's decision claiming they were only being upfront with their customers. He said that in order to keep their doors open they needed to pass on the increase, and that doing it indirectly through raising prices of their menu items would have been 'a lot more backhanded.' The increase was the first time Minnesota has hiked the minimum wage in a decade. Beemer only has six servers on the pay roll, but he said it will cost him $10,000 more a year to pay them $8 an hour instead of the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. It's not clear if Oasis Cafe is only restaurant to react to the news by imposing such a fee. According to the Star-Tribune, one customer called the cafe Wednesday to demand a refund and others encourage people to boycott the roadside cafe on Facebook. 'We're shocked at what's going on,' manager Colin Orcutt told the Star-Tribune of the public response. Fee: The state ordered a mandatory wage increase effective August 1, but Oasis Cafe owner Craig Beemer reacted by adding a 35 cent 'minimum wage fee' directly to diners' tabs . 'We're all appalled at the response for just protecting his employees. We're just doing what we have to do.' But Wade Luneburg of the MN State Council of UNITE HERE Unions told the Star Tribune that the restaurant is 'overreacting.' 'Putting (minimum wage) fees on tickets and passing the cost on to consumers directly is strange at best, and creates an ""us against them"" mentality while ordering dinner.' Despite the online boycott threats, business has actually increased at Oasis Cafe this week, Orcutt told the newspaper. '(Beemer) wants people to be aware we're a small business and we're trying to stay open,' he said, adding that the cafe considered doing away with severs altogether and resorting to counter service to make ends meet.","Minnesota ordered a mandatory minimum wage increase effective August 1 .

"A New York man has been arrested after he allegedly groped a sleeping woman aboard a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to New Jersey. Eun Jong Lee was detained upon arrival Sunday night at Newark Liberty International Airport and was charged with abusive sexual contact, a felony carrying a maximum two-year prison term and a $250,000 fine. The 47-year-old Ithaca resident made his initial court appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in Newark. Arrested: New York man Eun Jong Lee has been arrested after he allegedly groped a sleeping woman aboard a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to New Jersey . He was represented by a federal public defender, and federal prosecutors said he did not enter a plea during the session. Lee faces up to two years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors said Lee was seated next to a woman he did not know on the 13-hour United Airlines flight 78. They said while the plane was in the air, the woman, who was traveling alone woke up to find Lee's hand on the front of her shirt, touching her breast through her clothing. Lee then allegedly touched the skin of her neck and attempted to put his hand down the front of her shirt, prosecutors said. The woman said she asked Lee to stop touching her. She then reported the incident to a flight crew member and provided that person with a written statement describing what happened, prosecutors said. An after-hours message for Lee's public defender was not returned. In March, 66-year-old California man Hans Loudermilk was arrested for groping a 15-year-old girl on a Delta flight and telling her he could 'teach her things' about sex.

"Thief: Police arrested Kate Meckler, an agent for the New York-based firm Warburg Realty, in April after security staff saw her take a top, a pair of jeans and a jacket from the Manhattan store without paying, according to the prosecutors' criminal complaint . A high-flying New York real estate broker has admitted to stealing $1,700 worth of designer clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue. Police arrested Kate Meckler, an agent for the New York-based firm Warburg Realty, in April after security staff saw her take a top, a pair of jeans and a jacket from the exclusive Manhattan department store without paying, according to the prosecutors' criminal complaint. Meckler, who sells multimillion-dollar luxury homes in Manhattan, was originally charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property, according to the complaint. But she pleaded guilty Monday to a single count of disorderly conduct, the district attorney's office said. The 39-year-old NYU graduate wore an expensive-looking navy dress and gold sandals for the hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court, the New York Post reported. Meckler was sentenced to five days of community service at a soup kitchen under the plea deal her attorney struck. Meckler helped sell a Park Avenue apartment that belonged to Rachel Uchitel, a club promoter, for $1.95 million in 2011, according to a report in the New York Observer. It's unclear why Meckler, one of Warburg Realty's top-10-grossing agents, didn't pay for the goods worth $1,644. According to The Post, she has a condo sale in contract for $11.5 million on the Upper East Side. Her family also have money, with her father, Alan Meckler, CEO of Mediabistro.com, making his fortune as a tech guru with Mecklermedia Corporation. Saks: Meckler, who sells multimillion-dollar luxury homes in Manhattan, pleaded guilty Monday to stuffing the goods into her designer handbag and fleeing the exclusive department store, pictured . Her grandfather, Herman Meckler, was an actor who had supporting roles in movies including Oscar winner 'Amadeus.' A lavish Southampton mansion, owned by the family, was used in the film 'As Good As It Gets,' The Post reports. According to Warburg's website, the broker worked as a marketing executive at Bear Stearns and Estee Lauder before becoming a real-estate agent. Asked if the incident will affect her employment, the company's president, Frederick Warburg Peters, told Gothamist: 'I have every confidence in Kate and we continue to value highly her association with Warburg Realty.' Meckler didn't speak to reporters as she left court teary-eyed, but her attorney Adam Miller said she looked 'forward to moving on with her life and career.'","Police arrested Kate Meckler, an agent for the New York-based firm Warburg Realty, in April .

"Jurors in the case of a 20-year-old man accused of murdering a University of Florida student out of jealously were shown today blood-stained shoes and pictures of a shovel and belt linked to the gruesome slaying. Pedro Bravo stands accused of strangling Christian Aguilar, 18, to death and dumping his body in the woods in September 2012 as part of a plot to reunite with his high school girlfriend, who was dating the UF student. On Thursday, prosecutors presented in court graphic evidence in the murder case, including a weaved belt they said Bravo had used to throttle his romantic rival. Scroll down for video . 'Murder weapon': Prosecutors in the trial of Pedro Bravo, accused of killing his romantic rival Christian Aguillar, showed jurors this image of a weaved belt they believe the defendant used to strangle the 18-year-old to death . Clue: Police believe that Bravo used this shovel found under a deck near his apartment building to bury Aguillar's body in a field . Grisly evidence: Gainesville Police Crime Scene Investigator Mark Trahan points to blood on a shoe insert (left) and the bottom of a Rust-Oleum paint can (right) that were found in a backseat compartment during a search of Pedro Bravo's Chevy Blazer . Jurors also got to see a photo of a shovel that was found under a deck outside of Pedro Bravo's apartment building in Spyglass, which officials said he used to bury Aguillar's body in a remote field. Victim: Bravo is also on trial for kidnapping and other charges in the September 20, 2012, death of Christian Aguilar (pictured), who once was his high school friend . Marc Trahan, a crime scene investigator with the Gainesville Police Department, testified Thursday that he used a chemical to detect blood stains inside Bravo's blue Chevrolet Blazer, WSVN reported. More blood was found on the insoles of a pair of shoes and a pain can stored in the SUV. Prosecutors believe that the 20-year-old defendant strangled his former friend-turned-rival inside his vehicle after giving him Gatorade laced with a mixture of drugs during a shopping trip September 20, 2012. On Wednesday, the court heard the second part of the testimony of Aguillar's girlfriend, Erika Friman, who detailed her relationship with the two men. The three of them had been friends in high school. After Friman entered college, she began dating Aguillar but kept it a secret from Bravo, WWGP reported. ‘I lied to him because he was at a . very sensitive point in his life, I supposed,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want . to throw him over the edge and say, “By the way, I’m dating a mutual . friend of ours.”’ Detective Trahan points to blood found on the bottom of the paint can seen on the screen during his testimony Thursday . When Bravo, a student at Santa Fe College, found out about his friends' budding romance, police said he became obsessed with the idea of eliminating Aguillar so he could be with Friman. Friman told the court that she arranged a meeting between the two men after Bravo threatened to kill himself. ‘I cared about anyone who claimed they were suicidal,’ she told the court. As part of her testimony, Friman also read entries from Bravo's journal. ‘No one will stop me,’ the suspected killer wrote. ‘I will get out of Miami and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back.’ Star witness: Erika Friman, the girlfriend of victim Christian Aguilar, continues her testimony from the previous day during the murder trial Wednesday . Emotional: Ms Friman detailed for the court Wednesday how she started dating Aguillar in college but decided not to tell Bravo about it to spare his feelings . Sealed with a kiss: Friman, the girlfriend of victim Christian Aguilar, blows a kiss back to the Aguilar family . Prosecutors say on September 21, 2012, Pedro Bravo spent 13 minutes strangling Christian Aguillar in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body. Aguilar's skeletal remains were discovered in October 2012 - several weeks after his murder - by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County. On Tuesday, Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com. But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react. Parents: Carlos and Claudia Aguilar listen as the prosecution gives opening statements on Tuesday . Object of affection: Bravo had become obsessed that Aguilar, a University of Florida student, was dating his high school girlfriend, Erika Friman, pictured, and plotted to eliminate him, Assistant State Attorney Brian Kramer said . Other surveillance pictures showed Bravo buying a shovel, drugs, duct tape, a knife and other items from Lowe's and Wal-Mart that were used in the alleged killing. The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar. 'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.' In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the Internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat. Death: In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar, pictured, to his car and strangled him . 'He cuts off the air to his airway and blood to his brain,' Kramer said. 'He would later (tell someone) it took Christian 13 minutes to die.' Friman and Bravo were dating at high school in Miami but Friman ended things before leaving to Gainsville to attend Santa Fe College, where Bravo later followed.

Mug: Biddle, seen in the mugshot from his arrest on theft and fraud charges, is believed to be running from the law . According to a report on Philly.com, is a manager of Professional Boat Sales in Northfield, which is owned by Tracy Blumenstein. The pair are facing 13 criminal complaints between them. Blumenstein was arrested in February on theft and fraud charges. Biddle faces nine charges in seven complaints, according to The Press of Atlantic City. Egg Harbor Township police are now considering Biddle a 'wanted person' with 'full U.S. extradition.' The business partners are professional boaters who have in the past won multiple boat-racing championships together in the U.S. and the UK. Biddle 'has contacts throughout the country and abroad and could be anywhere,' reads the flier obtained by The Press of Atlantic City. Theriault said police were 'proceeding with the investigation as we would if he hadn't been reported missing.' 'We have no proof (Biddle is) dead at this point,' he told the newspaper. According . to Philly.com, the fact Biddle was so seasoned on the water made his . crash seem curious to some, especially as he knew the channels where the . incident took place like the back of his hand. Witness . Tom Murphy, who ran into the water to help, said rumors started . circulating immediately after the collision and he refused to believe . them. However, he told Philly.com this week, 'It's starting to sound a little more believable.' The crash took place around 11.30 p.m. July 20.

One complaint against Biddle and his partner Blumenstein alleges the pair accepted a $20,000 down payment on a boat but never produced the vessel.

Winner: The crowd erupted at last year's Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game when Heath, a high school basketball coach and fervent Thunder fan, made the unlikely basket . Her husband, Heath, was a teacher and coach Christian Heritage Academy in Del City, where faculty and students raised funds to help offset their medical expenses, which included multiple rounds of chemotherapy. Mrs Kufahl also required surgery at a hospital in Houston, Texas, and subsequent treatments in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to local outlet News9.

"The key prosecution witness in former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's trial testified Monday that he never saw any signs the governor's marriage was crumbling, and that he never had any intimate physical contact with the first lady. A prosecutor asked Jonnie Williams about Bob and Maureen McDonnell's marriage to counter a defense attorney's assertion last week that the first lady, feeling neglected by her frequently absent husband, had developed a crush on Williams and that he had led her on. 'I didn't know she had any interest in me until this past week,' Williams sheepishly said on the stand. Scroll down for video . Court: Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, center, flanked by lawyers John L. Brownlee, right, and Henry W. 'Hank' Asbill, heads toward the federal courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, Monday . The testimony comes days after personal emails sent by Mrs McDonnell to the former businessman were read out in court, including one particularly racy one sent the day an earthquake hit Virginia that read: 'I just felt the EARTH MOVE AND I WASN'T HAVING SEX!!!!' On Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Dry asked specifically whether Williams and Maureen McDonnell had any intimate contact. 'I never had any contact with Mrs. McDonnell - no physical contact, period,' he said. Williams also said Maureen McDonnell never told him her marriage was on the rocks, and he saw no signs that it was. To further make the point, the prosecution showed two photos of the McDonnells at public events. First lady: Former first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, and one of her attorneys, Heather Martin, right, prepare to enter the federal courthouse, Monday . Corruption charges: Maureen McDonnell arrives for the start of the second week of the federal corruption trial for McDonnell and her husband . They were holding hands in one, and Bob McDonnell was kissing his wife on the cheek in the other. The McDonnells are charged with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for helping promote his company's products. They could face decades in prison if convicted. Williams testified under immunity, starting Wednesday afternoon and concluding at lunchtime Monday. Bob McDonnell's attorney, Henry Asbill, questioned Williams about his immunity agreement. He reminded Williams that he testified that a company's first responsibility is to stay in business. 'Would you agree the second rule of business is not to go to jail?' Asbill asked. Williams, who has said repeatedly that he has done wrong, replied: 'I don't think any businessman wants to go to jail.' Asbill, attempting to undermine Williams' credibility, questioned Williams about lawsuits he and Star faced over allegations of securities violations. Williams said he thought most of the half-dozen 'nuisance suits' by Star shareholders had been settled or soon would be, but Asbill noted that two were put on hold at the request of prosecutors in the McDonnell case. Defense attorneys last week noted that Williams and Maureen McDonnell had exchanged text messages and phone calls more than 1,200 times in less than two years, suggesting that the relationship between Williams and the McDonnells was not strictly business as Williams has said. Dry put that number in context, though, by mentioning Monday that during the same period Williams made or received about 109,000 calls and texts. 'I'm a busy man,' Williams said. Questions: Businessman Jonnie Williams, seen leaving court Thursday, claimed he only had a professional relationship with former Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife - but their texts show otherwise . Asbill asked Williams whether having the governor call the businessman's father on his 80th birthday was business or personal. Williams said it was personal, but it wouldn't have been possible without his spending on the McDonnells. 'This cost me, in my mind, hundreds of thousands of dollars even to be able to do that,' he said. Asbill pursued a line of questioning aimed at pinning most of the requests for gifts and loans on Maureen McDonnell and suggesting that the governor did little, if anything, for Williams in return. Williams acknowledged that his company received no state grants, which is what he was after.

But he pointed to a gathering of health care leaders at the governor's mansion, where Williams was permitted to invite anyone he wanted for a discussion about Star's signature product, Anatabloc. 'That was a very significant evening, to have that sort of thing happen for my company,' he said. Among the gifts Bob McDonnell received was a Rolex watch purchased by Williams and given to the governor by his wife for Christmas 2012. Williams received a text message that Christmas Eve with a photo of a smiling McDonnell showing off the timepiece. 'My first thought was I was scared to death,' Williams said of his reaction to seeing the picture. 'It's the first time I'm sure he knew it came from me.' Williams testified last week that Maureen McDonnell asked him to buy the watch, and it was a mistake to do so.","A prosecutor asked Jonnie Williams about Bob and Maureen McDonnell's marriage to counter a defense attorney's assertion last week .

"An unlicensed drunk driver who killed a 16-year-old boy in a horror crash last month and then posted a picture of his totaled vehicle with a smiley face on Facebook days after the tragic accident, has been jailed. Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, of Coon Rapids, Minnesota, caused two crashes on July 22 along Highway 252 in Brooklyn Park. Although he has yet to be charged in the two accidents, he has now been jailed for violating terms of his probation from a 2013 felony conviction.

Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, of Coon Rapids, was arrested Friday and is being held without bail before a Monday court hearing. A warrant for his arrest was issued a day after Jason McCarthy, of Brooklyn Center, died from injuries suffered when his car was struck July 22 by Vanwagner on Hwy. 252. Abstaining from alcohol and remaining law-abiding are among the many conditions of Vanwagner’s probation stemming from a June 2013 conviction for knife-wielding terroristic threats against a love rival. On the day of the accident, the 24-year-old ran into  McCarthy's in his second car accident, slamming into his car at around 60 mph. On the . Saturday before McCarthy died, Vanwagner posted the insensitive photo of . his car on his Facebook page with the caption 'That's her front end . after I got done with her lol.' Under a second photo, he commented: 'I'm all good slept a day in the hospital then came home and did yard work lol.' He acknowledged posting the picture but said he didn't even know he hit somebody. 'I just thought I hit something,' he said. McCarthy died just a few days later and the photos were removed shortly afterwards. The State Patrol said it suspects Vanwagner had been under the influence of alcohol when he hit one car, took off and then struck McCarthy’s vehicle. After last month’s crashes but before McCarthy died, Vanwagner posted photos of his severely damaged car on his Facebook page. He removed them after the teenagers' death . Suspect: Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, pictured left and right, of Coon Rapids, caused not one but two crashes on July 22 along Hwy. 252 in Brooklyn Park, according to the State Patrol . An eyewitness, Roy Peterson, saw the entire episode play out including both accidents. Speaking to the Star Tribune he says Vanwagner was driving recklessly. 'He was in his car after the initial wreck, heading down Hwy. 252 with no regard for anything else around him,' he said on Tuesday. 'Then he came to a complete stop in the middle lane,' Mr Peterson said. 'Everyone was aware of him.' Peterson said he pulled up next to Vanwagner and saw 'his head rolled over to the left on the seat cushion, and his eyes were rolled back in his head.' He called the police but before anyone could stop Vanwagner, he had driven off. Peterson watched Vanwagner’s accelerating car 'go all the way down the left-hand turn lane. There was no sign of brake lights' before the collision with McCarthy’s stationary car unleashed enough force to 'lift both of them up.' He rushed to help but there was no response from the teenager. Vanwagner was conscious in the aftermath 'but he had that blank look. … He was in a fog.' Officers suspected he had been drinking and could smell alcohol on his breath. Tragic: The teen victim, Jason McCarthy, pictured, was rushed to North Memorial Medical Center where he clung to life for days before dying on Tuesday . Jason McCarthy would have been a junior . at Champlin Park High School. He was an honors student and played bass . guitar in the high school band and with friends in a rock band called . the Crak Pots, his aunt Brigid Klaysmat told the Star Tribune.

"A jealous and enraged Florida teen strangled his love rival in just 13 minutes in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body in a nearby forest, a jury heard in the opening statements of the now-20-year-old's murder trial Tuesday. Pedro Bravo had become obsessed that Christian Aguilar, a University of Florida student, was dating his high school girlfriend, Erika Friman, and plotted to eliminate him, Assistant State Attorney Brian Kramer said. 'This is a story as old as time - elimination of a rival fueled by jealousy and anger,' Kramer said. Scroll down for video . On trial: Pedro Bravo listens as the prosecution gives opening statements in his murder trial in a courtroom in the Alachua County Criminal Justice Center in Gainesville, Florida, on Tuesday . Aguilar's body was discovered several weeks later by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County. Bravo is also on trial for kidnapping and other charges in the September 20, 2012, death of a man who once was his high school friend. Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com. But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's skeletal remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react.

The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar. 'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.' In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat.

"Tragic: The body of Jennifer Huston, 38, pictured, has finally been discovered . Missing Oregon mother Jennifer Huston was found dead Tuesday morning near her SUV on a rural, remote road about 24 miles from her Dundee home, police said. A landowner discovered her dark green Lexus on his property in Yamhill County near Sheridan around 10.30 a.m. and notified authorities. Detectives who responded to the scene on Southeast Gopher Valley Road, just off Highway 18, discovered her body nearby, Newberg-Dundee Police Department Captain Chris Bolek told NBC News. Bolek said there were no signs of foul play and no evidence to suggest that the public was in any danger, though he gave no indication of how she died. The grim discovery comes a day after San Juan County, Washington, sheriff's office said it had been unable to confirm a report that the Dundee woman might be in the San Juan Islands of northwest Washington. KPTV reports that the sheriff's office said Monday it had received 'no information confirming the presence of Jennifer Huston in the San Juan Islands.' Investigators were checking out a report that the missing woman was spotted late last week on the ferry out of Anacortes to Friday Harbor in the San Juans. A couple who notified deputies told KPTV that they saw a woman matching Huston's description driving a car that matched Huston's car on July 31. The 38-year-old woman was last seen July 24 running errands at around 6pm. A search was conducted in Oregon. Huston's family says she spent time in the San Juans in the past. A couple say they saw a blonde female in her 30s on the 9am ferry to Friday Harbor in a car that matched the make and model of Huston's green Lexus, including a crack in the windshield. Scroll down for video . Found: Missing Oregon mother Jennifer Huston was found Tuesday morning near her SUV, pictured, on a rural, remote road, police said . Scene: A landowner discovered her dark green Lexus around 10:30 a.m. and notified authorities . Forensics: Detectives who responded to the scene discovered her body nearby, Newberg-Dundee Police Department Captain Chris Bolek told NBC News . Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car . However the ferry system in the area is connected to 20 terminals, including Seattle, which made the search to find Huston on surveillance footage near impossible. 'If that was her on the ferry, she could be on Orcas Island right now, she could be on Lopez, she could be on Shaw, she could be anywhere using the ferry systems,' San Juan County Under sheriff Bruce Distler told KPTV last week. Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, was last seen taking cash out at a bank, filling up her car with gas and then buying snacks and non-lethal sleeping pills at a Rite Aid in nearby Newberg around 6.22pm on July 24. She also withdrew a 'small sum' of money from an ATM, but it is not known how much. Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station, but police said it was not due to a dead battery, according to Fox News, and she has not used her credit cards since. She told her husband, Kallen Huston, she had some errands to run, but then never returned home. At a press conference this week, Mr Huston - who has passed a polygraph test - said he believed that finding his wife's 99 Lexus would be the key to finding her. He also pleaded directly with his wife for her safe return. Devastated: Jennifer's husband sobbed during a press conference Monday in which he begged her to come home . Last seen: The married mother-of-two was last seen filling up her car near her home in Newberg, Oregon, about 6.22pm on July 24 .

'Jennifer, if you could see this or hear this, I love you,' Mr Huston said. 'You have a ton of support from the community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need you. I love you. He added: 'We'll never stop looking for you.' Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area. They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress. 'After . [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have . covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts . are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office . said. 'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.' A clearly emotional Mr Huston, flanked by fellow members of her family, said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer, KOIN reported. Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage . stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after . As to questions surrounding her final . known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband . said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it . was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, . and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering . from for three days. He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.' Captain . Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a . 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 . miles after she filled up the tank. Mr .

"A teen whose boyfriend stabbed her father to death said she was 'glad' he was dead and wished her dad's girlfriend had been murdered too, a forensic psychiatrist testified in court Wednesday. Morgan Lane Arnold, now-16, was in a state of active psychosis when she made the remarks about her father, Dennis Lane, Dr Neil Blumberg said, according to The Baltimore Sun. 'I'm glad he's dead,' Arnold said at one point after she was arrested, according to records read aloud by Blumberg, a witness in her defense, in Howard County Circuit Court. 'My fantasy came true. He disappeared,' she apparently said. Arnold is accused of asking her then-boyfriend, Jason Bulmer, to kill her father. She was 14 at the time of the killing and was charged as an adult with first-degree murder and other counts. No remorse: Morgan Lane Arnold, right, pictured with Jason Bulmer, showed no remorse after her father was murdered . Victim: Dennis Lane was stabbed to death in his home by Bulmer in May 2013 . However, her lawyers are now trying to get her case transferred to the juvenile system and Wednesday was the second day of testimony. Arnold and Bulmer were described as misfits who had an obsession with fantasy characters. Testimony focused on the teen's mental health history, revealing that she has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, and Asperger's at various points in her life. According to The Baltimore Sun, mental health experts said Arnold regularly talked of a character named 'Nymeria' whom she said awoke within her and took over her body. Nymeria is the name of a wolf character on 'Game of Thrones.' Blumberg testified that the appearance of Nymeria suggested Arnold suffered hallucinations. However, other psychiatrists disagreed. Adolescent psychologist Kiu Eubanks told the court that Arnold is intellectually 'slow,' with her psychological age somewhere between 9 and 12. Arrest: Jason Bulmer was 19 and Morgan Lane Arnold was 14 when they were charged with murder . The hearing is scheduled to continue August 6. In . deciding whether she should be tried as a juvenile, Judge William . Tucker will take into consideration the girl's health, whether she has . the potential for rehabilitation, and whether she poses a risk to the . public. In February, 20-year-old Bulmer pleaded guilty to murdering Lane because Arnold was 'sick of him'. Bulmer . admitted stabbing the businessman and blogger several times with a . kitchen knife at the family's Ellicott City home last May. The court heard that Bulmer and his victim's daughter had been planning the killing on Skype for nearly two months. At his hearing, Bulmer, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in May, made no statements and only answered direct questions. Assistant state attorney, Danielle DuClaux gave an account of the murder, which took place at about 4am on May 10 last year. Target: Charging documents show Bulmer had intended to kill Denise Geiger, left, as well as Dennis Lane . Crime scene: Arnold is said to have left a door unlocked so Bulmer could slip into her home and kill her father . She read out conversations between . Bulmer and his teenage girlfriend, who is awaiting trial on five counts . including murder, conspiracy and solicitation of murder. According to DuClax, Bulmer told police that his girlfriend had told him to kill her father, the Baltimore Sun reported. He had also planned to kill Mr Lane's fiancée, Denise Geiger, who was in the house and called police as Bulmer began his attack. Charging . documents show that Bulmer claimed he was instructed by his girlfriend . to stab her father in the throat 10 times with a kitchen carving knife, . and Ms Geiger in the throat 15 times with the same weapon. When detectives asked why Miss Geiger was to be stabbed five times more , Bulmer, who was only in the 10th grade, told detectives that Arnold had said: 'I have my reasons, and I'll tell you later.' Bulmer was instructed to bring his own knife to the house, which Arnold, who has Asperger's syndrome and anxiety disorders, shared with her dad and Miss Geiger. He sent his younger girlfriend a photo of a kitchen knife in a text message, checking for her approval, charging documents showed. Plot: Bulmer and Arnold allegedly planned the murder over Skype, a court heard in Bulmer's case . Murder charge: Morgan Lane Arnold, who has learning difficulties, will likely be tried as an adult . Bond: Bulmer started dating Arnold, 14, after they met through an online game . Anxious: Morgan Lane Arnold has Asperger's and struggled to adapt to her school . She replied in such a way that 'indicated to Bulmer that this knife was satisfactory,' according to the charging documents. She sent a further message to say she would leave the door unlocked and . Bulmer let her know when he was getting close to the home. After the killing Bulmer had planned to flee to California with Morgan, who has special needs. The students, who both attended the same school, had met through online gaming. Arnold's anxiety had led her to retreat to online fantasy games, where she could control her interaction with others. 'Her electronic communication devices were her world,' her mother, Cindi Arnold, told the Baltimore Sun shortly after the murder. She said her daughter suffered from anxiety, which would cause her hair to fall out, and said that when the teenager was nervous she would growl and make animal sounds. Arnold had been having treatment, but it . was stopped after her parents separated and began a custody battle, as . they disagreed over the best way to raise their daughter. Mr Lane had struggled to accept his daughter's autism diagnosis, and believed his daughter needed more socialization, according to records. He 'expects more of Mogan in terms of emotional sturdiness' a report by Dr Cynthia Wilcox had stated. A sentencing hearing for Bulmer is due to take place on May 29. Arnold is still awaiting a court date and will be tried as an adult despite her special needs.","Maryland teen, Morgan Lane Arnold, was in a state of active psychosis when she made the remarks about her father, Dennis Lane, a psychiatrist said at a court hearing Wednesday .

"Silent film star Colleen Moore had a lifelong obsession with dollhouses and spent what would be around $7 million in today’s dollars to build the Fairy Castle—an 8-foot, jewel encrusted little girl’s dream. As one of the most popular actresses of her day, the star of 1934’s The Scarlet Letter had the resources to enlist top talent to produce her miniature dream home. The doll house even had an actual architect, who said ‘the architecture must have no sense of reality. We must invent a structure that is everybody's conception of an enchanted castle.’ Scroll down for video . Welcome: An ornate courtyard welcomes tiny imaginary visitors into Fairy Caste--the '$7 million' dream doll house commissioned by silent film star Colleen Moore . Breaking ground: Moore's vision first began to bear fruit when construction began on Fairy Castle in 1928 . Precious gem: Fairy Castle drips with jewels. The house's many chandeliers are fashioned with diamonds, emeralds, and pearls . The end result was Fairy Castle, a doll house full of chandeliers dripping with diamonds, emeralds, and pearls, murals courtesy of Walt Disney himself, and 2,000 miniatures throughout its expansive floor plan--including the smallest bible ever written. Work on Fairy Castle began in 1928. By 1935, some 100 designers and artists had worked on the house. When the doll house was completed, America was finally struggling out of the Great Depression and Moore put her castle to a philanthropic use. She organized a national tour which showcased Fairy Castle in major cities across the country . Big names: An architect was even hired for Fairy Castle and Walt Disney himself painted the house's ornate murals and tiny paintings . Ornate: Thousands of individual miniatures are placed throughout the 8-foot doll palace . Pricey: Real wood floors and actual tapestries adorn Fairy Castle's enchanting dining hall. The doll house cost $500,000 to build in the late 1920s and early 1930s -- in today's dollars, that's about $7 million . Ads for the tour in Chicago described Fairy Castle thusly: ‘A museum in itself—it awaits you—starting November 15th in our Eighth Floor Toyland. You will want to see it again and again.’ In the end, the tour raised $650,000 between 1935 and 1939, which was donated to children struggling with poverty. In 1949, Moore was convinced to part with her dream house for good and put it on permanent public display. Its new home became Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry, where it resides to this day behind glass. Millions have gazed into the tiny, enchanting home and will continue to for years to come. Good cause: The miniature world was inspired by Moore's lifetime obsession with doll houses. When it was completed in 1935, Moore sent Fairy Castle on a national tour to raise money for children left destitute by the Great Depression . Group effort: By the time it was complete, some 100 artists and designers had lent a hand to Fairy Castle . New home: Moore gave up her beloved Fairy Castle in 1949 so that it could go on public display. It now resides permanently at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry . Celluloid star: Built in 1928, the Fairy Castle was the property of the famous silent movie actress Colleen Moore (pictured crouching in its courtyard)","One of the biggest stars of her day, Colleen Moore was obsessed with doll houses and had the means to commission the miniature castle of her dreams .

Vanwagner sideswiped a vehicle at Hwy. 252 and 73rd Avenue before continuing south where he struck McCarthy's car from behind, leaving both cars totaled. State Patrol Sgt. Jesse Grabow said the 'odor of alcoholic beverage was noticed' on his breath. Results of a blood alchohol test are pending, as are the charges against the driver, who according to state records had a revoked license. Vanwagner is on probation for a felony conviction in April for terroristic threats. He is required to abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs and remain law-abiding under the conditions of his sentence.","Michael J.

"Tracy Morgan still hasn't recovered from the injuries he sustained in a June car crash with a truck, but the comedian is working hard to get better. The 45-year-old comedian's attorney appeared on the Today show on Monday to give an update on Morgan's condition and speak about their current lawsuit against WalMart, whose truck driver caused the deadly crash. 'He's still struggling but he's a fighter,' attorney Benedict Morelli said. Scroll down for video . Doing better: Tracy Morgan's attorney Benedict Morelli appeared on the Today show Monday morning to give an update on the 45-year-old comedian's condition after a serious car crash in June . Injured: Morgan sustained a broken leg and ribs in the June 7 crash and is still in rehabilitation. Pictured last month, attending a doctor's appointment in Manhattan with his fiancee Megan Wollover (left) and their 1-year-old . The former 30 Rock star and a group of friends were returning from a stand-up show in Dover, Delaware early June 7 when trucker Kevin Roper, 35, smashed into their limousine-van while speeding 20 mph over the limit on the New Jersey Turnpike. Close-friend and comedian James McNair - known as Jimmy Mack - was killed in the crash while Morgan suffered a broken leg and ribs. His assistant Jeffrey Millea and comedian Ardley Fugua were also injured in the crash, and Fuqua remains hospitalized two months later. Disastrous: Morgan and some friends were returning from a stand-up gig in Delaware on June 7 when a WalMart truck slammed into their limousine-van on the New Jersey Turnpike, going 20 mph over the speed limit . Fatality: Morgan's close-friend and fellow-comedian James McNair - known as Jimmy Mack - was killed in the crash . Lawsuit: Morgan and the other passengers in the vehicle are now suing WalMart for their negligence in letting the truck driver work 13 hours straight. Above, a view of the beat-up limousine-van that was carrying Morgan and his friends . Morgan is still in rehab from the crash, and was pictured out last month moving around with the help of a walker going to a doctor's appointment in Midtown Manhattan with his fiancee Megan Wollover and their 1-year-old named Maven. He has since filed a lawsuit against WalMart for their negligence in letting truck-driver Roper operate one of their vehicles even though he had been up for nearly 25 hours at the time of the crash - a violation of New Jersey law. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving 65 mph in a 45 mph construction zone when he rammed into the vehicle carrying Morgan and friends. Fighting the charges: Truck-driver Kevin Roper, 35, has pleaded not guilty to charges of death by auto and assault by auto. Pictured above in Middlesex County Court on June 11, 2014 . He had also been on the job for more than 13 hours at the time, even though truck drivers are only allowed to work up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 spent behind the wheel. Roper's final destination that night was Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which Morelli says would have involved going over the legal limit. WalMart has issued a new statement to NBC, calling the crash a 'terrible tragedy'. 'We are cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation and working to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident,' the statement reads. But Morelli says he hasn't seen any 'full responsibility' yet, representing Morgan as well as Fuqua and Millea. If the . case goes to trial, Morelli says he will prove that it is the company . culture at WalMart that employees are pushed to work illegal hours. In . Roper case, Morelli says he had to commute more than 700 miles from his . home in Jonesboro, Georgia just to pick up his truck in Delaware and . continue working. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, also claims Roper fell asleep at the wheel. Morgan, Fuqua and Millea are asking for a trial by jury and compensatory damages. James McNair's adult children are considering suing the company and truck driver as well. Haven't stepped up: Morgan's attorney says WalMart has yet to take 'full responsibility' for the June 7 crash . Morgan is best known for playing the role of 'Tracy Jordan' on NBC show 30 Rock, and his time on Saturday Night Live . Roper is also facing criminal charges for the crash and has pleaded not guilty to charges of death by auto and assault by auto. Fellow-comedian Neal Brennan also gave an update on Morgan's condition when he appeared on 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' last week. 'From what I can tell, he is great,' Brennan said of Morgan. 'Physically, I don't know. He said he is going to rehab every day.' 'Mentally, he seems all there. Because we were talking, and he was like, ""Neal. I mean, the outpouring of love was unbelievable. I mean, the people that reached out to me: Busta Rhymes, LL Cool J, the president,""' Brennan said. 'The fact that Tracy put LL Cool J and Busta Rhymes above the president let's me know that Tracy is back.'

"A British backpacker allegedly set fire to a French tourist who had wrapped himself in toilet paper for a fancy-dress party in Sydney. The 31-year-old French man had turned up at a hostel in the guise of an Egyptian mummy. But the 30-year-old Briton, who has not been named, set the toilet paper alight resulting in the other man receiving serious burns, police say.

It was pretty frightening at the time.’ The alleged incident took place at a hostel in the popular Sydney resort of Manly (above, file picture) The British tourist, who is from Wales, later went to Manly police station and gave a statement before being charged with recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. Detective Inspector Graham Cope said the incident did not appear to be a malicious attack. ‘Setting fire was certainly a reckless act but probably this could best be described as a prank.’ The Welsh man has been granted bail to appear at Manly Local Court next month.","Victim, 31, needs skin grafts to his back, neck and arm .

"Franz Beckenbauer called for the corruption report on the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host contests to be published, and said Tuesday that he took no bribes before voting. The former Germany great left FIFA's executive committee months after the vote in December 2010 gave Russia the 2018 event and Qatar the 2022 tournament. Beckenbauer remains active in FIFA but was briefly banned in June by the ethics committee from all football-related activity for failing to cooperate with prosecutor Michael Garcia's corruption investigation. The suspension was lifted after Beckenbauer pledged to answer the questions put to him. Franz Beckenbauer (with Xavi Alonso) has added his voice to calls for FIFA to publish the Garcia report . Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as a player and coach with West Germany, refused to disclose who he voted for but maintained he was neither offered nor accepted any financial inducements or gifts. 'Nobody offered me anything in order to influence my vote. No. This did not happen,' Beckenbauer said through a translator in London. 'As far as the vote is concerned I can't say anything because it was a secret ballot and I have to observe this agreement made at the time.' Beckenbauer said he cannot understand why FIFA President Sepp Blatter wants Garcia's report to remain secret, echoing calls for its public release from current executives, including Michel Platini. 'Personally there's nothing to hide,' Beckenbauer, who is a special adviser to FIFA's football committee, said at the Security Sport conference. 'If you have nothing to hide you can publish and divulge it.' Sepp Blatter (right, with actor Gerard Depardieu) has faced increasing pressure to publish the findings . Despite the conference being staged by Qatar's International Centre for Sport Security, Beckenbauer questioned a key aspect of the Gulf nation's bid - the energy-intensive cooling technology to cope with the summer heat. Discussions between FIFA and Qatar organizers about shifting the World Cup dates are continuing, while the hosts maintain they can stage the event at any time in the year. 'I was surprised Qatar won,' Beckenbauer said. 'In the summer it's not possible to play football there despite the fact Qatar developed a system of cooling the stadiums in order to create more comfortable temperatures. 'Technically speaking it's possible, but is it necessary? It wastes a lot of energy ... my suggestion would be to play in the winter.'","Michael Garcia's report into World Cup vote corruption is believed to be more damning than expected .

"A 100ft-wide sinkhole that is so deep the bottom cannot be seen at one end has appeared overnight just yards from a farmer's house in County Durham. John Hensby, 71, says his partner Sam Hillyard, 39, first discovered the hole on Thursday morning, adding that it has been growing ever since. And  Mr Hensby now fears that heavy rain forecast for the coming days could be about to make the situation even worse. A 100ft-wide sinkhole appeared overnight on Wednesday in the Pennines and was first spotted by Sam Hillyard, 39, as she was walking her dogs the next day . Farmer John Hensby, 71 (pictured), says the hole is so deep you cannot see the bottom at one end and has been getting bigger every day . Mr Hensby fears that with heavy rain forecast for the coming days the land around the hole could collapse even further . Mr Hensby, 71, who lives in Cowshill, near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, said: 'I am not sure where this will end. 'The hole is still growing. It is astonishing. If you could have heard the bangs, crashes and rumbles when it first happened you would understand how terrifying it was. 'My partner Sam had been walking one of our dogs when she she found it on our land around 80 metres away from our house. 'The land is surrounded by a sheep farm and there are two or three around at the moment. If a sheep was to fall down the hole then that would be the end of it. It would be the same for our two dogs. You wouldn't be able to get to them or even see them.' Mr Hensby believes the collapse could be linked to 19th-century iron or lead mining in the area, though he has been unable to find evidence of a shaft that may have collapsed. The sinkhole appeared just 90 yards from Mr Hensby's farm in Cowshill, near Bishop Auckland in the Pennines . Mr Hensby believes the hole could have been caused by either an iron ore mine or a lead mine, both of which operated in the area in the 19th century . Mr Hensby also worries that his dogs or one of the sheep that graze in the surrounding pastures could fall into the hole, as he would be unable to get it out . While lead mining started in the Pennines around 2,000 years ago, commercial operations didn't start until the mid-1800s and continued until the early 1900s, starting up again for a few years during the First World War. Around this time the landscape was littered with chimneys and huge waterwheels that were used to sort useful ore from soil and other scrap, though only a few remain today. The mines also produced zinc ore, iron ores, and fluorite also known as fluorspar, though the areas is less well-known for these. Council workers have been to inspect the site, but are unsure what can be done to stop the hole getting bigger, as it has almost reached a public footpath . Mr Hensby, who lives with partner Sam, an academic at Durham University, added: 'From time to to time small holes do open up on our land, but we have never known them to be so big before. 'Some council experts came to inspect the hole yesterday but we are not sure what can be done. We are crossing our fingers it doesn't get much bigger, but it is approaching a public footpath now.' He added that he is working to increase the wild bird population on his land, and hopes that the sink hole will not have a negative impact.","Farmer John Hensby, 71, says his partner Sam Hillyard, 39, discovered the hole on Thursday morning .

"The haunting signs of lives once lived still echo from every room in this long-abandoned ramshackle ruin. Old Crow Cottage, a Grade II listed building, now stands eerily abandoned since 2009 - the clothes, pictures and other remnants from former inhabitants are untouched and lying under a thick layer of dust. New photographs from inside the dilapidated cottage, in Willersley, Herefordshire, reveal the eerie atmosphere within the building which would once have been a family home. Decrepit: Old Crow Cottage was abandoned since 2009 and has been left to rot ever since . Eerie: A coat lies on top of a pile of rubbish and fallen masonry in one of the haunting pictures taken inside one of the rooms . Timewarp: Little has changed inside the run-down 300-year-old Old Crow Cottage . Over the last few years, locals have even reported to have seen lights flickering inside the cottage, leading to rumours that the cottage might be haunted. The last occupant was killed in a car crash on the road outside the home. Urban explorer Dan Circa ventured inside after reading about its history online. Dan, 28, from Manchester says: 'The . cottage has been in the same family for many years and it looks like . each generation has filled the house with their possessions.' 'Inside, there was everything you would find in a family home - from old photographs and clothes to beds and clocks. 'The longer I was inside the cottage the atmosphere felt more and more oppressive.' Memories: The building which was a family home for many years still holds some of the trinkets and photographs collected by its former residents . Atmospheric: Old Crow Cottage is in a state of disrepair but any prospective buyer would have to overcome the haunting atmosphere within the building if they were to renovate it . Past: Old photographs left inside the abandoned 'Old Crow Cottage' hint at a bygone past when the building would have been a fine family home . The Old Crow Cottage can be found in historic records dating to as early as 17th century. It appears the building was a pub or inn under a series of difference names. But a local newspaper reports from 1841 show the occupant at the time was a Mr James Matthews. But the 1851 census the owner had changed to Thomas Phillpots and his family. Two years after the census, tragedy struck the Philpotts family with the death of their eldest son Thomas, aged 33, on 22 October 1853. Details of the occupants through much of the 19th century are sketchy. But the last person thought to have lived in the Old Crow Cottage was David Edward Penny, 72, who died on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2013, after his car collided with a lorry on the road outside the house. The crumbling cottage consists of seven rooms - one entirely burnt out from a fire and another completely collapsed. Upstairs . in one of the bedrooms, lay discarded clothes and empty shoe boxes - in . another hangs framed portraits of what could have been residents who . once inhabited the home. Newspaper editions from the 1960s lay strewn . across the burnt out floors offering a flashback to the past. Dan says: 'I'm not a huge believer in ghosts, but at one point a small ornament fell over, as if it was pushed quickly. 'The cottage really is on its last legs, very structurally unsafe and could fall any day now.' Built in the seventeenth century and originally named 'The Old Crow', the cottage has had many uses over the years. Initially, the cottage was part of a farm, and then the property became a pub called 'The Crow Inn'. Years later the pub was closed and the cottage turned into a mini brewery where beers and ciders were produced. More recently, the cottage provided a . backdrop to a horrific car accident that saw a 72-year-old man . tragically killed in October 2013. The victim of the crash is believed to be one of the cottage's last remaining residents named David Edward Penny. According . to local historical records, Mr Penny lived at the cottage with his two . brothers Philip and John, but has since lay abandoned. Dan says: 'I hope the cottage and the objects inside can be saved. 'The vast history is amazing and it should not be left to rot. 'I hope the current owner can fully restore it one day. 'The . main reason I started urban exploring is because I love to capture the . beauty that can be found in decaying buildings and objects inside.' Glimpse at a former life: Urban explorer Dan Circa ventured into the eerie interior of the old abandoned cottage to take a series of haunting images . Forgotten: The abandoned building would have once echoed to the sound of children laughing and playing with their toys - now unloved and gathering dust . Faith: A sign reading 'The Lord is my strength' still hangs above one of the beds inside the crumbling ruing of Old Crow Cottage . Abandoned: Old Crow Cottage in Willersley, Herefordshire, has been the scene of a number of tragedies during its 200 year history . Undergrowth: Ivy and other creepers have found a home amongst the detritus from former residents of Old Crow Cottage . Sings of those who once made a home in Old Crow Cottage still litter the interior - including cupboards full of cups and saucers . Ghostly: A dressing table, including a comb and mirror, have been left to gather dust in one of the bedrooms of Old Crow Cottage . Decoration: A few pictures cling to the flaking walls of Old Crow Cottage in Willersley, Herefordshire . Dated: Old moisturiser bottles left inside the abandoned 'Old Crow Cottage', in Willersley, Herefordshire, hark back to a bygone era . Echoes: Tucked amongst the cobwebs and dusty light bulbs is a portrait of a young boy who may once have played in the eerie corridors of the Old Crow Cottage . Inhospitable: Until just four years ago the Old Crow Cottage was a home to people but it has now been left to rot . Signs of life: Commemorative Royal mugs sit on the cupboard shelve behind a thin screen of cobwebs . A day in time: A local newspaper gives a snapshot of life inside the abandoned Old Crow Cottage, located in Willersley, Herefordshire . Revealing: Wedding and family photographs tell the story of those who once called the eerie and now abandoned Old Crow Cottage home . Recollection: An old Daily Express newspaper sits among a pile of old photographs and flaking interior inside the abandoned Old Crow Cottage, in Willersley, Herefordshire . Winston Churchill adorns the cover of The Sunday Times colour section in one of the many newspapers collected by the Old Crow Cottage's inhabitants . Anyone contemplating reviving The Old Crow's past as a guest house might be able to trade on its ghostly past. But it would have to some way to vying with The Ancient Ram Inn for the title of Britain’s most haunted B&B. The guesthouse, in the village of Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, is believed to be riddled with up to 20 spectres who torment the paying punters of the 12th century home. Built on an ancient pagan burial ground - and also believed to be the scene of child sacrifices and devil worship - the Cotswolds cottage is haunted by the likes of a murdered young girl called Rosie, a high priestess, and even a male sex demon, known as an incubus. The strange goings on include a blood-curdling child’s scream, ‘electrified’ wooden beams, and even the touch of an invisible force. Caroline Humphries, whose family has lived in the Ram Inn for nearly 50 years, said: 'My father won’t go anywhere without his Bible.' But despite its ghoulish reputation, Ms Humphries is inundated with visitors who are desperate to spend a night in Britain’s spookiest lodgings, which were built in 1145 and costs between £25 and £30 per night. Past guests have fled from the house in the middle of the night after claiming to have seen furniture flying around the bedrooms, visions of a little girl wandering the hallways, and have even been pushed down onto a bed by a randy incubus.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry attended a society wedding in Switzerland today. The young Royals looked relaxed and happy as they watched the ceremony in the upmarket resort of Arosa. They have been enjoying a mini-break at the resort as guests at the wedding of their polo-playing friend Mark Tomlinson to Olympic dressage gold medalist Laura Bechtolsheimer. Happy: Prince William, his pregnant wife Kate and Prince Harry attended the wedding of Mark Tomlinson and Laura Bechtolsheimer during a break at an upmarket ski resort in Switzerland . Thrilled: The Royal trio watched the happy couple from a staircase at the wedding in the Swiss resort of Arosa . Happy couple: As the second anniversary of their own wedding approaches, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watched friends tie the know in Switzerland, joined by William's brother Prince Harry, seen standing beside blossoming Kate as she holds a maternal hand to her baby bump . The trio all seemed to be enjoying the wedding as they chatted to guests. As the newly-married couple walked past them, an evidently delighted Kate threw a handful of confetti into the air. The Duchess of Cambridge, who beamed as she watched the newlyweds emerging into the bright Swiss sunshine after the ceremony, was elegant in a cream woollen coat over a floral dress, teamed with a chocolate brown pillbox hat and fur scarf. The Duchess had previously been pictured on the . slopes of the resort. Holding a wooden sledge and wearing sunglasses, the 31-year-old Duchess wore a brown snug jacket and warm looking boots. She was pictured next to a male friend looking relaxed and happy. The chocolate-box Alpine resort is known for being small and compact, with stunning views of the surrounding mountains. It is less well-known for its nightlife, being home to just a single . long-established disco bar - which may come as a disappointment to . party-loving Prince Harry. Snow white wedding: The royals' delight was evident as they sat in the congregation alongside other guests at the society wedding . Married: The bride, Laura Bechtolsheimer and her husband Polo player Mark Tomlinson leave the church in a horse-drawn carriage . With the world eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Royal baby, Kate has been getting plenty of opportunity to relax recently. Last month, Prince William and Kate enjoyed a break in a sumptuous villa on one of the most exclusive paradise islands in the world. The happy couple took a ‘babymoon’ break in a luxury £5 million house on Mustique. Nestled amid lush tropical gardens, . with dramatic views of the aquamarine Caribbean waters lapping a . tranquil white-sand beach, the five-bedroom house would normally have . cost about £19,000 a week to rent. It was not known whether the . multi-millionaire owners, who are close friends of both the Royal couple . and the wider Middleton family, charged them for the stay. The . dream home was furnished with Oriental antiques and came with a staff . of six servants, who oversee such amenities as a private cinema, gazebo . and 64 ft infinity pool. During the lavish trip, the Duchess was seen every day at the tennis courts on the privately owned island. Elegant: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen exchanging a smile with husband William, left, and chatting with the vicar, right, wore a cream coat over a patterned dress . Fun: Kate flung a handful of confetti into the air as the newlyweds walked past following the ceremony in a bright and sunny Switzerland on Saturday . Holding court: Prince Harry, Kate and Prince William chatted with other guests at the society wedding . Royal guest: Prince Harry attended the wedding alongside his brother Prince William and sister in law Kate . Winter white: Olympic gold medallist Laura Bechtolsheimer chose the idyllic surroundings of the Swiss Alpine resort for her wedding to Mark Tomlinson . However, she was cheering from the sidelines rather than playing, as she has done on previous trips. Arosa is known as being a small, smart resort with spectacular views of the surrounding mountains. The town is situated just two hours south of Zurich in the Graubünden mountains. It is set high above the treeline in a natural bowl and is both a summer and winter tourist resort.Despite the Royal trio all being advanced skiers, the remote Swiss town is known for suiting skiers of all abilities. It boasts more than 37 miles of slopes. Prince Harry may have been disappointed to learn that the resort is not big for its nightlife, although it does contain one long-established disco bar.Two lakes are also situated in the centre of the resort. ‘They’re having a very quiet, peaceful holiday, which is just what Kate needed,’ a long-time island resident said. ‘I’d heard they were planning to . leave on Thursday but that they are enjoying themselves so much, they . may stay until after Valentine’s Day.’ The . couple were joined by the Duchess’s sister Pippa, brother James and . parents, Carole and Michael. The Middletons rented accommodation nearby . to give the couple some privacy. Royal . links to Mustique go back to 1960, when Princess Margaret was given a . ten-acre estate there. The Queen and Prince Philip have also made . several visits to the island. An unprecedented veil of secrecy was drawn over William and Kate’s visit. One American businesswoman, who is a regular visitor to the island, said: ‘The owners are an absolutely lovely pair and their villa is stunning. ‘It is perfect for William and Kate because it is luxurious and secluded. It is just what they need before the fervour of a newborn baby. 'I imagine they are on their guard after Kate was photographed topless in France, but there is no chance of that happening in Mustique.’ The expectant couple's trip to Mustique earlier this year was their seventh visit to the paradise island. With its long stretches of white sand, palm trees and balmy temperatures, it is a world away from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's current location in a Swiss ski resort nestled in the snowy Graubünden mountains. But with Kate snug in a cream woollen coat and a smart chocolate brown hat, and husband William decked out in tails, the pair looked more than happy to be in attendance at their friends' nuptials, in spite of the the brisk temperatures. Focus of attention: Normally all eyes would be on the Duke and Duchess, but they were happy to stay in the background at their friends' wedding . Having fun: Prince William strikes a pose at the wedding, which was also attended by one of his ex girlfriends, Olivia Hunt (pictured right wearing a red coat) Standing out in a crowd: The Duchess of Cambridge looked beautiful as her face caught the sun in Switzerland . Expecting: The Duchess of Cambridge, who is expecting the royal couple's first child in July, waved and chatted to other guests and threw confetti at the ceremony . Break: Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate are currently enjoying a break at a plush ski resort in Switzerland. The couple are pictured skiing on a previous trip to Klosters .

"Jose Mourinho may insist Diego Costa can do 'almost nothing' between matches  but Chelsea's £32million striker is fighting fit to be unleashed on Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League.

I think players are getting in trouble and when I anticipate the next pre-season it will be even worse, because there will be international matches. ‘For a World Cup some teams don’t qualify; for the international fixtures, every player goes with his national team.

"A Colorado mother spent the night scared and ‘praying nothing would happen’ after she got a missed call from ‘Satan’. Jenn Vest was half asleep while breast-feeding her son when her phone rang from the number 1-666-666-666. After that call, she received 48 text messages from different numbers, all with only the single word ‘Satan’ in the messages. Scroll down for video... Freaky call: The Colorado woman got a missed call from the number, 116666660666 . 'Freaked out': Jenn Vest was half asleep on Monday night while breast-feeding her son when her phone rang from the number 1-666-666-666 which she says scared her so much she stayed awake all night . ‘It really freaked me out because I was half asleep feeding my son and it woke me up. She said she thought she might have been dreaming at first. 'Then I stayed up the rest of the night praying and hoping nothing would happen,’ Vest told KUSA TV. The woman said she tried calling the number back, only to get a recorded message saying the number was no longer in service. Bombardment from hell: Then Vest got 48 text messages in a row from different numbers all with the same message: 'SATAN' The phone number has been used to prank people in the past, sometimes with threatening messages telling people they were going to die. 'Yesterday I got a phone call and my mom answered it. It said ""Ian Folk (my name) has three days to live"". Of course my mom has been freaking out all day about it. i pushed last call on my phone and it says the number is 666-666-6666. I try to call it but it isn't a real number. it was pretty creepy,' says one person on a blog. Another person wrote: 'I just got a call from 666-666-6666 (which was creepy enough). An automated voice that sounded like the old Apple text to speech guy stammered sputnik at me for a bit then called me a f**kstick and told me to press 3 to remove myself from the calling list.' Vest said she did not know how someone had found her number but said she had recently hung up business flyers and thought that it could stem from them. According to one comment, there is nothing to be scared of and that it is an automated service people can use at the website, www.ospenterprises.com/phone/. People who want to play a prank of their friends can do it through that website, according to the comment.

"The alleged leader of the hacking group LulzSec, the collective which claimed responsibility for infiltrating the the CIA website, is being held by Australian police. The 24-year-old computer expert, who held a position of trust in the IT department of an international company, was arrested at work in Sydney last night. He has been charged with hacking offences that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years. Take him away boys: Australian Federal policemen arrest the man they say is the self-proclaimed leader of the international hacking group LulzSec, the group that claimed responsibility for shutting down the CIA website . Glen McEwen, head of cyber crime operations at Australian Federal Police, said the man's job gave him access to sensitive information from clients including government agencies. LulzSec, an offshoot of the better-known hacking collective Anonymous, has taken credit for hacking attacks on government and private sector websites. Those hit include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Nintendo. Anonymous - and LulzSec in particular - became notorious in late 2010 when they launched what they called the 'first cyber war' in retaliation for attempts to shut down the Wikileaks website. The name LulzSec is a combination of 'lulz', another way of writing 'lols' - an internet slang acronym standing for 'laugh out loud' - and security. A tweet by Anonymous Australia denied that the suspect was part of their network . Australian police said the unnamed Australian man, who is believed to have used the online moniker 'Aush0k', was known to international law authorities. However, a Twitter account claiming to represent Anonymous in Australia earlier today said the announcement by Australian Federal Police was 'bulls***'. For the lulz: The logo of hackers' collective LulzSec, a group which has claimed responsibility for cyber attacks on public and private organisations . Responding to tweets asking if the individual was known to the hacking collective, Anonymous Australia responded: 'Nope not part of the usual suspects on any of our chans of communication I suspect some DDos skid on his mums win (Windows) box.' Others on the social messaging site expressed doubt that groups like LulzSec have leaders in the sense claimed by Australian police. The arrest comes a week after an . American member of LulzSec, Cody Kretsinger, was convicted in a Los . Angeles court and sentenced to a year in prison followed by home . detention. Kretsinger, who used the online handle 'Recursion', pleaded guilty in a plea agreement with prosecutors. Court . documents in that case revealed that Anonymous leader 'Sabu', whose . real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, had provided the FBI with . information on fellow hackers after pleading guilty to hacking offences. The . Australian suspect has been charged with two counts of unauthorised . modification of data to cause impairment and one count of unauthorised . access to a restricted data system. The charges relate to an attack on an Australian government website earlier this month. Investigation: A forensics officer examines a computer while executing a search warrant following the arrest. Police said their suspect's job gave him access to sensitive information from clients including government agencies . Search: LulzSec, an offshoot of the better-known hacking collective Anonymous, has taken credit for hacking attacks on government and private sector websites . 'Let me make it extremely clear to everybody out there, this is not harmless fun, this is serious,' said Mr McEwen at a press conference. He said the man posted in online forums frequented by other members of LulzSec that he was the group's leader. 'There were no denials of his claims of being the leader,' said Mr McEwen. The man has been granted bail and will appear before a court next month. LulzSec allegedly broke into Australian government department and university websites in 2011. Anonymous last year took around 10 Australian government websites offline, protesting plans to force ISPs to store more user data and make it available to security services.","The 24-year-old computer expert was arrested at work near Sydney .

"Roberto Martinez insists he has had no falling out with defender Sylvain Distin. The Everton manager reportedly had a disagreement with the French defender following the Capital One Cup defeat by Swansea City last month and Distin was understood to have been given two weeks off as a result. The 36-year-old missed games against Liverpool, Krasnodar and Manchester United and Martinez admits the centre half was available for selection in the latter two games. Sylvain Distin is set to return for Everton against Aston Villa having been frozen out of the first-team . Distin was a regular last season but had replaced by John Stones until the youngster's injury . However, the long-term injury to John Stones means Distin is back in the fold to face Aston Villa this weekend and Martinez said: ‘You will always get rumours, but the reality was that he picked up a knock after the Swansea game and obviously at that period I considered it was right for him to have a bit of break and rejuvenate. ‘But sometimes he is such a professional he works too hard. He is someone who is not just happy with what he does with the team, he has his individual programmes and he works too much. ‘I felt that he needed a bit of a break but now he has come back refreshed and ready to fight for his place. Sylvain is training well and is fully refreshed and is ready to fight for his place. Roberto Martinez on Thursday insisted he has not fallen out with Distin despite dropping the defender . ‘Sylvain’s experience is quite unique and it’s a great sign to see him enjoying his football, enjoying his training and it’s a great opportunity to have him in the squad. It’s great to see him around the place with that energy and the desire to help the team.’ Martinez, who said Distin had suffered a dead leg in his right thigh against Swansea, added: ‘He could have played the last game against Manchester United and maybe Krasnodar, but the little knock that he had stopped him from being available for Liverpool and from that point on it was just making sure he could recover. ‘You need players fully fit and ready to perform and Sylvain is ready, he has been training really well the whole week. Distin celebrates Everton's second goal against Leicester on the opening day of the season . ‘I think every player wants to play and the moment you lose that desire you’re not going to last. As a player you want to play every minute and that’s how it should be.’ Ross Barkley is also nearing a return to full fitness but Martinez says that it’s too early to tell if he’ll be ready for Saturday’s game. ‘Sometimes you forget what a sensational footballer he is. It’s too early to tell if he’s going to be involved on Saturday but I don’t see him being to far away. ‘James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar are also very close. If it’s not the weekend I expect them to be available for the Europa League game.’ Influential midfielder James McCarthy is nearing a return to action for the Toffees .","Sylvain Distin has missed Everton's last three games .

"A film is to be made about former West Bromwich Albion and Real Madrid winger Laurie Cunningham, entitled the Black Flash. More than £1.6million has been raised to make a film about the former England international winger. Producers of the film issued a crowd-funding appeal to raise £1.4m and investors have helped them surpass that figure. A film about former England and Real Madrid winger Laurie Cunningham is to be made called Black Flash . Cunningham became the first British player to join Real when he signed from Albion in 1979 and was a member of what became known as the Three Degrees alongside team-mates Brendon Batson and Cyrille Regis. Cunningham died in a car crash in Madrid in 1989 aged 33. Film-makers Roker 37 said the film was set to be a drama 'about a tragic hero who was adored but misunderstood.' In a statement to potential funders, the company said: 'This film will tell the story of a shy dreamer blessed with breathtaking ability, who became an icon, if not a champion, and died tragically before his time. On the surface, Laurie was exuberant, he loved to dance, wore loud fashionable clothes and played with a mesmerising freedom and grace. Inside, though, he was quiet and complex and it is this dichotomy that will define his story.' Actor James Corden is said to have been approached to play the role of Ron Atkinson. Roker 37 produced and directed the documentary for ITV1 entitled Laurie Cunningham: First Amongst Equals. The film will be about ex-Real Madrid star Cunningham - 'a tragic hero who was adored but misunderstood' Cunningham pictured during his younger days with Leyton Orient, where he started his impressive career .","Laurie Cunningham film set to be made after £1.6million was raised .

"Daryl Clark took the plaudits as Castleford Tigers swept the board at Wednesday evening's Rugby League awards at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

Tigers lost in the Challenge Cup final against Leeds at Wembley and narrowly missed out on finishing top of the league for the first time in their 88-year history. Daryl Clark and girlfriend Leigh at the gala dinner at Old Trafford cricket ground on Wednesday night . However, the club's best-ever Super League season was recognised at a gala dinner with Daryl Powell also named Coach of the Year. Clark, 21, whose scintillating form has earned him a place in the England squad for the 2014 Four Nations Series, is only the third player in the 37-year history of the Man of Steel awards to claim both individual titles. Leeds hooker David Ward did the double in the inaugural season of 1977 and Widnes centre Joe Lydon emulated him in 1984. Clark, who is moving to Warrington in 2015, beat off competition from two former Man of Steel winners, Jamie Peacock (Leeds) and James Roby (St Helens), as well as Warrington's England prop Chris Hill to scoop the highly-prestigious award, which is given to the player judged to have made the biggest impact on the season. Daryl Powell (left) was named Coach of the Year and Clark was Young Player of the Year and Man of Steel . He was chosen after the results of a poll of every Super League player went in front of a specially-convened five-strong panel featuring a former Man of Steel and representatives from the players' union and the media. The award has been renamed in memory of Steve Prescott, one of rugby league's most respected players who passed away 11 months ago after a long and courageous battle against a rare form of stomach cancer. Clark got the nod for young player of the year ahead of Wigan centre Dan Sarginson and Leeds stand-off Liam Sutcliffe while Powell topped the poll of his fellow coaches. Roby received the hit-man award after making 1,054 tackles in Super League this year and Warrington full-back Matty Russell was the top metre maker with 3,546 metres. Castleford swept the board at Wednesday evening's Rugby League awards at Old Trafford Cricket Ground . Warrington winger Joel Monaghan received a prize for topping the try chart with 28 and St Helens goalkicker Luke Walsh was named top gun after enjoying a success rate of 78.57 per cent with the boot. Seven players were presented with awards to mark their retirement from Super League with more than 200 appearances. They were Matt Diskin (Bradford), Jon Clarke (Widnes), Richard Horne (Hull), David Hodgson (Hull KR), Willie Manu (St Helens), Martin Gleeson (Salford) and Francis Meli (Salford). Widnes were named club of the year and a foundation award went to Warrington while the annual Mike Gregory Spirit of RL Award was presented to Terry Flanagan, the former Oldham and Great Britain forward who has played a leading role in the foundation of the sport's charity Rugby League Cares.","Daryl Clark took the plaudits as Castleford Tigers claimed several awards .

"West Brom striker Saido Berahino is one player who won't have a problem representing the England Under 21s in a major tournament this summer - as a thank-you to the country that saved his life. The attitude of young players towards the national team has been thrown into the spotlight again this week with Roy Hodgson revealing that Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was ""reticent"" to play for the Under 21s, prompting a furious response from the team's former manager Stuart Pearce, who retorted: 'How the hell has he got a senior England call up then?' But Berahino, who has a great relationship with current Under 21s boss Gareth Southgate and is looking forward to the first leg of their European Championship play-off against Croatia at Molineux on Friday, says he has no hesitation joining up with the national team at any level. Saido Berahino (left) has been in sparkling form for West Brom this season . The young striker scored his fifth goal of the season for the Baggies from the penalty spot at Liverpool . Berahino is currently the leading English goalscorer in the Premier League with five goals and says he owes a debt to England for allowing him to escape a bloody civil war in Burundi and become a refugee at the age of 10. He said: 'The Under 21s is a massive thing for me. England as a country has given me a second chance in life,' he said. 'England has helped me and my family, we are living well now and we are in good health, living comfortably. So getting called up to play is a big honour for me.' While Berahino harbours hopes of joining up with Hodgson's senior squad at some stage this season, he doesn't look down on the under-age national teams. 'I still remember the first game I played for the Under 16s in the Victory Shield. It was just amazing and I couldn't believe I was there. A few years before that, I wasn't even thinking about playing in a professional team let alone getting called up by England. Saido Berahino claims he owes England for saving him from war-torn Burundi aged 10 . The West Brom youngster claims he would never turn down an international call after it emerged Jonjo Shelvey was 'reticent to join up with the Under 21s . But it hasn't done Shelvey much harm as he earned a recall to the England senior squad . The winners of the tie against Croatia will qualify for the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer. 'We have to win the game at Wolves on Friday and make sure we go to the European finals,' he said. 'I just hope I don't get any stick from Wolves fans as an Albion player! I hope the fans are behind us and give us the best support. We will need it against a good Croatia team.' Having come through a troubled time at Albion last season in which he was photographed inhaling laughing gas and was struck by a team-mate, Berahino says the influence of Southgate, as well as club manager Alan Irvine, has been vital to turn his career around.

Saido Berahino (left) celebrates his goal at Anfield with team-mate Graham Dorrans . The in-form forward praised the influence of bosses Alan Irvine (left) and Gareth Southgate . He said: 'Gareth Southgate has been brilliant. He is a great guy and easy to work with. You understand him and as soon you see him, you know what he wants. He stayed in touch with me last season and gave me some advice about when he was a youngster, what happened and how he handled certain stuff. 'It was great to see someone from the national team caring and give me a call. When I had problems, he kept in touch with me and when I did go and play for England, he always had time to sit down and have a chat. He understood and knew what was going on. 'He knew it was tough and what was happening. He was a big help.'","The West Brom youngster says he would never turn down an international call at any level .

"Neil Lennon was confirmed as the new manager of Championship strugglers Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. The former Celtic boss beat off fierce competition including former Parkhead idol Paolo di Canio and Chris Hughton to land the job at the Macron Stadium. Lennon was officially offered the post by chairman Phil Gartside on Sunday lunchtime and will be paraded at a media conference on Monday. Currently propping up the Championship after winning just one game all season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Dougie Freedman this month. New Bolton manager Neil Lennon with a club shirt at the Macron Stadium after his appointment . Lennon (right) formerly worked alongside Johan Mjallby at Celtic Park and the pair will now reunite at Bolton . Celtic: 2010-2014 . Games 228 . Wins 159 . Draws 30 . Losses 39 . Lennon has been out of the game since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell. Despite working as a TV pundit, he has never hidden his desire to return to the dugout as soon as the right job became available. Garry Parker and Johan Mjallby, his trusted lieutenants at Celtic Park, will now join him in the north west. It’s believed Lennon has signed a three-year deal with a further one-year option. A Bolton statement confirmed the 43-year-old’s appointment, saying: ‘The club are delighted and excited to appoint Neil Lennon. He brings with him experience at the highest level and an infectious enthusiasm to take the club forward. ‘He will officially take charge of the team from Monday morning in the run-up to our upcoming game away at Birmingham City.’ The former Celtic boss was unveiled as the new manager of the Championship club on Sunday . Former Celtic boss Lennon lifts the Scottish Premiership league trophy in May before later leaving the club . Lennon said: ‘There’s a good structure at the club. I know the stadium well and there are some good players at the club. ‘I have a big job on my hands to get Bolton up the table. The financial state of the club never came up. I will play a style of football that will please the Bolton fans.’ Lennon had been due to travel to Saudi Arabia last week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to go to Jeddah. Whilst a wage of more than £2million a year was attractive, Lennon had reservations about moving to the Middle East in terms of his career development. The challenge of securing Bolton’s place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing. Despite Bolton’s £168m debt — a legacy of their relegation from the Premier League two years ago — Lennon is enthused at the prospect of returning them to former glories. His name was under consideration at fellow Championship strugglers Fulham but, with caretaker Kit Symons steadying the ship at Craven Cottage, that door remained closed. Lennon’s four years in the Celtic hotseat brought three successive Scottish Premiership titles, two Scottish Cups and qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, that included a win over Spanish giants Barcelona. But Lennon will be hoping to do better than the two Celtic managers who preceded him who both ended up in the Championship without success. In 2010, Gordon Strachan resigned after less than a year at Middlesbrough with the club in 20th and Tony Mowbray was sacked by Boro in October 2013 with the team languishing in 16th.

The investigation has already led to the conviction of Singaporean fixer Chann Sankaran, businessman Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan and another former player, Michael Boateng, in June after they were found to have paid footballers to influence the outcome of matches so that others could profit through betting on the result. The trio were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery. Sankaran and Ganeshan were sentenced to five years in jail, while Boateng was jailed for 16 months.

"Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has advised Manchester United counterpart David de Gea to look upon the defensive upheaval at Manchester United as a challenge to improve his leadership skills. De Gea, regarded as one of the best shot-stoppers in the world, has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury, suspension and differing formations. Howard, 35, spent three seasons at United as a young goalkeeper and believes 23-year-old de Gea needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back-four. VIDEO Scroll down to watch De Gea get riled up by Sergio Ramos's 'Penenka' penalties . David de Gea (pictured) should learn a 'good lesson' from the current difficulties at Manchester United . Everton stopper Tim Howard (pictured) thinks De Gea can improve as a goalkeeper as a result of this season . Ahead of Everton's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday, Howard argued: 'It is easier when everything is settled in front of you, but for a goalkeeper it is part of the challenge when it's not. 'De Gea is still a young goalkeeper, even as talented as he is. If he can learn that, how to get your point across to different players and get them to respond to you very quickly, that will be a good lesson. 'You have to use a lot of body language, when the ball is out of play and there is a lull in the crowd, you try to make your point concisely. 'You talk to players in the dressing room before the game. You don't want to cloud their thoughts with too many things but you get a few points across to them. It is all a learning process. 'It feels like it was only in the last five years when I turned 30 that I started to really perfect things so it takes a while. But some guys do it quicker than others.' De Gea (centre) has conceded 13 goals in just seven games this season, including against West Ham United . American stopper Howard insists De Gea should embrace 'the challenge' he currently faces at United . Howard was part of Everton's seen that gained their first victory at Old Trafford in 17 years last season and quipped: 'We cracked it, so we want do it again.' And despite Everton currently lying 15th in the table with only one Premier League victory this season, the American regards Wayne Rooney's suspension for United as a big boost for his team. Howard will come up against world stars like Angel Di Maria, Robin van Persie and Falcao at Old Trafford but still thinks the absence of his former United team-mate Rooney is cause for optimism after the striker was sent off last weekend for kicking Stewart Downing against West Ham. 'It is great for us that Rooney won't be playing. Everyone has an opinion about him but as far as I am concerned, Wayne Rooney is a threat. He is a very dangerous threat. 'The more of those you can eliminate, the better. From his standpoint, it is disappointing he is suspended. But for us, it helps us. It is one less thing to worry about.' Howard, who has been at Everton seven years and equalled the club's European appearance record when he faced Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, is enjoying an extraordinary Indian summer to his career. Howard says it is 'great' Rooney will miss Man United's clash with Everton through suspension . His World Cup performances for the USA led to a phone call of congratulations from American President Barack Obama and a petition for airports to be named after him. There has been a minor backlash this season with Howard scrutinised for every goal conceded, particularly when Everton were surprisingly beaten at home by Crystal Palace. 'If I came back again as a footballer, I'd choose to be a number nine. You can miss five chances, score one goal, and you are a hero,' smiled Howard. 'Goalkeepers get caned all over the gaffe. Part of being a top goalkeeper is handling it. There are two goalkeepers in England at the moment (presumably Joe Hart and Simon Mignolet, though Howard declined to name them) who are getting crucified. It is a witch-hunt.' 'I have been at this a long time. The celebrity thing and all that nonsense happened and I was suddenly being invited to all these events and premieres. If it had happened to me as a young kid, it might have been different but I ended up declining most of them to stay at home with the family. I just doing the regular everyday stuff.'","Tim Howard thinks David de Gea can benefit from his side's poor defence .

"St George's flags were out in force from all around the country inside Tallinn's Le Coq Arena. Tamworth, Burnley, Stoke, Oxford, and Redditch were among the towns represented with many flags, like Blackpool FC, displaying the club name – emphasising you can support your club and country. Good also to hear shushing among the travelling fans before the Estonian national anthem was played, ensuring it was listened to with quiet respect rather than any jeers or catcalls from the away end. This was England's first qualifying game played on a Sunday since a 3-0 win in Moldova in September 1996. It was memorable for being Glenn Hoddle's first competitive game as England manager, and an international debut for David Beckham. Wonder what happened to him? England fans inside Tallinn's Le Coq Arena display their support for the national team, and their local clubs . Northerly Tallinn is more Scandinavia meets Eastern Europe than stereotypical old Iron Curtain. The atmosphere was joyful rather than aggressive and intimidating than in some former Russian Republics. The home supporters had their own brass band and big drum, though strangely their most popular chant 'Eesti, Eesti (Estonia)' initially sounded like 'Emile Hes-key' to untrained ears. Joe Hart is one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe but his achilles heel at the moment is his goal kicking. Managers from Fabio Capello onwards have noted it and it wasn't his greatest for distribution. One clearance for Callum Chambers ballooned into the air and gave the ball straight to Estonia – and it wasn't the only time. Roy Hodgson's England side entered the match top of Group E after beating San Marino on Thursday . ITV's England team Adrian Chiles, Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright were the victims of a 'humorous' German on their flight over to Tallinn after changing planes in Frankfurt. A member of the air crew grabbed the in-flight tannoy and said 'We'd like to welcome the English people on board who are going to the match in Estonia. But of course the result won't matter because in 2016 Germany will be champions.' They won't be able to say the same on the return flight with Germany beaten 2-0 in Poland on Saturday night. At 19, it is hard not to let your feelings show. Raheem Sterling appeared a bit grumpy as he warmed up with the other England substitutes before the game, after losing his starting place to Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana. A lively game of keepball among the subs ended with Sterling complaining and exchanging words with James Milner. The teenager then moved onto shooting practise – blasting the first shot wide and another over the bar after a member of the coaching staff got in his way. With Raheem Sterling left out of the side, Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana started against Estonia . England should probably be grateful that a lax bit of play from Fabian Delph in the opening minute led to a shooting chance for Sergei Zenjov rather than anyone deadly and in-form. The 25-year-old forward was signed by Blackpool manager Jose Riga in the summer but has failed to score so far in nine games for the Championship side. It's easy to forget how long Wayne Rooney has been around for. In England's last game against Estonia, a 3-0 win at Wembley in 2007, the Manchester United striker scored from Joe Cole's pass. He was the only survivor from that England side on the pitch and he played a captain's role in terms of effort and commitment. Pity his finishing wasn't of quite the same standard.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is preparing to make the first big call of the new season by leaving out England goalkeeper Joe Hart for Sunday's Community Shield clash against Arsenal. And there could be problems for another England star as Frank Lampard’s loan deal to City may be investigated by UEFA over financial fair play issues. Pellegrini, who won the title in his first season at City, wants to start with £6million summer signing Willy Caballero in goal at Wembley. Safe? Joe Hart has been warned that he faces a battle to keep his place in City's starting line-up . Sticks: Manuel Pellegrini has decided Caballero will play in the  Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley . Hart will be disappointed by his manager’s decision. The 27-year-old was dropped for two months last season after a costly mistake against Chelsea but bounced back well to reclaim his place and collect a second League title medal in three seasons. However, Pellegrini said he regarded both Hart and Caballero, 32, as first-choice goalkeepers after signing the Argentine from his former club Malaga. Although Hart is seen as one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe, Pellegrini admires Caballero’s kicking and ability to sense danger, which fits in with the defensive high line the manager wants his team to play. Hart joined City’s pre-season tour of America late after the World Cup, though he played well as a substitute against Liverpool in New York’s Yankee Stadium. New boy: Hart faces stiff competition from new Man City signing Willy Caballero . Pellegrini last night ducked questions about his No 1, saying: ‘Why are you interested in the goalkeeper? Why don’t you ask me about centre-halves?’ Meanwhile, UEFA are expected to ask to see the full documentary details of Lampard’s loan deal from City’s sister club New York City. The six-month arrangement was criticised last week by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a potential means for avoiding UEFA’s tough financial regulations, prompting City to respond by revealing that the Premier League club will be paying 100 per cent of Lampard’s wages while he is on loan there.

"Aston Villa’s comeback king Alan Hutton, one of the so-called ‘Bomb Squad’ of high-earners that owner Randy Lerner wanted out of Villa Park, has admitted he thought he would never play for the club again. Hutton, 29, was one of Villa’s stand-out performers in their impressive 1-0 win at Stoke City on Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround in his fortunes. The Scotland international has spent the last two seasons on loan at Nottingham Forest, Real Mallorca and Bolton Wanderers after manager Paul Lambert was ordered by Lerner to trim the wage bill by getting Hutton, Darren Bent, Stephen Ireland, Shay Given, Charles N’Zogbia and Barry Bannan out of the club. Back in business: Alan Hutton, playing his first Premier League match for 27 months, impressed in Aston Villa's 1-0 win at Stoke City on the opening day of the season . Perfect start: Andreas Weimann settled the contest at the Britannia Stadium . Comeback: Charles N'Zogbia, another member of the so-called 'bomb squad' of high owners Randy Lerner wanted out of the club, featured against Stoke . Andreas Weimann’s winner means he has already equalled the tally of goals he scored outside Villa Park last season. His only away strike in 2013-14 came in a 2-2 draw against Liverpool last season. But with the American now wanting to sell the club, there has been a U-turn in policy and Hutton and N’Zogbia played at The Britannia with Given on the bench. It was full-back Hutton’s first Premier League game for 27 months and he picked up a customary yellow card, for time-wasting rather than his trademark thumping tackle, as if he’d never been away. ‘It was a second debut for me. It was unbelievable to go away to Stoke and get the three points. Brilliant,’ he said. ‘To be honest, I didn’t see this happening. All I did was try to work hard and hope the chance would come. ‘I’ve been on loan to Spain and the Championship — that was down to wanting to play football. I’m not one of those players who is just happy sitting there. ‘Any opportunity I had to go and play, I was going to take it.’ Push on: Villa manager Paul Lambert issues instructions to Hutton during the match described by the player as a 'second debut' after so long away from the team . Spanish move: Hutton (left) spent a spell on loan at Real Mallorca last year . Villa’s struggles over the past couple of seasons persuaded Lerner to let his manager pick the most expensive players in his squad again — including those he previously wanted bombed out because they had been signed during the Martin O’Neill and Alec McLeish years he has come to regret. After Andreas Weimann’s 50th-minute winner, cheered from sidelines by Lambert’s famous new No 2 Roy Keane, the manager tried to explain Hutton’s long absence. ‘Everybody knew the finances were spiralling and we had to draw a line under it,’ he said. ’It was the case with Alan and a few of the lads. ‘But we move and if they (Hutton and N’Zogbia) keep playing like that, they will be fine. ‘Alan was outstanding, I thought the whole back four were. He has always been a really top pro. Even when he was out of the side there were never any cross words or anything.’ Villa’s deserved opening-day win matched their success at Arsenal a year ago. On that occasion, the promise evaporated quickly but this time Hutton believes it will be different particularly with star striker Christian Benteke due to return from an achilles injury in October and Colombian international Carlos Sanchez signing last week from Elche. Winning start: Lambert with assistant Roy Keane in the dug-out at the Britannia Stadium . Exciting signing: Lambert is pleased to have Colombian international Carlos Sanchez on board . ‘It’s a clean slate for everybody,’ said the right-back. ‘Everybody is being given a go and everybody has worked really hard over the pre-season. ‘I think people will be quietly surprised. They shot us down every early but you’ve seen us here and we did well going forward and at the back.’ Stoke’s optimism after signing six new players including Barcelona’s Bojan Krkic was pricked by being second-best to Villa. In the end, they were forced to send on Peter Crouch and resort to route one to try and grab an equaliser. Manager Mark Hughes, who incurred a glare from his former United team-mate Keane when he expressed his displeasure about Villa time-wasting, hopes the loan signing of Victor Moses from Chelsea on Saturday will help his team recover. Quiet debut: Stoke's new signing from Barcelona Bojan Krkic wasn't able to impact on the game . Plan B: In the end, Stoke brought on Peter Crouch in their search for an equalising goal . Stoke moved for the left-sided Moses after failing to agree personal terms with Liverpool’s Oussama Assaidi and Hughes said: ‘We’re pleased we’ve been able to bring him in. That’s probably all our business done now. ‘We feel he’s a player who can give us pace and power which we probably lacked a bit on Saturday. He’s a young man who obviously hasn’t played a great deal over the last couple of years. ‘He wants to play games and that’s the opportunity he will get here.’ Hughes’ top priority in the coming weeks will be how to get the best out of Bojan who found his opening Premier League game a culture shock and contributed little after an early turn and shot which hit the side-netting.","Hutton was one of six players branded the 'bomb squad' by Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner because they earned too much money .

"Louis van Gaal has hinted he would like to add Angel Di Maria and Daley Blind to his Manchester United squad ahead of the new campaign. The Dutchman is looking for the perfect players to fit into the attack-minded 3-5-2 formation he intends to deploy in the Barclays Premier League this season. And he suggested the Real Madrid winger and the Ajax wing-back could follow Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera in joining United before the end of the transfer window. VIDEO Scroll down for Daley Blind features in Ajax 4-1 victory over Vitesse Arnhem . CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW! There’s £60,000 in prizes including £1,000 up for grabs EVERY WEEK… . Wanted man: Louis van Gaal has dropped a strong hint that Manchester United would like to sign Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria as he searches for the ideal wide players to fit into his trademark 3-5-2 formation . Dutch delight: Van Gaal is also keen to bring the Ajax wing-back Daley Blind to Old Trafford. The player is very familiar with Van Gaal's formation after playing under him for Holland at the World Cup (pictured) Shortlist: Van Gaal is likely to make more additions to his Manchester United squad before the end of the month . In an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, Van Gaal said: 'You cannot compare how the players will do under the guidance of Moyes with those same players under the guidance of Louis van Gaal. 'Every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics. 'Now we have five No 9s and four No 10s and we don't have wingers to play attacking width, not at the highest level, of Ronaldo or Di Maria or something like that. So I have to play also in another way and you have seen that. 'It's a strategy of Manchester United to buy players who are on the way up and getting better, but I only buy when I think we need to.' Di Maria has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for some time but United may have to part with as much as £55m to sign him. Hot property: Di Maria, seen here playing against Manchester United in the Champions League in 2013, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford for some time but could cost as much as £55m . Getting stuck in: Blind challenges Gareth Barry of Manchester City during a Champions League tie. He has won four league titles at Ajax as well as helping Holland to third place at the World Cup . Though Blind is not explicitly mentioned, Van Gaal knows all about his qualities from his time as Holland coach and the player is certainly 'on the way up and getting better.' Van Gaal also said: 'If they are at the level I want them to be, then I will sign Dutch players. 'Dutch players are usually cheaper than players of other nationalities and they have usually been very well educated in the Netherlands, I believe.' Blind has a price tag of around £15m but Van Gaal has been told money is no object as he rebuilds United after a traumatic season under David Moyes. Different proposition: Van Gaal already seems to have got the best out of a squad that flopped under the leadership of David Moyes . Putting down a marker: Darren Fletcher and Wayne Rooney lift the International Champions Cup in Miami after beating old rivals Liverpool 3-1 in the final . His comments about Moyes suggest he will get more from the existing squad than his predecessor and this has been evident already in United's pre-season results. They won all five matches on their tour of the United States, lifting the International Champions Cup by beating Liverpool 3-1 in the final. Van Gaal has given every member of the squad a fair chance to show what they can do and most have responded with better performances than last season. They will have a final chance to impress when United host Valencia on Tuesday night before they kick off the new campaign at home to Swansea on Saturday.","Manchester United manager hints that he needs players to offer width .

"Aston Villa’s missing fans will need a little more convincing before they start queuing around the block for season tickets despite an impressive late cameo from teenager Jack Grealish. Paul Lambert’s men showed enough huff and puff against Parma on their first appearance at Villa Park this pre-season but rarely looked like breaking down the disciplined Italians until injury time when Darren Bent hit the crossbar. It has been a frustrating build-up to the campaign for Villa who had lost two of their previous three friendlies against Chesterfield and Groningen. New beginnings: Roy Keane is working alongside Paul Lambert as the club's new assistant manager . Mr Reliable: Brad Guzan was Villa's stand-out player last season with a series of outstanding displays . On the move: Fabian Delph will be looking to build on an encouraging season last term . There were encouraging displays from youngster Grealish, and Charles N’Zogbia and Alan Hutton who hardly got a kick for Villa last season due to injury and loan spells. But with Christian Benteke still on the treatment table, a lack of firepower will worry Lambert and his assistant Roy Keane. Season ticket sales are substantially down from last season’s figure of 28,000 and Holte Enders may want to see how the team perform in their first Premier League game at Stoke next weekend before deciding whether to commit for the campaign. Villa’s first home game in the league is against Newcastle United on August 23. Parma’s best-known player to English fans was Gabriel Paletta, who used to play for Liverpool and was part of Italy’s World Cup squad in Brazil this summer. The visitors certainly gave a decent demonstration of the Italian art of defending and Villa were restricted to half-chances for Andreas Weimann and Fabian Delph in a poor opening 45 minutes. Villa tried to introduce more zip in the second period. Weimann was foiled by goalkeeper Antonio Mirante and Kieran Richardson had an effort land on the roof of the net. Forgotten man: Alan Hutton may yet turn his Aston Villa career around under Paul Lambert . Back on track? Bent and Senderos could become  key players for Villa this season . The arrival of substitute Bent after 64 minutes reminded Villa fans they do have a proven goalscorer on their books but the question is whether he still remains potent at the age of 30. At the other end of the age scale, 18-year-old Grealish showed promise of a brighter future for the long-suffering Claret and Blues. One strong run after 75 minutes had the Parma defence backtracking. Perhaps the youngster should have taken a shot but he unselfishly laid a pass off to fellow substitute Leandro Bacuna, who took a heavy first touch to waste the opening. Encouraged, Bent made a sharp into the penalty area but captain Gaby Agbonlahor placed his cross too close to the defence and the ball never arrived. Karim El Ahmadi showed ambition with a late long-range shot then Bent hit the crossbar from a pull-back by Grealish. It was close, but not close enough. Villa must hope that is not going to be the story of their season. Elsewhere, Ron Vlaar came on as a late substitute for the home side as he made his first appearance since the World Cup.","Villa could only manage a goalless draw against Parma .

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has said Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman has behaved in an unacceptable manner by trying to unsettle his Dutch World Cup semi-final defender Ron Vlaar. Vlaar came through his first pre-season friendly by playing the second 45 minutes in yesterday’s 0-0 draw with Parma after taking a break after his impressive tournament displays in Brazil. Lambert is keen to open talks with the 29-year-old centre-half once the transfer window shuts but has been appalled by Koeman saying publicly Vlaar ‘would definitely be an option’ for Southampton after selling Dejan Lovren to Liverpool. Hot property: Ron Vlaar 'would definitely be an option' for Southampton but Villa want him to stay . Spat: The season hasn't even begun and Paul Lambert is already kicking off with Ronald Koeman . Koeman used to manage Vlaar at Dutch club Feyenoord but Lambert hit out at his comments saying; ‘There is been absolutely no enquiry, not one iota on it. The only thing I am disappointed in is people talking about him, who should know better than to talk about other people’s players. ‘I don’t think you accept it. I think out of respect you don’t do it, you don’t get involved in that. That is my opinion. You will have to ask others what they think but I am just giving my opinion.’ Vlaar’s appearance gave Villa fans a welcome boost and Lambert expects him to be at the club come September 1. ‘He’s only been back in training over a week really. For him to play against Parma was good, he was able to cruise the game so it wasn’t too much of a strain for him. ‘He (Vlaar) had a great World Cup. In the games he had, he was excellent, up against quality players in every one of them. I am expecting Ron to have a good season.’ Vlaar only has a year left on his contract but Lambert hopes formal talks will start soon. ‘Ron has been really good about it, he’s never really pushed anything. Once it settles down, I am pretty sure we will talk.’ Impressive: Vlaar (right) was part of a solid Dutch defence at the World Cup and has attracted interest . Villa need a tight defence this season because on yesterday’s evidence, they lack firepower going into the new campaign. After recent defeats against Chesterfield and Groningen, a dour draw with Parma was an improvement with the mean Italians marshalled by ex-Liverpool World Cup defender Gabriel Paletta. Even so, there was little to get Villa fans queuing around the block for season tickets with current sales well down on the 28,000 of last season. Things only livened up at the end when 18-year-old Jack Grealish came on and started running the show. It was lay-back for Darren Bent that produced the best chance in injury-time but Bent hit the crossbar from close-range. ‘I will be disappointed if he (Grealish) isn’t pushing for a place this season,’ said Lambert, once a top midfield player himself.

"Manchester United teenager James Wilson reminded Louis van Gaal of his huge potential by hitting all four goals in a 4-1 win over rivals Manchester City in the Manchester Senior Cup Final on Thursday night. Wilson scored twice on his Premier League debut against Hull City last season under interim manager Ryan Giggs but wasn't taken by Van Gaal on the club's recent pre-season tour of America. But in front of watching City manager Manuel Pellegrini, Wilson turned the Senior Cup final in Hyde on its head with clinical finishing in each half after United had fallen behind.

Four-midable talent: James Wilson was the hero for United, scoring four times after City went ahead . Fiery encounter: Typically considering the two teams playing, there were some enthusiastic challenges . Bright start: Jordi Hiwula, centre right, leaps on Devante Cole, right, after the latter set him up to score for City . Surging ahead: City's lead did not last long though, as United, and Wilson in particular, ran riot after the break . Shielding the ball: Andreas Pereira of United tries to steal the ball from City midfielder Pablo Maffeo .

Attendance: 3,261. Patrick Vieira's City youngsters took the lead in front of an impressive crowd of 3,261 when Andy Cole's son Devante set up Jordi Hiwula to score. But after that it was the Wilson show. He levelled on the stroke of half-time and then twice breached the City defence to score early in the second half . His first dunked a finish past goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of former Norwich City No 1 Bryan, and then side footed for his hat-trick. He added a fourth late on. Wilson, 18, is tipped to be the next United youngster after Adnan Januzaj to emerge from the club's famed youth ranks and follow in the footsteps of The Busby Babes and Class of '92. Van Gaal will probably consider sending Wilson on loan to The Championship or League One to gain competitive first-team experience.

"Imagine it’s August 7 and your season is already over. That is how Celtic fans felt on Thursday morning after their team’s humiliating exit from the Champions League at the first hurdle, against the far-from-mighty Legia Warsaw of Poland. All that lies ahead now is nine months of a Scottish Premier League title procession with Rangers, Hearts and Hibs not even in the top division. A Europa League campaign is still an outside possibility but judging by their 6-1 aggregate defeat against Legia, winning their play-off round later this month looks unlikely, particularly as they are certain to now lose some of their better players. VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants to build a new team . Down and out: Celtic lost 6-1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw in their Champions League qualification tie . On the move? England international Fraser Forster is a target for Southampton . England World Cup goalkeeper Fraser Forster is wanted by Southampton and Celtic are in no position to turn down an £6million transfer fee given that they won’t be making any of the £30million on offer in the Champions League. Highly-rated Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk could follow him to the south coast to link up with compatriot Ronald Koeman, now in charge at St Mary’s. Nigerian defender Efe Ambrose has been linked with Premier League new boys Burnley. Kris Commons, 30, is in the final year of his contract. Lonely figure: Celtic new boss Ronny Delia is under pressure following Celtic's Champions League exit . Left behind will be the club’s new Norwegian manager Ronny Deila – but for how long? It’s true that Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon also suffered Champions League disaster in their first seasons but they both had credit in the bank; Strachan as an experienced manager and Lennon a Celtic legend as a player. Deila has neither in his favour and looks out of his depth having spent the rest of his career in Scandinavia. It’s a sad sign of the times that the club who once employed Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill wouldn’t even be looked at twice by someone like former player David Moyes who is out of work after getting sacked by Manchester United. Despite a worldwide fan base and the potential to fill Celtic Park to its 60,000 capacity every week, there just isn’t enough money in the Scottish game presently to attract B-list players and managers, let alone the elite. Tactical guru: Legia  boss Henning Berg plotted a successful masterplan to beat Celtic over the two legs . The manner of defeat to Legia was a shock. Celtic had appeared in the last two group stages of the Champions League but were second best all over the park against the Polish team. Their manager Henning Berg was sacked by Blackburn Rovers after 57 days last year but had no difficulty plotting a tactical plan that was far too good for Celtic. Deila is in a no-win situation now. Win the league by 15 points and people will say it was expected. Lose his best players and see Aberdeen and Dundee United close the gap, and fans will blame the manager. Too good: Legia Warsaw won the second leg 2-0 at Murrayfield on Wednesday . Celtic legends from better eras in the club’s history have differing views. Striker Frank McAvennie believes Deila was the easy appointment for chief executive Peter Lawwell because he could be easily controlled. Deila is only 38 and was happy for the club to appoint his assistant, John Collins. ‘I hope he (Deila) is not the puppet some people say he is but I fear he might be. What gaffer comes in and is told who his right-hand man will be?’ said McAvennie, who keeps his finger on the pulse of fans’ feelings in Glasgow as a pundit on Radio Clyde. John Hartson, who played in a European final for Celtic against Jose Mourinho’s Porto in 2003, thinks Deila has to be more aggressive in his dealings with the board to guarantee investment in the squad. Demanding: Celtic legend John Hartson (left) says Delia must ask the board to invest in his squad . He tweeted: ‘RD must now show why Celtic appointed him.. How will he react the pressure will be building rapidly. He needs players. Knock the door down!!’ It used to be a favourite guessing game where Celtic and Rangers would finish in the Premier League. The truth is Celtic are now Championship-standard, Rangers below that after their spectacular fall from grace. Celtic’s European exit didn’t even take place at their own stadium. They used Murrayfield due to Parkhead being used in the Commonwealth. The club will soon be able to return to their home venue – but the deeper-lying questions will remain.

"Manchester United will not attempt to cash in on any of their first four blank Champions League weeks following discussions between manager Louis van Gaal and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Van Gaal has asked for and received a 10-week amnesty in which he can train with his players without the distractions of money-spinning friendlies to make up the financial shortfall caused by Manchester United’s failure to qualify for Europe. After that the 62-year-old Dutchman has agreed to sit down with Woodward again to assess the situation. Amnesty: Louis van Gaal has been promised 10 weeks with his players to train them up to his tactics . Demands: Van Gaal (right) wants time to get his squad to adapt to his tactical ideas across to his squad . The Dutchman said: ‘I need preparation of 10 weeks and I am lucky Manchester United are not playing in a European competition to do this,’ he said. ‘We have discussed the issue of friendly matches and for the first 10 weeks, we have to train. After that it is different and we will wait to see if we have a chance to play some matches. ‘It will also depends on the opponent. It has to be a good opponent like this tournament in America.’ The compromise with Woodward has been reached after van Gaal complained that United’s current 13,500-mile pre-season tour of America had hampered his plans. To stress his displeasure, he said: ‘Manchester United shall do everything to adapt to my rules for good preparation.’ The Dutchman has spent his first fortnight in the USA working on tactical issues with his players and will do the bulk of the fitness work when they return to England this week. Money: United will miss out on playing lucrative friendlies until at least December at Van Gaal's request . But he has now won a guarantee from Woodward that the club will not seek friendly games, in which they could earn several million pounds per game, when other clubs are playing Champions League fixtures in September, October and early-November. However, it does raise the prospect of United jetting abroad in December when the final group games are played in the Champions League or when the competition returns at the knockout stage in the spring, possibly against other leading clubs who are out of Europe. Van Gaal believes the tactical understanding his players have in his methods is the key to whether United can reclaim a top-four place after finishing seventh last season. ‘You cannot compare players under the guidance of Moyes with those same players under the guidance of Louis van Gaal,’ he said. ‘Every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics, so it is impossible to compare. I have to see for myself what those players are capable of before I can make any judgement - and two weeks is too short to say.’ Victory: United beat Real Madrid 3-1 in America as they continued their 100% record under Van Gaal .
