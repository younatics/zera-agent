The average Briton only feels 100 per cent fit and healthy for 61 days of the year, it emerged yesterday. For the rest of the time they are soldiering through four colds, one dose of flu, five cricked necks along with numerous other illnesses. It means most of us operate at well below our best for almost ten months of the year. A study found we suffer one bout of flu and four colds on average per year . The study of 2,000 people found one in four is permanently hampered by at least one ailment or injury which has not been resolved. Worryingly, the research, commissioned by Spire Bristol Hospital, also found the average Brits feels 'run down' on at least two days every week. Hospital director Rob Anderson said: 'It's surprising to see just how little of the year people consider themselves fully fit. 'If someone is plagued by a repeated problem they should talk to a healthcare professional to identify if it might be a symptom of something more serious. 'While people often like to see themselves as good at enduring pain and adopt a 'grin and bear it' approach, it's important to recognise what's easily treatable and can relieve us from a lot of unnecessary suffering day to day. 'Often small changes can make a huge difference to how healthy we feel - making sure you get enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, taking exercise. Cutting down on alcohol can reduce illness and increase energy levels, but sometimes only medical treatment will do.' 5 x cramps . 1 x fainting . 2 x pulled muscles . 5 x cricked or sore neck . 1 x nosebleed . 2 x ear ache . 1 x eye infection . 2 x stitch . 2 x toothache . 2 x stubbed toe . 3 x biting tongue . 1 x verucas . 1 x lost voice . 2 x blisters . 4 x sore throat . 4 x cold . 2 x mouth ulcer . 2 x cold sores . 1 x flu . The study also found the average person experiences eight bouts of illness a year - from coughs, colds and sore throats to the more debilitating sick bugs, flu and viruses, which leave us at full fitness for less than one fifth of the year. One in four get regular headaches and one tenth are regularly in pain from an old sports-related injury. Forty per cent are plagued by repeated colds and one in three struggles to shake repeated sore throats. Four in ten people are forced to endure back pain, while two ear infections and five bouts of heartburn also weigh heavily on the average person each year. Meanwhile we can expect one eye infection, wake up five times with a sore or cricked neck and will even bite our tongue three times in the average year. While stubbed toes, toothache and mouth ulcers make the list of ailments we experience each and every year on top of the coughs, colds and long-term injuries that leave us feeling at our best for just 61 days of the year. Unsurprisingly you are likely to feel your worst at 11.35am on a Monday and hit your healthiest point at Saturday lunchtime. But some don't even get that - a quarter say they permanently have at least one source of pain that hampers them day to day. Rob Anderson added: 'Anyone suffering from regular problems should visit their GP for a check-up. It's important to take health seriously and not ignore warning signs.'","Average Briton feels 'run down' on at least two days each week, finds survey .

The heartbroken mother a 13-month-old baby shot in its stroller says she will always wonder what her son's first words would have been. Sherry West is mourning the murder of her Antonio Santiago, who died of a gunshot to the head last Thursday after a botched robbery by two teenagers while West was out for a walk in the historic city of Brunswick, Georgia. De'Marquis Elkins, 17, is . charged as an adult with first-degree murder, along with a 14-year-old . who was not identified because he is a juvenile, Police Chief Tobe Green . said. Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother . Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday . West recounted the attack: 'He asked me for money and I said I didn't have it . 'When you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They're expensive. And he kept asking and I just said ""I don't have it."" And he said, ""Do you want me to kill your baby?"" And I said, ""No, don't kill my baby!""' Authorities said one of the teens fired four shots, grazing West's ear and striking her in the leg, before he walked around to the stroller and shot the baby in the face. West said her son was walking well on his own and eight of his teeth had come in. But she also mourned the milestones that will never come, like Antonio's first day at school. 'I'm always going to wonder what his first word would be,' West said. Tragedy: Little Antonio Santiago's stroller stands empty after the 13-month-old was shot in the head during a botched robbery .

Luis Santiago, the boy's father, said he must take comfort in his faith that his in a better place. 'He's all right,' Santiago told the boy's mother, trying to smile. 'He's potty training upstairs in heaven.' West said she took one look at a teenage suspect's jailhouse mugshot Saturday and said he was definitely the killer. Yet an aunt of the teen said he was eating breakfast with her when the slaying took place. Despite the conflicting stories, police have charged 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins with murder, along with a 14-year-old suspect whose name has been withheld because he's a juvenile. Brunswick police spokesman Todd Rhodes said even though Elkins' aunt provided an alibi, authorities have good reason to bring the charges. Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money . ""That's what she's saying, but the evidence we're looking at says something else,"" Rhodes said, though he would not elaborate.

Two teddy bears, a vase of flowers and a decorative cross had been left Saturday against a wooden fence near the shooting scene. Katrina Freeman said Saturday the . shooter can't be her nephew, Elkins, because he showed up at her house . Thursday at 8:15 a.m. - roughly an hour before the killing. She said she . cooked eggs, grits and sausage for breakfast and that Elkins . accompanied her and her children to run errands when they left at about . 11:30 a.m. ""He was with us the whole time,"" said . Freeman, adding that she gave police the same account of her nephew's . whereabouts. ""There is no doubt in my mind that he is innocent.""

At her apartment Saturday, West had . filled several bags with her son's clothes and diapers to donate to . charity. She said she hopes prosecutors pursue the death penalty in the . case. ""My baby will never be back again,"" West said, sobbing. ""He took an innocent life. I want his life, too."" In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was . stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the . stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges. In Georgia, police said they are still searching for the gun. No eyewitnesses have come forward. In the 911 recordings, two callers . said they heard gunshots and then saw West take her son out of his . stroller, lay him on the ground and try to revive him using CPR. ""Yes, I heard the shots.

Teenagers living in the north of England are among the heaviest underage drinkers in Europe, according to a study of 26 European cities. The extensive EU survey found Merseyside had the highest proportion of heavy drinkers, with 55 per cent of 14 to 16 year-olds downing large amounts of alcohol. Greater Manchester wasn't far behind with half of those surveyed labelled binge-drinkers. This compared to a European average of 33 per cent, while the lowest rate was 16 per cent recorded in Tetova, Albania. The rate of youths drinking before the age of 13 was 61 per cent in the two English cities. However, while a number of cities had higher levels such as Bordeaux in France (68%) and Bratislava in Slovakia (62%) they did not have similarly high levels of heavy youth drinking. Just 39 per cent of youth in Bordeaux and 28 per cent in Bratislava were classed as heavy drinkers. It wasn't all bad news for Manchester though: Mancunians ate . considerably more fruit and vegetables than the average Euro-26 city; . they had more green spaces to enjoy, and ate breakfast more frequently . than their European counterparts. Meanwhile Liverpudlians smoked less than the . European average. The survey, which compared health, life expectancy and lifestyles, included five British urban centres in total. Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow were the other cities analysed. Death from respiratory disease in Birmingham was substantially higher . than the Euro-26 average, although the incidence of male cancers was . significantly lower. Heavy drinking and smoking among young Brummies was . also well below the average. In Cardiff, male cancers and deaths among women from circulatory diseases were much lower than in the other European cities studied, but depression and anxiety among adults in the Welsh capital, as well as binge drinking, were higher than the average. Mortality from cancers and respiratory diseases were seen as key concerns in Scotland's largest conurbation, but drinking and smoking among young Glaswegians was on par with the average. The pan-European study, led in the UK by the Universities of Manchester . and Liverpool, identified key priority areas for each city studied that . the researchers hope policymakers will address. Youth health status for Merseyside: The area had the highest rate of heavy episodic drinking, as well as regular tooth brushing . Project coordinator Dr Arpana Verma, from The University of Manchester, . said: 'The gap between the rich and poor living in urban areas across . the world is widening. The urban poor are now worse off than the rural . poor. 'Health inequalities are a greater issue than ever before and it's . becoming increasingly important for policymakers to take the valuable . information that we have to offer and translate into policies that can . help improve our health.

Cutting back on the amount of red meat people eat would reduce the risk of chronic disease and also slash Britain’s carbon footprint, according to a study. Reducing red and processed meat consumption would not only prompt a fall in chronic disease incidence of between three per cent and 12 per cent in the UK, but our carbon footprint would shrink by 28 million tonnes a year, researchers said. Food and drink account for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions attributable to British consumers, with livestock farming accounting for around half of the proportion, owing to the large quantity of cereals and soy imported for animal feed. Benefits: Reducing red and processed meat consumption would prompt a fall in chronic disease incidence of between 3 per cent and 12 per cent in Britain . Even when imported foods are taken out of the equation, the Government’s 2050 target for an 80 per cent cut in the UK’s carbon footprint will be 'unattainable' without a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming, say the researchers, citing the Committee on Climate Change. Previously published evidence shows that the risks of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and bowel cancer rise by 42 per cent, 19 per cent, and 18 per cent respectively, with every additional 50 grams of red and processed meat eaten daily. The researchers used responses to the 2000-2001 British National Diet and Nutrition Survey to estimate red and processed meat intake across the UK population and published data from life cycle analyses to quantify average greenhouse gas emissions for 45 different food categories. They then devised a feasible 'counter-factual' alternative, based on a doubling of the proportion of survey respondents who said they were vegetarian - to 4.7 per cent of men and 12.3 per cent of women - and the remainder adopting the same diet as those in the bottom fifth of red and processed meat consumption. Those in the top fifth of consumption ate 2.5 times as much as those in the bottom fifth, the survey responses showed. Therefore, adopting the diet of those . eating the least red and processed meat would mean cutting average . consumption from 91g to 53g a day for men, and from 54g to 30g for . women. The calculations showed that this . would significantly cut the risk of coronary artery disease, diabetes, . and bowel cancer by between three per cent and 12 per cent across the . population as a whole. High cost: Livestock farming accounting for around half of the greenhouse gases attributed to food production, owing to the large quantity of cereals and soy imported for animal feed . And this reduction in risk would be more than twice as much as the population averages for those at the top end of consumption who moved to the bottom end. The expected reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would amount to 0.45 tonnes per person per year, or just short of 28million tonnes of the equivalent of CO2 a year. The researchers acknowledge that their data, published in the online journal BMJ Open, is a decade old, but the most recent nutrition survey (2008/9) indicates broadly similar and even slightly higher figures for red and processed meat consumption. Dr Louise Aston, of the Institute of Public Health at the University of Cambridge, said: 'This indicates that our estimates remain relevant and may even be conservative, highlighting the need for action to prevent further increases in intake in the UK population.' She said while it may be harder for people to understand the direct impact that climate change has on them, it is much easier to understand the impact on their health. Dr Aston added: 'Health benefits provide near term rewards to individuals for climate friendly changes and may thus ""nudge"" humanity towards a sustainable future. 'Dietary recommendations should no longer be based on direct health effects alone.'",Reducing red and processed meat consumption would prompt a fall in chronic disease incidence of between 3 per cent and 12 per cent in Britain .

Jonathan Thompson has been denied bail after confessing to killing Adonis Reed by punching him twice in the stomach when the tot wouldn't take a nap . A judge ordered a Long Island man held without bail Saturday after prosecutors said he confessed to killing a 4-year-old boy in his care by punching him twice in the stomach when the tot wouldn't take a nap. Jonathan Thompson, 31, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of the youngster, Adonis Reed, who was found unconscious on a couch in an apartment in the New York town of Amityville on Wednesday afternoon. Adonis had lived at the apartment with his six-year-old sister and his godmother Lakisha Pitt, who is Thompson's girlfriend. At Thompson's arraignment in Central Islip, prosecutors said he struck the boy hard enough to lacerate his liver.

The U.S. Patent Office has granted Apple a patent for what is believed to be the new dock connector on the next iPhone. Apple is believed to be revamping the charging port for what will be the fifth version of the iPhone, which is expected to arrive later this Autumn. As with all of Apple's products, the company keeps its cards very close to its chest before launches, but the patent filing describes a charging and data port which matches the rumoured new design. Sadly for Apple users, the new design will mean changing all of your peripherals, such as speaker docks, unless adapters comes to market. Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone (right), with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete . Old and new: The current iPhone is shown with the prototype of the iPhone 5's outer casing . Earlier this week Apple.pro printed these images of what they claim is the fascia of the next iPhone, suggesting the screen is much larger . The new port looks similar to micro USB, the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however it is very unlikely that Apple will support this standard, despite moves by the EU to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable. Apple's version has a triangle-shaped wedge at one end, which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round. Mac fans may spot a superficial similarity to a Firewire port, which is used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed. The patent office granted the patent for: 'A power adapter for a peripheral device such as portable electronics device. 'The power adapter includes a housing that contains electrical components associated with the power adapter. 'The power adapter also includes a data port provided at a surface of the housing. The data port is configured to provide external power to the peripheral device.' Popular: But iPhone users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device . The rumoured proposal has sparked . alarm among the company’s followers  who fear they will have to buy new . equipment to work with the phone. Docking stations, which play music . stored on iPhones and can cost hundreds of pounds, may become redundant . as will chargers. All iPhones made so far use a 30-pin connector both . for power and to plug in accessories. Useless: The $850 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 8 is designed to work with the current iPhone's design . Obsolete: The B&W Zeppelin speaker, left, and the Bose Sounddock 10, right, are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the iPhone 5 . Apple advertised for staff to work on . the new connector earlier this year. It was seeking an engineer . ‘responsible for identifying appropriate connection technology . requirements for new products and follow through with selection and . development of suitable interconnect products’. The advertisement added: ‘This will often involve adaptation of existing connectors or complete new designs.’ The new model is expected to have a . larger 4-inch screen that will reputedly offer better resolution viewing . than a high definition TV. It will include Apple’s new mapping . software, which has sparked privacy fears as it uses aerial photography . capable of showing detail just four inches across.","iPhone 5 will use a 19-pin connector instead of 30-pin, according to reports .

Drunk: 18-year-old Steff was arrested after police matched his DNA to that found on a can of Fosters left in the enclosure . A teenager stole an endangered tortoise worth £2,000 from a safari park and sold it on Facebook - for a paltry £30. Adam Steff took Flo, a 4.5lb juvenile Aldabra giant tortoise, from Woburn Safari Park in Milton Keynes after he wandered into her enclosure while drunk. The 18-year-old originally tried to sell Flo for what she was worth, then accepted an offer of just £30 for the tortoise - a specimen of one of the world's rarest species. Police arrested Steff, a bricklaying student, after matching his DNA to saliva on a beer can left at the scene. Steff, . of Flitton, Bedfordshire, has sold the tortoise to 19-year-old Aiden . Mckinstery, Bedford Magistrates Court heard last week. McKinstery . later posted a picture of it on Facebook asking for name suggestions . for his new pet which was spotted by a member of Woburn staff who . realised it was helpless Flo. He . claimed he didn't know the reptile was stolen after Steff had turned up . at his house with her in the early hours of the morning on January 5. Prosecuting, Camille Gifford said: 'It was only the fact that she was promptly recovered that she's back to being fit and well. 'The . keeper said that when she was returned Flo was a muddy brown colour . when she is normally beige. She would have died if she hadn't have been . returned and that would have been devastating for the park. 'She's . from the Seychelles and they only have five of the kind at Woburn with . Flo being the only female and they are hoping to breed the species.' The court heard Flo was recovered following a DNA match on a can of Fosters left in the enclosure. Steff had been drinking on the evening of January 4 when he ventured into the animal park, the court heard. Anna Jumnoodoo, defending Steff, said: 'He decided to go out for a walk and was able to walk into the safari park. 'Once inside he stole the tortoise. 'He's very sorry for his actions especially as he found out she had been unwell.' Steff had no idea of the value of Flo, she told the court. Steff initially denied the offence . when he was interviewed by police. He later admitted burglary of a . non-dwelling and was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work. He was also given a curfew from 7pm to 7am, to last two months. Magistrates . told him: 'It's a serious matter and from what we have heard you were . very fortunate there were not more serious consequences. 'It was a very stupid thing to do wasn't it and you have had time to reflect on the matter.' In addition to the unpaid work and curfew, Steff was ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge. Rescued: Flo the 4.5lb Aldabra giant tortoise worth £2,000 who was stolen by Adam Steff from Woburn Safari Park then sold for just £30. She has now been returned to her enclosure at the park . The Aldabra tortoise is becoming more popular in the pet trade, although in some countries they require a permit. Their price makes them an exclusive animal. Woburn Safari Park is home to five Aldabra giant tortoises, living in their own specially designed exhibit in the Animal Encounters section of the park. Flo, the only female at the park, is also the smallest. The largest of the group, four-year-old Albert, weighs almost 14kg. When he reaches adulthood, he will weigh a whopping 250kg, nearly 40st. Animal Encounters keeper Lianne Hyslop said: 'Despite her size, Flo makes up for it in personality. 'If you can spot her standing tall with her neck outstretched, that's a sign she's waiting for a tickle.' This breed of tortoise is normally found on the islands of the Western Indian Ocean and, contrary to popular belief, tortoises are not slow or sluggish reptiles; they can in fact move quite quickly. Aldabra tortoises are classed as 'vulnerable' in the wild. This means their numbers are in decline due to habitat loss, hunting and also from predatory species introduced into their habitats, such as dogs and rats. The tortoises at Woburn Safari Park will be part of a significant captive breeding programme, which will help secure the future of the species.","Adam Steff arrested after his DNA was found on a can of Fosters left behind .

Even after admitting to killing her ex-boyfriend in 2008, Jodi Arias continues to insist that she is innocent of the horrific crime. The 32-year-old California woman who could be facing the death penalty if convicted in the murder of 30-year-old Travis Alexander sat down for a jailhouse interview with CBS’ 48 Hours. While the prosecution claims that Arias stabbed Alexander 27 times, shot him in the face and slashed his throat from ear to ear in a fit of jealous rage following a sexual encounter in his Arizona home, the woman continues to maintain her innocence. Scroll to watch the full 48 Hours video . Defiant: Jodi Arias insisted in a new CBS interview that if found guilty of her boyfriend's murder, she would not be the first person wrongly convicted . Sentencing: Arias said that she would prefer to get the death penatly rather than spend the rest of her life in prison . ‘If a conviction happens, I know I won’t be the first person to be wrongly convicted,’ she told a CBS reporter recently,' adding that she knows in her heart that in the system of ‘God’s justice,’ she is ‘OK.’ Thinking about the outcome of her trial, the soft-spoken brunette appeared resigned to her fate. ‘If it was my choice, I would choose the death penalty because I don’t want to spend a life in prison,’ she said. During a 2008 interview recorded for 48 Hours, Arias said that she would have gained nothing from the gristly slaying. Bogus tale: At the time, Arias said that she and Alexander were attacked by a pair of men who assaulted her lover with a knife and gun . 'I’ve been sitting a lot in my cell thinking, ""What a waste,"" you know? I did have my whole future ahead of me,' Arias told a reporter five years ago. 'I had everything to lose and nothing to gain if I killed Travis. I loved him and still love him.' More than four years later, the woman has . revised her story, telling reporter Maureen Maher that she killed . Alexander, but did so in self-defense. Arias is accused of stabbing the Mormon real estate agent and motivational speaker 27 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his apartment after the two had a sexual encounter. In mid-August 2008, two months after the gruesome slaying that had shaken the Mesa community, Arias sat down with Maher for a jailhouse interview that eventually made it into the 48 Hours segment called Picture Perfect - The Trial of Jodi Arias. In the course of the lengthy talk, the media-savvy suspect offered her fabricated version of events, claiming that after she and Alexander had had sex, two men dressed in black broke into his home and attacked the 30-year-old with a knife and a gun. On trial: Jodi Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander . Heavy penalty: If convicted, Arias could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row . Her lover was stabbed on the floor, . but Arias said she managed to escape. She added that she never told . anyone about the deadly attack because she was afraid, but she was . certain at the time that Alexander was alive. 'It . was the scariest experience of my life,' she said of the bogus home . invasion. 'It was just so unreal. It was like a move unfolding. Like a . horrible movie.' Police have . since exposed Arias' tale as a boldfaced lie, and even her defense . attorneys now say that their client was not telling the truth in the wake . of the murder. Arias . eventually changed her story, telling investigators that she killed . Alexander in self-defense, describing him as a sexually promiscuous, . brutal man who beat her and sought to control her. But there is no record of Arias reporting the abuse, and Alexander's friends and other former paramours said that he was never violet. Arias herself said just months after her arrest that while her ex-boyfriend lost his temper a few times, she never felt like her life was in danger. On Thursday, jurors in the Arias . trial were shown graphic photos of the defendant and her slain paramour . taken on the day of his murder. In some of the pictures, Alexander appears alive in the shower, while other images captured his dead body on the floor. The day before, a videotaped . interrogation of the 32-year-old was played in court. A detective . grilled Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She . insisted she did not kill him. Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape. Femme fatale: Prosecutors say Arias drove to Alexander's home armed with a gun and knife with the intent to kill him . Conflicting words: Jurors in the trial watched a videotaped interrogation of Arias Wednesday during which she insists she didn't kill Travis Alexander, right, but says if she had, she would have killed him quickly and humanely . ‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’ ‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias . replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't . have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel. ‘I don't think I could stab him. I . think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my . intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves. ‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added. If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. She allegedly stabbed and slashed . Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat from ear to ear, and shot . him in the head around June 4, 2008, at his Mesa home. His body was . found five days later in his shower by roommates. Graphic: Witness Leslie Udy was shown graphic photographs taken of her friend Jodi Arias on June 4, 2008 by the prosecution to show that perhaps she did not know everything about her 'gentle' friend . Crime scene: Photographs shown in the murder trial of Jodi Arias show the crime scene at Travis Alexander's home in Mesa, California after his body was found . Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen . Prosecutors say Arias drove from California armed with a gun and a knife with the intent to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon. She neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene . that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever . seen. They say she attacked him in a . jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him . after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each . other sexually. Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, . told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in . anger’ on the day he was killed after becoming upset that she dropped his new camera in the shower, and she had no other choice but to defend herself. She then fled the scene and drove to relatives' home in California. When Detective Flores tracked her down and questioned her about the crime, the woman denied being in Alexander's home on the day of the murder and said that she had not seen him since April 2008. Detective Flores tracked Jodi down to her relatives' home in California to interview her about Alexander’s murder. But the woman denied being at the scene of the crime for fear of implicating herself. 'Self-defense': Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, told jurors in opening statements that Alexander 'lunged at Jodi in anger' on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself . She told Flores that the last time she saw Alexander was in April, which obviously was not true However, evidence recovered from inside the victim’s blood-spattered home told a different tale. Police recovered a camera in Alexander’s washing machine with the photos erased. Computer forensic unit managed to recover data, revealing dozens of pictures showing Arias and Alexander having sex and several out-of-focus, dark images depicting Alexander being killed and his dead body. According to investigators, Alexander’s bathroom was replete with biological evidence linking Arias to the crime scene, including her hair and a bloody palm print that eventually led to her arrest. Detective Flores revealed during the 48 Hours interview that Arias appeared conscious of her image, and even asked if she could apply makeup before being taken into custody. ‘It was like an out-of-body experience,’ Arias described her arrest to the CBS reporter. When the trial resumes January 29, . both the prosecution and the defense plan on playing parts from the 48 . Hours interview for the jurors. The trial is expected to last through April.

In a painful remembrance, West described the attempted robbery that ended with one of the suspects shooting her baby while he was sitting in his stroller. Police arrested 17-year-old De’Marquise Elkins and an unnamed 14-year-old for the murder on Friday. According to police reports, the two suspects attempted to rob Sherry West in Brunswick, Georgia, and shot her son in the face after she told them she had no money. Scroll down for video . Tearful appearance: In a painful remembrance, West described the attempted robbery that ended with one of the suspects shooting her baby while he was sitting in his stroller . ‘What does it say about this country that two young boys could even consider perpetrating such a crime?’ Morgan asked a tearful West. ‘It’s a shame that our children grow up around children like this and that children can actually grow up and do things like this.’ she responded. ‘I mean, people have to worry about children now, not just adult assailants.’ West told Morgan she ‘hopes the shooter dies. I had to watch my baby die and I want him to die. A life for a life.’ She said Elkins’ 14-year-old accomplice should be sent to ‘a juvenile correctional facility to age 21’ and then given ‘a consecutive life sentence in state prison.’ At the end of the segment, Morgan thanked West for coming onto his show to speak about her tragic loss and called the ordeal ‘one of the most appalling crimes I have heard of since I have been here in America.’ Elkins, 17, made his first court appearance in Brunswick, Georgia, on Monday, charged as an adult for the heinous murder. On trial for murder: De'Marquise Elkins, 17, appears in court on Monday over the death of a 13-month-old baby who was shot dead in Brunswick, Georgia . Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother . 'My client is absolutely, 1,000-percent not guilty,' public defender Kevin Gough, who represents Elkins said on Monday. Elkins is . charged as an adult with first-degree murder, along with a 14-year-old . who was not identified because he is a juvenile, Police Chief Tobe Green . said. At Monday morning's hearing, the 14-year-old came into the courtroom shackled and wearing a baggy orange jumpsuit. He glanced at the few members of the media allowed into the courtroom for the initial appearance as he shuffled to a lectern facing Glynn County Magistrate Tim Barton. The magistrate told the boy he couldn't set a bond because only Superior Court judges can do so in murder cases. 'I'm going to see that you get a lawyer immediately,' Barton told the boy. Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday . Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money . The 14-year-old was in the eighth grade at Glynn Middle School before his arrest, said Jim Weidhaas, a school spokesman. Elkins was last a student in the . system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative . school program, Weidhaas said. The baby's mother said she was . walking home on Thursday morning when two boys confronted her and one of . them opened fire. Police say she was shot in the leg, and her baby was . shot in face. Gough said he has demanded a bond hearing and filed a request for a speedy trial for Elkins. 'We look forward to our day in court,' he said. Ms West recounted the attack this weekend. She said: 'He asked me for money and I said I didn't have it. 'When you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They're expensive. And he kept asking and I just said ""I don't have it."" And he said, ""Do you want me to kill your baby?"" And I said, ""No, don't kill my baby!""' Authorities said one of the teens fired four shots, grazing West's ear and striking her in the leg, before he walked around to the stroller and shot the baby in the face. West said her son was walking well on his own and eight of his teeth had come in. But she also mourned the milestones that will never come, like Antonio's first day at school. 'I'm always going to wonder what his first word would be,' West said. Tragedy: Little Antonio Santiago's stroller stands empty after the 13-month-old was shot in the head during a botched robbery . Tearful: West is devastated that she will never see her son grow up - or even learn to speak her name . Luis Santiago, the boy's father, said he must take comfort in his faith that his in a better place. 'He's all right,' Santiago told the boy's mother, trying to smile. 'He's potty training upstairs in heaven.' West said she took one look at a teenage suspect's jailhouse mugshot on Saturday and said he was definitely the killer. Yet an aunt of the teen said he was eating breakfast with her when the slaying took place. Despite the conflicting stories, police have charged 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins with murder, along with a 14-year-old suspect whose name has been withheld because he's a juvenile. Brunswick police spokesman Todd Rhodes said even though Elkins' aunt provided an alibi, authorities have good reason to bring the charges. 'That's what she's saying, but the evidence we're looking at says something else,' Rhodes said, though he would not elaborate. Also Saturday, police in the coastal . port city released 911 recordings from neighbors who sobbed and pleaded . for help right after 13-month-old Antonio Santiago was shot in the head a . few blocks from his mother's apartment. Two teddy bears, a vase of flowers and a decorative cross had been left on Saturday against a wooden fence near the shooting scene. Katrina Freeman said Saturday the . shooter can't be her nephew, Elkins, because he showed up at her house . on Thursday at 8.15am - roughly an hour before the killing. She said she . cooked eggs, grits and sausage for breakfast and that Elkins . accompanied her and her children to run errands when they left at about . 11.30am. 'He was with us the whole time,' said . Freeman, adding that she gave police the same account of her nephew's . whereabouts. 'There is no doubt in my mind that he is innocent.' The slain boy's mother said she picked . the gunman out of a photo lineup of 24 mugshots police brought to her on . Friday. When a reporter showed her the photo of Elkins taken when he was . booked into the Glynn County jail Friday, she wept and nodded. Scene of the shooting: Antonio's upturned stroller still lies on its side in the residential area of Brunswick . ""He killed my baby, and he shot me, too,"" she said. At her apartment on Saturday, West had . filled several bags with her son's clothes and diapers to donate to . charity. She said she hopes prosecutors pursue the death penalty in the . case. 'My baby will never be back again,' West said, sobbing. 'He took an innocent life. I want his life, too.' In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was . stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the . stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges. In Georgia, police said they are still searching for the gun. No eyewitnesses have come forward. In the 911 recordings, two callers . said they heard gunshots and then saw West take her son out of his . stroller, lay him on the ground and try to revive him using CPR. 'Yes, I heard the shots. Somebody shot . this child,' said one sobbing caller, who told the operator there were . three shots fired. 'She's got him on the ground. Please, we need . everything we can get.' The 911 operators asked the callers if . the boy was breathing. Finally, a man in a grave voice, answers: 'No, . the baby's not breathing.' He says the child was shot 'right between the . eyes'. A woman can be heard screaming in the background just before police arrive. Sirens drowned out her cries. Elkins' older sister, Sabrina Elkins, said . police arrested him as he came to her home on Friday. 'The police came pointing a Taser at . him, telling him to get on the ground,' she said.

Young Roma women, provocatively dressed, gyrate sensuously to the sounds of Gypsy pop, trying to catch the eye of young men clad in muscle shirts and leather jackets. With the austere, car boot sale-like surroundings and the downmarket nightclub dress code, it's no wonder the event they are taking part in has been locally dubbed the 'bridal market'. Love is not exactly for sale in this poverty-stricken corner of Bulgaria. But amid the flirtation in the litter-strewn car park venue, families are weighing their finances against the merits of prospective brides. Scroll down for video . The same couple seen from behind: Despite the bleak surroundings, some 2,000 people have shown up in high spirits, many in cars rigged with speakers on the hoods to pump out Gypsy pop at full blast . A Kalaidzhi girl and boy dance atop a car, holding money: The community, a small portion of the estimated 700,000 Bulgarian Roma, are almost all devout Orthodox Christians who keep teen boys and girls separate . These Roma, who are among the most . poverty-stricken people in a deeply impoverished region, are seeking to . forge mutually beneficial unions that will help them weather Bulgaria's . brutal economic downturn. Globalisation . has added to their precarious economic position. The families gathered . here are part of a community of about 18,000 Roma known as Kalaidzhi, . who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths. Now . that historic trade is dying out, in part because traditional copper . pots and pans are being replaced by less expensive goods from the . ever-smoking factories of Communist China. Nevertheless, at the bridal fair a festival atmosphere hangs in the air. Even those girls still too young to be considered for marriage wear gobs of mascara, flashy jewellery and towering heels. Their . mini-dresses are electric pink, blood red or canary yellow. The boys . wear tight black jeans and muscle shirts, often topped with a black . leather jacket. Despite the . bleak surroundings, some 2,000 people have shown up in high spirits, . many in cars rigged with speakers on the hoods to pump out Gypsy pop at . full blast. Boys and girls dance side-by-side on the cars, shaking their hips in a frenzy of barely repressed sexuality. The . exuberance stems largely from the fact that, due to the community's . conservative values, youths are rarely allowed to mingle with the . opposite sex. Austere surroundings: The families gathered here are part of a community of about 18,000 Roma known as Kalaidzhi, who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths but who face fierce competition from China . Tradition: Talk of brides being sold angers the Kalaidzhi. They say the marriage fair is a tradition that actually works, keeping communities and extended families intact for generations. Kalaidzhi, . who are almost all devout Orthodox Christians, are known to remove girls . from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation. Donka Hristova is one of the young women to travel to the fair with her family, in the hope of snaring a suitable suitor. Dressed in a skintight mini-dress, . with her make-up dilligently applied, she joins her sisters in a . provocative dance - hoping to look her best for the many boys also in . attendance. At 19, Donka is prime marrying age. 'I . hope to meet new people and to see the parents of the boys, so our . parents can meet him,' she says. 'It's a good tradition. It's easier for . us if our parents approve.' It starts, like a high school dance, . with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps, occasionally shaking . hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay . discreetly in the background. Apart from these twice-a-year bridal . fairs, boys and girls only have contact in Internet chats. So Donka is . happy to leave the realm of Facebook and meet real young men. At the fair, there is no shortage of . youths held in thrall by the way she dances with her sisters, who also . wear their showiest clothes. 'I want to find someone who is easy to get along with,' she says, taking a pause from dancing in high-heeled sandals. 'Someone whose parents won't interfere after we are together, and someone who's not too rich and not too poor and has a job.'

Coy: Kalaidzhi, who are almost all devout Orthodox Christians, are known to remove girls from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation . The event's reputation as a 'bridal . market' goes back generations. It used to take place in a muddy open . field next to a horse-trading market in a small village, where . brides-to-be stood on stage with suitors competing for their hand. Those . days are over. Police this year moved it into a city to avoid tension . with the horse traders. Still, the flirtations can lead to negotiations . and a possible union a few months down the road. If . the youths warm to each other, the fair can trigger complex financial . negotiations about the price a young man's family must pay to a woman's . parents if they are to be married. The . cost of a bride - between 5,000 and 10,000 lev (£2,200 to £4,300) - has . dropped in recent years as jobs have dried up. And wedding festivities . are much more modest with cash so tight. But . prices still rise for a 'very beautiful' young woman with many suitors, . said Velcho Krastev, who has written extensively about the Kalaidzhi. Some . say this is an innocent payment for the cost of a wedding dress and the . elaborate wedding feasts of Roma tradition. Others say it's the price . families are willing to pay for their sons to have a woman believed to . be a virgin. 'We are . maintaining the morals of the children by marrying them off at a young . age,' said Kosta Kostov, a spectator at the fair. 'If she's not a . virgin, the bride's family has to give the money back.' He . said Bulgaria's crushing financial slowdown, and the near total . collapse of the coppersmith industry, has made it virtually impossible . for his family to raise the money needed to find wives for his three . grandsons, aged 18, 20 and 22. 'They have no jobs and their parents can't pay money to the bride's family,' he said. 'It's a crisis now.' Nerves: It starts, like a high school dance, with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps, occasionally shaking hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay discreetly in the background . Negotiations: The Kalaidzhi, unlike other Roma communities, do not allow girls to marry at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an even higher premium . Although the idea that a young woman . must be a virgin when she marries has generally faded in many segments . of Bulgarian society, it remains strong among the Roma, particularly . those who follow Orthodox teachings. The . Kalaidzhi, unlike other Roma communities, do not allow girls to marry . at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an . even higher premium. But they have started to modernise. It is now widely recognized that the young people need to have feelings for each other. 'That . is the first and most important step now,' said Mr Krastev, a member of . the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 'In the past, parents didn't ask the . young people whether they liked each other. 'But . the second step is that when they have decided they like each other and . the parents agree, they start negotiating what the price will be for . the bride.' Talk . of brides being sold angers the Kalaidzhi, who represent a small . proportion of Bulgaria's 700,000 Roma. They say the marriage fair is a . tradition that actually works, keeping communities and extended families . intact for generations. Indeed, . it is easy to find men and women in their late 30s and early 40s who . met at a bridal fair two decades ago and today are hoping now to make . matches for their children.

Georgieva married her husband Kolyo in 2008 after a courtship sparked . at the bridal fair. She came to this year's event to help her . 20-year-old cousin navigate the sea of suitors. 'She . is nervous and there are several grooms possible,' Georgieva said. 'She . has not decided, and she can't decide by herself. We are asking her . opinion but she also has to recognize our opinion.' That opinion doesn't hinge on the groom alone. 'I am here to meet the families,' she said. 'To see if they have the wealth to support the bride.'","The 'bridal market' is the only opportunity for teenage girls and boys from the Bulgarian Kalaidzhi Roma to mix .

Somalia arrest: British citizen Clive Dennis was held at Mogadishu's Aden Adde airport on suspicion of planning to join terror group al-Shabaab . A British citizen has been arrested in Somalia under suspicion of plotting to join the terror group al-Shabaab, it was reported. Clive Dennis, 45, was held at the Aden Adde International airport in the shattered country's capital Mogadishu. An official from Somalia's Transitional Federal Government said the Jamaica-born Briton travelled on a UK passport from Nairobi. Somali director of immigration Abdullahi Gafow Mohamud told the Iranian broadcast network Press TV that Dennis was held at the airport over a visa offence and told officials he hoped to live in the port town of Kismayo. General Mohamud said: 'After a short interrogation, he claimed that he came from London via Nairobi and he was heading to Kismayo.' The Somalia Report news website quoted government spokesman Abdirahman Omar Osman Yarisow, who said Dennis had told immigration bosses he had travelled to the war-torn Horn of Africa nation 'to help Islam'. The publication reported: 'Dennis is suspected of having links to al-Qaeda, according to Yarisow, although it is unlikely that an al-Qaeda militant would choose to enter the country in such a manner.' Somalia Report added that the British citizen was allegedly caught in possession of drugs and a variety of knives. Press TV reported that other items in his baggage allegedly included military-grade rope, credit cards and daggers. Dennis' reported arrest makes him the latest in a string of Britons held in Somalia or Kenya over suspected links to al-Shabaab, which is backed by al-Qaeda. Concerns: Police officers at Mogadishu airport. Security experts have warned dozens of radicalised Muslims could have travelled from the UK to join al-Shabaab . Last month the UK hosted a major international conference on Somalia in the hope of finding new solutions to the crisis which has engulfed the country for more than two decades. However security experts have warned dozens of radicalised Muslims could have travelled from the UK to join al-Shabaab. Terror suspect Jermaine Grant, 29, from London, was arrested in Kenya in December and is due to stand trial over an alleged terror plot. Police have said they believed the Muslim convert could have been working in the port city of Mombasa alongside fellow Briton Samantha Lewthwaite, 28.The mother of three is the widow of London 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay. She is believed to have travelled to Kenya last year from her home in Aylesbury and is suspected of helping to fund terrorism. Al-Shabaab has controlled parts of Somalia for years since the effective collapse of the country's government. The militant organisation enforces an extreme form of Sharia law and has organised a string of terrorist atrocities. Last October Kenya sent troops across the border into Somalia in a bid to flush out the militia. The Kenyan soldiers have since joined an African Union peace mission in the country.","Jamaica-born Clive Dennis, 45, travelled on a UK passport from Nairobi ."

They may be idyllic - but beware: country roads are the deadliest places for drivers, new research has revealed. New figures released by the government show that although more accidents take place in cities, motorists are more likely to die in a collision if it takes place on rural roads. The high rate of deaths on rural roads is partly because such routes are more isolated and help takes longer to arrive. Rural Herefordshire emerges as England’s deadliest county, with the highest number of road deaths compared to population density. Deadly: They may be picturesque, but country roads are the deadliest place for drivers according to new figures . Some 14 people died, representing 0.76 people in every 10,000 of the population. Herefordshire was followed by North Yorkshire (0.71 per 10,000), Wiltshire (0.67), Lincolnshire (0.64), Warwickshire (0.61), Cumbria (0.60), Leicestershire (0.59), Rutland (0.52), Somerset (0.51), the East Riding of Yorkshire (0.50),  and Milton Keynes (0.49). Lowest with no reported deaths were Middlesbrough, Darlington, Slough, Portsmouth and the City of London. The City of London also has the most crashes overall per 10,000 population - way ahead of second and third place Westminster and Surrey - and it also has the most crashes resulting in serious injuries. As well as showing just the raw number of deaths and injuries, the new online database also measures the figures against population densities, traffic levels, road lengths and local authority spending on road safety. The tables were launched by Transport Minister Stephen Hammond at a road safety conference organised by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for transport safety (PACTS) called ‘Lies, damned lies and statistics: understanding road casualty trends and causes’ held at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. The tables also compare casualty rates against road safety budgets. The council with the highest rate of people killed or seriously injured per £10,000 spent on road safety is the London Borough of Barnet - with 1,120 people killed or seriously injured per £10,000 spent on running costs such as road maintenance and repainting white lines. Barnet said the figures were ‘skewed’ because of ‘accounting issues’ linked to changes in the way it allocated its road safety budget. Next from bottom was rural Northumberland - England’s least populated county - followed by and Rotherham. The lowest rates of casualties for the money spent were seen in Ealing, Blackburn and South Gloucestershire. Ministers say highlighting the best and worst performers will allow drivers and other road-users to see whether they are getting value for money from their councils in cutting the carnage rates on the nation’s roads. As well as putting casualty figures into context, the site provides a mapping facility so people can see how many cyclists or children have been involved in collisions on a particular road. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘This new comparison website will give local residents a more accurate picture of their council’s performance in reducing road casualties and will allow councils to make more meaningful assessments of the work they are doing to improve road safety. 'If a council is performing particularly well, then I want to see them sharing best practice with others so that they can improve and people across the country can benefit.’ One silver lining of the economic downturn is that it is dramatically cutting the number of deaths on Britain’s roads, the PACTS road safety conference heard. Since Britain went into recession the number of people killed on Britain’s roads has fallen by more than a third, from 2,946 in 2007 to 1,901 in 2011, according to a report from TRL - formerly the Transport Research Laboratory - launched at the conference. Louise Lloyd, senior statistician at TRL said the economic mood of the UK is resulting in a fall in traffic volumes as motorists cut out discretionary journeys. Safer: Urban roads are far safer for drivers because they are less isolated and it takes less time for help to arrive . Drivers are sticking to slower speeds to save fuel costs, and drink-drive casualties are declining as people sacrifice nights out. The ‘squeeze on spending’ is also resulting in a drop in young males taking their driving tests. Miss Lloyd said: ‘It appears that in prosperous years people may have been over-confident in their driving style, taking more risks with speed and drink-driving for example. 'External influences such as the recession and weather patterns have caused people to be more cautious about their safety on the roads, leading them to drive more carefully. ‘It is this change in behaviour which is directly affecting the number of fatalities on our roads.’","Rural Herefordshire is the deadliest place in the UK to drive .

Facebook has denied a bug on its site is causing private messages to be displayed on people's walls. Online users have claimed private messages written in 2009 and earlier were today showing up on viewable timelines as messages 'posted by friends'. The reports were mainly in the US and France, and only appeared to affect some users. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was at the centre of a major privacy row today as internet users claimed that private messages were being displayed as public. However, the site said the issue was simply a mistake by users. Facebook acknowledged the problem had been raised by users, but denied there was a problem, saying it has 'extensively investigated' them. 'A small number of users raised concerns after what they believed to be private messages appeared on their Timeline. 'Our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users' profile pages. 'Facebook is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy.' The concerns come as Facebook is looking to tackle Google by making search a much more prominent part of its social network. Mark Zuckerberg said: 'Facebook is pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have' - and plans to build more powerful search facilities as Facebook evolves. The social network is already tweaking its search capabilities - with any search a user makes in the top bar now stored and displayed by Facebook. Facebook said it will now log all searches made in Facebook, which users can then see by clicking on the Activity Log button. The company stressed that any searches you make will not be visible to other users.

Arrested: Megan Rice, an 82-year-old nun, was one of three who allegedly broke into a nuclear facility . Two men and an 82-year-old nun allegedly broke into the U.S. government's only facility for handling, processing and storing weapons-grade uranium, government officials said Thursday. The Oak Ridge, Tennessee facility has been temporarily shut after the security breach, and now 82-year-old Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli, 63, and Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, face criminal charges of trespassing. Officials said the facility was shut down on Wednesday at least until next week after the three activists cut through perimeter fences to reach the outer wall of a building where highly enriched uranium, a key nuclear bomb component, is stored. The activists painted slogans and threw what they said was human blood on the wall of the facility before they were arrested shortly before 4.30am last Saturday. The numerous buildings in the facility are known by the code name Y-12, that it was given during World War II, Reuters reported. While moving between the perimeter fences, the activists triggered sensors that alerted security personnel. But officials conceded the intruders were still able to reach the building's walls before security personnel got to them. Ellen Barfield, a spokeswoman for the activists who called themselves 'Transform Now Plowshares,' said three were arrested and charged with vandalism and criminal trespass. Scroll down for video . Partners in crime: Greg Boertje-Obed, left, and Michael R. Walli, right, are also activists for Transform Now Plowshares and were arrested after trespassing at the Y-12 facility in Tennessee . Holding: The U.S. government facility contains the largest weapons-grade uranium supply in the country . She said Rice, Walli, and Boertje-Obed were being held in custody and appeared for a hearing before a U.S. magistrate judge in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Thursday. A statement released on Plowshares’ website read that the use of blood was meant to ‘(remind) us of the horrific spilling of blood by nuclear weapons.’ A detention hearing is set for Friday afternoon, when prosecutors must show the defendants are a flight risk and a danger to the community in order to keep them in custody, according to court officials. The trial date is October 9. The activists had apparently passed through four separate fences and walked for 'over two hours' before reaching the uranium storage building, on which they hung banners and strung crime-scene tape, ABC News reported. Ralph Hutchinson, coordinator for the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, said the group's intention was not to demonstrate the lack of security at the plant, but to take a stance against the making of nuclear weapons. 'It wasn't so they could show how easy it was to bust into this bomb plant, it was because the production of nuclear weapons violates everything that is moral and good,' Hutchinson said. 'It is a war crime.' Break in: The three allegedly broke into the Y-12 National Security Complex, which contains large amounts of weapons-grade enriched uranium . Covert: This ABC News virtual view shows a rendering of the three allegedly breaking through one of the complex's four fences with wire cutters . The writings on the wall: The activists then splashed what they said was blood on the uranium in this ABC News rendering . Officials said that the storage building itself, which was built after the September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, was designed with modern security features and that its contents were not compromised. WSI Oak Ridge, the private firm employed by the U.S. Department of Energy to provide security at Y-12, is a subsidiary of the giant international security firm G4S. G4S drew criticism for failing to provide the number of security personnel it promised to protect the London Olympic Games, forcing the British government to deploy extra army troops. A spokeswoman for G4S declined to comment and referred inquiries to government spokespeople. The security failure was an embarrassment both for the security firm and for the National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, the Energy Department branch that operates U.S. nuclear weapons plants. 'It was obviously a pretty serious incident,' NNSA spokesman Joshua McConaha told Reuters. 'We're taking this very, very seriously,' added Steve Wyatt, a spokesman for the NNSA office in Oak Ridge, which supervises the activities of Y-12 contractors. Peaceable: This image shows the three protestors, who are now in federal custody, days before their alleged break-in . The NNSA officials said the activists cut through two chain-link fences surrounding the sprawling facility and a third fence surrounding the ultra-secure enriched uranium stockpile building, known as the 'Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility.' Wyatt said the building served as the U.S. government's only 'warehouse' for storing highly enriched uranium used in nuclear weapons. Highly enriched uranium is a radioactive material used in the core of bombs to produce a nuclear detonation. The Oak Ridge plant is one of the most important government installations involved in the maintenance and production of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Although the security breach occurred overnight last Friday, officials confirmed that the shutdown - which applies to 'all nuclear operations' at the Y-12 site - did not begin until Wednesday. Officials said it was expected to continue into next week. In the meantime, personnel at the facility would be given additional security training. Peter Stockton, a former congressional investigator and security consultant to the Energy Department, expressed scepticism at government assertions the nuclear material was not at risk. 'It is unbelievable this could happen,' Stockton said. 'The significance is outrageous. If they were terrorists, they could have blown open the door and got inside.' video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Megan Rice, 82, was one of three to allegedly break into heavily guarded nuclear facility in Tennessee .

Julia Pierson has been named the first female director of the Secret Service by President Barack Obama today signalling his desire to change the culture at the male-dominated service which has been marred by scandal. Pierson, who most recently served as the agency's chief of staff, takes over from Mark Sullivan, who announced his retirement last month following a prostitution scandal within his department last year. Several of Sullivan's agents hired prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia during preparations for one of Obama's planned trips, firing off an avalanche of intense criticism over the agency's handling. First Secret Service Lady: Veteran secret service agent Julia Pierson has been chosen as the first female Secret Service director by President Obama on Tuesday . It also raised questions within the agency – as well as at the White House and on Capitol Hill- about the culture, particularly during foreign travel. In addition to protecting the president, the Secret Service also investigates financial crimes. 'Over her 30 years of experience with the Secret Service, Julia has consistently exemplified the spirit and dedication the men and women of the service demonstrate every day,' Obama said in a statement announcing Pierson's appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation. At the Secret Service, Pierson has served as deputy assistant director of the office of protective operations, assistant director of human resources and training and chief of staff. She started in 1983 as a special agent in Miami. Before that, she was a police officer in Orlando, Florida. 'Julia is eminently qualified to lead the agency that not only safeguards Americans at major events and secures our financial system, but also protects our leaders and our first families, including my own,' Obama said. New direction: Named the agency's first female director, Obama's choice, Pierson seen left, signals his desire to change the culture at the male-dominated service, which has been marred by scandal . 'Julia has had an exemplary career, and I know these experiences will guide her as she takes on this new challenge to lead the impressive men and women of this important agency.' Thirteen Secret Service employees were caught up in last year's prostitution scandal. After a night of heavy partying in the Caribbean resort city of Cartagena, the employees brought women, including prostitutes, to the hotel where they were staying. The incident became public after one agent refused to pay a prostitute and the pair argued about payment in a hotel hallway. Eight of the employees were forced out of the agency, three were cleared of serious misconduct and at least two have been fighting to get their jobs back. Replaced: U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, seen in May of 2012, announced his retirement last month following a prostitution scandal among his agents in Cartagena, Colombia last year . The incident took place before Obama arrived in Colombia and the service said the president's safety was never compromised. But news of the scandal broke during his trip, overshadowing the summit and embarrassing the U.S. delegation. Sullivan issued a new code of conduct that bans employees from drinking within 10 hours of starting a shift or bringing foreign nationals back to their hotel rooms. Sullivan apologized for the incident last year during testimony before a Senate panel. 'I have known and worked with Julie for close to thirty years,' said Sullivan in a statement on Tuesday. 'She was an excellent Assistant Director and Chief of Staff, demonstrating sound judgment, leadership, character, and commitment to our Country, the men and women of the U.S. Secret Service and those we serve and protect. This is a historic and exciting time for the Secret Service and I know Julie will do an outstanding job.'","Pierson most recently served as the agency's chief of staff before taking over from Mark Sullivan .

"By . Rob Waugh and Christine Show . CREATED: . 20:23 EST, 25 May 2012 . Google has joined an effort to warn thousands of users around the world that the internet will suddenly 'turn off' on 9 July of this year. The internet search-engine giant will set up alerts visible to the roughly 350,000 PC users with infected computers when they use its search results page as a warning that their machines have an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus called DNSChanger. Google's decision to lend help comes as the FBI, which detected the infection and established 'surrogate' servers to keep infected PCs working, plans to 'pull the plug' in July as a cost-cutting measure. Warning: Google will set up alerts visible for the roughly 350,000 PC users that their computers are infected with a virus on its search results page . Around 350,000 PC users have machines infected with an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus sending users to unintended and illegal sites . Google plans to alert more than 500,000 people in a week of the virus, which sends users of the Web to unintended - and sometimes illegal - sites. Damian Menscher, a Google social engineer, wrote in his blog that the search engine's initiative will reach a wider range of people as half the affected computers are owned by those who do not speak English. 'Our goal with this notification is to raise awareness of DNSChanger among affected users,' he wrote. 'We believe directly messaging affected users on a trusted site and in their preferred language will produce the best possible results.' The search-engine company hopes to reach out to many of the users who have no idea their computers are even infected. Infected: The Trojan 'DNSChanger' could cause millions - including Fortune 500 companies - to lose their Internet if the FBI shuts down surrogate servers . According to RT Network, servers function by translating traditional website URLs to their ‘numeric counterpart.’ But computers with the Trojan, which originally emerged in Estonia, will send users to fraudulent websites. And, if the FBI shuts off their emergency servers, millions of people could potentially be without Internet. The temporary servers set up by the FBI were created to allow companies to remove the worm from their infected servers; those affected had 120 days to get rid of the malware. After FBI warnings, the number of PCs infected with the Trojan has plunged - and most are in the hands of private individuals, not companies. Court order: The FBI will retire their surrogate servers by March 8 . Ticking clock: The FBI's surrogate servers can run until March 8, at which point they will either have to be shut down or run by a court-ordered extension . Of the 350,000 infected machines worldwide, 85,000 are in the U.S and 20,000 are in the UK. The malware is especially effective, Gizmodo reports, because it blocks infected users from visiting secure sites that could help them rid of the worm. Law enforcement officials and the computer industry have been working together in a coalition to fight the malware. The group, called the DNSChanger Working Group, will examine possibilities to fixing the problem. If no solution is reached, millions of people could be without the Internet, RT reports.","Machines infected with virus being 'kept alive' by FBI .

Collared: Ronald Gell claimed his dog was behind the wheel when officers arrested him for drink driving . A man who told police his dog had been driving when he was  stopped on suspicion of being drunk at the wheel was yesterday jailed for ten months. When asked who had been driving the car, 64-year-old Ronald Gell blamed his pet – then assaulted one of the officers. And when he was taken to the local police station, he refused a compulsory breath test. At Tain Sheriff Court yesterday, Gell, of Alness, Ross-shire, Scotland, was also banned from the roads for two years. He faced having his car confiscated, but Fiscal Roderick Urquhart withdrew his motion for forfeiture after receiving an appeal from Gell’s wife not to seize it. Gell had admitted that on February 19 he failed to give information to police as to the identity of the driver of the vehicle. He was admonished on this charge but jailed for five months for failing to provide a sample of his breath at Dingwall police station. He also admitted assaulting a female police officer by kicking her from the back seat of a police car as she was driving, endangering those in the vehicle and other road users. A further five months was added to his sentence. The court was told that staff at the Co-op store in Alness alerted police when Gell bought a bottle of rum with his groceries and clipped a kerb as he drove out of the car park. At the first hearing, Mr Urquhart said: ‘It was apparent to the lady at the till he was intoxicated and she became concerned. ‘A supervisor was called and they watched him on CCTV get into a car and drive off.’ Mr Urquhart said Gell mounted a kerb as he set off from the car park. The police were alerted and were on the look-out for him. By 5.20pm they saw he had arrived home. He added: ‘The car was empty. He was unpacking shopping. The Co-op store in Alness. Staff notified police after they saw him driving erratically . ‘When asked to provide the identity of who the driver of the vehicle was he replied “my dog  was driving”.’ The fiscal said there was a confrontation and Gell was arrested. ‘In the police car he kicked out at the driver of the car from the back seat and he had to be restrained for the remainder of the journey. ‘At the police station he refused to provide a sample of his breath.’ Gell admitted previous convictions and his solicitor, Alison Foggo, said he had a substantial number of court disposals and was subject to a live community payback order. ‘He suffers a number of health problems but there are a considerable number of recent breaches of bail orders including him not consuming alcohol,’ she said. Miss Foggo said Gell had reached the age of 60 before committing his first offence. ‘Now there have been 19 offences in past three years. Alcohol appears to play a very large part in his life, but he does not see it as an enormous problem. She added: ‘There are signs that he is beginning to recognise his alcohol problem but doesn’t  see himself as an alcoholic. 'His problems seem to be attributed to the fact that he is no longer working and no longer making a useful contribution to society, having worked all his days. ‘He had a heart attack about four years ago, and his health has taken a considerable turn for the worse with his recuperation slow and faltering. ‘My client is bored and needs to realise that enjoyment in life doesn’t come from a bottle.’ Sheriff Gilchrist told Gell: ‘It is very sad to see you in the position that you are in now which is clearly as a result of your consumption of alcohol to excess.’","Ronald Gell, 64, made extraordinary claim to arresting officers .

A 15-year-old boy with a severe nut allergy died minutes after eating barbecue spare ribs from a Chinese takeaway that had been marinated in peanut sauce. William Luckett, 15, took two bites of the ribs and died as his father Steven rushed him to hospital. William, from Newent, Gloustershire, had been visiting his father, Steven, on the Isle of Wight for the Christmas holidays when they decided to get William's favourite meal on December 29. They ordered dishes from Hong Kong Express, near where postman Steven lives in Brading. After two mouthfuls William, who attended Newent Community College and Sixth Form, said he was feeling unwell. An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned but it is believed that the teenager died from a serious allergic reaction to peanuts used to prepare the ribs. The restaurant today maintains that peanut was included as an ingredient on the menu next to the dish. William's distraught mother Helen Stiles said today that her son would not have eaten the dish if he had known that it contained peanuts. Mum-of-five Ms Stiles, 43, who spoke to her son 90 minutes before his death, said: 'Healways ordered the same things - duck in plum sauce and barbecue spare ribs. 'I have since discovered the restaurant they ordered from is the only one in that chain which prepares spare ribs with peanut sauce. More... How deadly peanut allergies can be cured... with peanuts: Holding tiny dose under tongue 'can build tolerance' Pregnant women exposed to pollen shortly before birth are more likely to have children with severe asthma . 'If Will or his father had even the slightest suspicion the food contained nuts, they would have asked. 'Will took two mouthfuls of rib and told his father he was feeling ill. He went to the toilet and when he came back he was covered in a rash. 'His father said he better get to the hospital, so Will started putting his shoes on. All the while he kept saying ""sorry dad"" like it was his fault. He died minutes after eating barbecue ribs from a Chinese takeaway - which unbeknown to him had been marinated in peanut sauce . The Chinese restaurant which sold the barbecue ribs today insisted that the dish is clearly labelled as containing peanuts on the menu. Michael Hang, manager of Hong Kong Express in Ryde - where William's father boughtthe takeaway - claimed ribs were always prepared in the sauce. He said:'I am really very sorry to hear about this. All the restaurants' ribs come with peanut sauce. Every Chinese restaurant does this. 'We have allergy information on all of our takeaway menus, it clearly says peanuts next to the ribs. 'If a customer has allergies then they have to tell us and we are very careful not to include what they are allergic to in the dish. 'I know how important it is because my son has allergies.' 'That's the type of kind-hearted person my son was. They left the house, he was walking and talking, but minutes after he got into the car, he collapsed and died.' William, who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, suffered his first reaction to peanuts at the age of four after eating a Maryland peanut cookie. His worried parents rushed Will to hospital after he turned while and developed rashes and doctors diagnosed him with a peanut intolerance. A  year later, William mistakenly ate a peanut M&M sweet and was prescribed an Epi pen - which gives a boost of adrenaline to stop or slow an allergic reaction - after being rushed to hospital. Helen added: ""Ever since then, I made sure we never had peanuts in the house. I checked everything we ate, and he learned himself. The takeaway was ordered from Hong Kong Express . restaurant near where William's postman father Steven lives in Braiding, . on the Isle of Wight. Right is William sitting with his brother Joseph . (left) 'Whenever trying something new, he would always ask if there were nuts in stuff. It's such a tragedy. Barbecue ribs were his favourite food - he ate them all the time. 'The week before he went to see his dad we went out for a meal and he ordered them then.' Helen believes that William, who also lives with stepdad Andy Stiles, brothers Joseph, 17, Hayden, 10, Toby, eight and sister Jess, two, had eaten from the Hong Kong Express chain of restaurants on the island before. She estimates that William ate around six Chinese takeaways after the family moved to the village of Cliffords Mesne, Glos., in 2011. Allergies can develop from food intolerances and William had not been tested since childhood - meaning his family did not know how severe a reaction could be. Newent Community School in Gloucestershire said they planned to hold a memorial concert in memory of Year 11 prefect William Luckett . His mother said: 'If he had had his epi pen on him, it may not have made any difference. He had such a severe reaction that by the time he got help it may have been too late. 'It could happen to anybody. I want to make people more aware. 'To die over something so stupid and trivial as peanut butter is a tragedy. It is so tragic because he had his whole life ahead of him.' Chinese spare ribs similar to the ones which caused William Luckett to have an allergic reaction . Jane Steele, headteacher of the Newent Community College and Sixth Form, said: 'He will be greatly missed by the staff and students who worked with . 'We were aware he had a nut intolerance. 'From previous experience, eating nuts would make him sick. 'He used to be very careful and sensible about what he ate and would refuse biscuits or cakes if they were handed out at after-school rehearsals.' The school plans to hold a memorial concert in William's memory. William moved to the area from the Isle of Wight with his mum, . stepdad, three brothers and sister in July 2011. A spokeswoman for the FSA could not comment on individual cases but said restaurants were not bound to display allergy information by law. She said: 'Current legislation that requires declaration of allergenic ingredients used in pre-packed foods, does not apply to foods sold . non-prepacked. 'So currently, when eating out, it is up to consumers with food allergies to ask for information about the ingredients used in the foods that want to buy so that they can make safe food choices.' 'However the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 do require that any information provided about food has to be accurate and not misleading. 'If a catering business said that a food did not contain nut ingredients, when in fact it did, this would be illegal and possible enforcement actions could be taken.' She said new EU legislation which requires food allergens to be displayed on non-prepacked food would come into effect in December this year. It comes after reports late last year revealed 18-year-old student, Emma Egerton, died after eating just one mouthful of takeaway chicken tikka korma. The korma from Manchester's Spice of India restaurant had been cooked in nut oil and contained ground almonds. The . student, who was alone at the time, . dialled 999 and left her front door open for the ambulance crews to get . in but was unconscious by the time they arrived and she died in hospital the same night. The inquest heard there was no warning on the menu that the dish she chose may contain nuts. Another . student with a nut allergy almost died last year after eating a ‘nut . free' cake which actually contained 55 per cent peanuts. Student Preethi Koshy, 22, suffered an allergic reaction from the marble cake and spent three days on a life support machine.

Arrest: Alexandru Hossu, an illegal immigrant, has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl . The former live-in trainer for Judge Judy's district attorney son has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and bragging about his connections to the family. It has also emerged that Alexandru Hossu, who is originally from Romania, is allegedly an illegal immigrant after outstaying his visa - despite working for one of New York's top lawyers. Adam Levy, the son of television personality 'Judge Judy' Scheindlin, has come under fire for employing Hossu, 35, and giving him accommodation at his million-dollar house in Putnam, New York. He has vehemently denied knowing about Hossu's immigration status and has become embroiled in a public scrap over the accusations with the sheriff of the county. Hossu was charged last week with two counts of first-degree rape after the 15-year-old daughter of a friend told a school counselor she had been sexually abused by him when she was 12. The News Journal spoke to a relative of the girl, who said 'everybody knew' that Hossu was an illegal immigrant. They added that he told everybody he was working for the district attorney. The relative, who has not been identified to protect the victim, said that Hossu met the girl's mother at a local gym a few years ago, and they struck up a serious relationship. Family: Hossu worked for Putnam District Attorney Adam Levy (center). He is pictured with his mother Judge Judy, her husband Jerry Sheindlin and children Nicole, Jonathan, Jamie and Gregory . He is accused of 'forcibly and violently' raping the 12-year-old girl twice in October 2010. It did not occur at Levy's home. While the relative asked the girl about the rape after she revealed the alleged attacks to her counselor, she simply said: 'I was told not to say anything about it.' 'I don't care if this takes down the . D.A.,' the relative told the News Journal. 'It's heartbreaking that (the . girl) carried this all by herself and didn’t tell us.' The revelations have also sparked a feud between Levy and Putnam County Sheriff Donald B. Smith, who has accused the D.A. of using his position to mislead the public. TV favourite: She is pictured speaking on her reality television courtroom series 'Judge Judy' 'In my view, Mr. Levy’s comments and actions would seem to suggest that, if he could have his own way, Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for his crime and Mr. Levy’s relationship with him would have never been brought to the light of public scrutiny,' Smith said in a statement. Levy in turn has lambasted the sheriff for claiming Hossu lived at his home. The sheriff has countered that the address on Hossu's driving license is the same as Levy's home. Levy offered two further addresses as . Hossu’s residence, which are both in Clocktower Commons, which is used for office space. One address was also used for a senator's political campaign. Levy has argued that he had 'absolutely no idea whatsoever' of Hossu's immigration status, and that an investigation with show that Hossu had a valid driver's license and Social Security number. Home: Hossu reportedly lived at Levy's million-dollar home, pictured, in Brewster. But Levy has denied knowing he was an illegal immigrant even though others said it was well known . He has asked a neighbouring county to handle the rape case because he knows the suspect. Hossu is being held in Putnam County jail in Carmel on $50,000 cash or $100,000 bond, and he is due in court on April 2. The charges will no doubt come as an embarrassment for Levy's family, including his television personality mother, Judge Judy Sheindlin. Sheindlin, 70, makes $123,000 per day for a $45 million annual salary, SFGate reported.

Tracy Dice Johnson was not notified by casualty officers after her wife was killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan, despite the fact that they were married. Because federal law defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, the military did not recognize the relationship of Army Sgt. Donna R. Johnson and Tracy Dice Johnson at all, rendering Johnson ineligible for the most basic survivor benefits, from return of the wedding ring recovered from the body to a monthly indemnity payment of $1,215. 'You cannot imagine the pain, to actually be shut out,' said Dice Johnson, an Army staff sergeant who survived five bomb explosions during a 15-month tour in Iraq. 'Not only is one of their soldiers being disrespected. Two of them are being disrespected.' Scroll down for video . Shut out: Tracy Dice Johnson holds a flag from a 'widow's box'; when her wife was killed in Afghanistan last year, the North Carolina National Guardswoman heard about it from her sister-in-law . Widow's grief: Although Donna Johnson had listed Dice as her next-of-kin, Army casualty officers informed Johnson's mother of her death first because of a federal law that prohibits the U.S. government from recognizing same-sex unions . As the Supreme Court prepares to consider the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, gay marriage advocates are focusing attention on the way they say the law dishonors gay service members and their spouses, who are denied survivor payments, plots in veterans' cemeteries, base housing and a host of other benefits that have been available to opposite-sex military couples for generations. Line of duty: Army Sgt. Donna R. Johnson was killed in Afghanistan in 2012 in a suicide bombing . If the high court strikes down the DOMA, the ruling could bring sweeping changes to the way the military treats widows and widowers such as Dice Johnson, the first person to lose a same-sex spouse to war since 'don't ask, don't tell' was lifted in 2011. Although they can now serve openly, gay and lesbian service members 'are anything but equal, and it's the DOMA that is really what's standing in the way,' said Allyson Robinson, a West Point graduate who serves as executive director of OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and veterans that filed a brief urging the court to strike down the law. On the other side stands the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, an association of faith groups that screen chaplains for military service. It has asked justices to uphold the DOMA on the grounds that pastors and service members from religions that oppose homosexuality would find their voices silenced and their opportunities for advancement limited. 'The military has no tolerance for . racists, so service members who are openly racist are not service . members for long,' the alliance's brief states. 'And if the traditional . religious views on marriage and family become the constitutional . equivalent of racism, the many service members whose traditional . religious beliefs shape their lives will be forced out of the military.' Retired . Col. Ron Crews, the group's executive director, said Congress could . find ways to honor war widows such as Dice Johnson without striking down . the DOMA, which he said had served as 'a wall' protecting military . personnel with strong religious beliefs since the ban on openly gay . service members was eliminated. Cherished: Tracy Dice Johnson holds a flag from a widow's box that platoon mates of her wife prepared during the service they had for their fallen comrade . Before he left office in February, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ordered the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to extend to same-sex partners of military personnel certain benefits not precluded by the DOMA, including ID cards giving them access to on-base services and visitation rights at military hospitals. Some of those measures would have eased Dice Johnson's grief, if they had been in place earlier. In the future, for example, same-sex survivors of service members will be eligible to receive a deceased partner's personal effects and to be presented with the folded flag at the funeral. But many of the acknowledgements available to military spouses in opposite-sex marriages remain out of reach. Last rites: A U.S. Army carry team transfers the remains of Army Sgt. Donna R. Johnson on October 1, 2012 . The widows of the two men who lost their lives alongside Johnson on October 1 heard the news from an Army casualty officer. But Dice Johnson, 43, found out from her sister-in-law. Johnson could not list her as primary next-of-kin since the government did not recognize their marriage. Former Rep. Joe Sestak, a retired Navy admiral who was the highest-ranking officer ever elected to Congress, said such inequities have implications for national security. Many financial protections and support services are offered to military families not just out of gratitude, but so service members can focus on their jobs during dangerous deployments, Sestak said. 'When you step back and all of a sudden realize that a law would actually prevent, today, the spouse of somebody in our military (being) notified first that that solider or that sailor has been harmed or killed ... you sit back there and say, 'What's going on?'' he said. Dice Johnson and her wife had been together six years when they decided to get married. They waited until the military lifted the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and then exchanged vows last year on Valentine's Day in Washington, D.C. Unrecognized: The death certificate of Tracy Dice Johnson's wife, Donna Johnson, indicates single, despite them being married . Soon after, Johnson volunteered for a second tour of duty, despite pleas from her wife and mother. 'There are a handful of things you can't tell your heart not to do. One is to serve your country, and the other is not to love who you love,' Dice Johnson said. Johnson had been in Afghanistan only a few weeks when a man wearing a vest packed with explosives drove a motorcycle into a group of soldiers on patrol in a market area in the city of Khost. Johnson was killed, along with two other members of the 514th Military Police Company, a translator, six Afghan police officers and six civilians. When Dice Johnson learned that uniformed officers were at the North Carolina home of her mother-in-law and father-in-law, she grabbed her marriage certificate and raced over there. Johnson had requested that her wife be the first to hear in the event of her death, she said. Fight for your rights: Protesters camp out in front of the Supreme Court hoping to get a seat in the courtroom when the high court hears the marriage equality cases referred to as Prop 8 on 26 March and DOMA on 27 March in Washington D.C. 'I wanted to make sure they saw my face, even if they weren't going to notify me,' she said. The notification officer assured her he had planned to visit her, too. Johnson's mother, Sandra Johnson, knew how happy her daughter was to be married to Dice Johnson, and the fact that her daughter-in-law was not recognized as such outraged her. As primary next-of-kin, she made sure Dice Johnson was recognized as her daughter's wife, including insisting that she be allowed to accompany a military escort with her daughter's body. 'They hemmed and hawed, hemmed and hawed, and I said, 'You will accept Tracy going up there because she will be our liaison. She will bring our daughter home, and she will bring her wife home,' ' Johnson said. One of Dice Johnson's duties as the escort was to take possession of her wife's property, including a velvet bag containing the wedding ring and St. Michael's medallion Johnson was wearing when she was killed. Equality: Marriage equality supporters take part in a march and rally ahead of US Supreme Court arguments on legalizing same-sex marriage in New York on March 24 . She was instructed to pass them on to her mother-in-law's casualty assistance officer. The night before she did, she slept with the jewelry, unsure if she would see the possessions again. The officer delivered them to Sandra Johnson, who immediately gave them back to her daughter-in-law. 'Every little step was a shaky step,' said Dice Johnson. 'You are definitely on uncertain ground.' Dice Johnson does not fault the Army. From the casualty officer to National Guard commanders, everyone did 'the best they could,' she said. In some instances, she was even surprised at her support. The condolence letter she received from President Barack Obama acknowledged Johnson as her wife. If the DOMA is overturned before the one-year anniversary of the attack, Dice Johnson may become eligible for monthly survivor benefits, guaranteed health insurance and other financial compensation.

American Airlines could be heading for bankruptcy protection as its parent company’s share price today plummeted 33 per cent to an eight-year low. The only way American Airlines can now return to profitability is to use the bankruptcy court to cut its huge costs, some Wall Street analysts warned. It comes amid a gloomy outlook for the airline industry worldwide and a concerning announcement last week that 129 American pilots had retired. Stormy outlook: Some Wall Street analysts said the only way American Airlines can now return to profitability is to use the bankruptcy court to cut its costs . Shares of parent company AMR tumbled 33 per cent on Monday to close at $1.98 and the stock price is down more than 75 per cent this year. AMR shares have not closed below the $2 mark since 2003. Stocks for the entire U.S. airline industry have fallen 40 per cent for the year. ‘For a long time, I've thought that the company has been at a disadvantage,’ Morningstar airline analyst Basili Alukos said. He said American must go through bankruptcy to bring its labour or debt in line with the lower costs of competitors. American is the only major airline that has lost money this year, losing a whopping $286million in the second quarter alone. But Maxim Group airline specialist Ray Neidl countered: ‘It's been a tremendous overreaction today in my opinion. Monday: AMR shares have not closed below the $2 mark since 2003 . Five-day: Shares of American Airlines parent company AMR tumbled 33 per cent on Monday to close at $1.98 after a terrible five-day spell in New York . 2011: The AMR stock price is down more than 75 per cent since this year began . ‘American does have big problems to solve, but they have plenty of time to do it.’ The airline said bankruptcy is ‘certainly not our goal or our preference’. 'For a long time, I've thought that the company has been at a disadvantage' Basili AlukosMorningstar airline analyst . ‘We know we need to improve our results, and we have a sense of urgency as we work to achieve that,’ it added. The airline is expected to end the third quarter with a healthy $4.3billion in cash reserves. As of late June, AMR had about $9.77 billion in liabilities. But Mr Alukos said the airline still ‘may not be able to satisfy all of its future commitments on its current fiscal trajectory'. ‘We are placing AMR under review as we reassess the company's ability to remain solvent,' he added. Falling: Shares of parent firm AMR tumbled 30 per cent on Monday afternoon and the stock price is down more than 75 per cent this year . Some on Wall Street viewed high numbers of American pilot retirements as a sign that senior employees are fearful for the company's health. At the start of the weekend 129 pilots . put in their retirement papers. The prior month saw 111 pilots retire. During a typical month 10 pilots retire. 'We know we need to improve our results, and we have a sense of urgency as we work to achieve that' American Airlines . But David J. Bates, president of the pilots union for American said the retirements have nothing to do with the health of the airline. ‘A lot of it is pure economics,’ Mr Bates said. A provision in the pilots' retirement benefits allows them to lock in the value of some of their investments going back 60 to 90 days. Pilots who retire now can therefore avoid the summer stock market slump. Travel down: The International Air Transport Association said airline traffic slowed in August compared with July, with the total passenger market down 1.6 per cent . Mr Bates reiterated his confidence in the company's finances saying, ‘I don't see any immediate liquidity concerns.’ Stocks slumped in heavy volume to a 13-month low on Monday as investors dumped bank shares on fears that Greece's worsening financial crisis could cause a large European lender to fail. Markets have feared European officials will be unable to prevent Greece's fiscal crisis from turning into a global banking crisis. The Dow dropped 258 points, or 2.36 per cent, to 10,655; the S&P 500 fell 32 points, or 2.85 per cent, to 1,099; and the Nasdaq lost 80 points, or 3.29 per cent, to 2,336. Not everybody sees the airline heading to bankruptcy court. ‘Management has indicated time and time again that they have no interest in filing,’ said Helane Becker, an analyst with Dahlman Rose. While most major U.S. airlines filed for bankruptcy protection early last decade, American chose to avoid restructuring. It also avoided a reorganisation when fuel prices spiked and travel declined in 2008 and 2009. Meanwhile, experts warn that an economic downturn could hit travel demand just as airlines are beginning to recover. The International Air Transport Association said airline traffic slowed in August on July, with the total passenger market down 1.6 per cent.","Parent company AMR's price drops 33 per cent in a day .

Dressed up: Rachael Martin arrived at the Truro Crown Court in Cornwall smartly dressed and appeared to be wearing expensive jewellery and carrying a designer handbag . A young bank clerk who stole £46,000 from her employer to help achieve her dream of becoming a model told police she had earned the money from working as an escort. Mother-of-one and law graduate Rachael Martin, 24, ‘spent money like water' after getting a job with Barclays  in Liskeard, Cornwall, where she was responsible for dealing with cheques. The stolen cash paid for a breast . enlargement, thought to be worth £4,000, dental work worth £1,700, and . liposuction, as well as nights out, drink and drugs. She has now been jailed after stealing £46,000 in just two months from her employers. Extravagances . included £1,687.95 at the Windsor Place dental surgery in Liskeard, and . £500 on unspecified cosmetic surgery at Harley Medical, the court . heard. Martin also lavished £670 at exclusive jewellers Tiffany, and £506 on a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes. When she was arrested, Martin, . from St Austell in Cornwall, told police she earned money as an escort . in Bristol, adding that she was ‘a common prostitute’. But the claim was a cover for her criminal behaviour, said prosecutor Iain Leadbetter. Recorder . Jeremy Wright jailed Martin, who has an eight-year-old son, for . 52 weeks, telling her she had demonstrated a ‘concerted, clever and . serious breach of trust’. Mr Wright said he gave Martin credit for pleaded guilty to 25 counts of theft - on the day her trial was due to start. He said he had to make a judgment on whether society's interests in jailing Martin prevailed over those of her child. He said: ‘I am told you spent the money on cosmetic surgery, drink and drugs and having a good time. ‘Your activity has been aggravated, . to some extent, by the fact that suspicion would automatically be thrown . on others, even if no other investigation took place. ‘You are not [your son's] sole carer, you leave him in the care of your parents whenever you like. ‘Considering the seriousness of the crime... it seems to me a mockery if I didn't send you to prison right away.' The court heard Martin had suffered with some 'issues' since the age of 11. Her . behaviour had been described as manic, and she had previously . demonstrated signs of 'sexual disinhibition and self-destruction', her . counsel, Michael Melville-Shreeve, told Truro Crown Court. Prosecuting, . Mr Leadbetter said Martin began working at the Liskeard branch of . Barclays in March 2010. Her role, he told the court, was to deal with . agents from the Provident, taking their cheques in exchange for cash. However, . between September 2 and October 29 that year, he said she had stolen . £46,000 after entering details relating to previously banked cheques . into the system. Rachael Martin, 24, posing left and right, used the cash to fund dental surgery, breast surgery and liposuction in the hope of becoming a model . She had also purposefully logged incorrect sums in . order to siphon off extra cash. She typically stole £1,000 or £2,000 at a time, putting the funds into her . own account. On one occasion she took £6,000. 'She spent money like water,' he told the court. 'She spent an inordinate amount of money . at a nail bar, over and over again. But it has . all gone, every penny. 'During police interview, she made a complete denial (of being responsible for the theft). 'She was to say: ""I have done nothing wrong, I'm not stupid."" 'She . described that she had earned a lot of money as an escort, ""a common . prostitute"", she said. She would go to Bristol. But when she did go to . Bristol, it was on spending sprees.' Law graduate: Mother-of-one Martin, pictured left modelling and right at court in July, stole £46,000 from a Barclays bank branch over two months . Defending, Mr Melville-Shreeve said Martin was of previous good character, barring a reprimand in 2003, aged 15, for stealing a bottle of vodka. She had graduated with debts of around £21,000, he said, but was now on the verge of bankruptcy, with her financial woes having nearly quadrupled. 'She is not the ordinary, run-of-the-mill person by any means,' he said. 'She was a very sad and unusual person (from the age of 11). 'There is a medical health issue in her background. Her spending has been, quite literally, manic. She has bought things, the consumer detritus that shops are full of. 'She has lost her reputation, lost her job, with no realistic prospect of employment.' Sentencing Martin, of St Austell, to 52 weeks in prison, Mr Wright said: 'You are still only 24 years old, you have a long history of medical problems. These problems are clearly things to do with attention seeking as much as anything else.'

Criticism: Sir Andrew, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Poet Laureate for ten years until 2009, called the Government's National Planning Policy Framework a 'charter for builders' Radical new planning laws are causing ‘irreversible damage’ to the countryside, the former Poet Laureate warned last night. Sir Andrew Motion called the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework a ‘charter for builders’ which would lead to the loss of priceless countryside. His comments coincide with the full introduction today of the system – which ministers say will cut red tape and boost development. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles briefed the Cabinet on the changes yesterday, saying they would encourage thousands of projects. But conservation groups warn councils are not prepared for new rules, leaving valuable land vulnerable to inappropriate development. Sir Andrew, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Poet Laureate for ten years until 2009, said tearing up planning laws would not solve the housing crisis. ‘I don’t think this Government wants to wreck the countryside, but it is going to do so unless it changes course,’ he said. ‘Today the National Planning Policy Framework comes into full force and it is proving to be groundbreaking in all the wrong ways. ‘Developing greenfield sites unnecessarily and with inadequate local consultation is entirely the wrong way to make sure we get the new homes the country so badly needs. ‘This is a charter for builders and truly irreversible damage is already underway. It is urgent that something is done about it.

Development: Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary, briefed the Cabinet on the changes yesterday, saying they would encourage thousands of projects . From today it will be the default planning guidance in local authorities which have not adopted tailored plans setting out where housing and other development should go. The latest figures show 30 per cent of councils have not published such local plans, while a further 20 per cent are still waiting for approval. National Trust spokesman James Lloyd said: ‘Half of England has no plans in place . . . Local authorities must be given more time. ‘We are not against development but we want to see development  in the right places. If we want to  regenerate cities and protect our precious green spaces for future  generations to enjoy we must build on brownfield sites first.’ Default: From today the framework will be the default planning guidance in local authorities which have not adopted tailored plans setting out where housing and other development should go . But ministers insist the changes – which slash 1,000 pages of planning guidance to 50 – protect picturesque areas. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ‘Very strong protections are in place to safeguard the Green Belt and other important areas. ‘Planning approvals are up but there has been no increase in appeals. Councils should focus on getting up-to-date locally decided plans in place, and seven out of ten already have published plans.’","Sir Andrew Motion slated Government’s National Planning Policy Framework .

Throughout their schooldays, their interests and talents were as indistinguishable as their looks. So when, tragically, Christopher was left trapped in a vegetative state after a horrific car accident when the boys were just 16, Andrew knew that as his twin, he was  the right person to speak on his brother’s behalf. And in 2009, three years after the crash, it was Andrew who made the heart-wrenching decision to end his brother’s life. After the accident in 2006 Chris initially still had some brain activity and would respond to simple commands . Twins Andrew (left) and Chris (right) shared an intuition which Andrew felt keenly when Chris was in a coma . With the full support of his mother . Helen and older sister Emma, Andrew went to the High Court seeking . permission to withdraw Christopher’s nutrition and hydration. Two years . later, after tests were completed, the court agreed and on December 7, . 2010, Christopher died peacefully in a hospice. It is only now that Andrew, 23, feels able to talk about what happened and his role in the decision. ‘Every . time I saw Chris, it was like looking at a mirror image of myself,’ he . says. ‘It was like watching  myself die. But if it had been me lying . there, I’d have wanted him to do the same. ‘I feel very empty without him. As . though I have lost a part of myself. But the extraordinary thing is the . moment he died, without realising it, I seem to have taken on his . mannerisms. 'Apparently I now walk, cough and laugh just like him. I have told Mum I shall now have to live for the both of us.’ Andrew and his mother Helen (right) decided three years later that ending life support was the right thing to do . Andrew (left) and his twin Chris (right) pictured with their mother Helen on a family holiday as children . Andrew . and Christopher, from Lutterworth in Leicestershire, were boarders at . Kingham Hill School in the Cotswolds at the time of the accident. They . had spent the weekend with family friends nearby. Their parents – . Peter, an accountant, and Helen – were divorcing and it was a difficult . time. Alastair Godfrey, 19, . the son of the family friend, offered to drive the twins and another . schoolfriend, Hannah Jenkins, back to school on the Sunday evening of . April 30. Christopher and . Andrew piled into the back of Alastair’s Renault Clio.  Hannah sat in . the front. Andrew put on his seatbelt, Christopher did not.  ‘Alastair . drove along the narrow country roads and into the school grounds,’ Andrew recalls, ‘but we went over a hill too quickly and smashed into a . 4x4 driven by one of the school’s groundkeepers. Identical twins Andrew (left) and Chris (right) Watson at the age of four . ‘I remember spinning around in the car and was then unconscious for a few minutes. ‘When I came around, I decided to get help from school and as I wandered down the road, I saw Chris lying curled up about 15 yards from the car. He was breathing but it was very shallow. ‘I was in such a state of shock, I initially couldn’t work out why he was there. It was only later I heard he had been thrown out of the car. ‘He and Alastair, who tragically died that night, were quickly taken away by ambulance. ‘Another ambulance took Hannah – who fortunately wasn’t too badly hurt – and me to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 'I had some internal bruising. Chris was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. After a week, Mum told me that he wasn’t in good shape so I went to see him.’ Andrew pauses and looks down at his hands in his lap. ‘I couldn’t stay with him for more than five minutes on that first occasion. ‘I don’t think anyone can understand what it is like seeing your identical twin like that because it looks as if it is you. ‘He had two massive black eyes, his head was shaved and there were tubes attached to him everywhere. It could so easily have been me, if I hadn’t put my seatbelt on, and I felt knocked off my feet for a long time. I sat and cried in the hospital waiting room. ‘It was also so heartbreaking to realise that something like this could happen in a blink of an eye. ‘One minute we were having a laugh on the way back to school and the next... ‘I gradually got more used to seeing him and on regular occasions while he was in an induced coma, I would hold his hand and talk to him and the nurses would tell me his blood pressure went down and he seemed more relaxed. That helped relax me. ‘I stayed at boarding school, but thought about him all the time. Because of our telepathic connection, when I couldn’t sleep or felt very agitated, I knew something was wrong. 'I would then phone Mum to ask about him and it usually turned out that he had had an epileptic fit. It was the weirdest experience. Andrew (left) and Chris (right) pictured with their sister Emma in 2005, one year before the accident . 'Chris still had some brain activity initially and would respond to simple commands, but sometimes when I thought I’d seen something, the nurses said they hadn’t.’ Shortly afterwards, Christopher was operated on for a ruptured stomach and from then on tests recorded zero brain activity. As well as developing epilepsy, Christopher had several strokes. His immune system shut down and he suffered from meningitis, MRSA and chest and urinary infections. In 2008, Andrew, his mother and sister met doctors and they mentioned that withdrawing feeding was an option. Andrew felt positive about the idea. ‘It was heart-wrenching to watch Chris’s physical deterioration. He had no dignity and could not communicate, which is no way for anybody to live,’ says Andrew. Christopher (left) and Andrew (right) with their sister Emma . ‘Mum signed a “Do not resuscitate” order and we took the decision as a family to withdraw feeding and let nature take its course. I had to force myself not to focus on the emotional side, as I didn’t want Chris to feel any of that when I went to see him. ‘I believed strongly that as Chris couldn’t make the decision for himself, I had to think for him. When you see someone who could do everything become completely helpless, you know it is no way to live.’ The court agreed in November 2010 that feeding could be withdrawn but the family then ran into another problem. ‘The lady who ran the care home in Leicester where Chris spent three years said she didn’t think it was the right thing to do and wouldn’t allow it to happen there. So we had to find a hospice to move him to. ‘At the hospice, he survived for ten days and died early on December 7. Mum went into his room first and I caught a glimpse of him through the door. It made me feel I had been hit by a giant stone. ‘But I told myself I had to go in. I said a final goodbye and a final  “I love you” then left in disbelief – because I had lost the most important person in my life.’","Twins Andrew and Christopher Watson were in the same car accident .

"By . Barry Norman . PUBLISHED: . 19:55 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:57 EST, 26 March 2013 . The first sex scene I ever saw in the movies that left me vaguely gobsmacked was the moment in Darling when Dirk Bogarde performed a sex act on Julie Christie. We didn’t see the act itself, merely the strongest possible suggestion of it, but that was astonishing enough. For this was back in 1965 when the censorship rules were just beginning to be relaxed, and daring sexual stuff was still uncommon in the cinemas. Raunchy: Dirk Bogarde and Julie Christie in Darling which was made just as censorship rules were beginning to be relaxed . From there, of course, the movies went on to ever greater licence, culminating in what is probably the most famous (or perhaps that should be notorious) sex scene — the sequence in 1992’s Basic Instinct when Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs to reveal that she isn’t wearing any underwear. That one brief flash, which defined Stone’s career and boosted her to A-list stardom, caused a great kerfuffle. She agreed to do it, she told me, because the director Paul Verhoeven had persuaded her that this simple, startling act proved that she had total control over all the goggle-eyed men in the room with her. Flash: Sharon Stone became an A-list superstar after that scene in Basic Instinct . This, however, was nonsense. Verhoeven asked her to do it because he knew it would arouse controversy, this being the first time cinema audiences had ever seen a movie star’s private parts in quite such intimate detail. But that occurred 20 years ago — a more innocent age before the internet — and now it seems we will not be seeing its like again. Not in the immediate future anyway. According to recent reports, Hollywood has decided that sex, far from being here to stay, is now dead as far as audience interest is concerned, and that there is more money to be made from special effects-dominated blockbusters. No more raunchy sex on the big screen? I can live happily with that because I’ve never regarded sex as a spectator sport. The energetic, simulated rumpy-pumpy of two complete strangers, however attractive, when viewed from the detached comfort of a cinema seat — cool drink in one hand, popcorn in the other — is, let’s face it, faintly ludicrous. It is, in my experience, more likely to raise a grin than anything else. This is not to say that sex scenes cannot be effective and memorable. Some have entered cultural folklore, such as one sexual encounter between Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider in Last Tango In Paris, which is said to have increased the sales of butter —though not necessarily for use on toast. Or the moment in a coffee shop in When Harry Met Sally, when Meg Ryan simulates an orgasm in front of Billy Crystal, causing another customer to tell the waitress: ‘I’ll have what she’s having’. Those sequences are memorable for different reasons — the first one because it’s genuinely shocking, the second because it’s very funny. Then there are other controversial sex scenes, like those in Don’t Look Now in 1973 when the carnal encounters of Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie were so lustily convincing as to cause a rumour to spread that, golly, they really did it. Unfortunately, bad sex movies also tend to stick in the mind. If you ever had the misfortune to see that great turkey Gigli, you will probably recall a lengthy bedroom encounter between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Memorable: The scene in When Harry Met Sally went down in movie history when Meg Ryan simulates an orgasm in front of Billy Crystal . I’m afraid that left me (and, I suspect, the audience) cold because even though Lopez was Affleck’s squeeze at the time, there seemed to be no empathy between them at all. And then there was 9 ½ Weeks — the supposedly ground-breaking 1986 erotic drama in which Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger were at it so often that I grew positively bored. And the scenes of mental violence when he makes her crawl about like a dog and watch while he sleeps with a prostitute were hard to take. For the great disadvantage of graphic sex scenes, whether done well or not, is that for better or worse you tend to remember them rather than the rest of the film. Besides, in the past 30 years or so, with the advent of looser censorship allowing filmmakers to show pretty much what they want, the cardinal rule that less is often more seems to have been forgotten — in other words that what is implied can be far more arousing than what is explicit. Reel love: Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat in The 39 Steps . I still maintain that one of the most erotic scenes in cinema history is to be found in Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps, released in 1935. Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll, handcuffed together — for reasons too complicated to go into here — and on the run from the bad guys, seek refuge, rain-drenched, in a small hotel. There she takes off her stockings and as she unrolls them his hand follows down the line of her leg without ever touching her. That was far more effective than any number of shots of heaving bodies, because everything was left to the audience’s imagination. For that reason, I won’t lament the decline of sex scenes in modern films, though the reasons for that decline — money being the dominant one — do worry me. Films with raunchy sex scenes are likely to be given stringent certificates, which bar under-15s from the cinema. And in an age when the target audience for the Hollywood studios in particular is those aged from 12 up to 18, that means a serious loss of revenue. These days, the film-makers argue — and this is another reason why sex is now less common on screen — that even pre-teens have seen much more graphic acts on the internet, and aren’t remotely interested in watching tamer stuff in the cinema. The time when teenagers got much of their sex education from the movies — because an adult would never have dreamt of discussing it with them —has long gone, and they have nothing to learn from anything on offer in the local picture palace. Then there’s a third reason why film producers, far from demanding sex scenes as they once did, are now ruthlessly cutting them from screenplays. And that is because women, who increasingly decide which films they and their partners will watch, are fed up with seeing themselves depicted not only as sex objects but often as the victims of sexual assault, as in Lars von Trier’s Breaking The Waves, in which Emily Watson is gang-raped. Instead, Hollywood executives seem to have decided we should be force-fed ever more CGI-dominated action epics which they believe will appeal to that core young audience, even if those special effects only serve to swamp the story and the characters. Frankly, I could do without most of them as well. In fact, I’d take The 39 Steps any day.","Raunchy movies like Basic Instinct are no longer popular among fans .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 13 July 2011 . Senator Jay Rockefeller said he was 'concerned' that phone-hacking may have extended to 9/11 victims or other Americans . The News Corp crisis went global today as a Senator called for a U.S. hacking probe and their Australian boss ordered a review of all editorial spending. It emerged today that News International executives have met to discuss selling off their remaining three remaining titles The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. But there are no obvious buyers for the papers - and the executives agreed to revisit the issue in six months time, the Wall Street Journal revealed. Today News Corp's Australian branch announced they would investigate all payments they had made for stories over the last three years as the scandal spread. In America, Senator John Rockefeller last night called for a probe into whether the company had been trying to access voicemails in America and he suggested 9/11 victims could have been targeted. The 74-year-old politician said the . closure of the News of the World raised 'serious questions' about . whether the newspaper's parent company had broken U.S. law. 'I am concerned that the admitted phone hacking in London by the News . Corp may have extended to 9/11 victims or other Americans,' he said.  'If they did, the consequences will be severe.' However, the Senator, chairman of the committee on commerce, science and transportation, did not provide any specific evidence to back up his claims. News Corp is based in New York, and owns the Wall Street Journal, New . York Post, and Fox Broadcasting. Les Hinton, the chief executive of . Dow Jones and one of Mr Murdoch's most trusted aides jetted into London . yesterday as the phone hacking fallout continues. He was at the tycoon's Mayfair home yesterday along with Elisabeth Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks. Today the boss of News Corp's Australian division, John Hartigan, said all editorial payments made over the last three years will be investigated. News Limited own eight of the 12 major papers in Australia including the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph and The Australian. Mr Hartigan, chairman and chief executive of subsidiary company News Limited, said in an email to staff it was 'offensive' to link them to the News of the World scandal. He said there was 'absolutely no reason' to believe they were involved in any wrongdoing. 'We will be conducting a thorough review of all editorial expenditure over the past three years to confirm that payments to contributors and other third parties were for legitimate services,' he said. Rupert Murdoch, left, and Elisabeth Murdoch, right, leave a restaurant in Notting Hill last night on the day the media mogul was ordered to appear before a powerful committee of MPs . 'Policies, codes and guidelines are important. But what matters is conduct. 'I . have absolutely no reason to suspect any wrongdoing at News Limited. However, I believe it is essential that we can all have absolute . confidence that ethical work practices are a fundamental requirement of . employment at News Limited.' He added in the email that a television station had apologised for incorrectly reporting that News Limited executives were suspected of involvement in the News of the World phone hacking. Yesterday . News Corporation announced a £3billion plan to buy back hundreds of . millions of shares, which have fallen sharply in value amid the . escalating crisis at his British newspaper division. More . than £4.3billion has been wiped off the value of the company since last . week due to fears that fallout from the phone-hacking investigation at . News International will infect other parts of Mr Murdoch’s business. Senior News Corp executive Les Hinton jetted into London yesterday as the scandal rages. Here he is pictured leaving his apartment in Mayfair . News . of the buy-back provided a temporary prop for the sagging News Corp . share price, which rose for the first time in five days. But . the ploy is unlikely to placate shareholders, who have become . increasingly alarmed at Mr Murdoch’s lax stewardship of the company, in . the longer term. Ministers are also understood to be . desperate to find a way to block his bid while trying not to offend the . powerful tycoon. His . business has also been hit by a class action lawsuit by News Corps . shareholders over claims bosses failed to properly investigate phone . hacking taking place at the News of the World, which was shut down on . Sunday. However, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt's move . to delay the Sky bid on Monday afternoon could potentially salvage the . deal, which had looked on the brink of collapse in the morning, . according to City analysts. Speculation . is mounting that the tycoon may have to relinquish day-to-day control . of the company in a bid to draw a line under the crisis – and his son . James, who runs all of News Corp’s businesses outside the US, could also . come under pressure to stand down as chairman of satellite giant BSkyB. The past week has severely damaged . News Corp’s bid to gain full control of Sky, and may see the media giant . forced to sell off part of its stake in the satellite firm. If it fails Ofcom’s ‘fit and proper’ test, the media regulator could . order News Corp to reduce its slice from 39 per cent to 29 per cent. City sources said James Murdoch’s handling of the crisis has all but shattered his hopes of succeeding his father. Analysts also said it frees Mr Hunt from a politically explosive conundrum. If . he had blocked the deal, or called in the Competition Commission . himself, he could have faced a legal challenge from News Corp. But if he had waved the takeover through, he risked triggering a wave of public fury. Jeremy Hunt, right, was left with no choice to refer the case to the Competition Commission following the decision, and ends Ed Miliband's threat to call for a vote of confidence if the Government did not call time on the takeover . The investigation will take at least six months. Senior . Lib Dem MP Don Foster, the party’s former culture spokesman, described . the move as a ‘ruse’ designed to buy ‘breathing space’. He added: ‘This is the best Murdoch can do to keep the possibility of the merger on the table. ‘By . dropping the News of the World, he can say his involvement in news and . current affairs in Britain has actually diminished and argue that the . issue of media plurality has disappeared. ‘There . is nothing to prevent Ofcom, however, from investigating whether or not . the Murdoch empire is fit and proper to own even the 39 per cent of . BSkyB it already owns.’ Mark Kelly, at stockbroker Olivetree . Securities, said: ‘News Corp is smoothing the way for the Government . here – keeping friends in power by making the decision for them.’ Louise . Cooper, of City broking firm BGC Partners, said Murdoch had given Hunt . ‘some wriggle room’ and avoided a ‘potentially damaging’ confidence vote . in the House of Commons tomorrow. Labour leader Ed Miliband had threatened to force a vote if the Government did not call time on the proposed takeover. Preventing . a parliamentary debate where fresh attacks could have been levelled . against his papers was a ‘smart move by an operator who is rapidly . taking back control of the situation’, she added. However, . the chances of News Corp buying the 61 per cent of Sky it does not . already own have tumbled with each new startling revelation. Sky . shares plunged 5 per cent yesterday and a staggering £2.4billion has . been wiped off the value of the satellite giant over the past week. Alex DeGroote, at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said the likelihood of the deal going ahead had reduced. Hugh Grant now provides Britain’s moral compass following the outbreak, a comedian joked on the Daily Show in the U.S. last night. Jon Stewart, pictured left, pretended to vomit as correspondent John Oliver, right, explained the News of the World had hacked into Milly Dowler’s phone and deleted answerphone messages. Oliver joked that after Notting Hill star Hugh Grant was now the most honourable man in Britain after he helped expose the scandal. ‘The guy who got car head from an LA road prostitute is now the moral compass of my nation,’ he said. Presenter Jon Stewart was incredulous in the clip as he was told that police had been paid by journalists – and disgraced editor Andy Coulson had been employed by David Cameron. He said: ‘On Friday we cut our probability of the deal going ahead to . 50:50 from 90:10 in favour. This seems very optimistic now. Our new . assessment is 10:90 in favour. In other words, we believe the deal is . all but dead.’ He also . raised the possibility of a forced divestiture – sale, liquidation or . spin off – of News Corp’s 39 per cent shareholding in BSkyB. He added: ‘If the “fit and proper” test is applied rigidly by Ofcom and events elsewhere worsen, it could become a factor.’ It . is now alleged that as many as 4,000 people had their phones hacked by . private investigators working for the News Of The World. Speculation . grew today that the red top would be replaced by The Sun On Sunday . after the domain name was transferred to News International from the . company who bought it last week. In . a further development this afternoon MPs will vote on a Labour motion . urging News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch to withdraw his bid to take . over the whole of BSkyB. Tomorrow's . motion tabled by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who today met the family of . murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, states that 'this House believes that . it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to . withdraw their bid for BSkyB'. News . International also said today it would co-operate after Rebekah Brooks, . Rupert Murdoch and his son James were asked to appear before a . committee of MPs. The . Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee asked the trio to give evidence . about the phone hacking and police payments scandals at a hearing next . week. A spokeswoman for .

A grieving daughter spent eight months sleeping next to the body of her dead mother in their one-bedroom flat because she could not afford to bury her, it emerged today. The grim living arrangement only came to light after bailiffs were sent to the property, in Munich, Germany, to recover debts left by the 70-year-old pensioner to find her decomposing corpse on a sofa bed in the flat's only bedroom. Most tragically however, her daughter, who had been living on unemployment benefits, was apparently unaware that she would not have been expected to stump up for the funeral in any case, police said. Needless: Tragically, the daughter, 39, from Munich, was apparently unaware that Germans unable to afford a relative's funeral can apply for a 3,200 euro state grant to cover the cost . In Germany, those unable to pay for a relative's funeral can apply for €3,200 from the state to cover the cost. The 39-year-old daughter has been sectioned at a psychiatric facility at her own request, police said. Detectives are now investigating whether she had been fraudulently claiming her mother's pension while secretly harbouring the cadaver at home. Grim discovery: The grim find only came after bailiffs were sent to the property, in the Moosach district of Munich, Germany, to recover debts left by the 70-year-old pensioner to find her decomposing corpse on a sofa bed in the flat's only bedroom . The pensioner died last July saddling her daughter with large debts. Apparently unable to cope with either the death of her mother or the subsequent burden of debt, she kept it secret from the world. But as the arrears mounted, a bailiff from the district court was dispatched the one-bedroom flat, in the city's Moosach district, on Thursday to search for objects of value to settle the bill. When the woman told them her mother was in fact dead they called the police who forced their way into the apartment and found the body. While it is still unclear if the woman had been claiming her mother's pension handouts, investigators said they did not believe that was the reason for her failure to report the death.","Body found after bailiffs went to flat, in Munich, Germany, to recover debts .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 07:39 EST, 17 January 2012 . A landlord tried to rent out an 8ft by 8ft garden shed for £450-per-month as a 'double room in a garden house'. Homeowner Greg Farkas was forced to withdraw the advert after realising it fell foul of planning laws - despite a flood of interest from prospective tenants. The shed on the outskirts of Oxford would have had no electricity or plumbing but . tenants would have been permitted to use the kitchen, bathroom and washing . machine in the main semi-detached house. 'Double room in a garden house': The £450-per-month shed that Greg Farkas tried to rent out in Oxford . Mr Farkas, 34, said he had more than 20 inquiries before he withdrew the advert in an area where the average house price is £230,000. The Hungarian lorry driver ordered the shed for £800 and laid concrete for it to rest on. However, it was never installed. The full text of the advert read: 'Nice . location near Florence Park, bus-stops and shopping centers are nearby. £450 per month all included. 'There is a lot of space in this brand new . insulated garden house. Nice kitchen, bathroom, microwave, internet, . washing machine all included. 'It's a garden house so you use the . facilities coming in a few steps from the garden.' Mr Farkas said yesterday that he had no option but to withdraw the advert. Not so sweet home: The 8ft by 8ft 'double room' which more than 20 people inquired about renting . 'I had no idea about the planning laws when I advertised the garden house,' he said. 'I had a large space in the garden, I . fully intended to insulate the garden house and give tenants full access . to the house facilities. 'I only had the advert up for two days but I must have got over 20 inquiries from people interested in renting it out. 'Some were students currently living . in Oxford but many were professional people with full-time jobs who just . can't afford to live in their current properties. 'Other potential tenants liked the idea of saving money while they saved for a deposit to buy a house.' Oxford City Council said he would have . to apply for planning permission for a new dwelling before he could . rent the shed out to tenants. Shed with a bed: The £800 shed was supposed to stand on this concrete patch in Mr Farkas' garden. However, the advert has now been withdrawn and the shed is no longer there . Under building regulations, local authorities cannot stop homeowners from erecting free-standing single-storey structures such as sheds - even very sophisticated ones . But if the building is designed specifically as somewhere to sleep, councils across Britain will demand that a planning application is made. If a shed was rented as a home - and authorities found out - they would have the right to tear down the structure. However, there are thousands of sheds in Britain that could be used to house individuals - and even families - and councils rarely act. A spokeswoman for Oxford City Council said: 'For immediate use . of a garden building as a dwelling or ancillary accommodation, planning . permission must be sought.' Demand: Converted sheds and huge outhouses are common in some urban areas, such as Southall, west London, a district with a large Asian population. Unscrupulous landlords are said to rent out the bedsits to immigrants . Council leaders said the case highlights the 'dire' shortage of affordable housing in the university city. Council board member for housing . need, Joe McManners said: 'I think this demonstrates how dire Oxford's . housing crisis is that people are charging a large amount of money for . what essentially looks like a shed. 'It is indicative of the shortage of housing to be rented at affordable rates.'Cllr McManners added: 'You do hear anecdotally about people who rent out their sheds or make funny little extensions. 'It's difficult to know the exact scale of it but it is not acceptable in the 21st century for people to be living in sheds.'","Greg Farkas, 34, said he had more than 20 inquiries about renting it .

One of the the corroded F-1 engines from Apollo's Saturn V rocket, which sat more than 4 kilometers below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean . The engines were discovered on the seabed using a robotic submarine - and were today recovered . Jeff Bezos also has his own exploration firm, Bezos Expeditions, which made the discovery.

The boss of Google last night said he was ‘very proud’ of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year. Taxpayers were left to fund the shortfall after Google contributed just £6million to government coffers – despite making sales of £2.6billion. MPs on the influential Public Accounts Committee last month slammed the group’s methods as ‘immoral’. Google chairman Eric Schmidt said he was 'very proud' of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year . But when asked about the arrangement which saw the group funnel billions of pounds to Bermuda, a renowned tax haven, the company’s chairman Eric Schmidt said: ‘It’s called capitalism.’ Mr Schmidt, who is estimated to be worth £4.6billion, said: ‘We pay lots of taxes; we pay them in the legally prescribed ways. ‘I am very proud of the structure that we set up. We did it based on the incentives that the governments offered us to operate. ‘It’s called capitalism. ‘We are proudly capitalistic. I’m not confused about this.’ But Business Secretary Vince Cable was unimpressed by Mr Schmidt’s views, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'It may well be [capitalism] but it’s certainly not the job of governments to accommodate it.' Chancellor George Osborne has revealed of measures to bolster HMRC's collecting powers . His claims will gall the millions of families who are being hit by austerity and the biggest squeeze on living standards in a generation. The current tax gap – the gulf between what is owed and the amount that has been collected – stands at a staggering £32billion. It is not the first time Mr Schmidt has derided the British tax system and its loopholes. He previously invoked rage by saying the company was obliged only to pay the legal minimum. ‘We could pay more [UK] tax but we would have to do so voluntarily,’ he said last year. Yesterday’s comments come days after it emerged the internet giant funnelled more than £6billion into tax-haven Bermuda last year. The figure is almost double the amount the company was hiding offshore three years ago, official company documents show. By sheltering the money it avoided more than £1billion in taxes on its worldwide operations. Last week the Chancellor announced he would bring in a general anti-abuse rule to clamp down on tax avoidance – which is legal but viewed as morally questionable. In his Autumn Statement, George Osborne unveiled a raft of measures to bolster HMRC’s collecting powers, including funding for an army of 2,500 more tax inspectors. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, who had met at Stanford University in California three years earlier. An American pressure group called Consumer Watchdog, based in California, has written to the Senate’s Finance Committee demanding a hearing on Google’s 'global tax avoidance strategies'. Director John Simpson has called for the Committee to organise a time for Mr Schmidt and Google’s chief executive could testify under oath and explain their company’s apparent 'abuse of the tax code to the detriment of all who play fairly.' Matt Brittin, Google’s UK head, also defended the avoidance scheme saying that MPs were blaming companies for a system that they had designed. He told The Telegraph: 'Google plays by the rules set by politicians. The only people who really have choices are politicians who set the tax rates.' Starbucks last week caved in to public pressure and agreed to pay millions in corporation tax amid fears of a growing consumer boycott. The global coffee group struck a deal with HMRC to pay £20million over the next two years, whether or not it reports a profit. The move will bring valuable money into Treasury coffers.","The search giant paid £6m in tax – despite making sales of £2.6bn .

Ministry spokesman Hong Lei today said that Beijing is studying . the report and repeated calls for dialogue and cooperation. Speaking to supporters in the city of Shahrekord, Ahmadinejad said Iran will not stop . its nuclear development, adopting a defiant position against the . report, which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country. In its latest report on Iran, the UN . International Atomic Energy Agency outlines the sum of its knowledge on . the Islamic Republic's alleged secret nuclear weapons work, including: . He said: 'If you think you can change the . situation of the world through putting pressures on Iran, you are deadly . wrong. The Iranian nation will not withdraw an iota.' Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not weapons production. Ahmadinejad's . regime is already thought to have built a top-secret explosives test . facility at a site in Parchin, just outside Tehran, where it is . conducting experiments to develop a weapon. Scientists . are building hi-tech precision detonators which would be essential for a . nuclear device, and developing a uranium core for a nuclear warhead, . the UN said. The report . also lays bare that Iranian scientists are trying to mount a nuclear . payload into their Shahab 3 missiles - which can reach Israel, Iran’s . arch foe. The report compiled by Yukiya Amano is the strongest sign yet that Iran seeks to build a nuclear arsenal, despite Tehran's insistence its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. The . document claims that while some of the suspected secret nuclear work by . Iran can have peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear . weapons.' A 13-page . attachment to the agency's Iran report details intelligence and IAEA . research that shows Tehran working on all aspects of research toward . making a nuclear weapon, including fitting a warhead onto a missile. Spreading the word: Ahmadinejad is adopting a defiant position against the report, which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country . Nationalism: Supporters of Ahmadinejad wave flags during his speech in Shahrekord . The U.S. State Department said it needed . time to study a new report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on . Iran's nuclear activities and declined to make any immediate comment on . its contents. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said: 'This was released to member states . about an hour ago so we're going to take some time to look at it before . commenting. 'We are not prepared to talk about any next steps at this point.' But with Israel threatening a military response, the report opens the way for a new confrontation between the West and Iran. Ahead of the report's release, . Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak warned of a possible Israeli . military strike against Iran's nuclear programme. He . told Israel Radio that he did not expect any new U.N. sanctions on . Tehran to persuade it to stop its nuclear defiance, adding: 'We continue . to recommend to our friends in the world and to ourselves, not to take . any option off the table.' The . 'all options on the table' phrase is often used by Israeli politicians . to mean a military assault. Iran is pursuing its nuclear weapons program at the Parchin military base about 30 kilometres from Tehran, diplomatic sources in Vienna say . Parchin has hundreds of structures and a number of fortified tunnels and bunkers for carrying out explosive experiments, it is claimed . While . some of the suspected secret nuclear work outlined in the annex could . also be used for peaceful purposes, 'others are specific to nuclear . weapons', the report claims. Some of the information contained in . the annex was new - including evidence of a large metal chamber at a . military site for nuclear-related explosives testing. The bulk, however, was a compilation and expansion of alleged work already partially revealed by the agency. But a senior diplomat familiar with . the report said its significance lay in its comprehensiveness, thereby . reflecting that Iran apparently had engaged in all aspects of testing . that were needed to develop such a weapon. Also significant was the agency's . decision to share most of what it knows or suspect about Iran's secret . work with the 35-nation IAEA board and the U.N. Security Council after being . stonewalled by Tehran in its attempts to probe such allegations. Copies of the report went to board members and the council, which has . imposed four sets of U.N. sanction on Tehran for refusing to stop . activities that could be used to make a nuclear weapon and refusing to . cooperate with IAEA attempts to fully understand its nuclear program.

The report suggests that Iran made computer models of a nuclear warhead . and includes satellite imagery of a large steel container the IAEA . believes is used for nuclear arms-related high explosives tests. In remarks broadcast on state . television, Ahmadinejad said that International Atomic Energy Agency . chief Yukiya Amano was simply repeating U.S. allegations. 'He delivers . the papers that American officials hand on him,' Ahmadinejad said. 'I am sorry that a person is heading . the agency who has no power by himself and violates the agency's . regulations, too.' He repeated Iran's stance that it is . not involved in making a nuclear weapon: 'They should know that if we . want to remove the hand of the U.S. from the world, we do not need bombs . and hardware. We work based on thoughts, culture and logic.'","Atomic agency report to be published today claims Iran is just 'months away' from building a bomb .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:29 EST, 16 December 2011 . Despite her superhuman strength, powers of flight and incredible agility, even Wonder Woman could succumb to breast cancer. That's the message being sent out to young women in the African nation of Mozambique today which is deploying a number of superheroes in its fight against the disease. Wonder Woman has been joined by other female comic book characters including Storm, She-Hulk and Catwoman to highlight that even they need to be aware of the warning signs. Not immune: Wonder Woman checks her breasts for signs of cancer in a new campaign which aims to raise awareness of the disease in Mozambique, particularly among younger women . It's no joke: In this illustration, created by artist Maisa Chaves, Catwoman gives herself a thorough examination . The illustrations, created by artist Maisa Chaves, show the women of steel checking their breasts for lumps. A caption next to them reads: 'When we talk about breast cancer, there's no women or superwomen. 'Everybody has to do the self-examination monthly. Fight with us against the enemy and, when in doubt, talk with your doctor.' The campaign, run by the Associação da Luta Contra o Cancer, isn't afraid to shock young women if it means they visit their GP. Previous ads made it appear as though spiders and cockroaches were living under the skin of women’s breasts. Powerful message: X-Men heroine Storm also features in the campaign by the Associação da Luta Contra o Cancer, which hopes it shocks women into seeing their doctor . Awareness: Despite her impressive physique, even She-Hulk is not immune to the disease . Although breast cancer is uncommon in women under 30, survival rates are lower for younger patients, and campaigns that target this age group are crucial in getting the message over about early detection. In October, Facebook caused outrage when it removed images posted by a U.S. campaign group showing survivors of breast cancer with their chests painted. It claimed the pictures breached its terms of use. Internationally, breast cancer charities join forces every October for a month-long campaign to raise awareness and generate vital funding for research, with many celebrities getting on board.","Aims to shock women into looking for warning signs .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:20 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:26 EST, 19 November 2012 . A company of elite archers who drowned aboard the warship Mary Rose have been identified by researchers who found repetitive strain injuries on their shoulders and backs. The archers were among 92 skeletons of those who died aboard Henry VIII's flagship, which sank in 1545 and was raised from the Solent in 1982. 'It was a requirement by law for every male to practice archery regularly from an early age, and many of the skeletons recovered show evidence of repetitive stress injuries of the shoulder and lower spine,' explained Alexzandra Hildred, curator of ordnance at the Mary Rose Trust. The remains of the Mary Rose lying in its specialist dry-dock at Portsmouth dockyard: Researchers have identified archers from a company of longbowmen who went down with the ship from their RSI . 'This could be as a result of the shooting heavy longbows regularly. Being able to quantify the stresses and their effect on the skeleton may enable us at last to isolate an elite group of professional archers from the ship.' For the past 18 months the Mary Rose Trust has been working with sports scientists from the College of Engineering at Swansea University to discover more about the lives of the medieval archers on board the ship. Contamination by cockles, molluscs and algae had made DNA identification difficult, but new techniques have now made it possible to identify the skeletons' origins and even personal features like eye and hair colour, the Daily Telegraph reported. Nick Owen, Sport and Exercise . Biomechanist from the College of Engineering at Swansea University, led . research into how the effect of a lifetime of archery affected bowmen, . who were the special forces of their day. By . making a biomechanical analysis of the skeletons of the medieval . archers he and his team examined the effect of constantly using and . practicing with the very powerful longbows on the musculoskeletal . system. Alex Hildred of Mary Rose Trust holds a bow like the ones found aboard the ship: Longbows like these were up to 6ft 6in long and hewn only from a specific part of the yew tree to get the maximum 'spring' Occupational hazards: This skull of an archer found who went down with the Mary Rose has an injury on its crown that researchers believe was caused  by an arrow. It is believed he survived the injury . 'This sample of human remains offers a unique opportunity to study activity related changes in human skeletons,' he said. 'It is documented that there was a company of archers aboard when the ship sank, at a time when many archers came from Wales and the South West of England. 'These archers had specialist techniques for making and using very powerful longbows. Some bows required a lifetime of training and immense strength as the archers had to pull weights up to 200lbs (about 90kg).' Sharp: This reconstructed arrow shows the kinds of projectiles that longbow archers would have fired . A longbow is a kind of bow that is roughly equal in height to the person using it. Although they have been used by may different cultures for thousands of years, in the Middle Ages the English and Welsh were famous for their very powerful Welsh longbows made from yew. These were used to great effect in the civil wars of the period and against the French in the Hundred Years' War, notably at the battles of Crécy in 1346, Poitiers in 1356, and, perhaps most famously, at Agincourt in 1415. The first book in English about longbow archery was Toxophilus by Roger Ascham, first published in London in 1545 and dedicated to King Henry VIII. The average length of arrowshafts recovered from the the Mary Rose is 30in (75cm). One skull discovered on board the ship even had an arrow injury on its crown, that researchers believed the owner would have survived. Mr Owen told the Telegraph how the breakthrough in DNA extraction had given his team the opportunity to profile the archers more precisely than before. A Swedish expert is working on reconstructing the faces of the archers for the new Mary Rose Trust museum, which will open next year. 'They were 6ft 2in or 6ft 3in, and strapping individuals,' he said. 'A longbow was 6ft 6in and made from a particular part of a yew tree to generate incredibly efficient ""spring"". 'It was mega hi-tech, and it gave England and Wales military superiority. These archers were the elite athletes of their day.' Once completed, the new study will help the Mary Rose Trust tell the story of the crew in much greater detail than before, when they open a brand new museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard next spring. Part of the process of analysing the skeletons involves creating 3D virtual images so that measurements can be taken from the remains without causing any damage to the valuable heritage artefacts.","Skeletons show evidence of repetitive strain injuries to the shoulder and lower spine - a result of regular practice with heavy longbows .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:33 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:34 EST, 25 March 2013 . Criminal families are being granted the chance meet up behind bars under controversial rules designed to stop relatives losing touch if they are both jailed, it can be revealed. Tory MPs said it was 'disgusting' that inmates are transported across the country to be reunited with girlfriends, husbands, fathers and daughters serving time in different prisons. Figures obtained by MailOnline reveal that despite deep cuts to justice budgets, taxpayer-funded trips are organised once a fortnight to ensure prisoners can ‘maintain strong family ties’ while on remand or serving sentences. Under Ministry of Justice rules, jails have a duty to arrange inter-prison visits for inmates to see relatives also serving time . Under official rules published by the coalition, jail staff have to make efforts to arrange for inter-prison visits for inmates to meet relatives who are also locked up. The trips, which could cost more than £100-a-time, can take place every three months. Tory MP Priti Patel said: 'Prison is a place where criminals are sent to be punished for their crimes and stripped of their liberty. 'It is disgraceful to see bureaucrats allowing quarterly visits between relatives in jail as part of the Justice Secretary’s plans to remove prisoner perks I hope he will consider abolishing this entitlement. 'When members of our Armed Forces putting their lives at risk fighting for our country are expected to go months without seeing their loved ones, it will disgust the public to see criminals enjoy this perk.' Relatives who qualify include husbands and wives, civil partners, children, siblings including half- and –step brothers and sisters, grandparents, anyone an inmate was living with in an ‘established relationship’ before being jailed and ‘those who have clearly demonstrated the intention to register a civil partnership but have not yet done so’. Ministry of Justice records, obtained through freedom of information laws, reveal 28 inter-prison visits were arranged last year, including four male prisoners visiting girlfriends, two men visiting brothers, one man meeting his mother and another meeting his wife. 'Disgusting': Tory MPs Priti Patel and Nick de Bois criticised the arrangements, insisting convicted relatives should not be allowed to meet up . In 2009 Gregg Avery, the ringleader of an animal rights gang which targeted an animal testing laboratory, boasted of being transferred from Winchester prison to visit his jailed wife Natasha in HMP Bronzefield in Middlesex while they were both on remand. In a newsletter to supporters, Avery boasted said the £110 taxi ride had secured ‘two hours of heaven’ together. The pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail and were sentenced to nine years in jail. Since then the number of inter-prison visits have risen sharply from just 18 in 2010, including female prisoners visiting daughters, husbands and boyfriends, to 28 last year. Tory MP Nick de Bois, a member of the justice select committee, said: 'I’m glad that the numbers we are seeing are so small as it should never be the norm that convicted relatives are routinely able to meet up. 'Prison should be about punishment and rehabilitation of offenders, and I fail to see how anything but the most exceptional of circumstances can warrant a family get together behind bars.' The rules state that the reunions behind bars must be arranged, subject to the availability of transport and accommodation for the inmates are prison guards . Official guidance which runs until . 2015 states that ‘subject to security requirements and the availability . of transport and accommodation’, arrangements may be made for . inter-prison visits to take place at three-monthly intervals. Each prisoner must surrender one visiting order and each visit should last ‘as long as local circumstances permit’. Steve Brine, a Tory member of the justice select committee, defended the arrangement. He said: 'There's stacks of evidence . that says maintaining positive family relationships during a stay in . prison helps with resettlement on release so, we shouldn't bite our nose . off by arbitrarily closing down inter-prison visits. 'The Prison Service should, and do, . manage each case individually which includes for-instance, a very . different regime for high risk offenders.' The Ministry of Justice said: ‘The purpose of inter prison visits is to enable close relatives, where both parties are prisoners at separate establishments, to maintain strong family ties.  ‘Inter-prison visits will be granted by the Governor only where security requirements are met and subject to the availability of appropriate transport and accommodation. ‘The decision to allow any visit must be balanced against the need to maintain security and keep prisoners in lawful custody. ‘Visits must be well managed, monitored, and where necessary due to inappropriate behaviour, terminated to maintain the good order and discipline of the prison.’","Prison staff are obliged to organise reunions behind bars for inmates to see spouses, civil partners, parents, grandparents or children .

The Made In Chelsea star, 23, tweeted a snap of her dazzling . engagement ring by Frost of London on Monday evening, with the touching caption: 'If I could scream loud . enough for the whole world to hear I would.' Her ring is made up of a typically large rock set on double bands encrusted with diamonds. Earlier in the day the brunette had told her Twitter followers that her beau whisked her away to 'her favourite restaurant in the whole wide world' - in the famously romantic city of Paris. Engaged: Millie Mackintosh said yes to Professor Green's proposal on Monday evening while on holiday in Paris . The couple have been dating for over a year, after the 29-year-old Professor - real name Stephen Manderson - became enamoured by the reality star when he saw her cover shoot for FHM two years ago. By the end of 2011 he had her number and they debuted their relationship at the BRIT Awards 2012 ceremony. At the beginning the longevity of the union was doubted by critics who said Quality Street heiress Millie . was simply after 'a bit of rough' with her rapper boyfriend. Long haul: The couple have been dating for over a year . Twitter love: Millie shared her news on the social networking site . Happy days: Professor Green's reaction to the news - sorry Jessica Alba, he is off the market . His response to her acceptance to his proposal on Tuesday was just two words on Twitter: 'Happy days.'

But it seems Millie and her new fiancé may have overdone the celebrating somewhat, with the reality star tweeting on Tuesday morning: 'Wow ive got a little bit of a headache this morning! #toomuchchampagne.' The pair also set tongues wagging when they shared a broody picture of themselves cooing over a friend's baby over lunch. However, in a recent interview, Millie admitted she is in no rush to start a family. Stage presence: Barclaycard transformed the King's Cross bus depot into a performance area for Pro Green's Contactless gig on Saturday night . Doting: Millie sported a camouflage jacket with her tight leather trousers as she supported her beau at the gig . She said: 'Definitely no baby, not right now. Like any girl, I know I want a family one day, but I'm really focused on work at the moment. 'But Herby my dog has made me feel . maternal. I love looking after people, but it's a lot of responsibility. It's like a little taste of having a first child.' Professor Green, who split from Hollyoaks . actress Candy . McCulloch in November 2011, admitted he had been seeing a lot of Millie . before they made their public debut, but initially said he wasn't . looking for 'anything serious'. Happy: Pro Green and Millie (pictured here at this year's BRITs) often share snaps of their relationship on Twitter - and that even goes down to getting engaged .

He told The Sun newspaper: 'I don't want to be too tied down or get into anything serious too fast. But Millie is really fit.' When Millie met Pro Green, she was overcoming heartache herself after she discovered her boyfriend Hugo Taylor . had cheated on her with best friend Rosie Fortescue.

Two men who stole 220,000 litres of cooking oil from KFC stores and supermarkets across the UK and sold it on as biodiesel have been jailed for a combined total of four years. Scheming Stuart Bradley, 38, and Matthew Walker, 27, masterminded a nationwide scam described by one senior detective as one of the most 'complex and elaborate' crimes he had ever investigated. The duo struck at dozens of KFC branches as well as Asda, Tesco and Morrisons supermarkets and stole up to £147,000 worth of cooking oil which they siphoned into their vans. Guilty: Matthew Walker, left, and Stuart Bradley, right, have been jailed for two years each for the 'complex and elaborate' scam of stealing used cooking oil and selling it on as biodiesel fuel . Posing as waste removal staff for an oil recycling company, they then went on to sell the stolen oil at a premium to a processing plant who converted it into eco-friendly biodiesel. Police were first alerted to their suspicious activities in February this year after an alarm on an oil tanker at Merry Hill Shopping Centre, Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was activated. The friends claimed to have been looking for somewhere to eat but backtracked when officers discovered a vat of foul-smelling used cooking oil in the back of their Transit van. Although the pair backtracked and claimed they actually worked for a waste company, they were promptly arrested. Officers then linked them to 13 unsolved offences -dating from November 2011 to February 2012 - up and down the UK. Bradley and Walker were charged and . appeared at Dudley Magistrates' Court in July but when they were released . on bail pending their trial they went on to commit further crimes at . the three supermarkets.

When you become an overnight sporting sensation, it's good to have a friend to keep you grounded - especially one who knows exactly what you're going through. Fortunately for NBA superstar Jeremy Lin it's fellow sporting icon Tim Tebow he can turn to, after the NFL quarterback confirmed the pair regularly talk on the phone. Tebow revealed his blossoming friendship with the basketball player as he attended Vanity Fair's Oscar party on Sunday night at the Sunset Tower Hotel in Hollywood. Call on me: New York Knicks star Jeremy Lin (left) and Denver . Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow (right) are helping each other deal with . their sky-rocketing careers . The Denver Broncos quarterback told the New York Post: 'He’s . a good guy and very humble. 'We talk a lot on the phone because I know . what he’s going through and I’ve been giving him some advice. He’s . handling it pretty well and staying focused.' Tebow was also spotted mingling at pre-Oscars parties over the weekend after signing with powerful Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel. The football player was a popular addition to the celebrity crowd. According to the Post, Glee's Dianna Agron, Serena Williams, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, LL Cool J and Taylor Swift all rushed over to chat to Tebow. New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin, 23, said he was ‘very inspired’ by the 24-year-old quarterback, according to Lin’s former . Harvard chaplain. Lin and . Tebow also share the common bond of their faith. Both extremely wealthy . players hope to become pastors after finishing their careers and have . been very open about their Christianity. Lin’s Twitter feed has the . description: ‘To know Him is to want to know Him more’. In action: New York Knicks NBA point guard Jeremy Lin, 23 (left) has had a phenomenal season for his team including a 25-point breakout game against the New Jersey Jets . Keeping the faith: The Denver Broncos may not have won the Superbowl but the quarterback's famous prayer pose 'Tebowing' has been mimicked around the globe . There is also the shared ground of having ubiquitous catchphrases. Since Lin's breakout 25-point game against the New Jersey Nets earlier this month, 'Linsanity' has swept the U.S. and rescued the New York Knicks from a disastrous season. It has also caused a trademark war with seven patent applications filed, including one by Pamela Deese, who is a lawyer representing Lin. 'We talk a lot on the phone, because I know . what he’s going through, and I’ve been giving him some advice. He’s . handling it pretty well and staying focused.' Tim Tebow . The catchphrase for the former Golden State Warriors player from Palo Alto, California, has been splashed across everything from mobile phone cases and sunglasses to action figures and footwear, but a trademark can take a year or more to register. The NBA said Lin jerseys have been the hottest selling shirts at its online store since his performance against the Nets. Lin famously used to sleep on the sofa . of his New York University student brother Joshua in Manhattan’s Lower . East Side. However, much like Tebow's hobnobbing at the Oscars - he has . moved up in the world. Rising star: An adoring fan waits to see Jeremy Lin on the court (left) while the player has traded his brother's couch for a luxury Manhattan apartment (right) His two-bedroom rental, listed at $13,000 a month, is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New York Downtown Hotel and looks out over the Statue of Liberty. Despite not making it to the Superbowl final, rookie quarterback Tebow played impressively in the  first NFL playoffs of his career. These sporting heroics, as well as his devout religious beliefs, have made Tebow something of a pop culture phenomenon. Celebrity status: Tebow is not only a favourite with Denver Broncos fans, his good looks and charm have seen him signed to powerful Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel . He has single-handedly inspired the . craze known as Tebowing  - where fans mimic the quarterback’s pre-game . prayer stance in photos posted to Facebook and Twitter. His popularity has led to a surge in sales of his memoir, Through My Eyes: A Quarterback's Journey, as well as having brands jostle to get him to endorse their products.","'He's a good guy and very humble,' Tebow says of Lin .

The painting, which may also contain a sketch of Joseph or an angel, is from the 1580s and created at the height of Walsingham's powers, while he served as the Tudor queen's lord treasurer and secretary. Hundreds were burned, hanged or beheaded at the fervent priest-hunter's say-so, including Mary Queen of Scots when he uncovered the plot to place her on the English throne in 1587. Uncovered: Queen Elizabeth's Protestant enforcer Sir Francis Walsingham's portrait has been scanned, which has uncovered a secret sketch put there by a Catholic sympathiser . Hidden: Running over Walsingham's face is the outline of what appears to be the Virgin Mary and Christ . At the time England was openly backing a war in the Netherlands against enemy Catholic Spain and Sir Francis was using his huge network of spies across the country and Europe to protect the Queen from the threat of Rome. Aide: Walsingham was one of Queen Elizabeth's right-hand men and also her treasurer and secretary in the 16th century . However, a five-year study into Tudor art by the National Portrait Gallery in London has found an important portrait of him contains hidden images, uncovered after it was hit with infra-red reflectography and X-rays. This technique has allowed the images to be seen underneath layers of paint without disturbing the main works . 'He would not have been delighted,' gallery expert Dr Tarnya Cooper said, adding: 'the Protestant spymaster with the Roman Catholic . image of the virgin and child beneath, you do wonder if the artist . might be enjoying a private joke at the expense of the sitter. 'The Catholics are the absolute enemy at this period so the idea that you’ve got this wonderful devotional image underneath your portrait would probably be rather horrifying to him. 'There is not very much that Walsingham does not know about of what’s going on in courts across Europe, he has a huge network of informers, is an incredibly wily man and is someone with a public reputation. For somebody who is not wonderfully keen on Walsingham this would be a clever way of getting at him. 'It is intriguing that it is under the spy-master general'. Walsingham was not the only victim as a version of The Flagellation of Christ has been found on the canvas . underneath a portrait of Thomas Sackville, the Tudor statesman and poet. The portrait of Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, is dated 1601, by . an unknown artist. The underlying image of the flagellation is believed . to be based on an engraving of the work, which first appeared on a . fresco in the Borgherini Chapel in Rome by Sebastiano del Piombo after . designs by Michelangelo. Recycling? This portrait of poet Thomas Sackville from 1601 was also looked at and it revealed an image of Christ below, which could be deliberate or a recycled background . Message: Hidden below Sackville's picture appears to be an image of The Flagellation of Christ, After Michelangelo, by Adamo Scultori . As 120 canvasses were scanned for secret images and only two were found to be hiding something, the gallery says it is likely the pair were targeted. He was Elizabeth I's priest-hunter who dedicated his life to protecting his country as leader of a fervent anti-catholic cause. Known as a master spy, he infiltrated Catholic pockets in England and abroad and built up a huge network of contacts. He was famous for using fear and paranoia as a weapon against Rome, and anyone suspected of being a threat to the country was killed, without exception. At the time there were several perceived threats to the Queen's reign, especially from Spain, and he killed many to stop it. His most famous moment came when he discovered Mary Queen of Scots was being lined up in a papist plot which led to her being beheaded at Fotheringhay in 1587. There are also other famous examples of artists hiding pictures below artwork. Goya's painting of a French general was found under his drawing of Spanish judge Don Ramon Satue at a Dutch gallery, with experts sure that it was painted over for political reasons. And the 16th century Gerolamo Bassano painting called The Sepulchre, kept in Washington DC, was x-rayed at a local hospital, which discovered there was a portrait of a man in Tudor costume holding his own waist. Some of these secret sketches may also be an example of the artists being thrifty and recycling canvasses or wood to form the piece of art. “It has been really exciting to discover these images beneath portraits. The re-use of wooden panels is an example of Tudor recycling, which was . an essential part of life in the past. And yet, the people in the . portraits painted over the top were perhaps unlikely to have known the . panels were second-hand,' Dr Cooper said. The works go on display this week in an exhibition, Hidden: Unseen Paintings Beneath Tudor Portraits. Visitors are also shown the X-ray images alongside copies of the concealed paintings.","Sir Francis Walsingham led queen's defence against threat from Rome .

Pubs in London have begun to serve horse meat burgers - and found them to be a huge hit with customers. One pub said demand is so high that it is selling more than 100 in a week. The scandal of horse being labelled as beef has actually helped increase demand for the meat. The Lord Nelson in Southwark introduced the dish a fortnight ago, while The Three Compasses in Hackney began grilling 100 per cent horse meat burgers earlier this week. The Three Compasses serves the patties with black pepper mayonnaise, onion, lettuce, pickles, Emmental cheese, ketchup and a fried egg. Chelsea Davies of the Lord Nelson enjoys the horse meat burger. It was introduced a fortnight ago . Chef Michael Brown - who described the taste as ‘very much like beef in texture and ever so slightly gamey’ - said 50 burgers sold out in hours on Tuesday night. Owner Lauren Johns said: ‘All across Europe, horse is considered a high-quality meat. We thought it’d be nice for people to try it and realise it’s really nice if prepared and sourced properly.” There are four sizes of burger named on an equine theme, from the 2oz taster-size Shetland at £4 to the £11 Triple Trojan. The meat comes from France. The Lord Nelson serves 8oz burgers with mushrooms and onions for £11. Extra toppings include goats’ cheese, brie and jalapeno peppers. It reported selling more than 100 in a week. Co-owner Benito Priolo said: ‘It’s leaner and denser than beef and points in the direction of liver.’ For £16, the pub serves the 50/50 Burger - which involves one burger each made from horse and beef.

But, it seems, they don’t always learn from the bad experiences of others. In an extraordinary case, two wealthy solicitors spent five years and virtually all their money battling over the terms of their acrimonious split. Battle: Giles Kavanagh (left) and Anna-Marie Harvey Kavanagh were left with just over £90,000 between them, after years of acrimonious legal disputes over money and their three children . House: The luxury £3.2 million mansion the pair used to share in Kingston Upon Thames (pictured). Mrs Kavanagh was awarded two thirds of the funds raised from its sale in a previous hearing . Despite both being practising lawyers, . Anna-Marie Harvey Kavanagh, 47, and her ex-husband Giles Kavanagh, 52, . ‘spent almost all their assets in litigation’ during the lengthy court . battle. A judge who had previously presided . over their case criticised them for ‘wrecking the ship of their . marriage, then turning their attention to the lifeboats’. And yesterday, as they returned to the . courts yet again, a different judge said they had ‘tragically’ squandered their fortune and had little more than £90,000 left between . them. The Kavanaghs, who have three children . together and were married for ten years, lived in a £3.2million . seven-bedroom home set in half-an-acre in South-West London until their . split in 2008. Following the divorce, they spent . almost £900,000 in a court battle to determine maintenance payments and . the division of their assets. Mrs Kavanagh was awarded two thirds . of the funds raised by the sale of the matrimonial home in . Kingston-upon-Thames, and her husband a third by a judge in 2008. But the proceeds of the multi-million . pound sale – after it is believed a hefty mortgage was repaid – were so . depleted by a ‘debt of costs’ and other factors, that Mrs Kavanagh . received just £94,500. Despite Mr Kavanagh earning more than . £485,000 a year as a partner in a law firm specialising in aerospace . litigation and insurance, he was left with ‘net debts’ following the . court hearings. Yesterday, the couple returned to . court before top family judge, Lord Justice McFarlane, to contest the . level of maintenance payments Mr Kavanagh was ordered to pay to his . ex-wife. The judge, sitting at London’s Civil Appeal Court, said that the couple’s expenditure was a ‘tragedy’ for the family’s finances. He added that Judge Clive Million, . who had previously presided over the case in the High Court’s Family . Division, had criticised the couple in his judgment last year. Criticised: the judge criticised the pair for 'wrecking the ship of their marriage' with their expensive legal battle. The pair lost almost all of their assets and sold their former home, (pictured) during their fight in the courts . He said that the judge had told them: ‘They wrecked the ship then turned their attention to the lifeboats. ‘By 2008 they had spent over £879,000 . on legal costs and contested proceedings. Children Act proceedings had . cost about £545,000. The financial proceedings cost over . £303,000 and Family Law Act applications cost another £32,000. The . disputes and costs have gone on. ‘The ship of marriage may founder, but this couple have driven theirs full-tilt on to the rocks.’ Mrs Kavanagh’s barrister, Jonathan . Tod, argued that Mrs Kavanagh should receive more maintenance because . her husband’s pay rises since 2008 had been ‘double the average annual . wage of a man living in the South East of England’. Mrs Kavanagh, who receives . £48,000-a-year, should have the yearly payments increased to between . £66,000 and £88,000 as she had put her career on hold to raise the . couple’s children, he said. Rejecting the plea, Lord Justice McFarlane said the impact of the costs in the case were ‘a catastrophe for this family’. He said Mr Kavanagh was already . responsible for paying the school fees for the couple’s three children . who are all being privately educated at a cost of £36,000-a-year. ‘There is no prospect of an appeal succeeding were the matter to be given permission,’ the judge concluded. Both parties attended the hearing, although Mr Kavanagh was not represented. Mrs Kavanagh declined to comment afterwards.","Former husband and wife return to court after expensive split in 2009, this time to contest maintenance payments .

Controversy: Mark Kelly filling out paperwork at a gun shop before buying an assault rifle . Gabby Giffords' husband has had his purchase of an assault rifle cancelled after the gun shop where he bought it concluded that he only wanted the weapon as a political stunt. Mark Kelly, a leading advocate for gun control since his wife was wounded in the Tucson shooting which left six dead two years ago, bought the AR-15-style rifle three weeks ago to show how easy it is to acquire lethal weapons. Yesterday the owner of Diamondback Police Supply, in Tucson, announced that he had returned Mr Kelly's money because he was not buying the gun 'for his personal use'. Doug MacKinlay said that he plans to raffle off the gun to raise funds for law enforcement, and donate the value of the rifle to a firearms safety organisation. Mr Kelly was accused of hypocrisy for buying the same gun he is lobbying to ban, but he insisted that he was only doing so to make a point and said he would hand the weapon in to police. Because the rifle was second hand, the former astronaut had to wait 20 days to take possession of it - and during that period Mr MacKinlay decided to cancel the deal. 'While I support and respect Mark Kelly’s 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,' the store owner said in a statement. 'In light of this fact, I determined that it was in my company’s best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal Form 4473 and NICS background check required of Mr Kelly before he could take possession this firearm. 'A full refund was sent to Mr Kelly, via express mail, on Thursday of last week.' Couple: Kelly is pictured with his wife, former Rep Gabrielle Giffords, left, during a return to the supermarket where she was wounded in a rampage two years ago in Tucson, Arizona . Point of sale: Kelly purchased the guns at Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson, Arizona . He added that the gun would be given . to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association, who will raffle it off to . buy equipment for the state's SWAT teams. Mr MacKinlay's business will also . donate $1,295, the price of the rifle, to the Eddie Eagle GunSafe . Program, which teaches schoolchildren what to do if they come across a . weapon. Earlier this month, Mr Kelly posted a . photo on Facebook of him filling out paperwork at the gun shop, along . with a statement setting out his reasons for buying the rifle. He . said that the background check for the purchases took only a matter of . minutes to complete, and added that he dreaded to think people can buy . similar guns without background checks at gun shows or on the Internet. Husband: Kelly hangs on to his wife as the two appeared at the Tucson supermarket where she was shot two years ago . Horrific scene: Kelly and Giffords appeared at the same supermarket where she was shot on January 8, 2011 . The . AR-15 is among 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a . bill pending before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr . Kelly and Ms Giffords started the Americans for Responsible Solutions . gun control group amid the wave of mass shootings in recent months and . have been touring the country in recent months in support of expanded . background checks for gun purchases. Killer: Jared Lee Lougner gunned down six people when he opened fire at a Giffords event in Tucson. She was shot in the head but survived . Ms Giffords, then a U.S. Representative, was among 13 people wounded in a January 2011 shooting . as she met with constituents outside a Tucson supermarket. Six were . killed. She resigned from Congress last year as she continues to recover from her injuries. Mr MacKinlay earlier said Mr Kelly never revealed . to the store's staff why he was buying the guns and added that it would . be wrong to refuse to sell a gun to someone because of their personal . views. 'He is a U.S. citizen, an Arizona . citizen and expressing his Second Amendment right to purchase and own a . firearm,' Mr MacKinlay said. Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the . National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA . board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make in . buying the guns, saying a model citizen like him should be able to . buy a gun relatively quickly. He also noted that such a purchase could have been a good investment as the value of those types of weapon soars amid heightened demand from gun owners. 'If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt,' Mr Rathner said. 'If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.' Mr Kelly told CNN that it was important for him to have firsthand information on the ease of buying guns such as the AR-15 and that he looks forward to buying a firearm at a gun show in the future. The high-profile couple have long been supporters of gun rights and owned handguns themselves.

It’s 11.20am and Natalie Portman’s personal trainer, Mary Helen Bowers, is putting me through my paces at my apartment in Manhattan’s East Village. Down on my mat, I’m guided through a series of leg lifts to tone and hone my inner thighs – similar to the kind of moves Mary had Natalie do to get in shape for her Oscar-winning role in Black Swan. It’s part of a workout that Mary Helen, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, calls Ballet Beautiful – which is also popular with her other high-profile clients, actresses Liv Tyler, Kirsten Dunst and Victoria’s Secret model Doutzen Kroes. MY LAPTOP STUDIO . As the burn begins to kick in, I can hear groans from other women. No – I’m not hosting a class at home, I have logged on to Mary Helen’s website, balletbeautiful.com, and joined one of her classes via my laptop. When we finish, Mary Helen leans into her webcam – which gives me a full view of her airy space in New York’s Soho where the live class is in session. ‘How are you doing Ruby?’ she asks. I give her a thumbs-up – even though my leg feels as if it’s about to go into spasm. Mary Helen has been training clients remotely since 2008, when she was working with Natalie. ‘She was amazing for my business, but at the same time it meant I travelled with her a lot,’ says Mary Helen. ‘I didn’t want to leave my other clients hanging, so I bought a laptop and started training people over Skype.’ When she opened her studio, she developed the software to allow people to join her classes online, too. A subscription costs £185 per month or it’s £23 a class. ON CAMERA . ‘Bye-bye gym, hello convenience,’ says the home page on wello.co, another site offering digital workouts. Having launched last summer with remote, one-on-one personal training sessions, it began offering classes – open to up to five people at a time – last month. Here, you can find anything from yoga to full-on boot camp sessions, and the following weekend, I try an hour-long cardio circuits class. Soon I get an email from Dorothy, the instructor, asking me and the other girls who’ve signed up if we have any equipment she can incorporate into our workout. It turns out we all own a set of dumbbells. Ballet beautiful: A webcam class from the website so you can take your classes at home . In the end, one of the other girls drops out and so Sarah – who is based in California – and I get Dorothy to ourselves. Jumping around my living room with my dumbbells, my eyes on my computer screen where I can see Dorothy in one window and Sarah in another, is a bit like doing a workout DVD – but better. Left to my own devices, I might have been tempted to sit out some of the tougher moves, but with the camera on me I am too embarrassed to give up so I power on through. By the end of the class, I’ve got a proper sweat on – just like if I’d worked out at the gym. But for a fraction of the price. An individual class costs £6.50, while a one-on-one session with a personal trainer is between £25 and £130, depending on who you choose. QUICK FIX FITNESS . An even better deal can be found at another site called fitnessglo.com. For £8 a month you get unlimited access to hundreds of prerecorded workout videos, ranging in duration from ten to 45 minutes, and covering every kind of workout under the sun. It’s like having your own fitness DVD library, and while you don’t get the benefit of personal instruction, it beats them all for convenience – you really can log on wherever and whenever. I try a 30-minute cardio athletic circuits class – the perfect quick fitness fix on another deadline-heavy day. All this doesn’t even begin to mention the ease with which you can find fitness instruction by watching videos uploaded by trainers to YouTube. So will I be handing in my gym membership and switching to digital workouts instead? Probably not. For me, you can’t beat the energy you get in a live class, with the teacher yelling instructions over a pumping soundtrack and 20 other people going for it on all sides.

A Dutch artist has produced an stunningly lifelike piece of 3D street art to highlight the plight of endangered African and Asian elephants. Remko Van Shaik, 45, chose the pavement outside a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thailand, on which to showcase his stunning chalk work to coincide with the meeting in the city of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. According to a new report entitled 'Elephants in the Dust – The African Elephant Crisis' presented to the summit, increasing poaching levels, as well as loss of habitat, are threatening the survival of African elephant populations in Central Africa as well as previously secure populations in West, Southern and Eastern Africa. A Buddhist monk and woman walk past a three-dimensional elephant painted on the ground at a temple in Bangkok by Remko Van Schaik, 45, from the Netherlands . The artist unveiled his work to coincide with an international summit which highlighted the danger elephants face from poachers . The report says systematic monitoring of large-scale seizures of ivory destined for Asia is indicative of the involvement of criminal networks, which are increasingly active and entrenched in the trafficking of ivory between Africa and Asia. The forest elephants of Africa have lost almost two-thirds of their number in the past decade due to poaching for ivory, a landmark new study revealed on Tuesday. Eight key ivory-trading nations, including the host nation Thailand and biggest market China, have been put on notice of sweeping trade sanctions if they fail to crack down on the trade. Mr Van Schaik applies the finishing touches on his 3D elephant art with an unknown assistant . Renowned Thai Buddhist nun Mae Chee Sansanee throws flowers over the stunning piece of work (right) 'The analysis confirms what conservationists have feared: the rapid trend towards extinction – potentially within the next decade – of the forest elephant,' said Samantha Strindberg of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), one of 60 scientists on the research team. There are about 100,000 forest elephants remaining in the forests of central Africa, compared with about 400,000 of the slightly larger savannah elephants. The total elephant population was over 1m 30 years ago, but has been devastated by poaching driven by the rising demand for ivory ornaments in Asia.

Police investigating historic child sex allegations in a scandal-hit diocese arrested a retired Church of England bishop today. Peter Ball, 80, was arrested at his home in Langport, Somerset, on suspicion of eight sex offences against eight boys and young men aged between 12 and their early twenties in the late Eighties and Nineties, sources said. The offences are alleged to have taken place in East Sussex and elsewhere within the diocese of Chichester. Rev Peter Ball meeting Prince Charles in 1992. The bishop, now 80, has described him as 'a loyal friend' in the past . Rev Ball, former bishop of Lewes and later Gloucester, has connections with Prince Charles whom he has described in the past as a 'loyal friend'. He is thought to be the highest member of the clergy to be arrested in connection with a sex abuse investigation. A second clergyman, an unnamed 67-year-old retired priest, was also detained at his home this morning near Haywards Heath, West Sussex, on suspicion of separate sex offences against two teenage boys in East Sussex between 1981 and 1983, Sussex Police said. The arrests follow a review and subsequent inquiry over the past six months by a team of Sussex Police detectives. The investigation followed receipt by police in May this year of two reports from a CofE safeguarding consultant. They contained reviews of Church files relating to safeguarding matters of young people in the Diocese of Chichester during the 1980s and early 1990s. Officers described it as a 'very complex inquiry' during which many people, who are all now adults, have had to be traced along with witnesses and records. Police said there were no allegations of recent or current offending, and there was no suggestion that any young people are at risk. The claims are being treated separately and do not involve the two men allegedly acting together. Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes, of Sussex Police, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The Church of England, including the Diocese of Chichester, are co-operating fully with police. 'Although the matters referred to are still the subject of police investigation, Sussex Police make it clear that the force will always take seriously any allegations of historic sexual offending, and every possible step will be taken to investigate whenever appropriate. 'Allegations of historic offences are treated just as seriously as any more recent offences.' The arrests come after the CofE issued an 'unreserved apology' earlier this year for historic cases of child abuse by some of its clergy. The Rt Rev Paul Butler, Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham and chair of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee, confirmed the arrests and said that the church has been working closely with police throughout the investigation.

But we can never be complacent. 'We would like to urge any victims or those with information to feel free to come forward knowing that they will be listened to in confidence. 'We have also put support systems in place for all those involved with today’s arrests.' The Bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner, said the arrests followed an investigation in which the diocese had been working closely with Sussex Police.

The parents of suspected honour killing victim Shafilea Ahmed have been charged with their daughter’s murder – eight years after she disappeared. Shafilea, 17, went missing from her home in September 2003 after complaining that her parents were trying to force her into an arranged marriage. A massive hunt was launched for the bright A-level student who had dreamed of becoming a lawyer. Her decomposed body was found in February 2004, hidden near a river in the Lake District. A coroner ruled that the Muslim teenager had been the victim of a ‘vile murder’. Iftikhar Ahmed, 51, a taxi driver, and his wife Farzana, 48, were initially arrested on suspicion of kidnapping their daughter in December 2003. They were questioned by police but were released in June 2004 without charge when the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence against them. The couple were re-arrested on suspicion . of murder in September last year but have always denied any involvement . in their daughter’s disappearance or death. But today, almost exactly eight years after Shafilea went missing, . they were charged with her murder. They appeared at Halton Magistrates’ Court in Runcorn, Cheshire, for a six-minute  hearing, during which they . spoke through an interpreter to confirm their names, ages and address. The . teenager's father, Iftikhar, 51, and mother Farzana, 48, have been . charged with murder and appeared at Halton Magistrates' Court, in . Runcorn, earlier today . Farzana and Iftikar Ahmed arriving at the inquest into the death of their daughter . Standing in the dock flanked by two . security guards, Mrs Ahmed wore a traditional grey Asian shawl and . fought back tears. Bearded Mr Ahmed, in an open-necked white shirt and . light grey trousers, remained expressionless, his hands clasped. The . murder charge was put to them but no plea was entered. The charges are believed to have come after fresh evidence was handed to police by Shafilea’s sister, Alisha, who was two years younger. She was arrested by police for allegedly masterminding an armed robbery at the family home. Alisha, who is in the witness protection programme, admitted the charges and is awaiting sentence. The 22-year-old is believed to have made new claims about her parents’ involvement in Shafilea’s death. Shafilea, from Warrington, Cheshire, went missing after complaining she was being forced into an arranged marriage. Police investigating her disappearance discovered she had travelled to Pakistan for what she thought was a family holiday. But once there she was allegedly told an arranged marriage had been organised for her. The A-level pupil drank bleach in an apparent suicide attempt while in Pakistan and returned to the UK to continue studying. The 17-year-old's decomposed remains were discovered on the banks of the River Kent in Sedgwick near Kendal, Cumbria in February 2004 . Weeks later she disappeared. She was reported missing by a teacher. After . her body was found on the banks of the River Kent in Cumbria, an . inquest ruled she had been murdered and a pathologist stated she was . likely to have been smothered or strangled. The coroner said at the time: ‘Shafilea was the victim of a very vile murder and there’s no evidence before the court as to who did it. There are things people know that have not been told to this court. Shafilea Ahmed, 17, vanished from her home in Warrington, Cheshire, in September 2003 . ‘Her ambition was to live her own life in her own way: to study, to follow a career in the law and to do what she wanted to do. These are just basic fundamental rights and they were denied to her.’ Her father has always denied he tried to force Shafilea into an arranged marriage, claiming she accidentally drank bleach during a power cut after mistakenly thinking it was fruit juice. Mr Ahmed said he had not reported her missing because police had not taken him seriously when she had run away before. In February 2003, Shafilea sought help from youth advisory service Connexions, saying she was ‘running away because she was in fear of being married’. Several songs written by Shafilea in the run-up to her death were later discovered, one saying: ‘I feel trapped.’ Another stated: ‘All they think about is honour, I was like a normal teenage kid, didn’t ask too much, I just wanted to fit in, but my culture was different. 'Now I’m sitting here playing happy families, still crying tears.’ Her parents were remanded in custody. The case was adjourned for a bail hearing at Manchester Crown Court tomorrow, where they will appear via video link.

Troubled: Former England star Paul Gascoigne has revealed that he downed dozens of bottles of children's medicine Calpol in a desperate bid to get drunk . Troubled England football legend Paul Gascoigne drank dozens of bottles of children's medicine Calpol in a desperate bid to get drunk, he admitted today. The alcoholic 45-year-old has admitted that he became hooked on the pink liquid because he wrongly thought it would get him drunk. The situation became so serious that he was banned from every chemist in Newcastle after staff realised what he was doing. Speaking to The Sun, the former midfielder, who was released from a clinic in the U.S following five weeks of treatment for alcoholism said: . 'It was crazy. I thought it had 0.00001 per cent alcohol in it and I thought if I drank enough it would get us drunk, because I didn't want to be seen drinking. I had loads of bottles.' Gascoigne admitted that he eventually sought treatment to come off the medicine after he was turned away from a chemist after a member of staff quizzed him about why he needed it. He also admitted going into rehab for laxatives and Red Bull. Calpol is a paracetamol-based medicine which can caused fatal liver and kidney damage when taken in high doses. Gascoigne also spoke about his bizarre bid to help police killer Raoul Moat after he turned up at a police seige with a fishing rod, chicken and lagers. The former football star left police officers and watching media shocked when he arrived at the police cordon in Rothbury, Northumberland, during the climax of the manhunt in 2010. Gascoigne thought he knew the crazed gunman from his work as a bouncer at a Newcastle club and 'without thinking' decided to go and help him after seeing news reports. But during his interview with The Sun, he admitted he didn't know what he was doing and said it was an example of how serious his drink problem had become. Silly: The alcoholic 45-year-old has admitted that he became hooked on the pink liquid because he wrongly thought it would get him drunk. He is pictured jogging up the steps of a gym yesterday . Gunman Moat shot his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and murdered her new boyfriend Christoper Brown in Birtley, Gateshead, before blinding PC David Rathband as he sat in his patrol car. The officer saved his own life by pretending to be dead and said afterwards it was the thought of his children that kept him fighting for survival. Worrying: The situation became so serious that Gascoigne was banned from every chemist in Newcastle after staff realised what he was doing. A bottle of Calpol is pictured . The rampage sparked a week long manhunt which ended when the 37-year-old shot himself in July 2010. PC Rathband, 44, was blinded after being shot in the face by killer Moat in July 2010 and after struggling to come to terms with his disability was found hanged in February 2012. Gascoigne also revealed yesterday how a DVD . message from Sir Alex Ferguson helped save his life during his five-week . stay in a U.S. rehab clinic. He said he watched the Manchester United manager and family and friends make emotional appeals for him to battle his demons. Gascoigne said: 'I was blown away watching people like Sir Alex telling me to stay strong and pull through. 'Sir Alex reminded me I'm a fighter. He said he was speaking on behalf of all the United players and everyone . was rooting for me,' he told The Sun.

A woman was beaten with a walking stick during a brutal exorcism organised by members of her own family, a court heard. Asma Hussain was tied to a bed and covered with holy water after relations became convinced she was possessed by a demon, it is alleged. Her husband Ahmed, 60, summoned the local Muslim preacher to carry out the ceremony and encouraged him to hit his wife harder, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. In court: Muhammed Aziz with Salma Hussain at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The pair are on trial with other family members accused of false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mrs Hussain’s back was described as ‘one massive bruise’ after the cruel and unwarranted attack, in which she also suffered injuries to her face and hands, jurors heard. Ahmed Hussain, his son Mohammed Kayes Hussain, 28, daughter Salma, 22, daughter-in-law Halima Khatun, 28, and son-in-law Mohammed Aziz, 21, are on trial accused of false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They are said to have believed that someone had ‘put black magic’ on their victim. ‘It appears that members of Asma Hussain’s family believed that she was possessed by demons,’ said prosecutor Babatunde Alabi. ‘As a result of this belief, it is alleged that they kept her captive in her own home, tying her to a bed in the living room. They also arranged for an imam to carry out an exorcism on her. ‘During the course of the exorcism, she was held down, had water poured all over her and was beaten with a cane. ‘For some unknown reason, it appears the defendants thought that Asma was possessed by a demon. Trial: Halima Khatun with Mohammed Kayes Hussain. The defendants thought Asma Hussain was possessed by a demon and claimed her behaviour had changed and her condition deteriorated over a matter of weeks . ‘They claimed her behaviour had changed and that her condition had deteriorated over a matter of weeks. ‘Faced with this seeming deterioration, they decided to deal with the matter by spiritual means.’ The exorcism, at the family home in Bethnal Green, east London, is said to have been instigated by Ahmed Hussain last January 7. The . family allegedly looked on as the imam - who has never been traced - . threw ‘holy’ water all over Mrs Hussain before whipping her with a . walking stick to ‘beat the demon out’, while her husband encouraged him . to hit her harder. ‘Asma was tied to the bed while the imam prayed,’ said Mr Alabi. ‘At some stage, with the encouragement of all the defendants, the imam started beating Asma with her husband’s walking stick. ‘This was done, apparently, to “beat the demon out”. The attack continued into the early hours of the morning, the court heard. The . previous day, Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain are said to have brought the . imam to the home of another daughter, Shahana Hussain, where Asma had . stayed overnight, telling her someone had put ‘black magic’ on her. They went into a room and the imam prayed before dousing Mrs Hussain in water. Shahana Hussain refused their request for more water and they left. On . the day of the exorcism, Shahana Hussain became concerned after . visiting her mother to find a relative removing a tie from her leg, it . was said. She had bruising on her face and was crying and appeared to be distressed. Shahana later called police who attended the property with paramedics, to be told by Mohammed Hussain that his mother was possessed and in need of an exorcism, the court heard. Khatun also told them her mother-in-law was possessed, it is claimed. ‘When the ambulance crew arrived, they wanted to take Asma to hospital,’ Mr Alabi said. Allegations: Asma's husband Ahmed, 60, summoned the . local Muslim preacher to carry out the ceremony and encouraged him to . hit his wife harder, Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) was told . ‘However, Ahmed Hussain said she was not going. Asma Hussain followed what he said and the other defendants supported this. ‘The family kept pouring water over her, claiming it was holy water. ‘All of a sudden, Asma rushed out of the room and went straight to the ambulance. ‘In the ambulance, a full assessment was carried out. When Asma’s top was lifted up, it was discovered her back was one massive bruise.’ During police interviews, Halima Khatun claimed her mother-in-law was possessed and said she knew water had been thrown at her, but insisted she was unaware anyone had beaten her. Salma Hussain told police she was present when her mother was hit by the imam but denied any involvement. She later refuted taking any part in the assaults on Mrs Hussain. Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Mohammed Aziz also both denied any involvement in the assault. Ahmed Hussain claimed he was held captive by his son, Mohammed Kayes, and was unaware of what was going on as he had been ‘given something to drink’. He denied instigating the offences. Ahmed Hussain, of Poplar, east London; Mohammed Kayes Hussain, of Aldgate, east London; Salma Hussain, of Shadwell, east London; Aziz, of the same address, and Khatun, of the same address, all deny assault occasioning actual bodily harm and false imprisonment.

Democratic convention delegates booed after the party voted to reinstate to its platform mentions of God and a declaration that Jerusalem was is the capital of Israel in their platform. Many in the arena jeered after the convention chairman Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, of Los Angeles ruled that the amendments had been approved even though a large group of delegates had objected. The party reinstated language from the 2008 platform that said 'we need a government that stands up for the hopes, values and interests of working people and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential'. Scroll down for video . Dissent: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared that the 'God' amendment passed a voice vote -- despite loud opposition from some party members . President Barack Obama intervened directly to restore the God and Jerusalem language changed both on Jerusalem. But Republicans charged that Obama had authorised the changes in the first place and reversed himself only after a wave of public criticism. The chaos in the arena was highly embarrassing for Democrats and the vote to change the platform appeared to be indecisive but was railroaded through by Villaraigosa anyway. The fiasco exposed tensions on Israel within the party in a year when Jewish support could be crucial, especially in the swing state of Florida. ‘There was no discussion,’ said Noor Ul-Hasan, a Muslim delegate from Salt Lake City, who questioned whether the convention had enough of a quorum to even amend the platform. ‘We didn’t even see it coming. We were blindsided by it.’ Angela Urrea, a delegate from Roy, Utah, said: ‘The majority spoke last night,"" said. ""We shouldn't be declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.’ Opposition: The Arab-American Democrats on the floor objected to both the 'God' language and the declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel . Republicans pounced quickly on both omissions. GOP . officials argued that not taking a position on Jerusalem's status in . the party platform showed the president was weak in his support of . Israel. Republican presidential nominee Mitt . Romney said omitting God 'suggests a party that is increasingly out of . touch with the mainstream of the American people.' 'I think this party is veering further and further away into an extreme wing that American's don't recognize,' Romney said. Confusion: Villaraigos was unsure what to do when the amendment didn't have a clear two-thirds majority in the first two voice votes . The Democratic Party's decision to . restore the mention of Jerusalem reflected what advisers claim was the . president's personal view, if not the policy of his administration. The . administration has long said determining Jerusalem's status was an issue . that should be decided by Israelis and Palestinians in peace talks, but . has been careful not to state that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. Romney's campaign quickly sought to capitalize on the slight, but important difference. 'Mitt . Romney has consistently stated his belief that Jerusalem is the capital . of Israel,' said Andrea Saul, Romney's spokeswoman. 'President Obama . has repeatedly refused to say the same himself. Now is the time for . President Obama to state in unequivocal terms whether or not he believes . Jerusalem is Israel's capital.' The White House wouldn't say whether the change in the Democratic platform language reflected a change in administration policy. Fixed? This is the language to was put back into the Democratic Party Platform after it was removed on Tuesday . Democratic National Committee . chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the reinstated party language . reflected 'the policy of both Republican and Democratic administrations . for decades.' Following the decision, former Ohio Gov Ted Strickland told reporters, 'It was an effort to bring clarification.' But the decision to amend the platform did not rest well with some delegates.

Victim: Four members of the same family have been jailed for life for the murder of Naila Mumtaz, who was six months pregnant . A man and three members of his family were jailed for at least 56 years yesterday after being convicted of murdering his pregnant wife claiming she was possessed by evil spirits. One of the four smothered 21-year-old Nalia Mumtaz while the others held her down, apparently in an attempt to drive out the ‘jinn’ spirit from her body. The killers included her husband, Mohammed Tauseef Mumtaz – who later claimed she suffocated herself – his parents, Zia Ul-Haq and Salma Aslam, both 51, and his brother in law Hammad Hassan. The murder of the isolated young woman was said to have been instigated by Mumtaz’s parents. The four were convicted in July following a three-month trial after a jury ruled they had deliberately smothered her. Mr Justice Keith handed them mandatory life terms yesterday. He said that, while the murder conviction left no room for doubt about what had happened at the family home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, the prosecution had been unable to ‘say for sure’ what the motives behind the killing had been. The court heard Mumtaz, who suffers from a genetic condition which has left him deformed, married his bride in an arranged ceremony in her homeland of Pakistan. This was 14 months before she died while six months pregnant with their first child. Birmingham Crown Court heard that a day before her death in the early hours of a July 2009 morning, Mrs Mumtaz, who spoke no English, had sounded ‘stressed’ when she called her parents to tell them her husband – and others in their neighbourhood – had been suggesting she may have become pregnant during a solo trip to Pakistan. But the judge said a ‘less unlikely explanation for what happened’ was that the defendants believed Naila had been possessed by a jinn – a mischievous spirit mentioned in the Koran – ‘and that they deliberately smothered her in order to get rid of the jinn’. The judge added: ‘That’s not an easy thing for those of us in the West to understand, but the evidence (from the trial) was that a belief in jinns is widespread in the community in which they lived.’ During the trial, prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said family members had told police a person had been present at  the house praying ‘to get the spirit out of her’. Killers: Husband Mohammed Mumtaz, mother-in-law Salma Aslam, brother-in-law Hammad Hassan, and father-in-law Zia Ul-Haq . Mumtaz claimed his wife had . ‘suffocated herself by putting her hand in her mouth and she tried to . strangle herself’ and that his parents and Hassan, 24, who all lived at . the house, were trying to hold Mrs Mumtaz down to stop her from harming . herself. Ambulance staff discovered Mrs Mumtaz unconscious in a bedroom . with bruising to her arms and face. She died shortly after being taken . to hospital at around 4.30am. Prosecutors said that while ‘complex . cultural beliefs’ underpinned the defence case, the defendants had given . untruthful accounts. The court heard Mumtaz suffered from . Klippel-Feil Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which means the neck is . shortened. However,  it was alleged his bride had willingly entered into . the arranged marriage, despite his deformity. Killers: Mohammed Tauseef Mumtaz (left) and his parents, pictured before a previous court hearing in April, were all convicted of murdering Naila Mumtaz . Defence barristers yesterday said that . at the most, the defendants were guilty of a desire to cause ‘really . serious bodily injury’, and not death. Ul-Haq and Aslam, who the judge said . were ‘more likely to have instigated what was done to Naila’, were . sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years each. Their son and Hassan, who . is married to the couple’s daughter, were sentenced to a minimum of 13 . years. Hassan was said to have acted like a . ‘dutiful son-in-law’, who, like Mumtaz, ‘went along’ with what the . couple thought should be done.

Once every office and most homes in the UK rattled and rang with their unmistakable sound but today marked the end of an era for the humble typewriter. The last one to be made in Britain has been taken off the factory floor as Brother stopped manufacturing the machine at its north Wales factory. The company has made 5.9 million in Wrexham since 1985 and has sent its last typewriter to the Science Museum in London to be displayed as an artefact. Historic: Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter and is shown here doing a final test on the production line . The original: This machine dates back to July 1985 and was the first to be made at Brother's Wrexham factory . After 130 years it is has finally become a victim of the computer-dominated world as Brother said demand in Britain had fallen to the point where it was no longer financially viable to keep making them. Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter. 'If people ever ask me, I can always say now, as a strange question, that I’ve made the last typewriter in the UK,' he said. 'I have made so many typewriters down the years. I once managed to make one with my eyes closed.' Made in Britain: Rachel Bloon from the Science Museum is handed the artefact by Craig McCubbin and Phil Jones from Brother UK . End of an era: The typewriter are of manufacturing at Brother's factory in Wrexham (pictured) ended today . The company said that it still had significant sales in the U.S. - where government departments and some offices still use them - but Brother's factory in the Far East produces enough typewriters to serve this market. Despite its British-sounding name Brother is a Japanese company from Nagoya that started life in 1908 as the Yasui Sewing Machine Company. It was given an English title, Brother, in 1954 to establish itself in the international market. Four years later a European division was set up in 1958 in Dublin and ten years later moved its UK headquarters to Audenshaw in Manchester after they bought the famous Jones Sewing Machine brand. In 2012, Brother's annual turnover was in excess of £3.8bn per year with its main manufacturing centres in China, Taiwan and soon Vietnam. It still does have production in the UK and is also well known for sponsoring Manchester City between 1989 and 1999, still one of the longest shirt deals in UK football history. The company will continue to use the Wrexham factory to run a recycling scheme for printer cartridges as well as to make other office technology. UK boss Phil Jones said the typewriter still held 'a special place in the hearts' of members of the public. He said: 'Because of this, and the typewriter’s importance in the history of business communication, we felt that giving it a home at the Science Museum would be a fitting tribute.' Typewriters were first mass produced by the Remington company in the 1870s. The Science Museum’s assistant curator of technologies and engineering, Rachel Boon, said staff were excited to add the item 'to our rich collection of typewriters' which numbers more than 200. She said: 'This model will enable us to tell the story of how technology has evolved in accordance with our communication needs.' The first known typewriter was invented in the US in 1830 by William Burt. But typewriters did not become a commercial success until the 1870s when inventors Christopher Sholes - who also invented the Qwerty keyboard - and Carlos Glidden made a deal with the Remington company to mass produce their machines. The first recorded idea for a typewriter is dated 1714 when an Englishman called Henry Mill patented his idea for ""an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another."" However, it wasn't until 1808 that Italian Pellegrino Turri built the first working machine of its kind. Turri made the typewriter for his friend Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano, a story which was the basis of a novel by Carey Wallace published in 2010. It wasn't until 1870 when Danish pastor Rasmus Malling-Hansen invented his 'writing ball,' that production of typewriter-like machines began on an industrial level. Typewriters as we know them now started to circulate after the introduction in 1874 of the Sholes & Glidden Type Writer in the USA. This machine brought in the QWERTY keyboard, and was designed by Milwaukee journalist, poet, and part-time inventor Christopher L Sholes. The QWERTY keyboard was designed to solve problems during printing, separating frequently-used pairs of type-bars so that the type-bars would not clash and get stuck at the printing point. The Sholes and Glidden looked very like a sewing machine and had limited success on the market. The Remington later became the commercial leaders in typewriters and is the basis of all such machines since. It was the Underwood typewriter that captured the market place for the coming decades. By the 1920's all brands were an imitation of the Underwood, which boasted frontstroke, QWERTY, typebar machines printing through a ribbon, and the  one shift key and four banks of keys.","Brother's last one is sent to the Science Museum to be displayed as an artefact .

It started off as a prank that bemused a few embarrassed commuters but has since grown into a global phenomenon. And despite the threat of snow and bleak midwinter temperatures many hardy thrill seekers braved bracing conditions and took to the London Underground today to take part in the No Trousers Tube Ride 2013. It was all part of the No Pants Subway Ride's 13th annual celebration of riding the world's underground without trousers, with commuters in London joining their counterparts from dozens of cities around the globe to venture out minus their breeches. Scroll down for video . Flashmob: A group of Tube passengers pretend not to know each other and keep a straight face as they take part in No Trousers on the Tube 2013 . Chilly: Commuters wait for a train to come along at Arsenal tube station, but there's one thing missing - their trousers . Barefaced cheek: Two female participants brave the cold weather and take to the London Underground in just their underwear . Mind the gap: A gang of pranksters taking part in the London event make sure they stand behind the yellow line while waiting for their train . The aim is to get on the train without trousers and to keep as straight a face as possible. Participants behave as if they do not know each other and - other than the lack of trousers - dress appropriately for winter donning hats, scarfs and a warm coat. The hilarious craze started back in 2002 when a handful of New York pranksters decided to cause a stir on a Subway train. One participant entered the train in just his underwear for seven consecutive stops and, if asked, were instructed to tell people that they 'just forgot' their trousers. Acting normally: Those who take part are told to go about their everyday business and pretend not to know each other . Say cheese: Other fully-clothed commuters take pictures of fellow passengers who are just in their pants on a packed Picadilly Line train . Untrussed Down Under: Commuters in Sydney, Australia, also took to the train minus their trousers . Balmy weather: Passengers about to board the Sydney CityRail earlier today in comfortably warm temperatures . Confused: Passengers were bemused by less than fully-dressed commuters at a rail station in Berlin . Colourful: Some dressed in garish underwear as they removed their trousers to take part in the No pants Subway Ride in Berlin today . On the 8th stop, a final participant would enter the carriage selling trousers out of a duffle bag - much to the bemusement of other passengers. The annual event steadily grew each year with more and more people choosing to take part. But it nearly hit the buffers in 2006 when the stunt was halted by a New York policeman. Eight passengers were handcuffed in their underwear and taken into police custody. A judge later threw out the case because it is not illegal to wear just your underwear on the Subway. Surprise: Passengers on a Shanghai train look startled as one passenger, complete with warm jumper and wooly hat takes off his shoes and trousers . Quizzed: Two passengers are highly amused by the prank while another two men ask the trouser-less traveller what he is up to . Untrussed: Passengers on a Shanghai subway train might have their umbrellas to protect them from the rain, but they are likely to get wet legs without their trousers . Startling: Onlookers watch as two girls chat nonchalantly on a Shanghai train earlier today . The No Pants event went global in 2008 with Adelaide in Australia joining eight American cities in taking part in the stunt. Last year's event saw tens of thousands of people daring to bare their underwear in 59 cities in 27 countries around the world. In London alone more than 150 took part. This year Londoners startled fellow passengers on the Picadilly Line. Unlike freezing London participants, those who took part in New York enjoyed a mild winter day, while those who took off their trousers in Sydney basked in balmy summer weather. Events also took place in cities such as Sofia, Stockholm, Berlin and Beijing. Hilarious: A group of men share a laugh as they take part in No Pants Day in Sofia, Bulgaria .

Founder and director of the LEO Zoological Conservation Center, Marcella Leone, watched the birth alongside staff and a group of other giraffes. When fully grown, the newborn, who will mingle with a group of five giraffes, which includes two pregnant giraffes, could reach 18 feet in height. Rare: A giraffe listed as an endangered subspecies has also been born at a conservation centre in Connecticut . Staff had double cause for celebration because the calf is the first born at the off-exhibit centre.

March Madness kicked off with a bang on Thursday with millions of Americans glued to the games to see how their brackets would fare in the early stages. As the NCAA tournament brings out the bracketologist in all of us, one mathematician is encouraging people to keep expectations low because the odds are not in your favor. After running the numbers, DePaul University Math Professor Jeff Bergen estimates there is only a one in 9 quintillion (that's a 9 followed by 18 zeros) of filling out a perfect bracket. Serenity now. Numbers don't lie: DePaul Professor Jeff Bergen showed the chances of a person filling out a correct NCAA Baskeball Tournament bracket and they ain't good . Do the math: The mathematician showed that out of the entire U.S. population, the likelihood of someone filling out a perfect bracket is less than 1/4 of 1 per cent . Professor Bergen explained, 'If you're just guessing [while filling out your bracket], you basically have no chance.' The Chicago university filmed the math whiz calculating the numbers in front of a whiteboard and as the computation unfolded, the results were enough to make even the most optimistic college basketball fan begin to despair. He explained how there are 64 teams in total for the bracket but only 63 are entered into his formula, because every team besides the ultimate victor will lose one game. There are two outcomes for each game and so to fill out a perfect bracket, someone must correctly predict the outcome for all 63 games. Scientific methods: Engineering students at Georgia Tech have built a computer model that predicts the outcome of the college basketball tournament, with Florida chosen as the 2013 victor . Mathematically this can be explained by multiplying 2x2x2x2x2....63 times. That yields the astronomical number of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 or  9 quintillion and change. But that chance is for the ordinary Joe Blow who really knows nothing about the NCAA and just wants to take part in the office pool and experience the cultural phenomena that is March Madness. The professor also created a formula that improved a person's chances of accuracy, only considering those filling out the bracket who actually know college basketball. 'If you know something about basketball, your chance of winning is one out of 128,000,000,000,' he said in the YouTube video to publicize his formula. Working off the assumption that everyone in the United States had a working knowledge of basketball and filled out their brackets accordingly, the chances of one person correctly predicting the outcome for all 63 games are still pretty slim at less than 1/4 of 1 per cent. 'When your bracket goes down the tubes, don't worry so does everyone else's!' he said somewhat reassuringly. Barack-etology: President Barack Obama filled out his bracket this week, selecting Indiana to win the NCAA men's basketball championship . But against all odds, engineers and scientists are still trying to put their knowledge to the test to predict the outcome. Engineers at Georgia Tech’s Logistic Regression/Markov Chain (LRMC) college basketball ranking system have developed a computerized model to select the NCAA champ. In the past five years they have correctly chosen the victor for three of those years. This year, the model predicts Florida, Louisville, Indiana and Gonzaga will advance to the Final Four with Florida and Gonzaga playing for the title. Florida was selected as the presumed winner, according to the model. But as they say, those who can't...teach. Neither DePaul or Georgia Tech made the tournament this year. Expert: Nate Silver estimates each teams' chances of advancing in the college basketball tournament . Even the president takes part in the madness. On Tuesday, he unveiled his bracket predictions with Louisville, Indiana, Ohio State and Florida reaching the Final Four and Louisville and Indiana facing off in the championship. President Obama believes the Hoosiers will claim victory. 'I think this is Indiana's year,' he said on ESPN, in a segment dubbed Barack-etology. Coming off the heels of his successful presidential election prediction, statistician Nate Silver applied his logic to the college basketball tournament. His bracket showed each team's likelihood of advancing forward, predicting Louisville as the most likely to win the title, with a 23 per cent chance of victory compared to Indiana (18.4 per cent), Florida (13.3 per cent), Kansas (8 per cent) and Duke (5.9 per cent). After the agonizing hours spent trying to rationally predict the outcome, The Wall Street Journal's Dan Heath staged an intervention of sorts with his readers and provided a four step program for people to prepare to be disappointed with The Four Secrets of Bracket Psychology. 1. Distance yourself from emotion before deciding2. Prepare to be wrong3. Avoid confirmation bias4. Honor your core priorities . 'Let's be honest: Your NCAA tournament bracket is probably not going to win,' he wrote in his piece on Wednesday, though in the interest of full disclosure he did admit that he himself had never filled out a bracket in his life. With the likelihood of success at nil to none, college basketball enthusiasts should remember it really is about good fun. In the end, the Aggies didn't make the tournament so how good could it really be?","DePaul prof calculates a 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 chance of accuracy .

Last year, the nation watched an average of four hours and two minutes of television a day, up from three hours and 36 minutes a day in 2006. Although 29 per cent of adults watch online catch-up services like BBC iPlayer, just one per cent of people only use these services and do not watch live television. Nearly a third of internet users also watch television through catch-up services every week, but television ownership is still high, with 97 per cent of households owning a set.

FOX News President Roger Ailes has never been afraid to voice his disdain for liberals and has called President Obama 'lazy' and said that while the president's second-in-command is lovable, Joe Biden is 'dumb as an ashtray.' His no-holds-barred assessment of the Obama administration came in a new excerpt released today from a forthcoming book about the cable news mogul, Roger Ailes: Off Camera,  by Zev Chafets. It's a well known fact that there is no . love lost between FOX News and the left but Chafets' piece portrays a side of Roger . Ailes that is rarely seen, the man as a father, husband and a human who lives with a very real sense . of his own mortality. A man and his empire: Roger Ailes founded the FOX News Channel in 1996 and it has grown to become the most watched cable news network . Mr Ailes delivered his scathing criticism of Mr Obama during the 2012 presidential election in response to the comments made by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who said Anne Romney had 'never worked a day in her life.' 'Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money,' Ailes said, according to the excerpt published in Vanity Fair magazine . 'How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won't report that.' No love: Ailes called President Obama (left golfing on Martha's Vineyard in 2010) lazy and said Vice President Joe Biden (right at a campaign stop in Concord, N.H.) was dumb . As the founding president of the news network owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Mr Ailes has built FOX News from a fledgling channel created in 1996 to become the most watched cable news channel. He is a formidable force inside News Corp. and enjoys what Mr Murdoch has described as a 'close personal friendship' with the media mogul. But the newsman demurred, insisting that his survival at the global conglomerate is based on his ability to make a profit. 'Does Rupert like me? I think so, but it doesn’t matter,' he said. 'When I go up to the magic room in the sky [Murdoch's office on the eighth floor at News Corp. headquarters in New York] every three months, if my numbers are right, I get to live.' 'If not, I’m killed. Our relationship isn't about love - it's about arithmetic. Survival means hitting your numbers. I've met or exceeded mine in 56 straight quarters. The reason is: I treat Rupert's money like it is mine.' Though Ailes has successfully maintained FOX News as a cash cow for the Murdoch empire, their relationship became strained when Murdoch's son-in-law, PR exec Matthew Freud, said the family was 'ashamed and sickened' by Ailes. Freud, the second husband of Rupert's 44-year-daughter Elisabeth, made the comments to the New York Times in 2010 but Rupert was quick to downplay the remarks and said through a spokesman that he was 'proud of Roger Ailes and FOX News.' Friends: News Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch (right) said he has a close with Roger Ailes, known as a formidable force in the News Corp. empire . Strain: Matthew Freud (right), the second husband of Elisabeth Murdoch (left at a London party in 2009), told the New York Times in 2010 that the family was 'ashamed and sickened' by Roger Ailes . Mr Ailes gave Zev Chafets unfettered access to his personal affairs, a rare move by the media mogul known for his extreme distrust of outsiders, that has even been described as sheer paranoia. Chafets visited the powerful businessman at his office in midtown Manhattan at FOX News headquarters, his family home in Putnam County in upstate New York and at various outings, including watching his son at a school basketball game. Roger Ailes Off Camera by Zev Chafets will be released on March 19 . The father of one son, 12-year-old Zachary, Mr Ailes, 72, speaks openly about his realization that he won't live forever and voices his fear that he will not live to watch his son grow.

'The actuaries say I have six to eight years. The best tables give me 10. Three thousand days, more or less,' he predicted. 'I’m not going to be here forever and I want Zac to know me.' In preparation, he has been creating memory boxes of momentos to leave behind. So far he has stuffed letters, pictures and memorabilia into nine plastic crates for Zac. Among the tokens include a pocket-size copy of the U.S. Constitution, a picture of Zac's mother, Beth, a press release about Ailes and a biography of Ronald Reagan. 'This is advice Zac might need to hear from me in 10 years and I won't be here to give it to him,'  he said about his collection. 'I’ve told him, if he has a problem or he feels he needs me, to go off to a quiet place and listen, and he will hear my voice.' Ailes was diagnosed with hemophilia when he was a child and said that from an early age he had to come to terms with the prospect of dying. 'I've been prepared to face death all of my life...So I'm ready. Everybody fears the unknown. But I have a strong feeling there's something bigger than us. I don’t think all this exists because some rocks happened to collide. I'm at peace. When it comes, I’ll be fine, calm. I'll miss life, though. Especially my family,' he said. When probed about the afterlife, Ailes said he thinks he and God will get a long just fine - until the interviewer presents a problematic scenario. 'What if you get there and it turns out that God is a liberal?' Chafets asked him. 'Well, hell, if God’s a liberal, that’s his business,' he said. 'But I doubt very much that he is.

Tesco has been forced to pull a line of its own-brand frozen meatloaf from its shelves after tests revealed the product contained up to five per cent horse meat. The admission last night came less than two weeks after shoppers were reassured that tests on  meat products on sale in British supermarkets had been completed. The supermarket giant apologised to its customers after confirming that packs of its Tesco Simply Roast Meatloaf had become the fourth of its products to test positive for horse meat contamination. Scroll down for video . Withdrawn: Tests revealed traces of horse meat in packs of Tesco's frozen Simply Roast Meatloaf . It follows the British Retail Consortium's announcement on March 1 that supermarket chains had completed testing on minced beef products, and that the latest round had found no traces of horse DNA. The emergence of the tainted meatloaf at Tesco is the latest development in the scandal that began in January, when Irish food inspectors announced that traces of horse meat had been discovered in frozen beef burgers being sold at a number of UK supermarkets. It has since engulfed major stores and brands including Asda, Burger King, Findus and Birds Eye, and a new survey has revealed the impact of the furore on the nation's shopping habits. Tesco's frozen meatloaf is the latest in a string of beef products recalled by UK food firms and supermarkets since the horse meat scandal first hit the headlines in January. A first wave of tests found horse DNA in products including Aldi's special frozen beef lasagne and special frozen spaghetti bolognese, Co-op frozen quarter-pounder burgers, Findus beef lasagne, Rangeland's catering burger products, and Tesco Value frozen burgers and Value spaghetti bolognese. A second round revealed contamination of Asda's chilled beef bolognese sauce, beefburgers, minced beef and halal minced beef sold by Sodexo, which supplies food to schools, care homes and the armed forces, and a Whitbread Group lasagne and beefburger. The third wave revealed contamination of Bird's Eye Traditional Spaghetti Bolognese and Beef Lasagne, Taco Bell's ground beef and Brakes' spicy minced beef skewer. Ikea also withdrew wiener sausages in the UK last month after tests found 'indications' of horse meat, and it also withdrew a batch of its traditional meatballs. The company said it was removing the sausages from sale in Britain, France, Spain, Ireland and Portugal after tests confirmed 'a few indications of horse meat'. It showed three in five people have changed their eating habits in the wake of the scandal that continues to rock the food industry. Nearly a third are buying less processed meat, such as burgers, while one in four now avoid meat-based ready meals. Tesco said it had pulled the 600g packs of . Tesco Simply Roast Meatloaf, made between October last year and January . at Eurostock in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, from its shelves. Tim J Smith, its group technical director, said: 'Tests on 15 other . lines from the same manufacturing site were clear of horse meat. 'Our investigation to thoroughly understand the source of the . contamination has started and we will complete our investigation before . deciding whether to continue using the supplier. 'We are very sorry that we have had a further product which has failed to meet the high standards we and our customers expect.' He said the company had now tested 500 product lines. Along with retailers, schools, care homes and hospitals have also been drawn into the controversy after unwittingly serving tainted beef. Consumer group Which? found that buyers’ trust in the food industry has fallen by a quarter, while 60 per cent have changed their spending habits. The organisation wants the Government to take urgent steps to ensure food labels are accurate, and for more random testing to be introduced. It says the Food Standards Agency should have greater powers to investigate and enter premises where food fraud is suspected. The survey, conducted late last month, also revealed that two-thirds of people (68 per cent) do not think the Government has been giving enough attention to enforcing labelling laws, with half of consumers (50 per cent) not confident that ingredient information is accurate. It found that 44 per cent now spend more time looking at the ingredients label on meat products, with 83 per cent agreeing that country of origin labelling should be required on such items. Confidence in food safety has also dropped, from nine in 10 feeling confident when buying products in the supermarket before the scandal broke to seven in 10 feeling confident now. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'The horse meat scandal exposed the need for urgent changes to the way food fraud is detected and standards are enforced. These serious failings must be put right if consumers are to feel fully confident in the food they are buying once more. Tests: The tainted packs of meatloaf were manufactured at Eurostock in Craigavon, Tesco said . 'Ministers must ensure that everyone involved, including their own departments, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the food industry and local authorities, are crystal clear about their responsibility to protect consumers and are properly equipped to do so.' Which? has called on the Government to take five 'urgent' steps, including more surveillance that is better co-ordinated between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the FSA and local authorities, and the immediate scrapping of proposals to decriminalise failure to comply with food labelling legislation. It also wants the food industry to improve traceability, labelling and testing of products, with the responsibility for labelling policy returned to the FSA from Defra. Which? said: 'Consumers should know what's in their food and where it's from. 'The Government should push for the EU-wide country-of-origin labelling to cover processed meat used in meat products, like ready meals. 'It should also scrap its plans to drop national rules requiring clear ingredient labels for meat sold loose, like in a delicatessen.' It added: 'The scandal shows this split (between Defra and the FSA) causes unnecessary confusion and complication. The Government should now move responsibility for labelling and standards responsibilities back to the FSA.'

"By . Hayley Peterson and Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 4 March 2013 . House Speaker John Boehner today admitted there is no easy way to stop the budget cuts dashing hopes for millions of Americans. The cuts, also called the 'sequester' began to take effect on Friday night. In an interview this morning with NBC’s Meet the Press, Mr Boehner said he wasn't sure how Washington could solve the fiscal problems that have dominated the country's politics for more than two years and he also suggested that he's not sure where the debate goes from here . Now what? House Speaker John Boehner says there is no easy way to stop the ""sequester"" budget cuts that took effect Friday night . 'I don't think anyone quite understands how it gets resolved,' Mr Boehner admitted during his interview with NBC’s David Gregory. President Obama and officials within his administration had warned of consequences for national security and government services if the sequester went ahead. Mr Obama has suggested new tax increases to avoid the cuts but Mr Boehner and his fellow Republicans have said that such a deal is not on the cards. Both the Republican and Democrat parties are agreed on one thing: neither wants the spending cuts to continue. Yet they've been unable to reach any agreement on an alternative measure. Where do we go from here? Both Republicans & Democrats are agreed on one thing - neither wants the spending cuts to continue... but they can't agree how to resolve the issues . Mr Boehner insists that the President should look at spending instead of attempting to push through new tax inceases. 'Every American, in these tough economic times, has to find a way to balance their budget. They've got to make choices,' Mr Boehner said. 'They expect Washington to live within its means and to make choices as well and it's time for the president and Senate Democrats to get serious about the long-term spending problem that we have.' Mr Boehner, who met March 1 with Obama and other congressional leaders, blamed Democrats for the impasse over the 'silly' cuts. He also said Republicans will hold firm in their demands for cuts in entitlement spending. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Facing public scrutiny: Neither side looks particularly good from the sequester fight but Republicans are very supportive of Speaker John Boehner's tough approach and his refusal to negotiate . President Obama cast blame on Congress for failing to avoid the sequester cuts . 'I’ve been here for 22 years' and 'I’ve watched leaders from both parties kick this can down the road,' he . said. 'We’re out of road to kick the can down. We’ve got a long-term . spending problem that has to be addressed.’ At the same time, Mr . Boehner said Republicans have no interest in shuttering the government . later this month when Congress will have to approve budget legislation . to keep federal agencies running beyond March 27. 'We should not . have any talk of a government shutdown so I’m hopeful that the House and . Senate will be able to work through this,' he said. Mr . Obama has demanded that any plan to replace the sequester must include . new tax increases, but Mr Boehner has said the President had already . secured a tax increase in a deal he made with Republicans in December. 'American . family's wages aren't growing,' the House speaker said. 'They're being . squeezed. And as a result, we've got to find a way through our tax code . to promote more economic growth in our country.  We can do this by . closing loopholes, bringing the (tax) rates down for all Americans, . making the tax code fairer. It will promote more economic growth.' Headed in without hope: Boehner agreed to nothing during the last-ditch negotiation session . On . Friday the President said it could take some time before members of . Congress agree to bargain with him on how to replace the spending cuts. He . told reporters that he hoped that as members of Congress began to hear . from constituents who are being negatively impacted they would think of a . way to move forward. 'It's going to mean hundreds of thousands . of jobs lost,' the President said. “That is real. We're not making that . up.  That’s not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.' Mr Boehner . responded, 'I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not. I . don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going . to work.' On Saturday Obama made phone calls to both Democratic . and GOP  senators to form a 'caucus of common sense' and support an . alternative to the spending cuts. Sharing his thoughts: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that the sequester is not a good move for President Obama and he blamed his former opponent for 'forcing' Republicans to dig in their heels . Mr Boehner has also won himself a . big-name fan in Mitt Romney, but his support comes more at Mr Obama's . expense rather than as a result of Mr Boehner's tactics. 'Well, no one can think that that's . been a success for the President,' the former presidential candidate . said in his first post-campaign interview with Fox News Sunday. 'He . didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening, but to date, . what we've seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, . doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and . berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. That causes the . Republicans to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It's a . very natural human emotion. 'The . President has the opportunity to lead the nation and to bring . Republicans and Democrats together. It's a job he's got to do, and it's a . job only the President can do.' President . Obama officially signed off on the $85billion in spending cuts on . Friday night after congressional leaders fail to compromise on a . replacement deal, leaving thousands of Americans in fear for their . jobs. The President made his displeasure with the deal known in a formal statement from the press briefing room. 'Everybody here, . all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol … They're going . to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a . pay cut, and they got to figure out how to manage that,' Obama said. 'That's real... that's not a scare tactic.' Obama made the remarks from the White . House following a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate . Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Democratic leaders Nancy . Pelosi and Harry Reid. Boehner emerged from the . meeting and told reporters that taxes were off the table as an option . to avoid the spending cuts, making it clear that no compromise had been . made. House Speaker John Boehner emerged from a White House meeting and declared that taxes are off the table as an option to avoid the sequester cuts . 'The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over,' he said. 'It's about taking on the spending problem.' Obama blamed Republicans for the country's predicament, claiming that there are many conservatives on Capitol Hill who agree with him, but are unwilling to say so publicly. President Obama wanted to replace the so-called sequester with a plan that would raise revenues as well as make a series of targeted spending cuts. But after making concessions on taxes in December by raising rates on the wealthiest of Americans, Republicans said they were unwilling to include new revenues in a plan to avert the sequester. The . immediate impact of the reductions remains uncertain, even as Obama has . declared it would mean 'hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.' The . administration has pulled back on earlier warnings of long lines . developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms. Because of those claims, Obama has been accused of posturing and exaggerating the effects of the cuts. His warnings of economic doom appeared to be a partial attempt to avert blame in the future if the economy begins to contract. 'Every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month, two months or six months...  We'll know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act,' he said. Industries most affected by the cuts . will be those that rely heavily on government funding, including the . military and defense contractors. 'Communities near military bases will take a serious blow,' Obama said. 'Border patrol agents, FBI agents ... all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.' While Obama warned off mass layoffs and smaller salaries as an immediate result of the cuts, he also hedged his warnings, saying, 'This is not going to be an apocalypse... It's just dumb.' He urged Congress to continue working on a plan to eventually replace the sequester. 'I don't anticipate a huge financial . crisis, but people are going to be hurt, he said. 'The economy will not grow as . quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it . would have.' Mr Boehner said Congress will move next week on a measure to maintain government funding after March 27th. Department of Defense . Homeland Security . Transportation and Recreation . Public Schools .

Peter Scott, a prolific cat burglar who identified himself as a modern Robin Hood, has died aged 82. Living on benefits in a council flat in Islington, North London, his final days were a far cry from his lifetime devoted to stealing millions from the rich and famous. Among his victims, none of whom he held in high esteem, were such stars as Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, Vivien Leigh, Lauren Bacall, and the gambling club and zoo owner John Aspinall, of whom he recalled: 'Robbing that bastard Aspinall was one of my favourites,' according to the Telegraph. High-society cat burglar Peter Scott, pictured in 1998, has died aged 82 . In total, by Scott's own reckoning, he stole jewels, furs and artworks worth more than £30 million. One of his most 'successful' jobs was stealing a £200,000 necklace from  Sophia Loren, whom he described as having 'got what she deserved' when she was in Britain filming The Millionaires in 1960. Fleet Street at the time said it was the biggest jewellery robbery ever in Britain; it earned Scott £30,000 from a 'fence' according to the Telegraph. From an early age, Scott was destined for an exciting life of crime. At first he alluded capture but eventually his illicit actions caught up with him and he spent numerous years behind bars. Born on February 18, 1931, in Belfast, to a middle-class military family in Belfast, Peter Craig Gulston's father died when he was young and his mother emigrated to the US. Scott said Italian actress Sophia Loren, pictured circa 1965, 'got what she deserved' after stealing a £200,000 necklace from her . A bright young boy, Peter was however trouble. He went to Belfast Royal Academy, but was inept at exams; instead he managed to swindle away the entirety of his father's inheritance. As a teenager he turned to crime, burgling the posh homes in Malone Road in his school scarf and filling his rugby bag. According to his memoirs, Scott claims he got away with 150 such crimes before police eventually caught up with him in 1952, but he still got away with just six months in Crumlin Road jail, after only being charged with 12 jobs. Once free, he changed his name to Scott and moved to London and like a moth to a flame, found himself wandering the streets of Mayfair and Belgravia, planning his next jobs. He began working as a pub bouncer and at night, would creep into the homes of London's richest. Taking his burgling career seriously, he carefully planned every raid, wearing a new suit for each burglary to blend in, if caught. On numerous occasions he was interrupted once inside, but with a reassuring call of, 'It's only me,' or 'Everything's alright, madam,' his appearance and demeanor meant he got away with his crimes. In the 1950s and 1960s, Scott would select his targets by going through the Daily Mail or the Daily Express. He even decided to join a swanky London tennis club to mingle with the wealthy, coaching more 'rich prats' who would likely become his victims. Even up until the 1980s Scott continued to climb up drainpipes and enter buildings through skilled and stealthy means. By the mid-1990s, Scott had served 12 years inside over the course of half a dozen different stretches. He was jailed for another three years in 1998 following the theft of Picasso's Tete de Femme from Lefevre Gallery in Mayfair the previous year. In his memoirs, Gentleman Thief (1995) he described his victims as 'upper class prats chattering in monosyllables'. Elizabeth Taylor playing with her pearls in a scene from the film 'Ash Wednesday', 1973, was a victim, as was actress Lauren Bacall, right . He wrote: 'The people I burgled got rich through greed and skullduggery. They indulged in the mechanics of ostentation - they deserved me and I deserved them. If I rob Ivana Trump, it is just a meeting of two different types of degeneracy on a dark rooftop.' He lived his heyday flashing his cash on luxury cars and fast women. His glamorous girlfriends included the model Jackie Bowyer - the second of his four wives. Scott, however, ended up broke and was declared bankrupt owing creditors £440,000. A son survives him.","Peter Scott stole £30 million from the rich and famous in his lifetime, he said .

Trial: Gary Cawthorne is accused of claiming to work for a modelling agency to lure a girl into toilets before groping her breasts . A businessman molested a teenage girl while posing as a freelance model scout for a top agency representing clients including Kelly Brook and Agyness Deyn, a court heard today. Gary Cawthorne, 49, told the 16-year-old to strip off so he could ‘measure her’ before cupping her breasts in a toilet cubicle at a luxury central London hotel, jurors were told. He then asked if she wanted bigger breasts before insisting she didn’t need cosmetic surgery, Southwark Crown Court heard. Cawthorne, who has held a string of directorships with firms in the financial sector, said he had worked for reputable modelling agencies, including Select Model Management, which represents Ms Deyn and Ms Brook. He also claimed the fashion brand Gap was among his clients. The girl had first accompanied a friend who arranged to meet Cawthorne advertising herself as an aspiring model on the website Gumtree.com. He said he had a vast knowledge of the industry and gave the girls the impression he could help them find work, jurors heard. The girl, who cannot be identified, broke down in tears as she told how she was left in ‘shock’ after Cawthorne assaulted her. Prosecutor Anita Arora told the jury: ‘This is a case about a man who took advantage of a young and naive girl who put herself in a vulnerable situation. ‘She and a friend put an advert on Gumtree advertising themselves as models. ‘As a result, the friend was contacted by a man called Gary and a meeting was arranged between the two girls and him.’ The girls initially met Cawthorne last . April 2 at the Grand Hotel in Northumberland Avenue, close to The . Strand in central London, to talk about the modelling industry, Ms Arora . said. A second meeting was organised two days later at the hotel, during which the two girls were also accompanied by a third friend. ‘Things took a slightly unusual turn,’ Ms Arora said. ‘He asked to measure the girls for what they would wear at some stage as models.’ Cawthorne and the girl went in a lift for a ‘fitting’, jurors heard. ‘She said she was feeling nervous, she had never done anything like this before. ‘They went in a toilet, not in a room, just her and Gary Cawthorne. ‘He asked if she was ok then asked her to take her clothes off, which she did. ‘He then pulled out a tape measure and started to take measurements including around her breast area and her legs. ‘He was making comments to her about her body and she felt uncomfortable. ‘She was shocked but she carried on.’ Claims: Cawthorne allegedly said he worked for the agency representing Kelly Brook and Agyness Deyn . Cawthorne then told the girl to take her bra off or the measurement would not be ‘accurate’, jurors heard. She covered her breasts with both hands and let him measure her. ‘He cupped both breasts with his hands and said there was nothing wrong with them’, Ms Arora told the court. ‘She didn’t ask him to do that. She didn’t agree to that and that, say the prosecution, is a sexual assault.’ The girl initially kept quiet but confided in her mother a few days later, who demanded Cawthorne’s phone number, the jury heard. ‘She decided to make enquiries about whether he was a legitimate model scout. ‘He convinced her he was a professional involved in the field of finding models, effectively a freelance model scout. ‘He maintained he worked for reputable model agencies including Select Model Management in London. ‘She asked him about his clients and he mentioned Gap. She was impressed by how professional he sounded.’ Meeting: Cawthorne allegedly attacked his victim in the toilets at the Grand Hotel in Northumberland Avenue, London . But the girl’s mother became alarmed when Cawthorne told her he had a psychology qualification and was a ‘doctor of some sort.’ After contacting a modelling agency, who they said they had never heard of Cawthorne, the mother called police, jurors heard. In a prepared statement, Cawthorne admitted being in contact with the girl and her friend but insisted nothing ‘untoward’ happened, adding: ‘I have no intention of touching someone without their permission.’ Cawthorne, of Plumstead, south-east London, denies sexual assault.

Two close friends have been killed after being hit by an 'out of control' truck while on holiday with their wives in Thailand. Derek Gent, 69, and Michael Holmes, 68, both from Rochdale, died on the island of Koh Samui. It is believed retired council chief Mr Gent and Mr Holmes were walking along a road when they were knocked down by the pick-up truck and killed instantly. Tragic: Derek Gent, 69, and Michael Holmes, 68, both from Rochdale, died on the island of Koh Samui, pictured . It is not known whether their wives witnessed the tragedy. Reports from the holiday island say the truck originally collided with a Toyota Corolla and veered off the road. It then hit Mr Gent - the former head of Oldham's trading standards - and Mr Holmes, before smashing into a tea shop. The driver of the Toyota told police he was driving home from the beach when the truck tried to overtake him causing a collision which span the pick-up 'out of control'. The truck driver is critically ill in a Bangkok hospital, while the driver of the Toyota escaped unharmed. Killed: It is believed retired council chief Mr Gent and Mr Holmes were walking along a road when they were knocked down by the pick-up truck and killed instantly . Mr Gent and father-of-three Mr Holmes had been staying with their wives in a hotel close to where the accident happened. It is believed their devastated widows were returning home today. Neighbours on Croft Head Drive, Milnrow, where keen angler Mr Gent lived, paid tribute. One, who was visibly upset, said: 'They were both absolutely wonderful men. Everyone is still in shock.' Another said: 'We'll miss them very much. They were both lovely people.' A third neighbour added: 'I have lost two fantastic friends.' Mr Gent retired from Oldham council about four years ago. Long-standing councillor Hugh McDonald said: 'Derek was always very courteous and pleasant and dealt with things very well. It is an awful tragedy.' John Battye, a fellow Oldham councillor, added: 'Derek was very professional and transformed our service from mediocre to first class. 'He was a very tall, handsome fellow and had quite a presence.' Mr and Mrs Holmes lived just a few yards away from the Gents on Yeoman's Close. One neighbour said: 'Our thoughts are with both families. It is just absolutely tragic.' Another added: 'Michael will be missed. Our deepest sympathies go to both families.' Mr Holmes is believed to have worked in sales. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth office confirmed it had been informed of their deaths and added: 'We are aware of the death of two British nationals in Thailand on March 23. 'We are providing full consular assistance to the families at this time.'","Derek Gent, 69, and Michael Holmes, 68 died on the island of Koh Samui .

The . family of murdered student Meredith Kercher today welcomed the news that Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito would face a . re-trial. Meredith's mother Arline and sister Stephanie said . that they had been told that an Italian court had overturned the . acquittals this morning. Knox was originally . sentenced to 26 years in prison and her former boyfriend Sollecito 25 . years for killing and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2007. They both served four years before being acquitted on appeal in 2011. Speaking . outside their home in Coulsdon, south London, the Kerchers said that all they wanted was justice for the 21-year-old woman they knew as Mez. Stephanie said: 'There are obviously a lot of unanswered . questions still, so we just hope that the outcome will answer those. 'All that we want is justice for Mez, but there is still a long journey . ahead of us. But it's making sure that we find out exactly what did . happen that night. 'Nothing's going to bring her back. We know that, but we have to do what we can for her as well. 'Justice for Mez': The family welcomed the decision by an Italian court this morning to overturn the acquittal . 'We just follow the system and hope we get complete justice. Every day is difficult, we have our lives, but we're still remembering Mez all together.' Murdered: Student Meredith Kercher was found dead with her throat slashed in Perugia in 2007 . Miss Kercher said that they were speaking to their solicitor to find out how the case would progress. She added that a trust set up in her sister's name, which is helping to pay . legal costs in the case, would eventually support people who found . themselves in a similar situation. She added: 'We've set up the Meredith Kercher Trust to help with . Meredith's case, but with the view that I'm going to convert it to a . charity to help other people once our case is closed. Just people in our . situation really. 'On the back of depending what interest I get with it will determine how I can best help other people. 'But I think one thing that has come out of it for us is we don't . actually have any financial support from anyone at all, so it is . literally all paid for by ourselves.

Back in the dock: Amanda Knox, right, was originally jailed for 26 years and Raffaele Sollecito, left, for 25 years . In Italy, the Kercher family's lawyer said that he was very pleased with the result. Francesco Maresca said: 'I . am happy the Supreme court has seen the faults in the acquittal and I . trust the next trial will be fair and balanced.' The ruling by the Court of . Cassation examined whether there were procedural irregularities which . gave grounds for a retrial, rather than assessing the details of the . case, which remain obscure in many particulars.

As the centrepiece of the Diamond Jubilee river pageant last year, it was last seen decked in gilded finery and bearing a proud monarch. Now the Spirit of Chartwell, which served as the Queen’s royal barge, is sailing under a foreign flag - having been sold to a Portuguese holiday company as a luxury charter cruiseboat. The 64-metre vessel will start its new life as a pleasure cruiser on the Douro river in Porto next month. Stripped of its banners, thrones and British ensign, its prosaic exterior is barely recognisable from the sumptuous vessel that led a 1,000 boat flotilla down the Thames last June. Luxury cruiseboat: The Spirit of Chartwell, flagship of the Queen's jubilee river pageant last summer, is now operating as a cruise liner out of Porto . Thrones: A pair of red velvet chairs, bought from Harrods, are one of the new additions inside the barge, which sit beneath a reproduction portrait of Her Majesty . Unrecognisable: Stripped of its banners, thrones and British ensign, the exterior looks very different from the vessel that starred in the Diamond Jubilee last year . Modifications: The new owner has replaced the original gilded prow with a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife . In place of the original gilded prow – which featured tasteful dolphins and the Royal cipher - the new owner has mounted a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife, topped with a fake crown. In June’s pageant, the boat was garlanded out with flowers gathered from the Queen’s gardens. Now it has to make do with plastic imitation blooms strung along its upper railings. However, the Spirit of Chartwell remains virtually untouched on the inside since it was given a six-month, £1million royal makeover in preparation for the Jubilee celebrations. Holidaymakers who stump up the £2,121 cost of a seven night cruise can recline on solid mahogany furniture, listen to a baby grand piano and sample drinks at the cocktail bar. The boat will take them up the Douro river, stopping at vineyards and villages, until it reaches Salamanca in neighbouring Spain. Some of the interior fittings are surprisingly modern for a vessel designed to recreate the splendour of 17th century royal barges. Sumptuous: The barge as it was decorated for the pageant last year, including flowers gathered from the Queen's gardens . Grand: For £2,121, holidaymakers can enjoy a seven night cruise where they can listen to a baby grand piano and sample drinks at the cocktail bar . Replica: A fake crown fixed to the bow of the barge . Features: The barge features a crest on the outside (left) along with a crown and coat of arms fixed to the bow (right) Alterations: The 64-foot vessel will start its new life as a pleasure cruiser on the Douro river in Porto next month . The capacious main salon is fitted with neon light fittings designed to change colour from icy blue to warm pink at the flick of a switch. Dinner guests are seated on banks of red leather sofas and upright Pullman chairs while the walls feature glowing glass panels – designed by French designer Rene Lalique – depicting sensuous nudes. One of the few new additions – a pair of red velvet ‘thrones’ bought from Harrods – sit beneath a reproduction portrait of Her Majesty. The Spirit of Chartwell’s 15 en-suite cabins fit 30 guests. They include all the comforts expected of a four star hotel – including 32inch flat screen televisions and ensuite bathrooms – but hardly rival the opulence of Buckingham Palace. Starring role: The boat played a major part in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee last year . Attraction: The boat's new owner expected the Spirit of Chartwell's royal credentials to be a magnet for British tourists . The main salon is fitted with neon light fittings (left) while a Portuguese flag now adorns the deck, along with imitation flowers (right) Leisure: Holidaymakers on the barge will also be able to enjoy drinks from the cocktail bar . The boat was bought in September from its British owner, Phillip Morrell, by Portuguese millionaire Mario Ferreira, the CEO of charter company DouroAzul. The tycoon, who boasts he is a friend of Richard Branson, said he acquired the boat for a ‘bargain’, but said a clause in the sale contract prevented him from disclosing the price. Mr Morrell had spent £8million renovating the boat, but was reluctantly forced to sell it after the Port of London prevented him from using it from cruise trips on the Thames over concerns it was too large to fit under a bridge in Richmond, Surrey. Mr Ferreira naturally expected the Spirit of Chartwell’s impeccable royal credentials to be a magnet for British tourists, and hired 14 English-speaking crew members to cater for their every whim. Comfortable: The barge's 15 en-suite cabins fit 30 guests and all include the comforts expected of a four star hotel . Bookings: Owner Mr Ferreira has been surprised to find most of the bookings so far have come from Germany. Pictured left is a cabin in the boat and right is the dining room . Refit: A view of a plaque noting the name Gebr. Kooiman, refitter of the Spirit of Chartwell . But he revealed most of the bookings to date have come from Germany, saying: ‘It is kind of weird. I was totally convinced the British would be the first ones to buy trips on it. ‘But the Germans have booked out the majority of the year. They must be very curious. I hope it will be as popular with British people in the future.’ He added: ‘It is a fantastic vessel. It is completely sound as it was fully checked out by the Royal Navy before the Jubilee. ‘Plus, it has some special security features. For example, there is a high-tech fire extinction system that uses high-pressure vapourised water to put out fires without causing damage. ‘It has amazing medical kits, with everything you could possibly need. I’m not sure if the windows are bullet proof. I never asked, and I don’t really want to test them.’ New gilded prow . The original structure featured a sculpture of Old Father Thames, a pair of classical dolphins - symbols of the Thames - and the royal cipher. In its place, Mr Ferreira has placed a pair of topless mermaids - which he says are based on his wife Paula - topped by an imitation crown. Plastic flowers . For June’s Thames pageant, the Spirit of Chartwell was garlanded with flowers from the Queen’s gardens. Its new owner has made do with strings of imitation flowers. Although they may be less impressive, they will stand up to the heat of a Portuguese summer. Portuguese ensign . When it served as the royal barge, the Spirit of Chartwell was given a special permit to wear the British White Ensign, usually reserved for Royal Navy ships, as well as the Royal Standard. Its new owner said he wanted to keep a British ensign as it ‘looks more authentic’. But he was prevented by red tape imposed UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency. He said: ‘They drove me totally insane. I wanted to keep the British ensign, but they said they had to come and certify not only my ship, but also the captain. Velvet ‘thrones’ Mr Ferreira imported the red velvet chairs from Harrods store in Knightsbridge. They were created as part of limited edition range of Jubilee furniture by designer Clive Christian, also known as the creator of the world’s most expensive perfume. At first glance, the chairs seem authentically regal. But closer investigation reveals the heraldic crest and motto embroidered on the seat backs - ‘fax animi honestae gloria’, meaning ‘through honour, glory is found’ - belong to Mr Christian’s family and not to the royals.","Boat was bought in September by Portuguese millionaire Mario Ferreira .

A teenage soap star sobbed in the dock today after he was cleared of molesting and raping a fellow stage school pupil. The 17-year-old bisexual, who cannot be named, was accused of a campaign of abuse against another boy in 2010. Prosecutors alleged the actor forced the boy into a twisted sex game in the stairwell of a theatre. He was accused of headbutting the boy and pinning him against a wall before forcing him to perform oral sex while his girlfriend watched to prove he liked men and women sexually. Cleared: A teenage soap actor was on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court accused of rape and sexual assault but the jury found him not guilty today . But a jury of seven men and five women today cleared the star of rape and three counts of sexual assault dating from between July 2010 and September 2010. The panel had deliberated for four hours and 45 minutes before reaching its unanimous not guilty verdicts on all counts at Blackfriars Crown Court. The teenager had wept as the verdicts were returned and was hugged by his sobbing dad as he left the dock. The teenage actor, who will turn 18 in May, was accused of sending the boy lewd text messages before sexually assaulting him in the darkened stairwell as they prepared for an end-of-year school show. Prosecutors alleged he then raped the boy the following day, again in the stairwell, to prove he was bisexual to his girlfriend. - Actor cleared of four sex attacks told the court during his trial . It was said he continued the sexual abuse in September 2010 during the new school term with 'weekly' sex attacks. But the actor, supported by his family in court every day during the six-day trial, told jurors the sexual contact between the pair was always consensual. 'It was both of us, both consensual, wanting to do things and both enjoying it', he told Blackfriars Crown Court. 'It wasn't a straight man being lured in, it was both of us.' The teenager said he was 'bi-curious' and approached the boy after hearing rumours he had been with other boys and posted erotic pictures of himself online. Accused of being a 'bully' who had forced himself on the other boy, the star replied: 'I was willing to experiment with my sexuality and he had apparently done it before with other boys. 'He was another lad who was up for doing things. 'I didn't know any other boys like that, I wanted to try to experiment and he seemed - well, he was up for it.' The actor told the court he had initially said no sexual contact had taken place at all because he was 'embarrassed' to admit his sexuality in front of teachers and his parents. He admitted in the witness box breaking down and crying after the boy performed oral sex on him in front of his girlfriend. 'I was very embarrassed, that's my girlfriend there and she is watching a boy suck my penis,' the actor said. 'I was confused and I didn't think it was right. 'I put my head in my hands and started having a cry.' He denied being attracted to the boy, who he said may have become 'infatuated' with him after they exchanged saucy text messages. 'He was very much the one who took the reins, although I approached him first', he said. 'When I sent pictures of my penis, he sent pictures back. 'He said I had a nice bum, he complemented my bottom and tried to kiss me. 'Whether he said have an infatuation with me, I'm not saying I'm great looking, but whether he had an infatuation I can't answer that.' The soap star, from Surrey, put his career on hold to fight the legal battle against the sex claims. He denied rape and three counts of sexual assault.

Bank account holders in Cyprus could be subjected to a weekly limit on cash withdrawals, it emerged today. Cypriot finance ministers have drafted a series of capital controls that also include export limits on euros, a ban on cashing cheques. Fixed-term deposits may also have to be held until maturity. Cash crisis: Cypriot finance ministers are considering weekly limits on withdrawals to curb a run on deposits . Earlier, the Central Bank governor said measures to avert a run on deposits after a painful EU rescue plan will be 'loose' but would apply to all banks on the island. Panicos Demetriades said they would be 'temporary' but would not say how long they would last. He said authorities were doing 'all they could' to ensure banks reopen on Thursday as announced late yesterday. The two banks at the centre of the financial crisis - Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank - are currently limiting ATM withdrawals to 100 euros a day. News of the limits on cash withdrawals, revealed by the BBC, came after the . Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced British pensions would not be paid into Cypriot bank accounts for the . foreseeable future and advised expats to open UK accounts. 'Watching brief': Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) is advising British expats to either switch their payments to a UK account or open a new one after the Cyprus bailout targeted savings . Chancellor George Osborne also revealed the Treasury is working on a solution for the 13,000 UK customers of Cyprus Popular Bank, part of Laiki Bank, who could lose up to 40 per cent of their savings above the 100,000 euros (£85,000) cut-off limit. A spokeswoman for the DWP said a 'watching brief' is in place on the situation but . payments into Cypriot bank accounts will not resume when banks on the . island reopen - currently planned for Thursday. In a statement to MPs, Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the Government . is advising people to either switch their payments to a British account . they already have or to open a new one. About 6,000 of the 18,133 British expats on Cyprus use a British bank account already and so are not affected by the freeze. Mr Webb said: 'We are advising customers to change the bank account into . which payments are made, for example by nominating an alternative bank . account or the account of a 'trusted friend' which is permissible under . our current rules on benefit payment. 'This is a practical measure to ensure that payments reach our customers . promptly, and we are not advising these customers to close their . Cypriot bank accounts. 'Customers who do not currently have another bank account may wish to . open one. 'HM Treasury have also worked with Barclays to put in place a . process so that individuals can open a bank account quickly if they wish . to do so.' The freeze on benefit payments into Cypriot bank accounts was announced . by Treasury Minister Greg Clark last week amid reports that the . government in Cyprus was planning a levy on all accounts to fund a . bailout. The plan was rejected by the Cypriot parliament, but banks have been . closed since in a bid to avoid a run on the island's banks after a new . deal which will use savings over £85,000 to pay off struggling lenders. Run dry: A cleaner mops the forecourt of the empty laiki bank which is being wound down as part of bailout deal to use savings to pay off its debts . The . rescue package will wind down the largely state-owned Popular Bank of . Cyprus, also known as Laiki, and shift deposits below 100,000 euros to . the Bank of Cyprus to create a 'good bank'. Deposits above 100,000 euros in both . banks, which are not guaranteed under EU law, will be frozen and used to . resolve Laiki's debts and recapitalise Bank of Cyprus through a . deposit/equity conversion. Banks . have been closed since March 16 to avert a run on deposits as the . country's politicians struggled to come up with a plan that would raise . enough funds to qualify for an international bailout. All except the country's two largest . lenders had been due to open today after the country clinched an . 11th-hour deal with the 17-nation eurozone and the International . Monetary Fund. Hard times ahead: Cypriot students shout slogans during a protest against the bailout package outside the presidential palace in capital Nicosia . But last night the Central Bank said . that 'for the smooth functioning of the entire banking system, the . finance minister has decided, after a recommendation by the governor of . the Central Bank, that all banks remain shut up to and including . Wednesday'. ATMs have been functioning, but many . run quickly out of cash, and a daily withdrawal limit of 100 euros (£85) was imposed on the two largest lenders, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki. Mr Clark said the goal was to ensure that payments reached their intended recipients. Mr Webb said the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and aims to minimise disruption for those affected.","Ministers also considering euro export limit and ban on cashing cheques .

A disgraced dentist who was struck off for conning the NHS out of £200,000 has been banned again for boasting about toilet sex sessions to a newly qualified dental nurse. Shabbir Merchant, 44, told the 'shocked' nurse he was 'good with his hands' and bragged about groping women in toilet cubicles as the pair were working together at his surgery. Merchant had claimed to be a reformed character when he returned to dentistry in 2009, less than three years after being jailed for 18-months for fraud. 'Shameful': Shabbir Merchant, seen above in file pictures, bragged about sexual encounters in toilet cubicles to the 'shocked' dental nurse as they worked together at a Chesterfield practice . The Ferrari-driving dentist was kicked out of the profession in 2006 after making a string of bogus claims for treatment of non-existent patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He submitted £200,000 worth of fake invoices to the NHS to fund a four-year spending spree which saw him splash out on property in London and Manchester and a fleet of luxury cars. Now Merchant has been banned again for nine months after admitting a raft of fresh charges, including poor treatment of seven patients between September 2009 and June 2010. He also admitted making suggestive comments to the dental nurse in February 2011, shortly after his marriage crumbled. 'Your use of inappropriate comments to a female colleague was completely unacceptable, and was compounded by the fact that you were in a professional setting, alone together and in close proximity', said General Dental Council panel chairman Lynne Stuart. 'She felt shocked by the language you used and threatened by your close proximity to her during this conversation.' Then employed at a Denture Care . practice in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, Merchant claimed he had 'a lot of . strange stories' to tell her before making a string of lewd boasts. He . claimed he was 'disgustingly used by women' and recounted tales of . being dragged into toilets by women before 'putting his hands down their . knickers'. Ms Stuart added: 'You accepted that your conduct on this occasion was inappropriate, shameful and disgusting.' When . the horrified nurse complained, Merchant tried to force her to withdraw . her statement by threatening to shame her in the Asian community. He . sent her a letter on October 25 last year, saying: 'It's with great . reluctance I may have to disclose further information about you, but I . can't see any other option because I have to defend myself against the . GDC. 'It is you and your family who have to live with the consequences of your actions.' The . panel accepted Merchant was going through difficult personal . circumstances at the time, including a divorce and the death of his . father. Struck off: A panel told Merchant his behaviour towards his female colleague while they were alone at the surgery in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was 'completely unacceptable' Merchant's original downfall came after he submitted false invoices for non-existent patients at his Bray Dental Practice in Adelaide Road, Swiss Cottage, in London, between May 1999 and August 2003. He invented expensive treatments for nearly 200 patients, but suspicions were raised when the GDC spotted discrepancies in his paperwork. In a bid to bolster his story, the dentist claimed his surgery was burgled and dental records stolen - even reporting the supposed break-in to the police. He had in fact spent the money on building up a property portfolio of six homes and a fleet of sports cars including a Ferrari coupe and Porsche 911. The dentist, then of London Road, Stanmore, Middlesex, was jailed for 18 months in 2006 after he admitted fraud charges totalling £197,997.78 at Southwark Crown Court. But he served just four-and-a-half months in prison before being released. Merchant was struck off by the GDC in July 2006, but convinced the regulator to let him work again in January 2009, subject to strict conditions of practice. Restrictions on his work were finally lifted in February this year, just a month before he admitted the fresh allegations of misconduct. 'You have fully repaid your outstanding debt to the NHS since your release from prison', said Ms Stuart. 'It is not the committee's task to revisit your previous conviction and in the circumstances has attached little weight to it in all the circumstances.' Merchant has admitted several incidents of shoddy work at Droitwich Spa Dental Practice, in Worcestershire. He confessed to a string of bad clinical decisions, failing to record assessments and treatments, and not properly assessing the patients' needs, at the start of the two-week hearing. Merchant admitted more of the charges during the hearing after expert evidence was given, and he was cleared of a handful of accusations about his work. He also admitted trying to blackmail another former colleague into withdrawing allegations reported to the GDC. Merchant, of Reydon Avenue, Leytonstone, east London, was issued with an immediate nine-month suspension, and will be subject to a review hearing before he can work as a dentist again.","Shabbir Merchant made 'disgusting' comments when alone with nurse .

"By . Sam Dunn . PUBLISHED: . 19:09 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:36 EST, 21 March 2013 . Nick Clegg yesterday won his battle to let hard-working families earn up to £10,000 a year tax-free. His cherished policy to benefit low earners will now be introduced in April 2014, a year earlier than expected. But the speeded-up timetable means a record five million workers are set to pay higher rate tax by the end of next year, experts warned last night. Cherished policy: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in Downing Street ahead of the Budget during which he won his battle to let hard-working families earn up to £10,000 a year tax-free . The numbers dragged into paying 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million in 2014. The hike in personal allowance thresholds from £6,475 to £10,000 means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax at all since 2010. For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying £705 less income tax compared to when the Coalition took power. Changes announced in the Budget yesterday mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher rate tax will be £41,865. It means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the Treasury – a huge blow to the household finances of nearly another million families who won't consider themselves remotely well-off. Mike Warburton, of accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said: 'You no longer have to be wealthy to be a higher-rate tax payer. George Osborne, with his ministerial team, poses for pictures outside 11 Downing Street in London before announcing the Budget in Parliament . 'There will be many families who don't see themselves as wealthy who will find themselves as unwilling higher-rate taxpayers.' Increasing numbers of workers face paying higher tax rates because of what is known as 'fiscal drag'. Currently, everyone can earn £8,105 tax-free – then pays income tax of 20 per cent on the next £34,370. Once they have a £42,475 salary, they then pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound earned. From April, the personal allowance will rise to £9,440 – and then to £10,000 next year. Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. But from April 2014, the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in this 40 per cent net. In 1978, only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate. In 1989, the figure had barely moved to just five per cent. Under Gordon Brown, the figure rose to 3.8 million before falling back to three million when the Coalition was elected in 2010. However, under the current Government, the figure has rocketed. 'By the end of this parliament, more than two million extra workers will have been dragged into the higher band,' Mr Warburton added. * George Osborne suffered an embarrassing setback last night as his controversial scheme to allow workers to trade in their employment rights in return for shares was thrown out by the House of Lords. Peers voted by 232 votes to 178 against the proposal, which would allow staff to give up key employment rights in return for shares in the company worth anything from £2,000 to £50,000. Ten Tory rebels voted against the plans, including the former Cabinet ministers Lord Lawson, Lord King, Lord Forsyth and Lord Deben. Former head of the Civil Service Lord O'Donnell said the plans would be 'very harmful to growth'. 'In the old days the price of slavery was 20 or 30 pieces of silver – is it now £2,000?' he asked. The Chancellor unveiled the 'shares for rights' plan at the Tory conference last October. He said it would boost entrepreneurial companies and allow staff to share in their growth. But critics argued that basic rights such as redundancy pay and unfair dismissal provisions should be preserved for all.","One in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn .

A stay-at-home mother-of-two has told how she is able to raise her family on an income of $14,000. Danielle Wagasky, 28, from Las Vegas, Nevada, was forced to cut back when her husband took a break from the Army to go back to school. With just his living allowance to survive on, she set about mastering the art of frugal living, teaching herself how to cook, learning how to sew and avoiding impulse shopping sprees. Frugal lifestyle: Jason and Danielle Wagasky, pictured with their two children, live on just $14,000 a year . Thanks to her efforts and some very savvy saving, the couple now own a home with no mortgage after paying $28,000 cash for a house without a kitchen.

'It’s so good and it saves a lot of money,' she told Business Insider. And every cent counts because the . Wagaskys get by on a $400 a month grocery budget. They are members of a food co-op, and they pay cash in grocery stores to ensure that they don't go over their allowance. 'Once that $400 is gone, it is gone.

'I am able to freeze about 8 gallons of . milk each month.They sit at the bottom of my freezer and we thaw them . out when we need them,' she explains. Her kitchen is stuffed full of cookbooks which allow her to rustle up meals from scratch. Their most impressive saving, though, was the bargain price they paid for their home.

In 2008 when he served his second . deployment in Iraq. she was left in charge of the family finances and . she became determined to save $30,000 to put down a downpayment on their . home by the time he returned. 'I never paid anything growing up - I . was kind of spoiled. And then, all of a sudden, I had to do all the . bills. It was tough,' she said.

'We don't go just for an hour, we stay and visit and even run errands that may be close to where we have family,' Mrs Wagasky said.

The Savse Smoovie, which reputedly slows down ageing, is selling so fast at . retailers including Harrods and Harvey Nichols that suppliers have had . to increase stock twenty-fold to keep up with demand. And its unique selling point is that it tastes nothing like broccoli and is in fact sweet, a trick Georgian mother Nina Koutibashvili came up with when she invented the drink in the 1980s in order to encourage her children to eat their green vegetables. The life-giving broccoli drink that hails from ex-Soviet Union country Georgia . Savse Smoovies, left, have become a surprise hit in middle-class British supermarkets because parents are delighted at finding a new way to encourage their fussy children to eat broccoli and other vegetables, right . The project began when Nina was diagnosed with an iron deficiency during pregnancy 27 years ago in Georgia. Her doctor advised her to drink a blend of spinach and apple juice, so Nina set about juicing a mixture of vegetables and fruits. She loved the taste so much she has been developing and juicing her recipes ever since, convincing her children to love vegetables via her delicious drinks. In 2011, Nina and her son Guka Tavberidze - who was curious as to why he could never find smoothies as good as his mother's - decided to bring the secret recipe into the mainstream . Guka took the old family recipe . and developed a cold-pressure machine to crush the vegetables using . 90,000lbs per square inch, the equivalent of being crushed by a herd of . elephants. Georgian mother Nina Koutibashvili invented the sweet smoothie in the 1980s after being diagnosed with an iron deficiency during pregnancy . Broccoli flavour: Broccoli, pear, spinach, kale, kiwi, lemon, banana . Beetroot flavour: Beetroot, apple, lemon, avocado, lime, mango, red pepper . Strawberry flavour: Strawberry, broccoli, celery, kale, orange, spinach . The resulting Savse Smoovies - available in broccoli, beetroot and strawberry flavours - are now sold in 250ml bottles for £2.49 in health food sections of high-end British stores including Planet Organic, Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason. In blind taste-test carried out before the product's launch, 98 per cent of those asked to guess what they were tasting could not detect broccoli. That has helped make it popular with parents trying to find new ways to encourage their children to eat more leafy green vegetables when they often cannot stand the taste. Unlike many other smoothies, the Savse ingredients do not need to be heated and pasteurised in production - a common process which prevents decay but sees fruit and veg lose much of their nutritional value. Savse Smoovies are also available in beetroot and strawberry flavour . The properties of broccoli are said to help boost the nervous and immune systems and help to prevent the formation of cancers. Guka said: 'We're absolutely thrilled by and proud of the reaction to our invention. Most people who blind taste test Savse simply don't even believe that it contains vegetables. 'It tastes like an ultra-fresh version of a standard smoothie with a slightly zingier flavour.'

Parents who give their toddlers skimmed milk to prevent them gaining weight may be wasting their time, researchers say. A study found that two-year-olds who drank full-fat milk put on fewer pounds by the age of four than those on low-fat. Academics believe this is because higher fat milk makes children feel fuller for longer, and they eat less as a result. Unhelpful: Skimmed milk might not make children feel as full as whole milk, resulting in them eating more overall (posed by model) The US study concluded that the type of milk given to children ‘may not matter that much’ despite fears the obesity epidemic is being fuelled by diets high in fat. Researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine found two-year-olds who drank mainly low-fat and skimmed milk were 57 per cent more likely to become overweight by the age of four. But the average weight of children drinking full-fat milk was lower over the same period. Professor Mark DeBoer, who led the research, said: ‘We assumed the study would show that children drinking low-fat and skimmed milk would be helped to keep their weight down, but this was not the case. ‘If you are going to drink milk, and we strongly back the importance of drinking milk at a young age, it doesn’t seem to matter that much which type it is.’ Obesity epidemic: Researchers found that two-year-olds who drank mainly low-fat and skimmed milk were actually more likely to be overweight by four-years-old . In the US, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association recommend all children drink low-fat or skimmed milk after the age of two to ward off obesity. In contrast, British children under five are not advised to drink skimmed milk – which has virtually all the fat removed – because they need the extra energy for growth. The US study asked 11,000 parents what type of milk their children drank at aged two and four: skimmed; one per cent semi-skimmed; two per cent milk fat; full-fat, or soy. The children were also weighed and measured at both ages – with around one in three being overweight or obese at both time points, says a report published online in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. Healthier: British children under five are not advised to drink skimmed milk because whole milk helps them grow at that critical stage . Heavier children were more likely to drink skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, with 14 per cent of heavy two-year-olds and 16 per cent of heavy four-year-olds drinking it, compared with nine per cent of normal weight two-year-olds and 13 per cent of normal weight four-year-olds. Professor DeBoer said parents may be acting from the best motives by choosing low-fat milks, but milk fat may increase a feeling of fullness so reduce the appetite for other high calorie foods. He said: ‘Physicians don’t have much time to advise parents worried about their children putting on weight, so they may be better off sticking to advice we know works. ‘This includes cutting down on TV watching and sugary drinks, and increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake.’","Two-year-olds who drink skimmed milk more likely to become overweight .

A man born without a penis has revealed he can finally feel positive about the future after being offered groundbreaking surgery where the genital part will be created from his own arm. Andrew Wardle, 39, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, explained on today's This Morning he has 'learnt to live' with his condition but it has caused endless problems with his love life. While he said he has never had any trouble getting girlfriends, he said some have been more understanding about his situation than others. Scroll down for video . Born without a penis: Andrew Wardle, 39, shared his story on This Morning and revealed not all girlfriends have been understanding . He recalled some dates reacted with anger - and one even with violence - when he told them the truth about his body. 'It is difficult to explain to a new girlfriend but when I have some have been really nice about it,' he said. 'But I was punched in the face once when I told a girl. I guess she was angry as she felt like I had lied but it's not something you can say right away.' Mr Wardle has hit headlines before because of his rare affliction. He explained how he was born  with an ectopic bladder, meaning . it formed on the outside of his body. Doctors were able to fix his bladder so he was able to pass urine but he never developed a penis. Angered one girlfriend: He explained to presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes how he was once punched in the face when a date discovered the truth about his body . Presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford asked him how he had coped as a school boy. He said: 'As child it was easy, guys don't look . at each others private bits. I did get bullied a little as I was always in and out of hospital, people didn't know why I needed treatment but had an idea of area it was in.' He explained how as he grew up it became 'second nature' to hide his problem and when he first began to develop sexual feeling towards women it wasn't a problem thanks to having a sympathetic first love. He said: 'My first girlfriend was really nice and understanding. We went out for four years . and it was not a problem. It may had been if we were together in the future but we were only 15 so it wasn't.' Hope: Mr Wardle is happy with new girlfriend, Freida, right, and positive about surgery where a penis will be created from the skin on his arm . Despite his problem, Mr Wardle said he continued to have numerous girlfriends and his reluctance to jump into bed on the first date sometimes worked in his favour - as women were often delighted to be with a 'nice guy' who wanted to take the relationship slowly. However, he also said he went through 'dark times' when he took drugs to forget about 'who he was'. But this only led to him becoming more depressed and he was once so low he made a suicide attempt. But with the help of family, friends, and a new supportive girlfriend, Freida, he in now back on track. He admitted he is finally feeling . 'positive' about the future as he is set to have a groundbreaking . operation where a penis will be created from the skin in his arm. This will then be 'wired up' to be fully functional. There is a possibility he will one day be able to have children but he said he is yet to fully discuss this with surgeons at University College London who have agreed to carry out the complicated three-part operation. 'I've learnt to live with one but I owe it to myself to give it a go,' he said.","Andrew Wardle, 39, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, was born without a penis because his bladder formed outside his body .

The number of confirmed cases of norovirus is up by 83 per cent on this time last year, and the toll is expected to rise . The total of 4,030 is more than twice the 1,934 cases at this time last year. But this is only a fraction of the true total as most sufferers do not visit their GP.

The number of cases has  risen earlier than expected this year, following a trend seen  across Europe and other parts of the world which has  unknown causes. In Australia, outbreaks began earlier than usual during the  winter and have persisted into their summer. John Harris, an HPA norovirus expert, said: ‘The number of laboratory-confirmed cases has risen once again as it appears that we have seen the rise that usually begins in January start a little earlier than we expect. ‘Norovirus is very contagious and very unpleasant. To help prevent spread, it’s important that people who believe they are unwell maintain good hand hygiene and stay away from hospitals, schools and care homes, as these closed environments are prone to outbreaks which can cause severe disruption.’ Symptoms include a sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhoea, often with headache, raised temperature and stomach cramps. The illness usually resolves itself in one or two days in otherwise healthy people.

Amazon has come under fire from parents after the search term 'teen books for girls' was found to yield pornographic content. Grandmother Martha Welter, from Chicago, Illinois, told NBC she first raised the issue in November, after discovering the . disturbing results while browsing the website for a book to give to her . 12-year-old granddaughter. 'I was speechless,' Ms Welter said of her discovery. 'I just could not believe that this was happening.' Disturbing: Last November, Chicago grandmother Martha Welter (pictured) was shocked to discover that a search on Amazon for 'teen books for girls' resulted in pornographic content . Ms Welter's initial search took place nearly four months ago, but searches today have not yielded the same results. Indeed, a spokesman for the company has informed MailOnline: 'We have improved our search functionality since receiving this customer feedback, and will continue to do so.' The grandmother stumbled upon the graphic books when she . typed 'teen' into the Amazon search box, hoping to find a book for her granddaughter. 'I always give books to my grandkids for Christmas,' she told NBC at the time. The search term 'teen books for girls' appeared in a drop-down list, and Ms Welter clicked on it. While the first page of results yielded . innocent titles like Pretty Little Liars, the second page was filled . with 'adult, pornographic picture books,' she recounted. 'I can't even . say the name of them.' 'I discovered adult, pornographic picture books. I can't even say the names of them' Some of the titles were Sexy College . Girl Enjoying Herself, Hot Asian Girl and Wild Beach Night, according to . NBC, and the covers featured almost-naked and topless girls. What's more, the unexpected search . results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time, 91 of the 140 . suggested titles were graphic adult picture books. Shocked, Ms Welter contacted a customer service representative who told her Amazon would follow up on her complaint. Shocking: After clicking on search term 'teen books for girls' from a drop-down list, Ms welter found pornographic novels with revealing cover images of girls . Unexpected results: Ms Welter stumbled upon the graphic books when she typed 'teen' into the website's search box, hoping to find an age-appropriate book for her granddaughter . But just yesterday, the raunchy titles still remained on the website. On Tuesday, NBC reported that not only did the innocent search term still result in over 100 explicit images, but that even more graphic titles had been added since Ms Welter's original search. But when MailOnline performed the same search today, the books did not include any inappropriate content. 'Kids can't go in an adult book store. They should not be able to find this stuff so easily online' Ms Welter said her biggest concern is . that children have access to these explicit images. 'They can't go in an . adult book store,' she said. 'They should not be able to find this . stuff so easily online.' Other angered parents have taken to NBC Chicago's Facebook page to share their similar concerns. One commenter wrote: 'Amazon needs to . get rid of that ASAP! Shame on them!' while another posted: 'Thank you . to caring parents, grandparents and others who take appropriate action . and alert others as well.' Indecent: Shockingly, the unexpected search results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time, 91 of the 140 suggested titles were graphic adult picture books . The issue was especially surprising since in Amazon's content guidelines, the company states that they do not accept 'pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts'. But the problem may be a result of the . website's self-publishing service, which allows any user to upload their . stories and choose which keywords will be linked to them. 'The internet is totally the Wild West - anything goes, anything can be published' Howard Tullman, president of Tribeca/Flashpoint Media Arts Academy and web-based media expert, explained that the internet is 'totally the Wild West. Anything goes, anything can be published.' He said: 'The truth is, the volume of everything that is going on the web is beyond human capabilities to edit or review.' Still, NBC noted that the URL address for each of the books included the term 'teen-books-for-girls', perhaps indicating that the titles were purposely geared towards teenagers.","The problem was brought to light when a grandmother was searching for books for her 12-year-old granddaughter .

A New York Giants player has been robbed of $500,000 of jewellery - and the chief suspect is a woman he invited to his hotel room but did not catch her name. Shaun Rogers had been partying with the woman at the exclusive Liv club at the Fountainebleau Hotel in Miami on Sunday evening before inviting her up to his room. The defensive tackle, who signed a $1million contract with the Giants last month, reportedly fell asleep at around 7am when it is believed the stranger then made off with the stash.

When Rogers awoke at 12.30pm on Monday, the woman was nowhere to be seen and he was unable to open the door to his safe. When hotel staff finally forced it open, the safe was empty. The player reported diamond earrings worth $100,000, two watches valued at $160,000, a $50,000 gold necklace, $60,000 gold bracelets and a Diamond cuban link chain worth $70,000 missing. A Miami police report stated that 34-year-old Rogers, who is not married, left the hotel at around 1am to go to the nightclub with a male and female friend. He then returned to the hotel room with his friends plus the unknown woman where the group continued to party but Rogers went to sleep.

Jared Lee Loughner's parents told investigators they noticed a change in their son after he was fired from a sales job at Eddie Bauer, according to the records, which had previously been sealed. 'He just wasn't the same,' Jared's father, Randy Loughner, said. 'He just, nothing, nothing worked, seem to go right for him.' Convicted: Tuscon shooter Jared Lee Loughner was behaving erratically and using cocaine and marijuana in the months leading up to his rampage . Anniversary: Gabrielle Giffords, left, listens to her husband Mark Kelly, right, during a return to the supermarket where she was wounded in a rampage two years ago in Tucson, Arizona . Jared's mother, Amy, described his run-ins with authorities, his drug use and his deteriorating  psychological state. 'Sometimes you’d hear him in his room, like, having conversations,' Ms . Loughner said about her son. 'And . sometimes he would look like he was having a conversation with someone . right there. Be talking to someone. I don’t know how to explain it. I . don’t.' She and her husband . pleaded with their son to seek psychological help shortly before the shooting, . but he refused, she said. 'I tried to talk to him,' Randy Loughner said. 'But you can't, he wouldn't let you... Lost, lost, and just didn't want to communicate with me no more.' Growing increasingly concerned about their . son's behavior, Randy . Loughner said he had begun disabling his car so he couldn't go out . at night. The couple also confiscated a 12-gauge shotgun from Jared - which he had purchased in 2008 - after he was expelled from community college and administrators recommended that any firearms be taken away. One-time friend Zachary Osler told investigators he had also grown uncomfortable with Loughner's . personality, saying, 'He would say he could dream and then control what he was . doing while he was dreaming.' Osler was an employee at the store where Loughner bought a Glock before the January 2011 shooting. He was questioned . about seeing Loughner shopping inside sometime before Thanksgiving and . he describes an awkward encounter with his former friend. 'His response is . nothing. Just a mute facial expression. And just like he, he didn't . care,' he said. Still, Osler said he was shocked to learn Loughner had carried out such an attack. 'My jaw dropped,' he said. 'And I was like, ""I know this . person. Why would he do it? What would his motive be?""' After killing six people and wounding 13 others outside . a supermarket in Tuscon, Loughner was polite and cooperative with . police, though he complained of feeling sore as authorities . began their hours-long initial interview of the gunman. One of the arresting deputies who . arrived on scene at the shooting reported that Loughner was repeatedly . saying 'I plead the fifth,' as he was being handcuffed, even though no . one was asking him any questions.

Horror: Emergency personnel attend to a shooting victim outside the shopping centre two years ago . The officer said he found a folding . knife with a four-inch blade in Loughner's pockets along with two loaded . Glock ammunition magazines. The morning of his rampage, Loughner called a friend, Bryce Tierney, and left a message that the Tierney believed was suicidal. 'He just said, ""Hey, this is Jared. Um, we had some good times together. Uh, see you later."" And that's it,' Tierney told investigators. Immediately before the shooting, Loughner was at a convenience store and he made another call - this one to a cab. The store's clerk recalled that Loughner was pacing back and forth inside and outside the store and that he visited the restroom at least four times. At one point, Loughner looked up at a clock and said, 'nine twenty-five, I still got time,' the clerk recalled. Loughner, now 24, was sentenced in . November to seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years in prison after . pleading guilty in August to 19 federal charges. His guilty plea allowed . him to avoid a death sentence. He . is serving his sentence at a federal prison medical facility in . Springfield, Mo., where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and forcibly . given psychotropic drug treatments. Arizona's chief federal judge and a nine-year-old girl were among those killed in the rampage. Giffords was . left partially blind, with a paralyzed right arm and brain injury.

U.S. District Judge Larry Burns had prevented the Pima County Sheriff's office from . releasing the records in response to a request from The Washington Post, . ruling in March 2011 that Loughner's right to a fair trial outweighed . whatever disclosures might be authorized under state law. But last month, Burns cleared the way for . the release of the records after Star Publishing Company, which . publishes the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, had sought their release. The judge said Loughner's fair-trial rights are no longer a consideration now that his criminal case has resolved.

Almonzor and Ocle, Spanish Andalusians, are being put through their paces in haute ecole — an equestrian discipline not seen in this country for 300 years. Haute ecole (high school) is equine ballet. A horse undertakes an extraordinary series of choreographed leaps, kicks and canters known as ‘airs above the ground’. After more than 300 years the art of historic classical horse dressage 'Haute Ecole' is performed at Bolsover Castle, Derbyshire previously owned by Lord Cavendish . The levade move was first taught at the beginning of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30-35 degrees from the ground . In a spectacle as breathtaking as it . is beautiful, these magnificent horses perform the complex dance-like . steps in an equine equivalent of ballet. The white ‘pillar’ in the centre of the riding school is used to encourage the animals to move in ever-decreasing circles. The horses in these photographs – Almonzor and Ocle – are Spanish Andalusians, one of the few breeds . with the physical strength and intelligence to master the discipline. Rider Ben Atkinson, 19, with Almonzor' a 14-year-old Spanish Andalusian horse performing in the castle's original riding room . Advanced dressage training techniques were introduced to England in the 17th century by William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, once riding master to King Charles II . They are pictured performing at . Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, once the seat of Cavendish, and now the . only British venue for ‘haute ecole’. Rider Ben Atkinson,19, instructs six-year-old Ocle to perform moves such as a 'Capriole', where all four of the horses . legs are off the ground at once. The discipline was once said to have . originated on the battlefields of the seventeenth century when . cavalrymen needed to carefully manoeuvre their mounts among foot . soldiers but historians now believe it is more likely that it developed . from exercises used to strengthen horses for combat. Three . hundred years ago the British were world leaders at the sport. ‘Haute . ecole’ was introduced to this country by William Cavendish, first Duke . of Newcastle and riding master to Charles II. However, after the art was perfected it died out in Britain, with the Spanish and French now reigning supreme.

No hands!: 19-year-old Ben Atkinson practises the routine with fourteen-year-old Spanish Andalusian horse Almonzor in the Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire . Cavendish is still considered the father of modern dressage though, and echoes of British prowess at ‘haute ecole’ can be seen in the Olympic champions of our modern dressage team. The sport of dressage proved a big hit at the London 2012 Olympics where Team GB won a total of five medals. Charlotte Dujardin mesmerised the nation with her performances of routines on her horse Valegro, winning gold in the team dressage and individual dressage events. Her sequence featuring Land of Hope and Glory, The Great Escape and the chimes of Big Ben proved a big hit with the judges and raised the profile of dressage as a sport among the British people. Last year was the first time Britain had ever won a medal in an Olympics dressage event.

Who killed Osama Bin Laden? An undated picture of the Islamist figurehead in Afghanistan. A third Navy SEAL has come forward to rubbish the account of his death published in U.S. Esquire magazine last month . The latest leak comes after one Navy SEAL published a book last year about his role in the Abbottabad raid and a second spoke to U.S. Esquire for a 15,000 word article published last month. The men's magazine in February published a lengthy profile of 'The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden', whom they identified only as 'the shooter'. The Shooter told Esquire that on the fateful night he had confronted Bin Laden in the terror chief's bedroom and shot him twice in the forehead when he saw him reach for a gun. That account completely contradicted that given by Matt Bissonnette, another Team 6 member, in his best-selling book No Easy Day, which was written under the pseudonym Mark Owen. Now a third member of the secretive military unit has broken cover to tell CNN security analyst Peter Bergen that the story presented in Esquire is rubbish. No Easy Day: The Esquire account wildly contradicted that given by Matt Bissonnette in this pseudonymously written book published last year . It is unclear whether he had official authorisation to speak to the media. Just . after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011, 23 commandos and their . interpreter attacked Bin Laden's compound. They shot and killed his two . bodyguards, one of his sons and the wife of one bodyguard. The . first three soldiers to reach the top floor of the house, where Bin . Laden's bedroom was believed to be, were 'the point man', 'the shooter' whom Esquire profiled, and the now-famous Bissonnette. So far all three accounts are in agreement. The Shooter told Esquire that what happened next was that Bin Laden peered through his bedroom door and the point man shot at and either missed or lightly wounded him, before peeling off to tackle two women nearby. The Shooter claims he then ran alone into the room where he found Bin Laden hiding behind one of his wives, perhaps using her as a human shield. Seeing a gun 'within reach' he shot the Islamist twice in the head. But according to the latest account to emerge, the story is far less heroic. Bergen reports that what actually happened, according to his source, is that the point man shot and gravely wounded Bin Laden. The point man then leapt on the two nearby women - to absorb any explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests - as two more SEALs went into Bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing he was mortally wounded, finished him off. The account is largely in agreement with that given in No Easy Day, where Bissonnette says he was one of the first in the room, saw Bin Laden close to death, then finished him off as he lay on the floor. The source who spoke to Bergen told him there was no way The Shooter could have seen a gun in Bin Laden's possession because the guns found in the room were only discovered on a high shelf after a thorough search. Pakistani police stand guard as workers demolish Bin Laden's compound: With the scene of the raid torn down there is now no way to forensically investigate which of the various accounts is actually true . Pouring more scorn on the Esquire account, the source further told CNN that The Shooter was actually sacked from the SEAL unit in question after bragging about his role in the raid in bars. That contradicted claims in the Esquire article which had cast their source as a humble, retired soldier now struggling to make ends meet after leaving the military while dealing with the physical and psychological scars of the event. Rumours had already been circulating that Esquire had been fooled by their source. Gawker points to a post by military blogger Brandon Webb, a former SEAL himself, who cited anonymous SEAL commandos to claim Esquire had been duped. In his post, Webb repeated the claim that The Shooter had lost his place on the SEAL team for his bar-room bragging. The U.S. Navy SEAL insignia: Members of the secretive unit are supposedly bound by oaths of silence . Esquire, nevertheless, have stood by their story, which is closer to the official account given by U.S. authorities than either of the accounts given by CNN or Bissonnette. Bergen himself admitted in his CNN piece that, with the compound's buildings now demolished, there is no way to conduct a forensic examination to determine which account is the truth. This morning David Granger, the magazine's editor-in-chief, posted a strident denial that his contributor had got his facts wrong. It reads: 'Esquire and Phil Bronstein, the veteran journalist and writer of the story, object to CNN's report in the strongest possible terms. 'By stark contrast with Bronstein's thoroughgoing 15,000 word report, the CNN story constitutes a mere act of assertion. 'As far as can be gleaned from the report, it is based on the opinion of one current SEAL who was not on the bin Laden mission and who therefore could not have first-hand knowledge of it. 'It is little more than gossip. 'Esquire's story remains the most thoroughly reported account of the raid and of the death of Osama bin Laden.' The SEALs cautiously approached the room where they found two women, hysterically crying and standing over a man lying at the foot of a bed. The younger of the two women rushed at the point man who grabbed them both and herded them into a corner. Owen comments that had the women been wearing suicide vests, this action would have cost the soldier his life but saved those of his colleagues. According to No Easy Day, the fallen man, wearing a white sleeveless T-shirt, tan trousers and a tan tunic, had been shot in the right side of his head. ‘Blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull,’ writes Owen. ‘In his death throes, he was still twitching and convulsing.’ Owen and another Seal shot more rounds into his chest until he was motionless. At least three children sat stunned in the corner of the room as the commandos cleared two small rooms just off the bedrooms. Other Seal teams cleared the rest of the third level until it was declared secure. Owen and his comrades then examined the body. He says: ‘The man’s face was mangled from at least one bullet wound and covered in blood. A hole in  his forehead collapsed the right side of his skull. 'His chest was torn up from where the bullets had entered his body. 'He was lying in an ever-growing pool of blood. As I crouched down to take a closer look, Tom joined me. ‘ “I think this is our boy,” Tom said.’ In the account given to Esquire journalist Phil Bronstein the SEAL recalls that once he locked eyes on his target, he remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head. He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. 'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled on to the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**. 'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.'","Latest leak contradicts account given in recent Esquire article .

A rotund opera singer has lost an impressive five stone and is in training to complete a 300 mile charity cycle after adopting a caveman diet . David Webb also  took up Cross Fit, the new fitness phenomenon involving constantly varied, high intensity workouts, and went from an unhealthy 19 stone and 40 per cent body fat to a fit and muscular 13 stone. Part of the successful opera group Amore, David has performed across the globe, on multiple TV shows and even serenaded the Queen on the royal barge at her jubilee, but his confidence on stage has hidden a lifelong struggle with his weight. Write caption here . David, pictured second right with Amore members (l-r) Peter Brathwaite, Monica McGhee and Victoria Gray, knew he had to loose weight to be fit for singing . The 29-year-old, who trained at the Royal College of Music, says although he was always large, he was very active as a child. ‘I was never taught about food as a child. I was never told how exactly people got fat.’ David, who played rugby and football throughout his childhood, says he began to over eat when his parents got divorced. ‘A lot of it was eating to comfort myself,’ admits David, who also suffered bullying at school because of his size. ‘I’d eat so much I would almost be sick, then start all over again. I’d hate myself for doing it’ he says. However, his high level of activity meant that David remained reasonably fit, and aged 18, he was able to run the London Marathon for his little sister Hannah, who was wheelchair bound throughout her childhood with ME. David, seen here aged 7, says he was never really taught about healthy nutrition as a child . David was active in his childhood, but the weight still crept on due to his diet, especially during his gap years . David at the end of a Crossfit workout, consisting of 30 handstand press ups, 40 pull ups, 50 24kg kettlebell swings, 60 sit-ups and 70 burpees with a time cap of 20 minutes . ‘I spoke to Hannah about what it was like, about feeling each movement was a monumental effort and being trapped. It sounded a bit like ‘hitting the wall’ in a marathon. ‘I thought, if I can do the race, it’s just a tiny bit of what she goes through everyday.’ Despite completing this extreme physical feat David says the weight continued to pile on during his gap years, when he was singing in the Truro Cathedral choir. Amore's success has seen them appear on numerous TV shows like ITV's Daybreak. David explains that even in opera 'you have to look as good as you sound nowadays' David adopted the Caveman diet of basic, natural and largely unprocessed foods to get so svelte, though he still allows himself a 'fatterday' each week . Working in a bakery in the day, David would start eating at the very start of the day, enjoying the pastries and breakfast foods the bistro served. ‘I could eat two walnut and maple pastries, then scrambled eggs with four or five slices of buttered toast just for breakfast.’ ‘It was all beige food. Then after I’d sung in the choir we’d head down the pub and I’d have five or six pints. ‘There’s a stereotype of the fat opera singer, but you actually need to be incredibly fit to sing. David aged 22, just before he started at the Royal College of Music . ‘Nowadays you have to look as good as you sound,’ David explains. When he started at the Royal college of Music, weighing a hefty 19 stone, David realised if he was to continue to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer on the global stage he would have to tackle his growing waistline. He adopted the Palaeolithic diet, often called the cave man diet, based on foods that might have been eaten by out hunter gatherer ancestors. David's diet shifted from high fat and sugar foods to natural unprocessed foods, with lots of protein. A typical days food became scrambled eggs , smoked mackerel and spinach for breakfast, chicken and steamed broccoli for lunch and a ‘palaeo lasagne’, made without any pasta, for dinner. In addition David began ‘Crossfit’, a fitness program, founded by Greg Glassman, that is fast growing in popularity, involving high intensity bouts of exercise for short periods, focusing on core strength. ‘Workouts last for about 10-20 minutes each. The idea is to challenge your body so the workouts are constantly changing. ‘A lot of the exercises are functional, so they are designed to actually be helpful in everyday life.’ A session usually involved high impact cardio with weights as well as skill based exercises like working with Olympic rings, handstands, push ups and burpies. ‘Although each session is short, the high intensity means they are exhausting and really challenge your body. I’m often on the floor at the end!’ says David, who began to notice the effects on his body almost immediately. ‘It was incredible. With each month more and more people would comment on my weight loss. ‘But what surprised me was the comments about my attitude, how much more positive I was.’ David and Peter met Harry Styles backstage at this years Brit awards. As Amore's success has continued, so has David's physical transformation . It was during his time at the Royal College that David met fellow Amore members Monica McGhee, Peter Brathwaite and Victoria Gray and formed the group. As they went from success to success, David’s frame continued to shrink. Each week he allows himself a day off his diet, which he calls ‘fatterday', where he can eat exactly what he likes. David, seen here after completing the Men's Health 10km assault course, says the biggest change has been in his attitude and confidence . ‘I’m obsessed with Oreo milkshakes so I usually make sure I get one of them in! ‘The feeling of health has over taken the feeling of vanity now, I love feeling physically fit. ‘The confidence I have gained is what motivates me to keep going.  I find I’m craving the bad foods less and less as time goes on.’ ‘The only downside is none of my suits fit me anymore!’ he says. David is now using his new found fitness to raise money for cleft palette charity Operation Smile by cycling 300 miles in three days. He is hoping to raise £2,400 which is enough for 16 children to have a life-changing operation. ‘In 3 days I will cover over 300 miles, and although it's April, it's most likely that it will be raining for at least two of the three days! ‘I was first introduced to Operation Smile and their work, when 'Amore' were invited to perform at their Christmas Service last year. The commitment, energy and huge hearts of the staff and volunteers made me want to do something else to raise money and awareness of their work than just sing. David has pledged that he will cycle all the way home again if he reaches 3 times his original goal. You can donate towards David’s cycle here .

This image of a football players lining up for a team photo before a game forms part of a unique scrapbook showing German prisoners of war at a camp in England. Unlike the case of tens of thousands of Allied servicemen who were held in Nazi prison camps during World War II, pictures of captured Germans in Britain are quite rare. The photos along with sketches drawn by German soldiers give a snapshot of a friendly and pleasant life inside the camp in the New Forest in Hampshire. Photographs and sketches drawn by German prisoners were found in a scrapbook at the home of the widow of Max Mueller, the most senior German officer held at the camp in New Forest, Hampshire . The scrapbook shows a group photograph of German prisoners of war and is signed is signed by seven people . The black and white photos include one of a prisoner football team dressed in a contemporary kit that looks like something from the cult war film Escape to Victory. With up 500 servicemen at the camp, there were several teams from different huts who regularly played against each other to pass the time. Some of the evocative works of art depict the prisoner huts with colourful and well-tended flower beds outside them. A sketch of the camp by a German prisoner was found in a scrapbook at the home of Max Mueller, the most senior German officer held at 'Lager 65' The collection of sketches drawn by prisoners were found in a bedroom cupboard after being hidden for decades . There are several group shots of the prisoners, who are wearing surplus British army uniforms and appear in good health, mainly because of the plentiful supply of pork and lamb from local farms. The scrapbook has been found after spending decades in a bedroom cupboard at the home of the widow of the most senior German officer held at ‘Lager 65’. Molly Mueller’s late husband Max remained in England after the war and became a butcher in Brockenhurst in the New Forest. The scrapbook full of illustrations is going on display as part of a history exhibition by the New Forest National Park Authority . The water colour paintings were found by Mike Mueller, the son of German first lieutenant Max Mueller . The scrapbook, which is bound in leather and fur, was found in good condition and will be exhibited to the public . His son Mike, 61, has now unearthed the book that was given to his father by the German soldiers who served under him at the camp in Setley, near Brockenhurst. The scrapbook is going on display as part of a history exhibition by the New Forest National Park Authority. Mike, who runs a bed and breakfast, . said: 'I recall sitting on my father’s knee as a child and him going . through the book with me. 'Some of the men in the pictures I knew because quite a few of them remained in England. 'The . art work is made with watercolours and is really quite good. It is just . a record of the people who were at the camp and was meant as a momento . to my father to remember them by. 'But it has been gathering dust in a cupboard for years, and we just thought it would be nice for other people to see it. In 1939 there were just two prisoner of war camps - at Glen Mill Camp in Oldham, Lancashire and at Grizedale Hall Lancashire. By 1946, one year after the war had finished, more than 400,000 German prisoners of war were still being held in 600 camps across Britain. In December of that year conciliatory Britons invited the German prisoners into their homes for Christmas. One fifth of all farm work in Britain was done by German detainees, even though it was against the Geneva convention for prisoners to do forced labour in captivity. German prisoners of war were allocated the same food ration as British servicemen and given access to medical care. There were activities within the camp such as lectures, concerts and English lessons, football and other sports. The last German prisoners were returned home in 1949. 'He didn’t talk much about his time there, so it’s remarkable to have this record.' Max Mueller was a first lieutenant (oberleutnant) in the Wermacht’s heavy artillery. He served on the Russian front before he was sent to the western front in France in 1944. He was captured by the Canadians soon after D-Day and ended up at the PoW camp in the New Forest with 500 captured comrades. Although the war in Europe ended in May 1945 the camp remained open for two more years because it took so long to process the prisoners. But in that time the Germans worked on local farms and were able to come and go with a 10pm curfew. Max married wife Molly in 1950 and they had Mike two years later and daughter Karin in 1954. He died in 1989 aged 76. Along with the scrapbook, four one foot high wooden carvings of German prisoners and a British army sergeant major have also been found. Gareth Owen, a historian at the NFNPA, said: 'The hand-drawn sketches are particularly striking. Many of them are initialled so we are able to match them with the photos of the prisoners in the book. 'This is a fascinating insight into what was upmost in the minds of the German prisoners so far from their homeland.'","Scrapbook found in bedroom cupboard of first lieutenant Max Mueller .

Artist Jay Shells has erected signs bearing song lyrics about the city by New York rappers like Nas, Jay Z and the late Guru in the locations to which they refer. He said: 'It’s an homage to New York hip hop. New York City is the birthplace of hip-hop and if any place deserve this historical map of sorts, it’s New York.' 'Ain't nothin nice': This sign, featuring a lyric from Where I'm From by Jay Z, is part of artist Jay Shells' unofficial hip hop history walking tour of New York City . 106 and Park: Shells calls his project 'an homage to New York hip hop'. The city is where the poetic musical form was first developed in the late Seventies and early Eighties. This line is from Kanye West's All Falls Down . The unofficial project involved Shells and helpers from the website Animal New York putting up signs quoting rap artists like Busta Rhymes, KRS One, Kanye West, Jeru tha Damaja and various members of the Wu Tang Clan in the locations their lyrics describe. He spent last weekend putting up more than 30 of the official looking signs across New York neighbourhoods immortalised in the poetic musical genre. For example, this lyric from Cam'ron's Bout It Bout It: 'I represent where them killers at 145th and Broadway you get your head cracked.' That quote is now featured on a red and white sign at the very spot it talks about - although 'the killers' are, thankfully, nowhere to be seen. 'Blacker than midnight': Shells spent last weekend putting up more than 30 of the official looking signs across New York districts immortalised in rap songs. Mos Def spoke this rhyme the track Mathematics . 4th Street Park: Heavy D uttered this rhyme on the track Get Fresh Hev . It is not the first time that Shells has taken it upon himself to educate New Yorkers with a string of unofficial signs. He erected a string of 'Metropolitan Etiquette Authority' signs in 2011 asking his fellow city-dwellers to 'Pay attention while walking' and 'Pull up your pants', among other imperatives. One squarely aimed at the NYPD's mounted officers commanded them to 'Clean up after your horse'. But the latest project eschews such moral judgements to instead mark out the territories made famous across the world by New York's most influential artistic export. Shells, a lifelong New Yorker, told the New York Daily News he became interested in hip hop's descriptions of his home town after ruminating on a line from Big L's verse on the 1995 track Lifestyles Ov Da Poor and Dangerous. 'On 139 and Lennox Ave. there’s a big park, and if you’re soft don’t go through it when it gets dark,' the lyrics go. 'Drug associated since the 70s, word': Shells is seen carrying a step ladder walking away from a sign featuring a lyric from Lil Fame on M.O.P.'s track Brownsville . 'Where them killers at': This line is from the Cam'ron track Bout It Bout It . 'You try bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless': Prodigy's words from the last verse of Mobb Deep's Give Up The Goods . 'Hear it when I get biz for K-Von': Kool G Rap's words from For Da Brothaz . Shells said: 'There are so many blocks that get called out in songs but a block can be huge. 'A corner or venue is a place where you can put a stake in the ground and say, ""This is mentioned"". But it’s really specific locations, a place where you could put a brass plaque in the ground and say, ""This happened here"". 'That’s the reason I did the project, for that feeling for someone that might be walking by, and that person didn’t know that where they’re standing, that particular point, is mentioned in a song.' 'I claim the whole planet cuz it's mine goddamnit': This line is taken from Showbiz and AG's track Next Level . Poignant: This lyric from Big L's 1995 track Lifestyles Ov Da Poor And Dangerous appears on a sign just yards from where the rapper was gunned down four years later . The project is ongoing, but Shells has set himself a few limits. The location must a very specific corner, park or establishment, and only one quote per rapper will go up. As yet he as another nine signs left to erect across the city, and is taking suggestions from friends and strangers on Twitter for other lyrics to post. As the tough-guy lyrics suggest, not every location is safe. Indeed, Lamont Coleman, better known as Big L, was in 1999 shot dead on 139th street, yards from the park he four years earlier boasted is dangerous after dark.

Price: £39.99 / $63.00 (RRP) Part Metal Gear Solid, part Devil May Cry, Revengeance attempts - and largely succeeds - at reinventing Raiden, a character that, until now, may have divided opinion. Indeed, from the moment you're treated to the awe-inspiring, kinetically-charged combat, you know that you're in for something special. A large part of this is due to an ingenious fighting mechanic called the Zandatsu. Here, you are propelled into a slow-motion mini-game where you have to target and sever specific points of an enemy. It's brilliantly responsive and makes a welcome change from overused quick-time events that plague games of similar ilk. Epic: Some of the set-pieces in Revengeance are among the best in Metal Gear's illustrious history . General gameplay is blisteringly fast. Blocking and parrying (both of which use the same combination of a timed button press and directional input), are the bread and butter with a focus on Raiden being as offensively-minded as possible. This, coupled with cleverly intertwined slow-motion and a repertoire of acrobatic aerial manoeuvres makes battles some of the most visually spectacular around. It's a shame, though, that the camera can sometimes be inconsistent - making it hard to see exactly what's going on. However, the wonderful set-pieces offer no such irritation. Raiden's main weapon is an electric blade, but modifications to it later on in the game help to stop repetition setting in. Enemies, armed with a variety of rocket launchers and heavy weapons, are ruthlessly aggressive and although it's relatively easy mowing them all down, the real challenge is pulling off the most stylish and brutal moves in Raiden's armoury, meaning that no battle is ever the same. However, the 'S' level difficulty will prove tough enough to please even the most hardened Ninja Gaiden fans. But it's not all action, and there's a lot here for Metal Gear fans to enjoy. In keeping with tradition of the games, there are special bosses - this time, four cyborgs called the Wings of Despair. Although fleshing out their characters is primarily left to cutscenes 'Hideo Kojima style', boss battles have a very different feel which may jar with some hardcore fans of the universe. Beating the odds: Throughout the action-packed campaign you will come up against a range of enemies, including robot war machines . Thankfully, the game is packed with trademark Metal Gear humour. The ability to perform a sneak attack after running around in the iconic cardboard box is a particular highlight. Although some have criticised the game's length, it's still a solid nine to ten hour journey that never takes its foot off the gas. Graphically, the game holds up well with a solid framerate, but some textures are bland and muddy on close inspection. But this doesn't take away from Revengeance being a brilliant action game - and one that's worthy of its Metal Gear title. That is perhaps the greatest accolade of them all.

Slain: Kyle Kester, 38, was robbed and brutally murdered on February 10 shortly after moving into his dream home he spent two years building in Mexico . The victim’s mother added that her son would’ve given his assailants his property had they asked for it, or offered them the opportunity to earn money and buy the gadgets themselves, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. A friend discovered Kester's body inside a bedroom about two days after he was beaten and stabbed to death. The suspects in the murder, a pair of teenagers and a 21-year-old whom the Minnesota native had hired to install an irrigation system on his property, were captured on a surveillance video at the house. The teens were arrested, but the older of the three alleged perpetrators is believed to have fled across the border into the U.S.. The getaway driver in the case was arrested but has since been released. Tragic: A friend discovered Kester's body inside a bedroom about two days after he was beaten and stabbed to death . The 38-year-old's remains were flown back to Minnesota, where he was cremated. His final resting place became the mantle at his parents' home, which serves as a pedestal for an urn containing his ashes. Kester's closest friend in Mexico, Hugo Barron Felix, told the Star Tribune in an email that the investigation into the man's murder has been slow-going. The pair of teens charges in the crime could receive a maximum of five to seven years in prison if convicted. Concerned: Kyle's parent, Wini and Harley Kester, had been anxious that their son would be a target for robbers. Kyle had assured him that the locals in the village were like family . Kyle Kester grew up in Apple Valley, Minnesota, where early on he developed a passion for rebuilding and repairing cars. He became a mechanic and moved to northern California, to Galt, and then moved south to San Diego. He relocated to Phoenix in 2004. While in Arizona, Kester got into the business of flipping homes. In the process, he befriended Mexican immigrants whom he hired to refurbish the properties, becoming obsessed with their language and culture. In the profile for his MySpace page, which appears to have been last updated two years ago, Kester sounds upbeat and optimistic. 'Life has been good to me, good partners, good jobs, good finances, and overall a happy life,' he wrote. Tragedy struck February 10 when the 38-year-old was stabbed and beaten to death during a home invasion . 'I think i have weathered the great recession or depression or whatever name this economic disaster will be given in the history books.' 'In the last couple years I have worked harder than ever to stay ahead, and in fact I grew my real estate holdings when everyone I knew was falling apart. I hope that by the time I'm 40, I can sell everything, retire and be sipping martinis on a tropical beach somewhere.' That dream appears to have come true for him and in 2010, Kester moved to Mexico, briefly settling in the resort town of Puerto Vallarta before moving inland to Colonia Bosque de la Capilla, a rocky, remote valley 18 north of Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco. He bought land overlooking the mountains and started a two-year building project on his dream home - a sprawling, 6,000-square-foot stucco estate complete with a stable for horses half an hour ride down a dirt road from the nearest neighbor. In his MySpace profile, he sounded like he was focused on preparing for a new chapter in his life but hinted he may still be open to new opportunities. 'Not looking for Mr Right at this point, I need to focus on bettering myself. However if a hot handsome latino man comes to sweep me off my feet i would not mind,' he wrote. His parents worried that Kester would become the target of robbers in the poverty ridden countryside, but he reassured them that the locals were like family to him. 'He loved the people there. He trusted everyone which ultimately led to his death,' his online obituary stated.

Tragedy struck February 10 when the 38-year-old was stabbed and beaten to death during a home invasion allegedly committed by his own employees who had been frequent guests at his house. Two days later, at around 7pm, Wini Kester got a call from her son's friend in Phoenix. ‘Right away, I said “What happened to him?”’ she said. 'I always had this fear. I used to have dreams of him getting beat up and hurt.’ More than a month after their son's death, the Kesters are still struggling to cut through the red tape to get their son's possessions home. Local police seized the victim’s vehicles along with a $30,000 backhoe, and an attorney his parents hired has claimed that he is entitled to 30 per cent of the estate. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar's office had been in contact with the Kesters working to help clear up the holdup and have the property released to his surviving family. Some of his possessions left inside the blood-splattered house have vanished.","38-year-old Kyle Kester was stabbed to death in his home in Jalisco, Mexico on February 10 .

'I know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and a number of others,' Petraeus said at a University of Southern California event honoring the military in his first public speech since the affair. 'I can, however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings, and as best possible to make amends to those I have hurt and let down, and that is what I will strive to do.'

'And the effort to move forward over the rocky path of one's making is vital, inescapable, and ultimately worth it,' he added. Petraeus made the comments to a group of about 600 people, . including many veterans at the University of Southern California's . annual ROTC dinner. He was invited to speak at the dinner a year ago, before his affair became public. 'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said at the start of his remarks. 'I am also keenly aware that the reason for my recent journey was my own doing. So please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret - and apologize for - the circumstances that led me to resign from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters.' Petraeus has remained largely in seclusion since resigning. His lawyer, Robert B. Barnett, has said that Petraeus has spent much of that time with his family.

Petraeus received applause and a standing ovation before he began the evening's program by cutting a cake, a task reserved for the highest ranking person in the room. His affair with the retired four-star general's biographer, Paula Broadwell, was discovered during an FBI investigation into emails she sent to another woman she viewed as a rival for his attention. At the time, Petraeus told his staff he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment.' 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,' he said. After the affair, he testified behind . closed doors about the Benghazi attack but kept out of the public eye . after the very powerful media storm which blew up in the wake of the . scandal.

Intimate history: David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell shaking hands in front of the American flag . Oath of office: Petraeus was sworn in last September by Joe Biden with his wife Holly at his side . As the military leader credited with . reshaping the nation's counterinsurgency strategy, turning the tide in . the U.S. favor in both Iraq and Afghanistan and making the U.S. safer . from terrorism, Petraeus expected a friendly audience at the ROTC . dinner. At least one expert in crisis . communications said that if his apology comes across as heartfelt and . sincere, the public will indeed be seeing much more of him. Family: Petraeus has been married to wife Holly for 38 years and they have two children together .

He noted that unlike former President . Bill Clinton, former U.S. Senator John Edwards and other public figures . caught in extramarital affairs, Petraeus didn't try to lie his way out . of it, immediately took responsibility and moved on. 'I think the world is open to him now,' said Bragman, vice chairman of the image-building company Reputation.com. 'I think he can do whatever he wants.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 13:03 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:23 EST, 28 December 2012 . A forest-owning German aristocrat is to reintroduce bison into the wild in Western Europe for the first time in over 250 years. Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is set to introduce a herd of eight European bison to his 32,124-acre forest in North Rhine-Westphalia. If the 79-year-old prince's plan works, Germany will be the first country west of Poland where animals, also known as wisent, will live in the wild once again. Massive: European bison, also known as wisent, stand up to 6.5ft tall and can weigh up to a ton. Now a German aristocrat has hatched an audacious plan to reintroduce them to the wild on his country estate . However, there are fears the reintroduction of the wild, giant animals, which grow up to 6.5ft tall and weigh up to a ton, will scare away tourists and pose a hazard to hikers. Nearly a decade in gestation, Prince Richard's plan is set to enter its critical phase after he was given final approval from the state Environment Ministry in Dusseldorf just before Christmas, Der Spiegel reports. His 50sq/mile estate - roughly half the size of Manhattan - surrounds the city of Bad Berleburg and extends across many of the foothills of the Rothaar Mountains. It is already home to about 300 wild sheep, 400 red deer, 600 wild boar and so many roe deer his seven groundsmen have given up trying to count them. A wisent calf eats a carrot: Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg is set to introduce a herd to his forest in North Rhine-Westphalia . Now over the next few days workers will drive into Prince Richard's forest and take down the fence around an enclosure where his eight bison have been acclimatising to the environment since 2010. Once that is done, the enormous bull, five cows and two calves will be free to roam. They will be the first of their species to wander wild in Germany since 1746. But questions have been raised about the possible impact of the mammoth creatures. They will roam wherever the leader takes them, even along major roads and through nearby villages. Officials and residents of Bad Berleburg, a city of some 20,000 people, have been largely in support of the plan, which they hope will bring tourists back following the decline of the German health spa industry. European bison were hunted to extinction in the wild in Western Europe centuries ago, but they lived on in Eastern Europe until a poacher killed the last wild specimen in the Caucasus in 1927. That would have been the end of this close relative of the more famous American bison, which is roughly as big, if it wasn't for the few animals that survived in zoos. All of the roughly 3,000 wisents alive today are the descendants of only about a dozen original animals. However, residents of the High Sauerland region, just on the other side of the Rothaar Mountains, fear that the animals could wreck tourism, damage forests, and even interbreed with dairy herds. Despite the backing of such an august individual as Prince Richard, the plan also met with scepticism from officialdom, with the state Environment Ministry putting together a long list of concerns that took scientists from four universities more than four years to answer. Forestry economists eventually agreed that the bison herd could even be useful to forests, since they would keep ecologically valuable areas free from undergrowth - a task currently performed by forest workers. And a doctoral candidate at the University of Siegen, Philip Schmitz, conducted a study which finally showed the flighty bison, despite their imposing size, posed little threat to humans. After enlisting volunteers to approach the animals, he found they were far more likely to simply run away than make an attempt to charge people walking across their territory. This map shows the location of Schmallenburg and the forest where the bison will be set loose . The wisents of Bad Berleburg will never become a truly wild herd, because their numbers are too small, nevertheless this is the first time since 1746 that wisent will roam unchecked through a German forest. Because their numbers are small, they will only stand a chance of survival if humans intervene carefully in their lives. Rigorous family planning will be needed, because inbreeding will result if fresh genes are not introduced. The leaders of the herd will also be tracked via GPS transmitters to limit their territory to roughly 40sq/km - about a third of Prince Richard's estate. Their winter feeding area, where they are supplied silage by forestry workers, will serve as their home and they are not expected to stray far since, as the prince says, 'they're incredibly lazy animals'.","German aristocrat to reintroduce herd of eight to his private forest .

Their determined vicar rounded up an army of villagers to clear tons of snow so that their big day could go ahead. Bride and groom Alison Jelley and Michael Roberts, both 26, woke up on their wedding day to discover 2ft of snow had fallen overnight. Michael Roberts and Alison Jelley's white wedding went ahead - with the help of an army of volunteers armed with shovels . With a little help from their friends!

The Welsh village didn't let a little snow put a dampener on the couple's big day . The wedding venue in the remote village of Llanferres, North Wales, was completely cut off - and it was still snowing. But Rev Adrian Copping of St Berres Church in the village was adamant that the wedding would go ahead. He recruited an army of 30 locals who turned up with shovels and started clearing roads and pathways - even though they didn't even know the happy couple. A call was made to the local council and a snowplough was sent to clear the road for guests to arrive. Nice day for a white wedding! Determined villagers cleared mounds of snow so the couple could say 'I do' - and head off to their Mexican honeymoon . Kind-hearted villagers spent five hours ploughing through the snow - and their hard work meant the roads were safe enough for the wedding to go ahead . And after five hours hard work the roads and pathways were declared safe enough for the wedding to go ahead. The organist and some of the guests arrived after being given a lift by the local fire service. Rev Copping said: 'It was a wonderful example of community spirit. 'At one point one of the shovellers pointed towards the sky and said someone seemed to have it in for us! The kindness of strangers: The bride and groom were stunned when people they didn't know turned out to make the pathways safe for their wedding party .

The National Football League may soon be faced with its first openly gay player - a man who intends to keep playing after coming out. Football has never had a gay active player in its nearly 100-year history, but some have argued that it's time for a change. That change is likely to come sooner rather than later, as a player is reportedly preparing to make a public announcement about his sexual orientation before the 2013 season. Divisive issue: There has never been an openly gay active player in football's nearly 100-year history . Activists: Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, left, and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, right, have emerged as outspoken LGBT advocates in the NFL . CBS sportswriter Mike Freeman writes: 'I'm told that a current gay NFL player is strongly considering coming out publicly within the next few months - and after doing so, the player would attempt to continue his career.' Freeman did not say who the player is or any specifics about when his announcement would be made. But whoever the player is, he can count on the support of former players like Scott Fujita and active stars like Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, who are all outspoken LGBT advocates. Fujita told Freeman: 'I honestly think the players of the NFL have been ready for an openly gay player for quite some time now. Controversy: Chris Culliver sparked uproar when he suggested that gay men were not welcome in the 49ers locker room . He added: 'Trust me, the coming out of a player would create much bigger waves outside the locker room than inside.' But on the opposite end of the spectrum are opponents and a culture of homophobia. Days before the Super Bowl, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was asked about the prospect of gay players in the locker room during a radio interview. Culliver shot back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.' When asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do.' Culliver later issued a bizarre apology for his remarks, saying that the comments were a 'reflection of thoughts in my head' but not representative of how he feels. A debate about gay players in the NFL was sparked anew in the Manti Te'o 'fake girlfriend' hoax, where the former Notre Dame football star claimed that he was the victim of a prankster who was posing as a woman and later faked her death. It was alleged that Te'o was gay and had invented the online persona in an attempt to cover it up. He denied he was behind the scam - as well as being gay - in an interview with talk show host Katie Couric. Hoax: A debate about gay players in the NFL was sparked anew in the Manti Te'o 'fake girlfriend' scandal, where the star claimed that he was the victim of an online prankster . At the NFL scouting combine earlier this month, Te'o - as well as several other players - were reportedly asked about their sexual orientations. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called such a line of questioning 'unacceptable,' and the New York attorney general has urged the league to investigate. Michigan quarterback-turned-receiver Denard Robinson, Colorado tight end Nick Kasa and Michigan State running back Le'Veon Bell indicated they were asked about their sexual orientation at the combine earlier this month in Indianapolis.

Across the Weaver Hills in Ellastone, Staffordshire, a distinctly autumnal mist rolled across the picturesque landscape, as forecasters warned temperatures are set to drop by six or seven degrees on Monday. End of the summer? Autumn mists roll in across Weaver Hills in Ellastone, Staffordshire, signalling what could be the end of the unseasonally warm weather . With mist sweeping in across the Midlands this morning, forecasters said the warm weather will give way to more unsettled spells next week . The early morning sunlight tries to force its way through the mist on the Pennines . Despite the mist it is expected to be a great weekend weather-wise for most of the UK . The Saturday morning mist over Weaver Hills, near Ellastone, said to be the most southerly point of the Pennines .

But he predicted that cloudy weather . will slowly move from the north of Scotland across the north west of . England, Wales and south west England. 'An area of low pressure will form out the the west and will bring some showery rain in the afternoon,' the forecaster added. 'There will be heavy bursts in western Scotland and also the potential of thunder storms. 'Across the whole of the country it will also be a bit more blustery.'

More autumnal weather is predicted next week with most areas of Britain seeing periods of rain. The wettest periods will be on Thursday or Friday when there may be some fairly stormy weather, according to forecasters. Britons were today making the most of the September sun, flocking to beaches and parks to lap up the last of the summer rays. This weekend will follow a warm and . dry week for most parts, which will continue today with sunny periods . lasting longest across East Anglia, southern parts of the Midlands and . southern counties.

It’s just a shame . it wasn’t like this during the holidays.’ Sunseekers today gathered on the beach . in Bournemouth, Dorset, while many walked along the promenade and . Victorian pier. Ice cream vendors meanwhile enjoyed a super seasonal . finale. Ice cream salesman Phil Baker said: ‘It’s been really busy today considering the schools have gone back. ‘There have been lots of mums with . very young children and quite a lot of pensioners are out and about. Because the sun is shining they’ve all been buying ice creams. ‘But it won’t make up for the poor . trade through the summer. There were days when I didn’t sell a single . ice cream, but hopefully this weekend will be busy.’ Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said the upcoming warm weekend is ‘a bit of a bonus for mid-September’. He told MailOnline: ‘It’s well above . average for this time of year. The best of the weather this weekend is . going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday, but many eastern . areas will also do OK. ‘Any rain will be probably confined to . north-west Scotland, with temperatures quite widely in the twenties . from the Aberdeenshire area all the way down to London.’ On the up: Ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years . The demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales. Analysts say Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent, and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent. Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007, meaning we will eat at least 500million fewer scoops a year. Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen. Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion. Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons. Together with the pressure on consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’","Highs in Britain on Saturday will be 27c (81f) and 28c (82f) on Sunday .

A donation campaign supporting the man whose crude joke led to the the firing of a female developer who tweeted about it is stirring controversy across the internet. Adria Richards was fired last week from her job at SendGrid - developers of a cloud-based e-mail system - after she overheard the joke from a couple of developers sitting behind her at the PyCon Conference in Santa Clara, California. She said the men had made a remark concerning 'big dongles' - a device that . plugs into a computer - but Richards maintains the men were using it in a . sexual manner. Campaign: The Feminist Victim's Fund has been established to give donations to men like the developer whose crude joke led to the the firing of a female developer who tweeted about . She tweeted . a photo of the two men with the message: 'Not cool. Jokes about forking . repo's in a sexual way and ""big"" dongles. Right behind me #pycon' The joke teller, known only as 'Mr Hank,' was also dismissed from his job at PlayHaven as a result of Richards' tweet. But now, a group of Reddit users have founded the Feminist Victims Fund, designed to help men like Mr Hank and others they deem to be oppressed under the 'tyranny' of feminism. The fund appeared on the subreddit . TheRedPill, which is designed to show its visitors 'how to live, find . success and happiness in an era of feminism.' A post in TheRedPill reads: 'Feminism has caused some serious changes to our culture, to our society, and to our lives. We focus on some that are affected more than others, and we give back.' Adria Richards was fired from her job at tech company SendGrid after sending this tweet alleging sexual innuendos from several men at a California conference . Donation: The campaign has set a goal of $1,000 for Mr Hank . 'Our goal is to encourage men to . speak out, to be men, to not fear oppression and enjoy their freedom of . speech. Unfortunately in today's climate, being a man has become a . financial liability. Say the wrong thing in the wrong place and you can . find your entire life ruined. Destroyed.' The campaign has set a goal of $1,000 for Mr Hank and donations are collected using digital currency BitCoin. Richards' tweet last week garnered the attention of the conference organizers, who immediately reacted to deal with the situation. The chair of the conference, Jesse Noller, said 'We pulled all the individuals aside. We got all sides of the story. They said she was right, and they were very apologetic.' When blogging about her ordeal on her website But You're A Girl, Richards had this to say. SendGrid is a popular cloud-based e-mail company that works with Pinterest, Foursquare and Spotify (among other Silicon Valley companies) Richards also blogged about the incident on her website But You're A Girl, detailing the specific encounter she had with the men at the PyCon Conference . 'Have you ever had a group of men . sitting right behind you making joke that caused you to feel . uncomfortable? Well, that just happened this week but instead of . shrinking down in my seat, I did something about it.' It was Richards manner in dealing with the situation that led to her firing, according to SendGrid CEO Jim Franklin. 'Her decision to tweet the comments and photographs of the people who made the comments crossed the line,' Franklin wrote on the site for SendGrid. 'Publicly shaming the offenders - and bystanders - was not the appropriate way to handle the situation.' Andy Yang, the CEO of PlayHaven, did not mention the employee's name but came down hard on his actions. Richards attended the popular SXSW conference in Austin, TX just a few days ago . Gender equality has become a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley, especially on the heels of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's 'Lean In' 'PlayHaven had an employee who was identified as making inappropriate comments at PyCon, and as a company that is dedicated to gender equality and values honorable behavior, we conducted a thorough investigation. The result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go.' The second man in the photo, who is also employed by PlayHaven, is reportedly still with the company. According to Richards, she was sparked into action by a photo of a young girl, a 'young coder,' that appeared on screen during the PyCon Conference. 'I realized I had to do something or she would never have the chance to learn and love programming because the a** clowns behind me would make it impossible for her to do so.'","Reddit users unite for Feminist Victims Fund - designed to send donations to men oppressed by feminism .

A university is under fire after a class assignment instructed its students to write the word 'Jesus' on a piece of paper, throw it on the floor and then stomp on it. Florida Gov Rick Scott has now demanded an investigation into the ‘offensive’ assignment after a Florida Atlantic University professor allegedly threw a student out of his class for refusing to participate. Ryan Rotela, a junior at FAU’s Davie campus who describes himself as a devout Mormon, says it was his refusal to participate that led to his suspension. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Assignment: Ryan Rotela, a junior at Florida Atlantic University, says his intercultural communication professor instructed him to write the word Jesus on a piece of paper like seen here . Refusal: After her wrote it down he was then told to place it on the floor and then stomp on it, an act he says he refused to do, leading to his suspension . 'Anytime you stomp on something it shows that you believe that something has no value. So if you were to stomp on the word Jesus, it says that the word has no value,' Mr Rotela told CBS12. The assignment instructed in Dr. Deandre Poole's intercultural communication class was meant to demonstrate the power of words and symbols, according to the exercise. 'This exercise is a bit sensitive, but really drives home the point that even though symbols are arbitrary, they take on very strong and emotional meanings,' the exercise taken from St. Norbert College communications professor Jim Neuliep reads. 'Most will hesitate. Ask why they can't step on the paper. Discuss the importance of symbols in culture.' Mr Rotela said he went to speak with his professor's supervisor two days after, and found himself suspended. Threatened: Mr Rotela, who describes himself as a devout Mormon, says that after he returned with an attorney from the Texas-based Liberty Institute his school apologized . Apology: The university has since apologized calling the assignment insensitive and unacceptable, just before Florida Governor Rick Scott got into the matter demanding an investigation . He says his argument was first rebutted by the school. 'While at times the topics discussed may be sensitive,' Communications Department Director Noemi Marin said last week according to UPI, 'a university environment is a venue for such dialogue and debate.' It was after Mr Rotela returned with an . attorney from the Texas-based Liberty Institute that he says the school . changed its tune. Supporter: Gov. Rick Scott says he personally called Mr Rotela to applaud his bravery in standing up for what he believes in (file photo) FAU'S Dean of Students Cory King told him last week that any disciplinary charges would be dropped, according to Mr Rotela. 'He apologized in person for what happened and how everything went out of control,' Mr Rotela told the Palm Beach Post. In a statement later released on the university's website, the school called the assignment 'insensitive and unacceptable' while noting it having been written by a professor unaffiliated with FAU. 'Based on the offensive nature of the exercise, we will not use it again and have issued an apology to the community. It was insensitive and unacceptable. We continue to apologize to all the people who were offended and deeply regret this situation has occurred,' the statement reads. 'No students were forced to take part in the exercise; the instructor told all of the students in the class that they could choose whether or not to participate. No students will be disciplined in any way related to this exercise, either inside or outside the classroom.' On Tuesday Gov Scott showed that their apology may not be enough. 'I am requesting a report of the incident, how it was handled and a statement of the university’s policies to ensure this type of ""lesson"" will not occur again,' he wrote to State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan. Gov Scott says he later called Mr Rotela personally to discuss the matter. ‘I told him that it took great conviction and bravery to stand up and say what he was asked to do was wrong, and went against what he believed in,’ Scott told the Sun Sentinel.

A young woman who was arrested 30 times for drunken attacks - including punching police officers - has warned against the dangers of binge drinking. Amy Roberts, from Glasgow, told Closer magazine how alcohol transformed her from a shy schoolgirl into a violent criminal. She said: 'Alcohol turned me into a . crazed animal – I once punched a man in the face five times until he . bled and enjoyed it. It disgusts me now. But I became addicted to the . confidence alcohol gave me.' Amy, now aged 21, started drinking when she was 14 blaming 'peer pressure' from her older friends. As . a teenager she would often drink four times a week, taking her weekly . intake to 162 units - the recommended weekly intake for a woman is 14. On a typical night she would down a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20, a bottle of Lambrini and 10 vodka shots. Lacking . in self-esteem as a teenager, she said the alcohol made her feel more . 'confident and chatty' and helped her 'fit in' with her friends. However, it also led to her committing a number of violent offences. The first was when she attacked a police officer who tried to take a bottle off her when she was caught drinking in the street. She recalled: 'I bit her hand – I felt filled with . rage and couldn't stop myself. She handcuffed me and I was kept in a . police cell for the night. 'In the morning, I was horrified – I was a . good girl, doing well at school and from a good family. I'd never been . violent before.' However, the incident was not enough . to make Amy change her ways. In fact she said having a conviction for . attacking a police officer was like 'a badge of honour' as her friends . thought it was 'cool'.hh . Out of control: On an average night she would consume a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20, a bottle of Lambrini and 10 vodka shots . She went on to commit a string of other drunken offences - around one a month - between the ages of 16 to 18 including punching other police officers, security guards and her friends. On one occasion, she viciously attacked a landlord who kicked her out of his pub for being under age. 'I punched him in the face, five times. He was bleeding . from the nose. I was like an animal, shouting and screaming. I was . actually getting a thrill out of it,' she said. Amy admits she was 'out of control' and ignored the pleas from her 'angry and disappointed' mother, Helen, 59, a care worker, to give up alcohol. Peer pressure: Amy said she drank to fit in with her older friends and feel more confident (posed by models) Amy shares her story in this week's Closer magazine . The wake up call she needed only came after a five-and-a-half-month prison sentence she was given for punching another police officer in what was her 30th attack. Upon her release in April 2011, she had counselling and agreed to stop seeing her old friends. She now only drinks occasionally and volunteers in a clothes shop. She left school with six A to C GCSE grades and would love to get a full-time paid job but fears her criminal record will always hold her back. 'My past will haunt me forever,' she said. 'I don't know if I'll ever work – I'll be branded a criminal forever and it makes me feel worthless.' Amy is not alone in her teen addiction to alcohol as recent figures have revealed a surge in the number of girls under 15 consuming 11 units a week. There has also been a 50 per cent rise inthe past five years in fines issued to women under 21 for committing drunken violence. Amy now hopes other girls will learn from her story and change their ways. 'I'm embarrassed and ashamed of my past. Binge-drinking might seem like fun, but it wrecks lives.'

The critically acclaimed author both dismissed the notion of a third movie, which Ms Parker said she was open to in 2011, and admitted she would have changed the plot entirely for the 2010-released second film - where Samantha, Charlotte, Miranda and Carrie jet off to Abu Dhabi for a holiday. 'If it were up to me,' Ms Bushnell said, 'the second movie would have been Carrie Bradshaw . decides to run for mayor and Samantha helps her. 'It would get into some . real issues of what happens when you’re part of a relationship and the . woman is ambitious. What does that do to her relationship with Mr. Big?

The wife of former German president Christian Wulff is taking legal action to prevent Google from spreading rumours that she once worked as an escort girl. Web users who type Bettina Wulff’s name into Google’s search engine receive suggestions including ‘prostitute’, ‘escort’ and ‘red-light district’. Rumours were reportedly circulated by political opponents of her husband, who resigned in February following a loan scandal. Bettina Wulff, the wife of former German president Christian Wulff is taking legal action to prevent Google from spreading rumours that she once worked as an escort girl . 'I was never employed as an escort,' Mrs. Wulff swore in her statement at her attorney’s office in Hamburg. A click on the German version of Google throws up numerous references to 'call girl,' 'red light,' 'prostitute' and 'escort' in relation to Mrs. Wulff. The case is unique in Germany in being the first lawsuit ever launched by a former first lady in a bid to salvage her reputation. German and foreign bloggers - as well as 34 media outlets in Germany - have signed declarations over the past few months pledging to cease and desist from citing such allegations after strongly worded letters were despatched from Mrs. Wulff’s legal team. Her lawyers said; 'In recent months . many publishers, journalists and Internet activists desisted immediate . upon request, without even trying to justify the false representations'. It is understood everal media outlets have had to pay compensation to the tune of tens of thousands of euros to her. Her . lawsuit is also aimed at German chat show and Who Wants to be a . Millionaire host Guenter Jauch who refused to sign the declaration never . to mention the red-light rumours. Jauch denied he ever slandered her . and pointed out that the reference he made to her on air was credited to . the newspaper it appeared in. And Google on Sunday said it will fight her bid to censor it. Kay . Oberbeck, spokeswoman for Google Northern Europe, said the displayed . terms about her are 'algorithmically-generated result of objective . factors, including the popularity of the entered search terms'. Google has already faced five similar cases in Germany - and won them all . She said Google 'is not proposing these terms - all terms that appear have been previously entered by Google users.' Google has already faced five similar cases in Germany - and won them all. While Mrs. Wulff might want to erase any mention of her past, her present situation meant she woke up on Sunday plastered over the newspapers in her homeland because of the legal moves. Jauch’s TV show had quoted a newspaper article regarding the rumours in Berlin and Jauch had also questioned the deputy editor of the mass-circulation newspaper Bild about the affair. The lawsuit states that in Wulff’s view, Jauch had 'played a central role... in the destruction of her reputation.' The lawsuit against Google aims to stop words such as 'red-light past,' 'prostitute' or 'escort' appearing as search suggestions when Bettina Wulff’s name is entered in the search window. Wulff will also try to counter the allegations when she publishes a book about her life this month, . The Sueddeutsche newspaper said its investigations had revealed that Christian Democratic Union circles in Hanover started spreading the rumours in 2006 to target her husband who was state premier of Lower Saxony at the time. The rumours spread multiplied in the days leading up to his taking the presidential post in 2010 with several news outlets taking them seriously. Wulff resigned this February after a string of money-related allegations came to light – including that in 2008 while he was Lower Saxony state premier, he failed to declare a soft loan of €500,000 from a prominent regional businessmen. The Wulffs were married in March 2008, two months before the birth of their son, Linus. Bettina Wulff, who had studied media management in Hannover, worked as a publicist before becoming Germany’s First Lady. A ruling about the validity of her lawsuit is expected at the Hamburg State Court within weeks. Typing in ‘Bettina Wulff’ on to Google.de, autocompletes the search with terms like 'escort' and 'prostitute.' In fact it throws up ‘prostitute, escort and past’ before a single search term has been entered. Of such ‘hits’ there are an astonishing 61,800 for prostitute, 1.46 MILLION for ‘rotlicht’ - red light - and 157,000 for her ‘past.’ The allegations were a source of routine gossip in political and media circles for years; one rumour which did the rounds was that Wulff met her when he hired her for the evening as an ‘escort.’ Some media outlets have published details of the place where she was supposed to have worked - and she claims she never was employed in such a manner. A court in Hamburg is considering Mrs Wulff’s claim.","Typing Bettina Wulff’s name .

High street retailers have been enjoying what some have described as their busiest day of the year with customers making a last dash for Christmas presents. The British Retail Consortium already predicted this weekend will be 'the big one' as consumers spend up to £5 billion. Today is being touted as the busier of the two days - primarily because of longer opening hours. Bluewater shopping centre in Kent confirmed that today was their busiest day of the year. Big day: High street retailers are preparing for what they hope will be the biggest day of the year amid gloomy sales figures in the last dash to Christmas. This was a packed high street in Southampton today . Visa Europe also expects today to be the . year's busiest shopping day, with customers set to spend £1.26 billion . on their Visa cards alone. The company predicts it will process 31.9 million transactions today, with 2pm to 3pm expected to be the busiest hour. It said shoppers appeared to be saving up for a 'spree' this weekend, with figures showing an incremental increase in spending in recent weeks. Visa Europe commercial director Dr Steve Perry said: 'The way in which Christmas falls this year means that, in comparison to 2011, we appear to be a week behind in terms of consumer spending. Crush: Visa Europe also expects today to be the year's busiest shopping day, with customers set to spend £1.26 billion on their Visa cards alone . 'This is borne out in the Visa Weekly Christmas Spend Tracker which shows that UK consumer spending is down -2.9% annually. 'It appears that shoppers are holding off their spending sprees until the weekend when we anticipate that Saturday will be the busiest shopping day of the year, with consumers set to spend £1.26 billion on their Visa cards alone. 'Competition for consumer spending is fierce, with growing numbers of consumers still visiting online retailers to snap up bargains ahead of anticipated discounting on the high street in the final furlong before Christmas.' Packed house: Xmas shoppers out in force before the weekend. This was the scene at Lakeside Shopping Centre, Thurrock, Essex today . A spokeswoman for John Lewis said the last two weekends had been record-breakers in terms of sales and momentum was continuing to build, adding that 'another record-breaker isn't out of the question'. And Waitrose is expecting today to be the busiest food shopping day of the year. But the Local Government Association (LGA) said confidence on the high street remained low as Britain prepared for 'what is traditionally the busiest shopping weekend of the year'. Its annual Christmas survey found that 84% of town centre managers said confidence among shoppers had either not improved or worsened compared with this time last year. The LGA suggested that the particularly cold and wet start to the winter could also be taking its toll on the number of shoppers visiting town centres. The LGA's chairman of its economy and transport board said: 'Last year, 86% of those who took part in our survey thought there would be no improvement in consumer confidence on the high street in 2012 and it would seem from today's results that they were right on the money. 'Worryingly, the outlook for next year is not much brighter. Spree: Experts believe as much as £5billion could be spent on the British high street over the next two days in an unprecedented rush . 'People's shopping habits are changing, and we need new creative approaches to revitalising our town centres.' Tim Walley, general manager at Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre, said: 'Today we expect to welcome in the region of 220,000 visitors to Bullring as they take advantage of the final weekend before Christmas. 'This Christmas we essentially have an extra weekend of trading in comparison to December 2011, so we're expecting a bumper weekend. 'Tomorrow we expect another 120,000 customers will visit the centre.' At the Westfield Derby shopping centre, Richard Thornton marketing and communications manager said plenty of shoppers had arrived and were ready for the centre to open at 9am, today. 'It is extremely busy, much busier than it usually is for this time on a weekend and the car parks were extremely busy when I was coming in this morning,' he said. 'We're open from 9am until 7pm, and we had about 50 people queuing outside the Pandora jewellery store before it opened this morning.' At the Touchwood Shopping Centre in Solihull near Birmingham, managers were expecting up to 30,000 people through their doors today. Some 275,000 shoppers are expected to descend on Bluewater in Kent this weekend. More than 600,000 visitors have flocked to the shopping centre - which extended its opening hours until 11pm - over the past five days. Determined: Shoppers in Winchester brave the weather as they shop on the last Saturday of shopping . Robert Goodman, Bluewater's general manager, said: 'With this weekend being the last chance for many people to complete their Christmas shopping, we are expecting Bluewater to be very busy.' Jo Tallack, general manager at the Highcross Leicester shopping centre, said: 'With one full weekend left before Christmas, we're expecting both Saturday and Sunday to be exceptionally busy at Highcross. 'Last weekend we saw almost 170,000 people through the doors, which was our busiest weekend in three years and our busiest Sunday since we launched in 2008. We're expecting this weekend to be just as busy - if not more so - than last weekend. 'Total year-to-date sales are up by 5 percent at Highcross, with like-for-like sales up 3 percent - we're confident this will be another successful Christmas at the centre.'","Today will be busiest this weekend due to longer opening hours .

Sun-powered lasers could protect Earth from any more asteroids judged to be flying too close, a new study claims. U.S. researchers have outlined a plan for solar powered space defences which could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past Earth on Friday night in 60 minutes. The same system could destroy asteroids 10 times larger in about a year, with evaporation starting at a distance as far away as the Sun, the researchers claim. Sun-powered asteroid-busting lasers: Described as a 'directed energy orbital defense system', DE-STAR is designed to harness the power of the Sun and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams . After Earth's close shave with asteroid 2012 DA14 on Friday night - and the unexpected meteorite explosion which injured 1,000 Russians that morning - attention has turned to technology which could be used to defend our planet. The 130,000 ton, 150ft-wide lump of space rock hurtled past at 17,400mph - eight times as fast as a bullet from a high-powered sniper rifle - making its closest approach at 7.25pm on Friday evening. If it had struck our planet it would have exploded with one thousand times the force of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. In the run up to the close shave - an event which occurs roughly once every 40 years - astronomers were keen to point out that their calculations showed little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 actually hitting our planet. But in the event a similar, or bigger interloper is spotted on a collision - an event thought to happen every 1,200 years or so - academics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, have outlined a plan to destroy it before it can destroy us. They say their concept, dubbed Directed Energy Solar Targeting of Asteroids an exploRation, or DE-STAR, is 'a realistic means of mitigating potential threats posed to the Earth by asteroids and comets.' Described as a 'directed energy orbital defence system', DE-STAR is designed to harness the vast power of the Sun and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams. These can then be aimed at any threatening-looking asteroids to destroy them before they can get too close. How asteroid 2012 DA14 looked in a long-exposure . image taken from Earth: If it had struck it would have exploded with . one thousand times the force of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in . 1945 . Extinction-level event size: Radar images of the three-mile-long . asteroid Toutatis captured by NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar on . December 12 and 13 as it passed the Earth at a distance of some . 4.3million miles . Gary Hughes, a professor at Cal Poly, who contributed to the research, said: 'This system is not some far-out idea from Star Trek. 'All the components of this system pretty much exist today. Maybe not quite at the scale that we'd need – scaling up would be the challenge – but the basic elements are all there and ready to go. 'We just need to put them into a larger system to be effective, and once the system is there, it can do so many things.' Indeed, the researchers say that aside from vaporising extinction-level event size asteroids, the DE-STAR system has a number of other potential uses - even as a spaceship propulsion system. Professor Hughes and UC Santa Barbara physicist Philip Lubin calculated the requirements and possibilities for DE-STAR systems of several sizes, ranging from a desktop device to one measuring six miles in diameter. The larger the system, the greater its capabilities, they said. For example, DE-STAR 2 – at 100m in diameter, about the size of the International Space Station – 'could start nudging comets or asteroids out of their orbits,' Professor Hughes said. Powerful: This plot shows time to evaporate an Apophis-like asteroid versus its diameter, versus several laser power levels. The baseline DE-STAR 4 system has approximately 100 gigawatts of laser power . But DE-STAR 4 – at 10km in diameter, . about 100 times the size of the ISS – could deliver 1.4 megatons of . energy per day to its target, said Professor Lubin, obliterating an . asteroid 500m across in one year. Such . a sized system could also accelerate interplanetary travel far beyond . what is possible with the chemical propellant rockets used today, . Professor Lubin claims. It could also power advanced ion drive systems for deep space travel, he said. Able . to engage multiple targets and missions at once, he claimed, DE-STAR 4 . 'could simultaneously evaporate an asteroid, determine the composition . of another, and propel a spacecraft.' Larger . still, DE-STAR 6 could enable interstellar travel by functioning as a . massive, orbiting power source and propulsion system for spacecraft. It . could propel a 10-ton spacecraft at near the speed of light, allowing . interstellar exploration to become a reality without waiting for science . fiction technology such as 'warp drive' to come along, said Professor . Lubin. Scalable: This plot shows DE-STAR laser power and spot diameter versus DE-STAR array size. The DE-STAR system is modular and can be built up in sections each of which is immediately operational . The researchers say recent and rapid developments in highly efficient conversion of light to electrical power have made such advances a possibility today when just 20 years ago they would have appeared impossible. An asteroid big enough to destroy London skimmed past the Earth at just after 7pm on Friday night. The flyby by the 150ft, 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the closest shave for an object of this size since records began. Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting our planet, if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Its closest approach - passing within 17,000 miles, which is closer than some satellites - was at 7.25pm GMT. The flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above Russia's Ural Mountains. Astronomers said the two events were merely a coincidence and that the objects were travelling in opposite directions. 'Our proposal assumes a combination of baseline technology – where we are today – and where we almost certainly will be in the future, without asking for any miracles,' said Professor Lubin. 'We've really tried to temper this with a realistic view of what we can do, and we approached it from that point of view. 'It does require very careful attention to a number of details, and it does require a will to do so, but it does not require a miracle.' Professor Hughes added: 'These are not just back-of-the-envelope numbers. They are actually based on detailed analysis, through solid calculations, justifying what is possible. And it's all available under current theory and current technology. 'There are large asteroids and comets that cross the Earth's orbit, and some very dangerous ones going to hit the Earth eventually. 'Many have hit in the past and many will hit in the future. We should feel compelled to do something about the risk. Realistic solutions need to be considered, and this is definitely one of those.' Professor Lubin, who began work on DE-STAR a year ago, said: 'We have to come to grips with discussing these issues in a logical and rational way. 'We need to be proactive rather than reactive in dealing with threats. 'Duck and cover is not an option.'","U.S. researchers call their idea a 'directed energy orbital defence system'

Roger Buckingham stabbed a brave street cleaner who tried to stop him with his broom as he was leaving a house with a stolen laptop . A burglar has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years today for killing a brave street cleaner who tried to stop him with his broom. Piotr Mikiewicz, 40, was stabbed through his heart as he tackled Roger Buckingham, who was trying to flee a house with a stolen laptop. Buckingham, 31, of Shepherd’s Bush, west London, was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey and jailed for life. The Recorder of London Judge Brian Barker said 'cowardly' Buckingham, a petty criminal and drug addict with 25 previous convictions for 51 offences, must serve at least 27 years. The judge said: 'He was a brave man who acted beyond the call of duty. He ignored his own safety and he paid for his actions with his life. 'He was a truly exceptional man. He was a valued member of the community.' Buckingham had acted 'in frustration and temper', said the judge. 'On any view, it was cowardly and selfish.' The court heard the Polish national Mr Mikiewicz was working in Rylett Road, Shepherd’s Bush, in August, last year, when Buckingham broke into a house. He tripped the burglar alarm and was making his getaway with £30 and a laptop when Mr Mikiewicz saw him and hit him with his broom to stop him getting away. But Buckingham had taken a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the public-spirited cleaner. He ran off while local people tried in vain to help Mr Mikiewicz on the ground. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC said Mr Mikiewicz had shown a 'laudable sense of civic duty and right and wrong'. He added: 'That man, armed only with his dust cart and broom, took on the defendant, striking him in order to apprehend him and prevent him leaving with the fruits of his crime. Scroll down for video . Roger Buckingham can be seen in the stairwell of a block of flats shortly after the stabbing . A CCTV image from the Metropolitan Police shows Roger Buckingham walking along Askew Road, London, shortly after the stabbing . 'It was a terrible and needless waste of the life of a man who provided a service to the local community and did that which we all wish we had done.' Buckingham had claimed the death was 'a terrible accident' but the jury took only four hours to convict him of murder. The murder weapon was found abandoned in an Opel Zafira, which Buckingham stole from a petrol station a few days previously. It had been ticketed by a traffic warden in Bentworth Road, near Buckingham’s home that morning. Buckingham was later arrested at his girlfriend’s home as he made plans to flee to Cyprus. Buckingham stood with his hands behind his back as he was sentenced. His family had earlier shouted abuse at the jury. Police combed the streets after the street cleaner was stabbed to death by an armed burglar . The cleaner repeatedly hit the thief with his broom as he tried to stop Buckingham fleeing the affluent semi-detached property in Shepherds Bush, west London . An officer stands outside the cordoned off house following the incident . Mr Mikiewicz's sister Anna told the court in a statement that her brother had been living in London for nine years and considered it his home. She said: 'He was a wonderful man, full of compassion for others. He did not tolerate lies and theft. He was a believer and lived according to these principles.' Busie Mikiewicz said her husband was a 'brave and selfless man who wasn't frightened to stand up for what he believed was right'. She added in a statement: 'He was someone who represented everything that is good about decent people and was prepared to fight for what was right. 'Anyone who knew Piotr knew he was a truly good and honest person. He had a strong sense of what was right and wrong. 'He wasn't just a road sweeper, he was part of the community that genuinely cared for him. 'Piotr was a truly good person who was immensely proud of the job he did. 'A cruel and thoughtless act can take away his life, but not the inspiration that he brought to so many people.' Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner said: 'Piotr Mikiewicz demonstrated extreme courage when he spotted Buckingham leaving a house he had burgled moments earlier. 'He acted on pure instinct to right a wrong but unfortunately paid for his brave act with his life.'","Roger Buckingham stabbed Piotr Mikiewicz through the heart as he fled a home with a stolen laptop .

Three teenagers killed when their car collided with the back of a lorry were seen ‘having a bit of a giggle’ together just moments before their deaths, an inquest heard today. Jack Boyton, 17, of Enfield, north London, was driving to show his mother his new car when he was killed with friends Harry Ferrand, 17, also of Enfield, and Ashley Jones, 19, of Canvey Island, Essex. All three were pronounced dead at the scene on the A10 in Hertfordshire last November after the crash in a Vauxhall Corsa, which had been bought just a few hours beforehand. Fatalities: Jack Boyton (left) and Harry Ferrand (right), both 17 and from Enfield, north London, were killed . Liam Bradshaw, another 17-year-old boy from Enfield, survived the crash. Coroner Ed Thomas recorded a verdict of accidental death at Hatfield Coroner's Court in Hertfordshire. Victim: Ashley Jones, 19, of Canvey Island, Essex, was also pronounced dead at the scene last year . He confirmed the victims died from dramatic head injuries after their car collided with the back of a lorry parked in a layby. Mr Thomas added: 'For me to make suggestions would only be speculation. There was no braking. The vehicle went straight into the lorry. 'The lorry was legally parked there and very visible. There's nothing that I've heard that suggests that up to that point the driving was inappropriate.' Addressing the victims' parents, he said: ‘They were all in the car together and you can imagine they were in the car and they were having a nice time. They were all young men who had a lot of promise. Nice young lads.' Investigating officer Robert Wagstaff said there was no evidence the two rear passengers - Harry and Liam - were wearing seatbelts, while Jack and Mr Jones were found to be wearing their seatbelts. There was nothing inappropriate found in the teenagers' bloodstreams. The driver of the Mercedes Sainsbury's lorry the car crashed into, as it sat parked in a layby while he had a 45 minute rest break, spoke today. Addressing the victims' parents, Nigel Bennett fought back tears to say: ‘The emergency services were very professional. They couldn't have done anything more for your children.’ Road: The accident happened on the northbound A10 between Turnford and Hoddesdon (file picture) Mr Bennett described the moment the car crashed into the back of his lorry just as he was about to have a cup of coffee after eating his lunch. ‘There was a massive bang and the vehicle moved and slipped slightly off the tarmac,’ he said. ‘I've never experienced anything like it. It was like the suspension had collapsed.’ The accident happened at about 2.15pm on the northbound A10 between Turnford and Hoddesdon. The last man to speak to the boys recalled how Jack had excitedly called in with him to show off his new car just before the crash. Jack, who was just about to embark on a career as an estate agent, had worked for Daniel Moseley selling Christmas trees and fireworks and was described by his ex-boss as ‘polite, outgoing, bubbly’. Mr Moseley said: ‘He said he'd come back tomorrow. He was going to meet his mum. When he left me he was going to show his mum his new car.’ He added that he told Jack to ‘drive carefully’ when he said goodbye. Joanne Cole was driving behind the teenagers a short time before the crash and recalled how they appeared to be having a good time. ‘It was nice to see lads laughing and getting on,’ she said. Ms Cole described the movements of the car as ‘normal driving’ and said she believed the driver was ‘concentrating on the road’. She added: ‘They were having a bit of a giggle.’ 'They were all in the car together and you can imagine they were in the car and they were having a nice time. They were all young men who had a lot of promise. Nice young lads' Coroner Ed Thomas . In a statement released by police after the inquest, Jack's mother Sarah and father Michael Boyton said: ‘How can I describe Jack, well my boy, my friend, my son? ‘Jack had a very caring nature and would always help someone that needed a hand. Jack passed his driving test a few weeks before the accident and as soon as he had it was his goal to get a car. He was so excited. Jack at this point was the happiest he could have been.’ Describing the moment she was told of the tragedy by police, Mrs Boyton said: ‘I remember being at home when Pc Sparkes came and told me what I didn't want to hear. Our boy, our baby, my little husband was dead.’ Vivian Fegan, mother of Mr Jones, said the last thing he said to her was ‘love you too’. In her witness statement, she said: ‘At the end of every phone call I would always say “love you”. Depending on who Ash was with he'd say it back. 'Because I knew he was with his friends I said it again almost making him say it in front of his friends. Ash said “love you too” very quickly and quietly - that was the last thing he said to me.’","Teenagers were seen 'having a giggle' just moments before their car crashed with a lorry .

A serial burglar who boasted on television about being a reformed character has been jailed for six years for raiding the homes of two sleeping pensioners. Derek Bray starred in the Channel Four series 'Thief Catchers' and spoke of how a special police unit had helped him turn his back on a lifetime of crime and drugs. He moved to Exeter, Devon, from Bristol to start a new life but soon drifted back into his old ways and has now been jailed for a crime spree in which he raided four homes in the space of a few weeks. Bray even went burgling on the night before he was due in court for an earlier break-in, Exeter Crown Court was told. His victims included a 90-year-old widow and an 85-year-old widower, who were both living on their own. Their homes homes in Exeter were both broken into as they slept. Bray, 37, of Exeter, admitted two burglaries, two thefts, taking a car without consent, handling, and asked for three other offences to be considered. He was jailed for six years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, who was told that Bray has 35 previous convictions totalling more than 150 crimes dating back to his teens. He told him: 'You burgled the home of a lady of 90 who lived alone while she was at home asleep at night. That is a serious aggravating feature. 'You were bailed and on the night before you were due in court you committed a further dwelling house burglary. You have an appalling previous record for burglaries.' Mr Terry Holder, prosecuting, said Bray broke into the home of a 90-year-old woman in Exeter, in January and that of an 85-year-old man in March. He stole a laptop and purse in the first raid and was caught on CCTV as he tried to use a stolen card at a cashpoint. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bray was one of a number of criminals who featured on the Channel 4 Dispatches programme in 2010 . He took another computer, cash and cards at the second raid as well as the keys of the owner's Honda Jazz car which he used to drive to the nearest ATM where he withdrew £200. He later admitted another two raids, in which he broke into unsecured homes and took a hip flask and other property after wandering the streets seeking out targets. A stolen laptop, car keys, and other loot were found by police in a secret hiding place under the cooker at his home. Miss Emily Pitts, defending, said Bray had come clean about all his offending and helped police clear up the earlier burglaries. She said: 'He has been using drugs since he was 13 and been on heroin since he was 16. 'His mother is also an addict.

Gordon Ramsay’s father-in-law reignited their bitter war yesterday by demanding the High Court shut down the chef’s global empire. Christopher Hutcheson lodged a petition to ‘wind up’ Gordon Ramsay Holdings, which owns all his restaurants and media ventures. Hutcheson claimed he was taking the drastic action in pursuit of a ‘significant unpaid debt’ – understood to be £2million Ramsay offered to pay him in February to settle the vicious feud ripping the company and family apart. He also alleged he was acting because the TV chef was facing a ‘tax investigation’ by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs – a claim which Ramsay’s camp believe is designed to smear him. Ramsay is understood to be confident the court will dismiss all Hutcheson’s demands, if it even reaches the stage of a hearing. The once-close pair fell out in 2010 and hostilities have grown increasingly severe. Ramsay, 46, accused Hutcheson – the father of his wife Tana and former chief executive of the Ramsay empire – of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million to finance his womanising. Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed ‘monster’ and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. Ramsay’s wife, 38, sided with her husband and severed ties with her parents after discovering her philandering father had kept a second family secret from her for 30 years. In February this year, a truce was called and both sides withdrew civil litigation. Ramsay is believed to have agreed to pay £2million to Hutcheson, which included a payment for a 30 per cent shareholding in Gordon Ramsay Holdings. But yesterday full hostilities were resumed as Hutcheson accused Ramsay – whose annual income was recently estimated at £24million – of failing to pay up. Chef Gordon Ramsey and his wife Tana Ramsey . The High Court in London confirmed a ‘petition to wind up’ Gordon Ramsay Holdings had been lodged by Hutcheson. A hearing at the Companies Court has been scheduled for January 21. Presenting a winding-up petition to the court is the most serious debt recovery action that can be taken by someone claiming to be a creditor. Hutcheson will be required to demonstrate he has an unpaid debt that is not in dispute, something Ramsay’s camp suggest he will be unable to do. Technically, if a judge sided with Hutcheson, the court has the power to order the compulsory liquidation of the Ramsay empire, which includes 24 restaurants around the world. However, it is more likely the matter will be resolved before that stage. Yesterday Hutcheson’s solicitor, Ryan Carthew, said: ‘I can confirm that a statutory demand has been filed with respect to Mr Ramsay and a winding up petition against Gordon Ramsay Holdings in relation to a significant debt which is now due to our client Mr Hutcheson.’ A source close to Ramsay confirmed there was a tax investigation, but suggested it related to the time when Hutcheson was chief executive of the company. A spokesman for the chef said the winding-up petition had been published ‘maliciously’, adding: . ‘There are valid reasons why the purported debt has not been paid which has nothing to do with GRH’s solvency or ability to pay.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Christopher Hutcheson has lodged a petition to wind up his son-in-law's restaurants .

'Although exact details of how the . new search engine will work remain unclear for now, we have been told . that the social network is planning to launch a big new 'search feature' on the site 'very soon', one that will shake everything up,' the site . claimed. Facebook already offers a basic search feature on its site, allowing users to look for 'people, places and things'. However, it is believed tonight's announcement could see this dramatically upgraded. 'If Facebook were to allow users to . quickly search the social network and beyond for example, it could cause . major headaches for Google: the new feature would give Facebook users a . reason to bypass Google altogether,' said Pocket Lint. 'This could do very well,' Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint told MailOnline. 'A lot of people are used to Facebook, and I think it's a no-brainer. 'Google has tried to get into social with Google+, and the two areas go together.' Mr Miles also warned Facebook would need to tread carefully around privacy, but said: 'As long as Facebook doesn't touch settings, users will not be worried'. The new feature is expected to be made available within hours of tonight's announcement. Facebook's HQ in Menlo Park, in the heart of silicon Valley, where the launch will take place .

The families of two holidaymakers mown down by a truck in Thailand today said the deaths have left a 'massive hole' in their lives, as the first pictures of the pair were released. Derek Gent and Mike Holmes, both 68 and from Rochdale, Greater Manchester died in the road traffic accident while away with their wives on the lush tropical island of Koh Samui. They had been friends for 30 years, their children said in a joint statement today. Tragedy: Lifelong friends Mike Holmes (left) and Derek Gent, who were killed when they were hit by a truck while on holiday in Thailand. Their families today released a joint statement paying tribute to the men . The pair are thought to have been walking by the side of a road when an out-of-control pick-up truck collided with another vehicle, careered off the road and slammed into them. The men had been staying with their wives at the luxurious Rocky's Boutique Resort in Koh Samui. Their wives were not with them at the time of the incident. Their children today paid tribute them in a joint statement. 'We are really struggling to comprehend our loss. It has shocked us all and left a massive hole in our lives. Derek and Mike were regular golfing partners and friends for more than 30 years,' they said. 'Devoted husbands, fathers and grandfathers, their loss will be felt by our families and their many friends. 'Our mothers Janet Holmes and Christine Gent have been overwhelmed by the kindness and support they have received from the employees of the resort where they were staying (Rocky's Boutique Resort), the Thai people and the holiday company they travelled with (Kuoni).' Paradise island: The pair are thought to have been walking by the side of a road in Koh Samui when an out-of-control pick-up truck collided with another vehicle, careered off the road and slammed into them . Reports from the holiday island say the truck originally collided with a Toyota Corolla and veered off the road. It then hit Mr Gent - former head of Oldham's trading standards until he retired around 10 years ago - and Mr Holmes, before smashing into a tea shop. The driver of the Toyota told police he was driving home from the beach when the truck tried to overtake him causing a collision which span the pick-up 'out of control'. The truck driver is critically ill in a Bangkok hospital, while the driver of the Toyota escaped unharmed.

Neighbours on Croft Head Drive, Milnrow, where keen angler Mr Gent lived, were visibly upset at the news of the deaths. 'They were both absolutely wonderful men. Everyone is still in shock,' said one. Another said: 'We'll miss them very much. They were both lovely people.' A third neighbour added: 'I have lost two fantastic friends.' Long-standing Oldham councillor Hugh . McDonald, who had previously worked with Mr Gent, said: 'Derek was . always very courteous and pleasant and dealt with things very well.

President Barack Obama was sworn into his second term on Sunday at noon in front of only his wife and two daughters in a simple service. His younger daughter Sasha said 'Good job, Daddy!' after he correctly recited the oath of office. 'I did it!' he gleefully responded. Sure to keep him on his toes, he followed that up with a quick 'You didn't mess up!' Scroll down to watch . Keeping it brief: Mr Obama had his immediate family beside him at the ceremony, but reports also say that his other relatives were also present but out of the camera's line . Close bond: Mr Obama got a happy hug from older daughter Malia and Sasha (right) told him 'Good job, Daddy!' after he completed the oath. 'You didn't mess up!' The swearing in ceremony took place on Sunday in keeping with the laws states in the Constitution which states that Presidents' terms begin at noon on January 20. Normally the oath of office is given on the steps of the Capitol and is followed by his address to the nation, but because this year it happens to fall on a Sunday- and inaugurations are never held that day of the week- the oath of office was given quickly in the Blue Room of the White House instead. Swearing in: President Obama took his oath of office on Sunday just before noon, officially marking the start of his second term . Big moment: The oath was given quickly and held inside the White House because it is Sunday and the inauguration ceremony will be held tomorrow . Keeping it in the family: Mr Obama opted to be sworn in on a Bible that has been in Mrs Obama's family for some time . When President Obama takes the oath again tomorrow in front of the packed Mall, it will be his fourth time doing so. Michelle Obama showed off her new bangs along with a royal blue dress and cardigan by American designer Reed Krakoff at the swearing-in ceremony. The First Lady and daughter Malia matched the President's blue suit, also complementing the Blue Room of the White House, where the small ceremony took place. Younger daughter Sasha, however, went her own way: She wore a lacy pink dress with a gold, wide-width, high-waisted belt - a style her mother helped popularize - and gold shoes. It's not the first time Mrs Obama chose a design by Krakoff. She previously has worn a gown and jacket by the designer, who also is the president and executive creative director of Coach, Inc. She has carried one of his tote bags, too. Her hairdo, however, is a change - and it has been the subject of online chatter since its debut on Thursday in a photo taken at the White House. Only the President's immediate family and a few relatives were present, along with a crew of journalists to witness and televise the event. Aside from thanking Chief Justice John Roberts after the oath- and joking with his younger daughter that 'I did it!'- Mr Obama did not make any remarks before heading back out of the Blue Room and back to business. Mr Roberts, who famously floundered at Mr Obama's 2008 inauguration, carried a piece of paper and read the quick oath without any stumbles this time. Because he did not recite the oath of office word-for-word in in 2008, Mr Roberts had to perform a second official service inside the White House in the days following. Though they were not seen on cameras, . a number of his relative were apparently in attendance- including his . sister and her family, and First Lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig . Robinson and his family and her mother, Marian, who lives with the . Obamas in the White House. Mr . Obama opted to give a nod to Mrs Obama's relatives by choosing to be . sworn in with his hand resting on the Robinson's family Bible. Reading it carefully: Chief Justice John Roberts famously floundered when he read the oath of office to Mr Obama in 2008, but he was careful to make no mistakes this time around . Signs of approval: Michelle gives Barack a kiss after he read the oath and Malia gives her dad a big hug . All smiles: Though they looked serious during the actual ceremony, everyone appeared happy after it was done . Few fans: Only a handful of relatives were invited to attend the private ceremony . On their merry way: Justice Roberts follows the First Family after the exit . Watching: The cameramen from the White House Press Pool watched and recorded the oath . Mr Obama attended church with his family . before the ceremony, and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown . Solider alongside Vice President Joe Biden, who was also sworn in for . his second term this morning. Family was a theme of the morning's ceremony as Mr Biden opted to take his oath of office with his hand over a bible that has been owned by the Biden clan since 1893. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore 70-year-old Biden into his second term before she rushed off to catch a train to her hometown of New York so that she could attend a book signing. Second term: Vice President Joe Biden was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Sunday morning . 'An honor': Biden was pleased that Sotomayor pushed back her travel plans in order to perform the oath . Friendly tone: The Vice President took the oath in front of 120 relatives and friends . 'I want to explain to you what a wonderful honor it was, and how much out of her way the Justice had to go. She is due in New York. She has to leave right now. So I apologize: We're gonna walk out,' Mr Biden told the crowd after they applauded his oath. 'Her car's waiting so she can catch a train I hope I haven't caused her to miss.' The Supreme Court Justice smiled before quickly exiting along with the Vice President and his wife Dr Jill Biden. 'And I am leaving - going and gonna meet the President (for) the traditional laying the wreath at 2 over in Arlington. And we're having breakfast. I'll be back, they tell me, in 40 minutes. I hope of some you will still be here,' he said. Happy moment: Mr Biden was surrounded by family members when he was sworn into office . Tradition: Mr Biden used his family's Bible which they have owned since 1893 . The ceremony was held at the U.S. Naval Observatory which doubles as the vice president's residence. It opened with a prayer by Reverend Kevin O'Brien, a practicing Jesuit priest who is the vice president of Georgetown University's Mission of Campus Ministry. The selection of Rev. O'Brien comes as little surprise since the Bidens often attend mas at Holy Trinity Catholic Church just one block from the college campus. After Rev. O'Brien finished his prayer, the attention went to Justice Sotomayor and Mr Biden who repeated the oath after her. Religious touch: Reverend Kevin O'Brien (right), who is a member of the faculty at Georgetown University, gave a blessing before Mr Biden took the oath of office . Pucker up: Mr Biden kissed one of his grandsons as the rest of the family claps on . Dr Biden, who kept the apparent color-coordination going as she and her husband were wearing varying shades of blue, was in charge of holding the family Bible. They were surrounded by Mr Biden's children- including Beau and Ashley- and some of their five grandchildren. Once the oath was said, Mr and Dr. Biden went to meet the President and First Lady at a service at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, though he said that he planned to return to the breakfast with his extended family within the hour.","President Barack Obama sworn in to second term just before noon on Sunday inside the White House .

A care home worker was today arrested on suspicion of murdering a 73-year-old resident. Father-of-two Ivan Emmanuel Campbell suffered internal injuries, possibly caused by just one fatal blow, at the private Victoria Nursing Home in Rusholme, Greater Manchester, last April. He was admitted to hospital after being found by other care home staff, but he died a day later. It was discovered that Mr Campbell had suffered a fractured rib and died from internal injuries. A Home Office post-mortem report found these injuries to be non-accidental and, after his fractured rib was discovered, it was believed they were caused by a single blow. The 34-year-old man was arrested this morning on suspicion of the murder of Campbell and in relation to another assault on a resident that happened on Tuesday last week. That incident involved staff calling police to attend a man aged 72 who had suffered a fractured rib. The member of staff is currently suspended from the home, just south of Manchester, which cares for people with complex mental health needs. It was understood that Mr Campbell was an outpatient at Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust and he was being assessed every six months by a psychiatrist. He was believed to have been suffering from mental health issues, including possible dementia. Since the original incident Greater Manchester Police has been working closely with the owner of the home and its staff, as well as Manchester City Council, the NHS, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust and the Care Quality Commission as part of the ongoing investigation. Officers: Mr Campbell had been in care at the private Victoria Nursing Home in Rusholme, Greater Manchester . Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall said: ‘Due to the complex needs of those at the care home this has and continues to be an extremely difficult and protracted investigation. ‘From the outset we were determined to establish what happened to Ivan and who was responsible for causing his injuries and that remains as true today as it did then. ‘We are continuing to work closely with partner agencies in health as well as the home and I want to reassure the relatives of residents there that their welfare is, collectively between us and our partners, a top priority.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Man, 34, also arrested in relation to another assault on a resident last week .

Locked up: Kosovan Jeton Lama has been jailed for eight years after raping a young investment banker in broad daylight in the City of London . A Kosovan refugee raped a young investment banker in broad daylight in the City of London, a court has heard. Jeton Lama, 25, stalked the 23 year-old woman as she walked home near St Paul’s Cathedral on the morning of Remembrance Sunday last year. She tried to fight him off and run to her flat but was dragged back to the doorway of a pub in an alleyway. Lama threatened to rape and kill her before forcing her to perform a sex act on him in full view of a CCTV camera. He then calmly walked off to buy a doughnut and a newspaper before getting a tube train home. Detectives arrested him three days later after tracking the use of his Oyster Card and managed to match his DNA to the scene of the attack. The victim has still not told her family what happened and said in a statement to the Old Bailey of her shock at being attacked in the street by a complete stranger. ‘Before that evening I was in a good place, I was young and happy and in some ways I feel it has changed me. ‘I am left always looking over my shoulder. I have never felt more afraid in my entire life. Sometimes it seems like an ugly horrible nightmare. ‘I tried to think what I have done wrong but I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I think maybe I should have continued walking along the main road but it never occurred to me in those moments that something like this would happen.’ The victim had only recently started a new job and was on her way home from a Saturday night out with friends at around 7am on Sunday 11 November last year. Lama followed her off the bus at St . Paul’s and started pestering her as she turned into Ludgate Hill, . telling her how he liked her hair. ‘He simply wouldn’t leave her alone as she was walking along,’ said prosecutor Neena Crinnion. ‘She was making it quite plain to him she wasn’t interested in engaging with him. She was becoming increasingly frightened and she was telling him to leave her alone but he was persisting in following her.' Horrific: The 23 year-old woman was followed by her attacker as she walked home near St Paul's Cathedral, pictured, on the morning of Remembrance Sunday last year . At one point Lama grabbed her but the victim shouted at him ‘don’t touch me, leave me alone’.She then tried to get away from him down Carter Lane but he ran after her and grabbed her, putting his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming. Lama told her: ‘If you scream I’m going to kill you. I just want to have sex with you. Stop screaming, you bitch. I’m going to f*** you so hard and then kill you.’ She tried to covertly ring 999 on her phone but he told her to put away the phone and started kissing her and groping her body under her skirt. In a desperate attempt to escape she pretended she would take him to a quiet place nearby in the hope of getting help from someone on the main road. But when he realised she was trying to trick her he pushed her into the doorway of the Rising Sun pub and demanded she perform a sexual act on him. 'I have never felt more afraid in my entire life' Following the attack, he then walked off down Ludgate Hill to . buy a doughnut and a newspaper from a newsagent before getting . the tube at Temple station. Detectives were later able to get a DNA sample from the scene. Lama was arrested on November 14 after detectives worked out his normal route of travel and stationed officers along the route. He pleaded guilty to rape in January this year and his letter of apology to the victim was given to the judge. Sentencing him to eight years in prison, judge Sasha Wass QC said: ‘The victim was a hard working, intelligent and successful, young and happy woman. Her life will never be the same again as a result of what you did to her. ‘She made it absolutely clear she had no desire to have anything to do with you. What happened to her was the worst nightmare of every woman. ‘The entire episode has been seen on CCTV and the police should be applauded for their detective work in swiftly apprehending you.’ Lama, of Pimlico, southwest London, came to the UK as a child asylum seeker in 2003 and was taken in by a foster family in Linconshire. In February last year he was fined £600 for assaulting his then girlfriend in Brighton by punching her in the face.","Jeton Lama stalked the woman as she walked near St Paul’s Cathedral .

Tragic: Landslide victim Susan Norman died in Looe, Cornwall last Friday having warned her council about the dangers two months ago . This is the grandmother who died when her home collapsed in floods, just months after she warned her council about the mortal danger her community faced should heavy rains strike. Susan Norman’s ground floor flat was . flattened last Friday as the three-storey building collapsed just before 6am after . violent downpours hit Looe, Cornwall. Tragically the mother-of-two was the only resident who did not escape. Ms Norman had previously warned Cornwall County Council about the danger and . had contributed to a 65-page dossier put together by neighbours . outlining their flood concerns. On Friday more than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage. But . Ms Norman was the only one who could not be found. Her children, Helen, Matthew and Rachael, had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm last Thursday after a long journey. They had clung to the faint hope she . was alive until authorities told them they had found Mrs . Norman’s body in the rubble. Her daughter Rachael Boden said that the . family was ‘extremely numb’. Neighbours said they heard 'windows . popping' at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of . surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building, . split into three flats. Retired police officer Pete Temlett, 59, who compiled the dossier . with local residents, said it was handed to officials in February - two . months before she died. He said the dossier outlined problems dating back over ten years . including blocked drains and poor curbing which were exposing the . building to a serious risk. Distraught: The body of Susan Norman, 68, was found after Veronica Flats in Sandplace Road, Looe, fell done in heavy rain . The council had a ten day period to respond to the residents which . they failed to meet eventually saying they would come back to them by . today. But before they responded Susan was killed and pulled from the home after a search by rescue teams and sniffer dogs. Mr Temlett said: 'The police are now investigating the dossier and . have advised us not to disclose anything from it. The council has failed . to act on information given to them. 'We put in all the evidence with photographs, letters, and e-mails received from the council. 'They refused to accept that we were vulnerable here and we even . asked them if we could be engulfed by the road above and they said they . had surveyed it and were quite happy with how things were. 'Mrs Norman did contribute to it, she told us about her concerns and . safety with water at the back of her house and the water running over. 'She had made it very clear that she had concerns for her safety in . her house as a result of the landslips that had already happened and we . were very aware of that.' Scenic: But the beautiful landscape in Cornwall was the scene of tragedy today . Investigation: Emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search . The property, named 'Veronica', is . one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer . drop to the picturesque Looe Valley railway line. Sandplace . Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed . to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas. The . road running along the back of the homes, a main road into the coastal . town of Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water which . locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared . drains. Location: The house that collapsed is in Looe, near to Plymouth in the eastern part of Cornwall . Devon and Cornwall Police say it has launched a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive. A police spokesman said: 'Work is currently on-going to make the site . safe, in order to allow further specialist examinations to take place.' Friend Edwina Hannaford described Ms . Norman as 'a happy, lovely lady'. She said: 'Susan was well-known in the . town and was an active volunteer. She was a very happy lady, very . friendly and smiley, and would always say hello. 'The . whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news, and sadly the news . that a body has been found is what we had been fearing.' Cornwall County Council said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mrs Norman. The Council is continuing to work with the police and the Health and Safety Executive to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the landslip. 'We are providing information relating to the highways and drainage systems in the area to the police and Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation.'","Susan Norman’s flat was .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:47 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:01 EST, 27 March 2013 . The British economy is heading for an unprecedented triple dip recession, experts warned today. The Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012. Poor wages and dire weather in the start of 2013 means growth is not expected to have returned. The news will pile pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who was last week forced to admit growth predictions for the whole of this year had been dramatically halved - down from 1.2 per cent to just 0.6 per cent. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in thj final quarter of 2012, with figures for the start of 2013 due in April . GDP figures for the current quarter are due to be released at the end of April, with the recent cold weather increasing the chances of two successive quarters of contraction, which would represent a return to recession. The country's stagnant performance reflects a fall in industrial production of 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter - including a 10.7 per cent slump in mining and quarrying - and the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2009. Sarah Hewin, head of research on European economies at Standard Chartered, told Sky News: ‘The real weak spots of the economy are manufacturing and construction. Employment is still rising, but wages are weak. The economy is moving ahead but there is a lot of stopping and starting. ‘We won't avoid a triple-dip recession. We are at risk, but we'll see a pick up later in the year.’ In one glimmer of good news for Mr Osborne, the ONS said it now thinks the UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent across the whole of last year, rather than previous guidance of 0.2 per cent. Household spending in the fourth quarter increased by more than previously thought, up 0.4 per cent from an earlier 0.2 per cent reading. Total disposable incomes rose by 2.1 per cent during the year as a whole, but slipped back 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Chancellor George Osborne admitted in his Budget last week that the forecast for growth in 2013 had been halved to just 0.6 per cent . IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said: ‘It looks touch and go whether the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013, and hence a 'triple-dip' recession.’ He said heavy snowfall, which has hit parts of the UK in recent days, increased the chances of another quarter of falling output. Marginal growth of 0.3 per cent in 2012 compared with 1 per cent in 2011. The figures also showed a household savings ratio of 7.1 per cent, the highest since 1997, as people choose to save rather than spend. This figure was boosted by a £20.1 billion increase in wages and salaries versus 2011. The UK's current account deficit shrunk to £14 billion in the fourth quarter - worth 3.6 per cent of GDP - from an upwardly revised £15.1 billion in the third quarter. For the year as a whole the UK's current account deficit was £57.7 billion. The trade deficit - the difference between the value of Britain's exports and imports - widened to £9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up from £8.1 billion in the previous quarter. Companies exported 1.6 per cent fewer goods in the fourth quarter, while services exports fell 1.8 per cent. Dr Archer said: ‘This export performance is really disappointing, even allowing for the problems in the eurozone and generally muted global growth, and is a blow to hopes that the economy can rebalance.’ The UK's persistent economic weakness has already led to the loss of its prized AAA rating. Former Labour trade minister Lord Digby Jones yesterday played down the idea that the atrocious weather made a triple dip recession more likely. He told BBC2’s Daily Politics: ‘""No more than it was two weeks ago [for the economy to go back into recession], it’s going to cost more people more money in power, energy gas oil electricity.’","Office for National Statistics says economy shrank by 0.3% from October to December .

Whistleblower: CQC board member Kay Sheldon says she cannot understand how some hospitals were declared safe . Hospitals with high death rates and poor care standards were registered as safe despite Britain's main health watchdog knowing there were serious failings, a whistleblower has revealed. Kay Sheldon, who is on the board of the Care Quality . Commission (CQC), said the organisation routinely ignored concerns at a number of . NHS trusts despite being set up to protect patients. The alleged whitewash came as the Mid-Staffordshire public inquiry into up to 1,200 unnecessary deaths was announced in 2010. Patients there were so neglected they forced to drink stale water from vases, sit in their own excrement for days while others were sent home with life-threatening injuries or died following routine operations. Kay Sheldon believes 'finding another Mid-Staffs had to be avoided at all costs', so the CQC decided to call potentially dangerous institutions safe as part of a cover-up. 'The Mid Staffs public inquiry was underway and it had been . said by Department of Health that Mid Staffs was a one-off and there was a real sense . that finding another Mid-Staffs had to be avoided at all costs, she told Radio 4's Today Programme. 'There were a number of hospitals where the . problems were well-known and yet they were registered as fully compliant and . subsequently inspected as fully compliant.' 'Cover up': After the scandal at Stafford General Hospital a CQC board member has said that others known to have problems were passed as safe to avoid bad publicity . Violent: What happened in Stafford, where up to 1,200 died, has caused national outrage and mass protests . Among trusts concerned, she said, was the University Hospitals and . Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust which is under police investigation . following the deaths of a number of babies. The CQC was set up under Labour in 2009 to replace three other quangos and improve standards. Yet it has been hit with many problems in its short life. Its head of the care was forced to resign with a taxpayer-funded pension pot of . £1.35million last year. Cynthia Bower (above right) agreed to leave after a damning official inquiry concluded it was not doing enough to . inspect hospitals, care homes and GP practices properly - exactly what it was set up for. The CQC has also been accused of rating hospitals as ‘good’ even though patients were dying from poor hygiene. And MPs on the health select committee said it was more obsessed with box ticking than carrying out inspections of hospitals and care homes. In 2011 the CQC annual report said it carried out 15,220 inspections in the previous year. It admitted later it was only 7,368. Weeks later it emerged that the regulator had spent millions of pounds on plush refurbishments, staff junkets, Raymond Blanc meals and, staggeringly, more than £300 on Krispy Kreme doughnuts. A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy. Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status. Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients’ lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England. Ms Sheldon said the CQC was aware of serious problems at the trust in . late 2009 and the beginning of 2010 but in April 2010 it was registered . as fully compliant. 'It just doesn't make sense. There is no way that the trust could have turned itself round in two or three months,' she said. 'It seems to me that CQC gave assurance about the trust that wasn't actually accurate. 'It was a very shocking thing to find thinking that an organisation . that's there to protect patients had effectively given what amounted to . false assurance and that meant that problems in the trust carried on . unacknowledged and unaddressed.' She claims a total of 15 hospitals were . being investigated over high mortality rates time, yet they were give a . clean bill of health. 'It does raise the question as to why those Trusts were . registered as fully compliant.  It seems that the CQC knew about the . concerns, they knew about the high mortality rates - that is something that . I’ve only just become aware of - and it concerns me greatly that  CQC had . that info and yet registered these trusts as fully compliant at the time,'  she said. Mrs Sheldon's was the Mental Health Act commissioner for 11 years and a trustee of charity Mind.

Victims: A tribute wall made by family members remains at Brakes Cafe in Stafford in memory of patients who have died at their local hospital . Damning: Robert Francis QC published a 1,700 page report with 290 recommendations following 'appalling care' at a Stafford hospital . CQC Chief executive David Behan, who took over last year, said an . independent review was under way into what happened at Morecambe Bay. 'The allegations that have been made are very serious,' he told the Today programme. 'I am absolutely committed that CQC will be an open and transparent . organisation. We will publish this report and we will be accountable for . the work that we do.' A CQC spokesman added: 'We are changing the way we inspect hospitals and making other changes to the way we work. These include strengthening the board and senior management team, for example by recruiting a chief inspector of hospitals, a chief inspector of social care and a chief inspector of primary care to lead our inspections. 'The matters Kay Sheldon have raised are not new and have been reported and discussed internally and externally. CQC is committed to being an open and transparent organisation, focussed on making sure health and social care services provide people with high quality care that they have a right to expect of health and care services.'","Whistleblower Kay Sheldon says failing hospitals were hidden from public .

Prosecutors said Monday that they won't charge a Texas couple in the death of a 3-year-old adopted boy from Russia, a case that has become the latest flashpoint in the debate over whether American families should be allowed to adopt Russian children. Ector County District Attorney Bobby Bland said his office would not charge Alan and Laura Shatto in the Jan. 21 death of Max Alan Shatto, who was born Maxim Kuzmin. 'The grand jury determined there was insufficient evidence to charge them with anything,' Bland said at a news conference. Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident . Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January . Laura Shatto told authorities she . found Max unresponsive outside their Gardendale, Texas, home while he . was playing with his younger brother, Ector County Sheriff Mark . Donaldson has said. The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital a short . time later. Preliminary autopsy results indicated Shatto had bruises on . several parts of his body, though four doctors reviewing the final . autopsy result ruled his death to be accidental. Bland, the top prosecutor in Ector . County, about 350 miles west of Dallas, previously said that the bruises . on Max's body appeared to be self-inflicted, and that no drugs were . found in Max's system. Russian authorities and state-run . media have blamed the Shattos for Max's death and used the case as . justification for a recently enacted ban on all American adoptions of . Russian children. Parents: The boy's adoptive parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . Russia's Investigative Committee has said it has . opened its own investigation. It's unclear whether the committee could . charge the Shatto family or force their prosecution. U.S. State Department officials and adoption agency advocates have called for caution. The Russian government passed the ban . in December in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering resentment over . the perceived mistreatment of some of the 60,000 children Americans . have adopted over the last two decades. At least 20 of those children . have died, and reports of abuse have garnered attention in Russia. Outrage: Demonstrators hold portraits of adopted Russian children who have died in the U.S., during a massive rally in Moscow . Protests: This woman holds a sign that reads 'Juvenile judiciary. Give us parents back!' Demonstrators walked along Moscow streets to support the new law prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by Americans . Rally: Activists from pro-Kremlin children's advocacy groups march through Moscow, demanding the return of an adopted boy whose brother, Max Shatto, died in Texas . Keeping mum: The driveway to the Shatto family home, rear left, is seen in Gardendale, Texas, with a sign that reads: 'No Comment' Foreign Ministry official Konstantin . Dolgov has called Max's death 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a . Russian child adopted by American parents.' Texas Child Protective Services . spokesman Patrick Crimmins said the agency was investigating allegations . that Max was subject to physical abuse and neglect but had not . determined whether those allegations were true. The agency that . processed the Shattos' adoption, the Gladney Center for Adoption in Fort . Worth, was cleared in a separate state investigation to find out . whether it followed all guidelines. The Shattos adopted Max and his . biological half-brother, 2-year-old Kristopher, from the same orphanage . in western Russia. Since Max's death, Kristopher has remained with his . adoptive parents. Russian state media have interviewed the . boys' biological mother, Yulia Kuzmina, who lost custody over . negligence and serious drinking problems. Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . In a tightly choreographed Feb. 21 . interview on state television, Kuzmina insisted that Russian custody . officials seized her children unfairly and said that she wanted to be . reunited with her other son, born Kirill Kuzmin. She said she had given . up drinking, found a job and pledged to fight to get the boy back. Russian President Vladimir Putin's . spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said it is necessary 'to temper emotions' over the case, and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has called . for 'sensational exploitations of human tragedy to end and for . professional work between our two countries to grow, on this issue and . many others.' Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an . investigation into the little boy's death.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 16 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:08 EST, 16 April 2012 . Over the past few weeks, much has been written and remembered about the Titanic, which famously sank exactly one hundred years ago yesterday. But while the story the hubris surrounding Titanic has been told again and again, not so much has been said about its nemesis - the iceberg that sent it to a watery grave. These pictures, taken after the Titanic sank, show what is quite possibly the only photographic evidence of the ice floe that caused the tragedy. Ancient: This photo of the iceberg that sank the Titanic was taken by the chief steward of the German ocean liner SS Prinz Adalbert just hours after the tragedy. Its identity was confirmed by a red streak of paintwork scraped across its base, an indication that it had collided with a vessel in the past 12 hours or so . The first was taken by the chief steward of SS Prinz Adalbert, a German liner, which sailed through the North Atlantic on April 15 just miles from where the Titanic sank the night before. He recorded seeing a streak of red paint smeared across the base of the floe - indicating that it was likely it had collided with a ship in the past 12 hours. The next photo was taken by Captain De Carteret of the Minia, a cable laying vessel which raced to the scene of the shipwreck to recover corpses and debris. According to the Minia's records, it was the only iceberg in the area. He also noticed the red scar along the base - a clear sign it was the culprit for the Titanic's ignominious end. That iceberg began its slow journey to . the North Atlantic over three throusand years ago - making it a rough . contemporary of Egyptian King Tutankhamun. The . exact details can only be a matter for speculation, but io9.com reports . that it likely began with snowfall on the Western coast of Greenland . somewhere around 1,000BC. As . months passed, this snow gradually turned into a more compacted form - . known as firn - which over subsequent decades was compressed into dense . ice as new layers of fresh snow fell on top. Massive: Captain De Carteret of the cable laying vessel Minia captured this shot of the iceberg as it sped to the scene to help with the Titanic recovery. It likely began life some 30 centuries ago - around the time of King Tutankhamun - as a blizzard on Greenland's tundra solidified to form glaciers . Hundreds of generations passed and entire civilisations rose and fell as this ill-fated ice was slowly forced further west towards the sea. Finally reaching Greenland's Arctic Ocean coast, the lapping tide began breaking away chunks of the glacier and the infamous iceberg was calved - thirty centuries after first freezing. But after it finally fell into the sea, the iceberg's life was a short one, io9.com reports. In . order to reach the spot in the North Atlantic where the Titanic met its . fate, currents must have taken the floe far south from where it was . calved. From the Greenland . coast, it would have floated on the currents from Baffin Bay to the . Davis Strait, onto the Labrador Sea and then finally into the Atlantic. Catastrophe: An undated artist's impression shows the chaos and confusion of the Titanic disaster. Water temperature that night is thought to have been 2.2C - lethal to anyone pitched into the sea . Watery grave: The prow of the Titanic seen from a Mir submarine 12,500ft beneath the North Atlantic Ocean . Remains: A white crab scampers near the remains of a coat and boots lying in the mud on the sea bed near Titanic's stern . By April 15, 2012, the date of the Titanic disaster, the iceberg was some 5,000 miles south of the Arctic Circle. That night, the water temperature was estimated at about 28F (2.2C) - lethal for anyone unlucky enough to find themselves plunged into it but far too warm to sustain icebergs for long. The life-expectancy of an iceberg in the North Atlantic is about two or three years from calving to melting. This means, according to io9, that it is likely the Titanic iceberg broke off from Greenland in 1910 or 1911 and was gone for ever by 1913 at the latest.","Pictures taken from passing ships just hours after the sinking of the ill-fated ocean liner .

A new Victoria's Secret slogan for its PINK line has sparked a backlash from parents who believe it is targeting teenagers rather than college age students. The Bright Young Things campaign was launched to tie in with Spring Break, however many understood it to be a brand new collection aimed at tweens and teens. Parents took to the Victoria's Secret Facebook page to complain, accusing the lingerie giant of 'sexualizing our daughters' and 'making it hard to raise wholesome children'. Scroll down for video . Too sexy for teens? Victoria's Secret's Bright Young Things campaign for its PINK collection has sparked anger from parents who understand it to be for middle schoolers . There is even a petition demanding that the advertising campaign be withdrawn and that the Bright Young Things line not target teenagers at all. This afternoon, Victoria's Secret responded to the complaints with a statement on its Facebook page, insisting that it has no plans to launch a line for college-age women. 'In response to questions we recently . received, Victoria’s Secret PINK is a brand for college-aged women,' it read. 'Despite recent rumors, we have no plans to introduce a collection for . younger women. '""Bright Young Things"" was a slogan used in conjunction . with the college spring break tradition.' The level of anger surrounding the rumored line was huge though, with hundreds of parents threatening to boycott the chain. One commenter wrote: 'You are selling out a generation of young women to make a buck with your . ""Bright Young Things"" line. It is irresponsible and disgusting to . market that level of sexually suggestive items to girls. As an adult, I . will no longer be shopping in your store.' Promotional opportunity: The Bright Young Things campaign was launched to tie in with Spring Break . Another wrote: 'You already do enough to undermine real woman's and young ladies self esteem - now you want further sexualize our daughters [sic].' And one women admitted to being a longtime fan of the brand, yet refuses to shop there any longer. 'I have shopped . regularly at Victoria's Secret for a decade and will no longer be . supporting your business,' she wrote. 'It's a shame because I love your product, but I . cannot support a company that seeks to sexualize children.' 'I love your product, but I . cannot support a company that seeks to sexualize children' A petition also seeks to stop the lingerie giant targeting teens. In a letter on ForceChange.org to Victoria's Secret CEO Lori Greeley, it is accused of hiring 'younger looking teen . models who are scantily clad and provocatively posed'. It also objects to the slogan . 'Bright Young Things' because it 'refers to young women as ""things.""' It read: 'By choosing to target teenagers with your new . line, you are condoning teen sexuality and portraying teens as sexual . objects.' While Victoria's Secret says that it targets college age women and above only, it does not deny that it appeals to a younger market. Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer said at a conference recently: 'When somebody's 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? They want to be older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that's part of the magic of what we do at Pink.' Debate: The level of anger surrounding the rumored line was huge, with hundreds of parents threatening to boycott the chain on its Facebook page . And indeed some parents find the backlash ridiculous. Mother Marina Jones says that she chooses to buy her young girls Victoria's Secret, and that Justice underwear is far more inappropriate, with slogans such as 'Wild Thing' and 'Party Animal'. 'My kids, yes kids, wear your bras and underwear,' she wrote on the Victoria's Secret Facebook page. 'The fact that parents are letting their . daughters shop at Victoria's Secret is not any fault of the store' 'Yes, this is my choice to put my 14 and 12 year old in undergarments that fit them! I buy the Pink age appropriate items. They have been in your undies for a few years now and I think it is ridiculous, that people are pitching a fix over your new line!' And an Illinois-based employee of Victoria's Secret also defended the brand, adding that Bright Young Things is 'simply the slogan for the spring break line...it is not a line for middle schoolers. She added that it was up to parents to decide whether their daughters shop at Victoria's Secret, and not the responsibility of the retailer. 'The fact that parents are letting their daughters shop at VS is not any fault of VS,' she wrote. 'Besides, not all of the items are risque... It's a matter of being a parent and making sure your daughter doesn't buy the underwear that says 'Feeling Lucky' on the butt when she's 12...' Earlier this month, a conservative mommy blogger shocked fellow parents by admitting that she has no problem with her nine-year-old shopping at Victoria's Secret. Sparking debate: Mommy blogger Jenny Erikson, from San Diego, California, wrote that she has no problem with daughter Hannah, nine, wearing Victoria's Secret underwear . Jenny Erikson, from San Diego, California, sparked fierce debate on parenting site The Stir, when wrote that she didn't want daughter Hannah 'to be the girl with the ugly underwear' at camp or slumber parties. She later told Good Morning America: 'I don't think there's anything wrong with having cute panties and bras . from the big girl store.' But many other mothers took issue with her decision, arguing that the lingerie giant is 'too sexy', 'not intended for children', and that Mrs Erikson is at risk of oversexualizing the youngster at too young an age. One commenter on the GMA website wrote: 'It's one thing to get your daughter cute, bright colored, fun . underthings, but Victoria's Secret is geared for sexy, not cute.'

Mugshot: The photograph of the 'guilty' iceberg was taken two days before the sinking of the Titanic . Experts believe it is the ‘guilty’ one due to its unusual shape, which matches sketches and eyewitness descriptions of the iceberg which fatally collided with the ‘unsinkable’ vessel on April 14, 1912, killing 1,502 people. The black and white picture of the floating ice berg is set to make $8,000-$10,000 (£5,016 - £6,270). Through the years a number of photographs have been claimed to depict the one which sealed the fate of the famous vessel, but experts say this one is the definite mugshot. Titanic expert Stanley Lehrer said: ‘In my professional judgement this iceberg is the one that sunk the Titanic.’ 'Victim': The Titanic leaving Southampton on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912, four days before the fatal collision with the iceberg . ‘Within the past two years, I discovered a photograph that had been taken by Captain Wood of the S.S.

Fictional witnesses: Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater in the 1997 film 'Titanic' ‘The captain took the pictures because he was fascinated with the unusual shape of the iceberg. 'This particular iceberg had an ellipse on the top right of the iceberg.' A handwritten caption, scrawled directly onto the developed picture states the coordinates of the iceberg as 'Latitude 410 0 W Long 490 50 N' - not far from the widely documented position where Titanic sunk. The caption scribbled on the photo reads: ‘Blueberg taken by Captain Good S. S. Etonian on 12/4/12 in Lat 410 50 W Long 490 50 N. Titanic struck 14/4/12 and sank in three hours.""

Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says he was driving to the bank in Macomb Township on March 16th  when he discovered the baby's frantic father on the side of the road, signaling him to stop. Pulling his car to the side, the troubled man, who appeared to speak only a little English, immediately handed him a phone already connected to 911. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unexpected: Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says it was the child's father standing on the side of the road waving for help that led him to find the woman who had just given birth on the side of the road . Saved: The college student did exactly as police dispatch told him to do, gently tilting the baby's head back and performing CPR, which got this little girl breathing . Looking inside the car, Mr Cornelissen discovered the man's wife and his newborn daughter who didn't appear to be breathing. 'Something’s wrong with his wife, he doesn’t speak very good English. He stopped me on the side of the road,' Mr Cornelissen is heard saying in the 911 call obtained by WDIV. Looking inside the car he says he saw the woman seated in the front seat with a blanket. Also with her, the head of a newborn baby girl. 'She just had a baby,' Mr Cornelissen calmly tells police as a woman's cries are heard behind him. 'She just had a baby?' dispatch asks. 'Yeah,' he answers. What happened next, however, took a lot more from him than just pulling over and talking to 911. Realizing the baby wasn't breathing, dispatch informed him that he'd have to perform CPR. Help: It was on the road that Mr Cornelissen discovered the father and his wife needing help for their baby who wasn't breathing . Relief: The baby is pictured shortly after with her mother in the hospital, a stay that will last several weeks as she improves . Mr Cornelissen, a man who weighs 290lbs and played football in high school, was told to take the baby’s tiny head in his hands - a child weighing a mere 3lbs, 8oz - and do exactly as they instructed. 'Tilt its head back just a little, but not too much, OK? ... You're going to cover the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth,' a dispatcher instructs him. 'I did the second breath and I stepped back and he goes, ""is the baby breathing?"" I said no. And then all of a sudden the baby made a crying face.' 'Yes!' Mr Cornelissen is heard exclaiming in the phone call. 'I remember the face to a T,' he later said before making a scrunched up wailing face and then smiling. 'That was the face. I swear to God. That was the face. It was awesome.' The baby is said to be doing fine but will have to stay in the hospital for several weeks. In the meantime the baby's parents have already welcomed Mr Cornelissen into their home and say they hope he'll stay in their little girl's life. Meeting: Mr Cornelissen meets the baby's father for the first time, in an emotional reunion the father says he hopes won't be the first .

Peter Madoff showed some real chutzpah by going to his daughter’s lavish bat mitzvah yesterday after his family pleaded with a judge to delay his 10-year prison sentence. The brother of shamed Ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff was pictured by the New York Post attending his granddaughter’s bat mitzvah at a posh synagogue in Midtown Manhattan. Peter was sentenced to join his brother in prison on December 10, but because of desperate pleas from rabbis and family, . Brazen: Brother of convicted Ponzi king Bernard Madoff, 67-year-old Peter Madoff, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on December 20 but was at his daughter's bat mitzvah yesterday . Coming of age: His granddaughter's bat mitzvah was held at Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan . According to the New York Post, which exclusively reported the details of the Madoff’s last hurrah, said that the 67-year-old grandfather was greatly enjoying himself and socialized with friends and family eating bagels and lox. The bat mitzvah, celebrating the traditional Jewish coming of age, was for his granddaughter Rebecca Skoller. Ms Skoller read passages from the Torah during the ceremony, and then joined her grandfather and more than 100 guests for food and fun. Madoff pleaded guilty to his role in the world’s biggest and most devastating Ponzi scheme on June 29, 2012, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison on December 20. In addition to his impending incarceration, the 67-year-old agreed to forfeit up to $146billion of his assets. His older brother is currently serving out a 150-year sentence. Peter Madoff admitted to, among other things, engaging in money transfers meant to avoid taxes, putting his wife on payroll for a job she never worked, and committing wire and mail fraud. Kin: Madoff's daughter, Shana Madoff Swanson, an attorney, pictured with Rebecca Skoller, Madoff's granddaughter . Forbes reports that Madoff has requested to do his time at Otisville Prison Camp, a medium security prison that was named by the magazine was one of America’s top 10 ‘cushiest prisons.’ But before Madoff swears off suits for prison-sanctioned sweats, he is expected to continue celebrating his granddaughter’s coming-of-age at an event space in Midtown West. The location, 404 NYC, offers thousands of square feet for dancing and feasting. A source told the Post that a celebration like a bat or bar mitzvah could cost upwards of $75,000. Victims of the Madoff brothers were outraged to hear that the convicted Ponzi schemer was still enjoying the good life while many of them had lost their life savings. ‘I would much prefer that Peter Madoff be locked up and the only way he can attend the bat mitzvah is through pictures sent to him in prison,’ 62-year-old Michael DeVita told the Post. Mr DeVit was one of thousands who lost his retirement assets to the scam. At the time of his conviction, Peter Madoff said that he was ‘deeply ashamed and terribly sorry’ but he didn’t know about the scam until his brother revealed it in December 2008, in the heyday of the housing crisis. Guilty: Convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff is currently serving out a 150-year sentence . He worked alongside his brother for more than 40 years. Close to $20billion vanished in the scam, the Associated Press reported, making the Madoff scam the largest Ponzi scheme in the U.S. The scheme left behind only a few hundred million dollars, not the $65billion claimed in bogus financial statements. Madoff revealed in court that he agreed to assist his brother Bernie in sending out the only money left to favored people, including friends and family. Peter Madoff was credited with creating a computer trading system for the firm in the late 1970s and early 1980s that was considered groundbreaking at the time. He ran the daily trading operation while his brother focused on the more secretive investment advisory arm. Both brothers made a fortune. Peter Madoff owned a vacation house in Palm Beach, Florida that recently sold for $5.5million.","Peter Madoff, 67, spotted at synagogue in Manhattan celebrating granddaughter's bat mitzvah in lavish ceremony .

Age has finally caught up with Dame Edna  Everage – and she is retiring. Barry Humphries, the man behind the glittery glasses, has announced that his character is setting out on her final tour. And the Australian housewife won’t be alone in her retirement as Humphries’s other alter ego, the obnoxious Sir Les Patterson, will be joining her. Bowing out: Dame Edna, pictured here bringing her own unique style to Dick Whittington at the New Wimbledon Theatre last Christmas, is retiring after more than 50 years in the business . Hats off to you: Dame Edna's creator Barry Humphries, seen here after being made a CBE for services to entertainment, says he wants to move on to do other things . ‘I’m feeling a bit senior now and it’s time to move on,’ Humphries, who is 78, said yesterday. The comedian’s upcoming tour will be the last time Dame Edna and Sir Les will be seen on stage, although their creator admitted: ‘Edna will crop up on television, I guess, but not in a live show.’ He said: ‘The fact of the matter  is that I’m beginning to feel a bit  senior. It’s the best aerobics you could do, leaping around on stage, but  it’s gruelling when there are other things to do.’ Dame Edna was created in the 1950s when Humphries was a young actor touring southern Australia. Sir Les Patterson burst on to the scene later, cursing and spitting his way through his first stage show in 1974. He was a dramatic contrast to Dame Edna with his nose-picking, belching and flatulence, but was an immediate hit with her fans. Fast and fabulous!

By the 1980s, Dame Edna had evolved from a drab housewife from Melbourne’s working class suburb of Moonee Ponds to an international star who hosted her own talk show. Celebrities including Sean Connery, Chubby Checker, Charlton Heston, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mel Gibson and Dusty Springfield appeared on The Dame Edna Experience. She became known for her glasses, her lilac curls, her ‘Hello possums!’ greeting and her ‘gladdies’ – the bunch of gladioli that she threw to the audience at the end of her live shows. Humphries’s characters have been such a hit in Britain that he was made a CBE in 2007 for services to entertainment. In the U.S., he won  the Tony award for best special theatrical event in 2000 for Dame Edna: The Royal Tour. Bond-ing with the stars: Dame Edna with 007 legend Sean Connery in 1987 .

And although Dame Edna’s upcoming farewell tour only covers Australia at the moment, British fans may also get the chance to say their goodbyes. Humphries said that if the show is a success in Australia, he will take it to London and New York. Entitled Eat Pray Laugh, the show is about a journey, he added. Providing a few clues as to what audiences can expect, he said: ‘Les has become a celebrity chef. We’ll have a kitchen on stage and Les working away, clearly preparing a meal for political colleagues. ‘Edna, of course, will be discussing her spiritual journey. She’s on a journey to find herself, to lose the trappings of mega-stardom and become a real person.’ There will also be an appearance from Humphries’s favourite character, Sandy Stone.

Britain's inability to deport hate preacher Abu Qatada shows the controversial Human Rights Act is ‘working’, a senior Liberal Democrat minister has claimed. In an astonishing intervention, Justice Minister Lord McNally said the legal protection given to the man once dubbed Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe was ‘part of what makes us a civilised society’. His comments came as the Government made a fresh attempt to deport the 52-year-old radical preacher, who is facing trial in his native Jordan for terrorism offences. Intervention: Minister of State for Justice Lord McNally, pictured left, claims the legal protection preventing the deportation of radical cleric Abu Qatada, pictured right, is what makes Britain a 'civilised society' Home Office lawyers said he was a ‘truly dangerous individual’ whose views ‘encompass the legitimacy of attacking people in the UK’. The seven-year bid to deport Qatada, who claimed asylum in Britain in 1993, has cost taxpayers more than £500,000 in legal aid alone. Tory critics, including David Cameron and Theresa May frequently highlight his case as evidence that the Government should scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act, or even withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. But Lord McNally said people should be ‘reassured’ by the fact that even terror suspects like Qatada were protected by the law. He told BBC Radio Five’s Pienaar’s Politics show: ‘The fact is, in my mind, if the Human Rights Act occasionally comes in favour of somebody who is not very likeable in terms of what they have done or who they are... that to me is a reassurance, that if even he is given the protection of our law and Human Rights Act then all the more the rest of us are going to be protected by it as well. Legal battle: The seven-year bid to deport Muslim cleric Abu Qatada has so far cost taxpayers more than £500,000 in legal aid . ‘The law is there to protect us all and . sometimes it protects those least worthy of its protection, but the fact . its protection is there is part of what makes us a civilised society.’ Asked about calls for the Human Rights Act to be scrapped he added: ‘If . it’s working, why try and fix it? I don’t see the great travesties being . done.’ Tory MP Peter Bone last night condemned Lord McNally’s . ‘offensive’ comments. Mr Bone said: ‘He is completely wrong. It is quite extraordinary that we should have a justice minister who . holds these views, which many people will find offensive. Lord McNally argued that the public should be 'reassured' that everyone is protected by the law . ‘We should be putting Qatada on a plane tonight and worrying about the legal consequences later - that is what the vast majority of British people want us to do. The only people supporting him are terrorists, rich barristers and the Liberal Democrats. ‘The fact that we have a justice minister who holds these views just confirms my fears that we are in coalition with a bunch of clowns.’ The row came as lawyers for the Home Secretary asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a decision to allow Qatada to remain in the UK. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) decided last November that Qatada could not lawfully be deported to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999.Siac judges ruled there was a ‘real risk’ that evidence obtained by torture, could be used against him in a retrial in Jordan. He was released from prison subject to a 22-hour curfew regime. The security bill for monitoring him is estimated at £100,000 per week. James Eadie QC, appearing for Mrs May yesterday, said the decision could not stand because Siac had taken an ‘erroneous’ view of the position in Jordan. Mr Eadie said the evidence was that ‘Jordanian law prohibits clearly and expressly the use of torture and the reliance on any statement obtained under duress, including torture’. Lawyers for Qatada said the appeal should be refused as Mrs May’s legal advice was wrong and there was a genuine risk that confessions obtained by torture would be used against their client. The appeal came three days after Qatada was arrested for breaching bail conditions. The court was told he had been detained after mobile phones and communication devices were found in his home as part of an ongoing Metropolitan Police investigation. Reserving judgment, Lord Dyson said the court would take time to consider its decision.","Justice Minister Lord McNally said the legal protection preventing Abu Qatada's deportation is 'part of what makes us a civilised society'

A Titanic enthusiast has built an exact replica of the doomed liner - out of old clockwork and broken VCRs. Jason King, 40, spent two and a half years meticulously crafting the nine-foot model out of scrap materials, which now sits in his study. Every minute detail of the vessel has . been replicated - on a 1:100 scale - right down to the rigging and . number of deck benches. Ship builder: Jason King with his replica Titanic which took him 25 hours a week over more than two years . Exact replica: The Titanic sits in Jason's study. He has had a number of offers for it, but want his children to 'cherish it' Ship shell: The hull's shape was formed from scrap wood. Every minute detail of the nine-foot vessel has been replicated - on a 1:100 scale - right down to the rigging and number of deck benches . And spookily, Jason finished the model on the anniversary of the ships sinking - April 15, marking 100 years since it sank. The father of two - Thomas, 9, and six-year-old Matthew - from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, spent £2,500 a materials for his labour of love. He said: 'It certainly kept me out of the wife’s [Nicola]  way for a while, so she was quite pleased. 'It’s a part of the furniture now. I want it to become a family heirloom for my kids to cherish.' Jason, who works for an engineering firm, bought over 150 books on . the ship so he could  meticulously research every last detail to make sure his . model was inch perfect. Big paint job: Jason put the model in his garden when he sprayed the liner. He finished work on it on April 15, the 100th anniversary of the sinking . Meticulous: The funnels, deck houses, fittings, masts and lifeboats were all built from scratch by Jason who researched the project to ensure every detail was correct . Luxury liner: Jason spent £2,500 on materials to build the doomed ship which was on its maiden voyage when it hit an iceberg . But he admitted: 'It was a bit of trial and error. I had built some models before of the Titanic, but nothing as big as this. 'I didn’t want to build a model this size and skimp on anything. So I did a lot of research, looking at old pictures to make sure everything was correct. 'Most people would not even notice the detail, but I wanted to make sure that no one could pick holes in it.' Jason estimates he spent a staggering 25 hours a week working on the model. Attention to detail: Jason bought over 150 books on the ship to make sure he included every detail from deck benches to funnels and walkways . Doomed ship: The model includes the lifeboats. There were not enough for all the passengers and crew when Titanic hit the iceberg . Labour of love: Jason spent two-and-a-half years making the model and has turned down offers worth thousands of pounds to buy it . And since completing it he has already received offers in the thousands to snap it up, but rebuffed them all. Jason, who has previously built a smaller Titanic and a replica of the ship as a wreck, said: 'Once I finished it, the first thought on my mind was to sit back and enjoy it. 'I won’t say never to selling it, but having sold two previously I just want to enjoy this one. 'It took exactly two and a half years to make working pretty much every day. It shows that if you put your mind to something you can achieve it.' He added: 'The model definitely has the wow factor. People are blown away by the scale and level of detail when they see it.' At 11.40pm on the night of 14 April 1912, the doomed Titanic stuck and iceberg. It was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York when disaster struck - sinking less than 3 hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, almost two-thirds of the people on board. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. Operated by the White Star Line, she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Sunk: The passenger ship Titanic which hit an iceberg as it sailed to New York, claiming the lives of more than 1,500 people . Captained by Edward Smith, her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants seeking a new life in North America. The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she only had lifeboats for 1,178 people – slightly more than half of the number travelling. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm. The glancing collision caused Titanic's hull plates to buckle inwards in a number of locations on her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea. Over the next two hours and forty minutes, the ship gradually filled with water and foundered around 2:20 AM. Passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially filled. A disproportionate number of men – over 90 per cent of those in Second Class – were left aboard because of a 'women and children first' protocol followed by the officers loading the lifeboats. Many of those in the water died within minutes from hypothermia. Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.","Jason King spent 25 hours a week making an exact replica .

Virgin trains are to continue running on the West Coast mainline until 2017, five years after Sir Richard Branson was supposed to lose the right to operate Britain’s biggest stretch of track. Ministers today admitted they have torn up the timetable for awarding a dozen lucrative franchises after unearthing systemic failures in the way multi-billion pound bidding competitions were handled. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin also revealed plans to put the East Coast main line back into private hands, after it was nationalised by the Labour government in 2009. Scroll down to watch the Transport Secretary's Commons speech . More delays: In an attempt to finally get a grip on the multi-billion bidding process to run Britain's railways, it was announced Virgin trains are to run the West Coast line until 2017 . Unveiling an overhauled franchise process today, Mr McLoughlin confirmed a series of delays to stop a repeat of the debacle over the West Coast line. The contest to run South Eastern services has been put back from April 2014 to June 2018 while the Great Western franchise, run by FirstGroup and due to end in October this year, will not start until July 2016. The Northern franchise, due to end in April 2014, will not begin until February 2016. The first of the new franchises to start will be Essex Thameside, where the franchise ends in May this year and will begin in September 2014. Details of the new franchise timetable reveal a string of delays . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin put the brakes on the entire contracts process after discovering 'significant flaws' The decision-making process about . which firms run the nation’s railways were plunged into chaos last . summer when ministers announced that Virgin had lost the West Coast . franchise. FirstGroup was awarded the £13billion, 13-year deal in August but Virgin launched a legal challenge. As . officials prepared for the High Court proceedings, ‘significant . technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed. In . particular major mistakes were made in the use of inflation and . passenger numbers, with different firms given different data. Three . civil servants were suspended and the deal was halted. With taxpayers facing a compensation bill of up to £100million, Mr McLoughlin initially asked Sir Richard to continue running services until early 2014 but today the government admitted a new operator will not now take over until 2017. It was the chaos surrounding the West Coast deal which triggered two independent reviews - one on the West Coast fiasco and the other on the whole franchise process. Rail minister Simon Burns said he was confident the new contest would be 'cock-up free'. He told BBC News: 'We have learnt the lessons of past mistakes with the West Coast Mainline and so that we can move forward.' Passenger Focus chief executive . Anthony Smith said: 'The time for passenger power has come. For too long passengers have been the passive recipients of major decisions made on their behalf behind closed doors. 'The voice of the user - and main funder - of the railways should be radically boosted in a process that needs to be opened up to scrutiny. We are going to work with Government to make this a reality.' Today's announcement is the direct result of the reviews and effectively sets the franchise process back on track. Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow . transport secretary, said: 'The full scale of the chaos caused by the . Government’s rail franchising fiasco has now been revealed with almost . every contract delayed by up to a staggering fifty months. 'Ministers have still not come clean . about the full extent of the losses facing taxpayers as a result of this . scandal, despite many industry experts putting the likely cost at well . over £100 million and a series of legal disputes yet to be settled.' The announcement is a fresh boost for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin trains, just months after being told it had lost the bidding war . In a statement to MPs, Mr McLoughlin . said: ‘This programme is a major step in delivering tangible . improvements to services, providing long-term certainty to the market . and supporting our huge programme of rail investment. ‘Above . all, in future franchise competitions we are placing passengers in the . driving seat by ensuring that their views and satisfaction levels are . taken into account when deciding which companies run our railway . services. The move to return the East Coast mainline to private hands ends the modern experiment in the government running services for the first time since the privatisation of British Rail. In . 2009 National Express walked away from the East Coast Main Line . franchise, and the Labour government took control of services. A new government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways, was created and has run the services ever since. It recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £7.1 million in 2011-12. In the four weeks to August 19, 93 per cent of East Coast trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011. The four-hour Flying Scotsman express . service from Edinburgh to London (pictured) was reinstated and extra services to . Lincoln and Harrogate were introduced. The . apparent success of the state-running of services caused the RMT . transport union to call for the same to happen on the West Coast line. DOR overhauled the East Coast timetable, introducing almost 20 new weekday services. But ministers have now announced it will be run by a private company from February 2015. ‘Franchising has . been a force for good in the story of Britain's railways, transforming . an industry that was in decline into one that today carries record . numbers of passengers.’ In a surprise move, the government hopes to put the East Coast line back in private hands in less than two years. The line - a key London to Scotland . route - has been run under the control of the Department for Transport . since November 2009 after transport company National Express pulled out. Mr . McLoughlin announced the ‘immediate start of the competition’ for the . East Coast franchise with an expected start of service by the new . operator in February 2015. Rail . unions reacted with dismay to the East Coast news, pointing out that . the private sector had twice given up the franchise, with GNER pulling . out some years ago. They . also highlighted the fact that the taxpayer is likely to have to foot a . bill as high as £50 million over the botched West Coast franchise. RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: ‘Despite wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on the franchising circus, and instead of learning the lessons of the privatisation disasters on the East and West Coast main lines and across the rest of the network, the Government has this morning given the green light to a whole new wave of profiteering that will have the train companies laughing all the way to the bank. ‘The proposed reprivatisation of the East Coast, after the public sector rescued the service following two private failures, proves conclusively that the political class have learnt absolutely nothing when it comes to our railways. ‘This is a politically-inspired wrecking move designed to flog off this publicly-owned intercity route before the next election regardless of the consequences.’ Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail . union, said: ‘The Tories are just like the Bourbons when it comes to . rail - they ignore all the lessons of history. ‘The . £50 million West Coast line fiasco revealed that private franchises are . a shambles. So they go and privatise the only successful publicly-owned . franchise, the East Coast line. ‘This . is an act of political spite to reward their friends in the City and to . tie the hands of an incoming Labour government in 2015. The most . expensive rail network in Europe is about to get even more expensive.’ The West Coast debacle pitted Virgin Trains against FirstGroup against each other, with Virgin emerging as the main beneficiary of the delays to awarding the £13boillion contract . TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady, who chairs the Action for Rail campaign said: 'This decision defies all logic. Since returning to public ownership the East Coast Mainline has flourished with passenger numbers and customer satisfaction increasing and all profits re-invested back into improving the service. 'The government, however, is not interested in evidence-based policy and is once again putting the interests of private companies and shareholders before those of commuters and taxpayers. 'This is privatisation for privatisation’s sake, as ministers steadfastly ignore what is best for the rail industry and the people who work on it and use it.'","Decision on who will run West Coast services delayed until 2017, says Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin .

Art specialist Harriet Wheeler wanted to exchange a £2,000 jacket, which was an unwanted gift, but instead she was detained by police for seven hours . When Harriet Wheeler was given a £2,000 Mulberry jacket by a generous male friend, she faced an awkward dilemma. Beautiful though it was, she felt it did not suit her. Not wanting to upset her friend by telling him, she took the black quilted leather jacket back to Mulberry's flagship store in London and asked whether she could exchange it for something else. There the ancient art specialist found herself handcuffed, arrested and marched off to a police cell on suspicion of handling stolen or fake goods. To make matters worse, her friend was dragged into the row when he was telephoned as part of the criminal inquiry. Now police have decided there is no case to answer, and have told Miss Wheeler, 25, she can collect her jacket from them. But there are still questions about its origins as Mulberry insists that it may not be the genuine article. Miss Wheeler is mortified that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she didn't like his gift, and is furious that Mulberry has not apologised. She insists the explanation is simple. Unbeknown to her, her friend had bought the jacket direct from the East . London manufacturer. That meant she was not entitled to a refund or exchange from Mulberry but she had no idea of that when she arrived at the shop. Mortified: Miss Wheeler is humiliated that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she didn't like his gift, and is furious that Mulberry has not apologised . She said Mulberry staff believed only . six of the jackets had been made. One, a size 8 like hers, had been . stolen from the store, leaving them fearing she was trying to exchange . stolen goods. Last night Miss Wheeler, who works for . an antiquities firm specialising in Egyptian, Greek and Roman coins, . told how the drama unfolded last week. 'My friend is a generous person, and . when he gave me the jacket I thought it was beautiful – but it didn't . suit me,' she said from her home in Wandsworth, South London. Miss Wheeler had been given the expensive black leather jacket by a friend, but wanted to return it . 'I didn't want my friend to know I was . trying to exchange it, but after a couple of months I phoned Mulberry . to talk about the jacket, and decided to go into the New Bond Street . store. 'It took ages for it to be sorted out. The store manager kept telling me it wouldn't be much longer. Eventually the police walked in. 'I didn't know what was going on and . when the police officer said I was under arrest for handling stolen . goods I was in shock. Then she whacked the handcuffs on me. I was so . upset, I was in a mess.' Miss Wheeler said that after waiting . an hour for a patrol car to turn up, she was 'paraded' down New Bond . Street in her handcuffs on the way to a police station. 'It was so humiliating,' she said. 'I . was left in a cell for four or five hours and when I asked how long it . would be they replied, ""How long is a piece of string? You could be . looking at staying overnight"". 'Then hours later a detective breezed . in and said they had got hold of my friend, who was on holiday in . Barbados, and he corroborated my story that the jacket wasn't stolen. 'It's been hugely embarrassing,' she said. 'I feel angry and it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Following enquiries the woman was released and no further action was taken.'

A carpenter was found inside his van laden with 132 empty lager cans... which he parked on a 70mph dual carriageway after mistaking it for a lay-by. The van had no lights on and the engine was turned off after Jason Teesdale had mistaken the main road for a lay-by, a court heard. Teesdale, 42, was more than four times over the drink drive limit when the incident happened. The carpenter mistook the A38 for a lay-by, and was found asleep by police officers with lager and cider cans in his van . Prosecutor Mike Brown said the carpenter 'had essentially mistaken the 70mph road for a lay-by' and posed a 'significant danger' to himself and other road users on the A38 in Cornwall. Police found 132 empty cans of lager in the van as well as half a bottle of wine, three cans of strong cider and a sealed bottle of wine. Teesdale, from St Austell, Cornwall, told police he thought he was in a lay-by. He admitted being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle after his arrest in the early hours of Saturday. Mr Brown said a policeman found the VW Transporter parked in the west bound carriageway of the road near Liskeard. The carpenter was discovered in his VW Transporter (not pictured) and admitted being drunk while in charge of a motor vehicle . He was unable to open the driver's door but there was a strong smell of alcohol when he opened the window. After the officer had moved the vehicle to a safe place he gave Teesdale a breath test which led to an 'incredibly high reading' - 146 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath - the legal top limit is just 35. Teesdale told police his last drink had been at 8pm the night before. Bodmin magistrates court heard he has a previous drink drive offence from 2001. Alexis Hager, defending, said the empty cans in the van didn't necessarily correspond to the amount he had drunk and said they were in the vehicle to be taken for recycling. Teesdale had been 'genuinely surprised' by the high level of the reading and had only had a couple of glasses of strong red wine. Ms Hager said he was going through a protracted divorce and was under 'substantial emotional pressure'. The case has been adjourned for reports and Teesdale was bailed.","Jason Teesdale mistook a dual carriageway for a lay-by, court hears .

A father-of-three fined £1,300 for inflicting fellow residents to loud Celine Dion and Eminem songs claims he is the victim and says his neighbours have wrongfully blamed him for noise. Jacek Korolko was handed a noise abatement notice by Bristol City Council after playing the music in his flat in Clifton Vale Close, Clifton, last year. The council claim Mr Korolko, 33, persisted in playing his music, ignored warnings and twice breached the noise abatement notice he had been served. Jacek Korolko, pictured with daughter Oliwia, 3, says he is the victim and has been wrongfully blamed . At Bristol Magistrates’ Court last month the case was proved against Mr Korolko in his absence. But Mr Korolko, who lives in his property with wife Dagmara, 34, and children Martina, 15, Claudia, six, and Oliwia, three, says far from being a nuisance it is he who is being hounded out by fellow residents. He claims that since moving into the property 15 months ago his neighbours have shunned him, complained about the noise his children make and wrongly blamed him for dog mess and litter on the grass surrounding the flats. Mr Korolko says since the complaints he has become increasingly stressed when his youngsters play indoors, has thrown out his stereo, sold his dog and makes his teenage daughter listen to music using headphones. He admits listening to music loudly on three occasions - two of which were his wife and teenage daughter’s birthdays. He said: 'I am meant to be living in freedom but it feels like sometimes we are in a prison. 'I can’t listen to music, I can’t let my kids play inside, I can’t have a dog, I can’t decorate my house. 'I feel stressed all the time. I think I have to think about changing my house but like the area I live. 'I feel like they want me and my family on the streets.' Write caption here . Mr Korolko says problems started as soon as he moved in to the property. He said: 'Almost straight away I was being asked why I was moving into a flat instead of a house. 'I was saying hello to people and they were just ignoring me. I felt like I looked like a monster or something. 'Then they would complain about my kids making noise playing. One time my wife came to the door carrying one child and the shopping and they deliberately shut it. 'Then a fox tears open bin bags and drags it across the grass and I am blamed for the mess, then a dog fouls in the garden and it has to be my dog. 'I don’t understand it. We are not bad people, I am not a terrorist or a bandit. 'But I listen to music three times and get a bill for £1,300.' Mr Korolko said he could never afford to pay the charges as only his wife currently works and he had to return to Poland to sort out his father’s funeral. A spokeswoman for Bristol City Council said that after several warnings they served a Notice under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Section 80 Abatement Notices. Despite this the complaints continued and officers witnessed two breeches of the abatement notice. John Sinnott, Environmental Health Officer, said: 'We warned Mr Korolko that he was in breach of the noise abatement notice and if he did again it would lead to court action. 'Neighbours have been very distressed at the unreasonable volume of music played often late at night.' Mr Korolko was fined £500 for the two breeches of the abatement notice and ordered to pay £799.59 costs and £15 Victim Surcharge. Cllr Gus Hoyt, Cabinet Member for Communities, Environment and Equalities said: 'Fines are always the last resort but local residents have the right to live without unreasonable noise from their neighbours. 'We have a policy of prevention and the officers we have do consult with those causing disturbances and there are plenty of warnings before we get to this stage.

A financial adviser was recorded on an answer machine strangling his university girlfriend after a 12-hour row by text message was jailed for more than seven years today. Carmen Miron Buchacra, 28 - known as Gaby - can be heard begging for her life on a voicemail recording as her partner  Paul Keene, 32, strangled her and repeatedly punched her in the face. The fatal attack came after the pair had sent bitter and angry text messages to each other when Keene was out drinking and Ms Buchacra was caring for their baby. She accused him on not wanting to spend time with their child and threatened to take their daughter, then 11-weeks-old, away from him. Carmen Miron-Buchacra's last words and cries for help were recorded as she was strangled and punched in the face by her partner Paul Keene . The terrified mother called a friend when Keene arrived at their home following his all-day drinking binge at a boules match. But her friend was out of signal and the phone went straight to voicemail - recording for eight minutes and 29 seconds as Keene killed Gaby with an electrical flex. Gaby, an 'outstanding and gifted' PhD student in postgenomic biosciences at Bath University's Department of Biochemistry, can be heard pleading with Keene as their 11-week-old baby lay in a cot nearby. The voicemail recorded Keene repeatedly punching Gaby in the face and strangling her before she gasps 'please don't' - and falls silent. Keene was arrested after police discovered Gaby's body at the couple's flat in Bath, Somerset. He was acquitted of murder after a trial at Bristol Crown Court last December but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control. Keene wiped tears from his eyes yesterday as he was jailed for seven years and four months at Bristol Magistrates Court. Gaby, a PhD student in postgenomic biosciences at Bath University's Department of Biochemistry, can be heard begging for life as their 11-week-old baby lay in a cot nearby . Mr Justice Eder told him: 'You hit Gaby and after a sustained, prolonged and savage attack you eventually killed her. 'It was probably caused by you strangling her with an electric cable around the neck. 'It was a vicious attack that lasted several minutes, we know this because she had many injuries on her face, arms, body and legs and there was blood spattered on one of the drawers. 'But also it was recorded on a friend's voicemail. 'I accept what caused you to lose self control was the cumulative effect of emotional abuse by Gaby over a significant period. 'In particular the threat to take away your daughter that you loved and that you would not be a part of their lives. 'The sentence can and should be imposed to reflect the horrifying circumstances which you inflicted on Gabby.' Gaby had called friend Ben Jones for help when Keene arrived at their home following a work game of boules with investment firm Advance Investments. Keene turned up at the flat and Gaby was forced to let him in, where he shouted at her and launched his fatal attack . But Ben was on a train and out of signal - meaning Gaby's last moments and the horrific killing was recorded on his answerphone. Mother-of-one Gaby can be heard pleading for her life as Keene punches her, telling her to shut up or 'you will be dead'. He can be heard snarling: 'Why are you crying? 'What the f*** is your problem? What have I done to you today? Carry on like this and I'm going to end up in prison because you will be dead. 'I may kill you because you are a f****** t***.' During the trial Michael Fitton, QC, prosecuting, told how Keene first tried to strangle Gaby using a dressing gown cord before switching to an electrical cable to ensure her death. He told the jury: 'Her last words were, 'please don't', then silence. 'When he took hold of the dressing gown cord and wrapped it around her neck he was clearly trying to kill her. 'When he failed in that attempt and reached for the electrical cable he was showing a persistence to kill her that is at odds with his defence.' He said the couple, who were engaged, had exchanged a 12-hour long series of angry text messages on the day of Gaby's death, June 23 this year. Keene, who gave evidence at his trial, told the jury he lost control and could not remember what happened when he killed Gaby at their home . Gaby accused Keene of not wanting to spend time with her and their baby daughter, Eleanor, and told him not to return home. But Keene turned up at the flat and Gaby was forced to let him in, calling friend Ben for help - but he lost signal during the call as he was travelling on the train. Gaby tried to call again but was diverted to Ben's voicemail, leaving the phone recording as Keene launched his fatal attack. It is believed that Gaby died during the phone call, which began at 10.46pm. Adam Vaitilingam, QC, defending, said: 'This was a relationship in which there was psychological bullying. 'There was plainly an in balance which resulted in Mr Keene being belittled by the deceased. 'The nature of the psychological bullying was very much on and off. 'He was walking on egg shells a lot of the time, things would be terrific and then they would go badly wrong. 'He would be, as it were, ostracised for significant periods. This was a period of low level emotional abuse. 'It went on for a considerable period of time, which culminated in the threat to take a child.' Keene, who gave evidence at his trial, told the jury he lost control and could not remember what happened when he killed Gaby, from Mexico. He also claimed he had no recollection of what happened in the hour and ten minutes between killing Gaby and calling 999. The financial advisor told officers he had drunk nine bottles of ale, a bottle of cider and a glass of rose wine during the boules tournament. Her family described the 'indescribable ache' in their hearts. Their statement said: 'Gaby was a beautiful person, inside and out. She spread love, peace and laughter amongst those who were lucky to have met her. 'Her departure has left an indescribable ache in our hearts; an ache that only her baby girl has been able to alleviate over the past few months. 'Gaby's life was full of dreams, hopes and professional and personal accomplishments, where becoming a mother was the biggest of them all, her life was abruptly and unjustly taken. 'Her death has caused amongst all of our family great sorrow and pain, she was an extraordinary daughter, a wonderful sister, a thoughtful friend, but most of all, she was an outstanding mother. 'Our family has had to deal with the fact that nothing will bring us back our beloved Gaby. 'It is up to us now, however, to keep her always close to our hearts and always in our minds.' They added: '""The actions of one person have affected the lives of the ones who loved and cared for Gaby unconditionally. 'Nobody has the right to take someone's life, especially when there is an innocent baby in the line who has now been left without her mother who welcomed her into the world with so much love and so much expectation. 'Gaby's intentions were always to better herself professionally and personally, to have a family and to provide for her daughter. 'All that we have left is to remember her with love and tenderness but most of all, to provide her biggest treasure, Ellie Mae, with the love and care that Gaby would have wanted for her.'","Carmen Miron Buchacra, 28, heard pleading for her life as she was strangled .

The assassination of Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti removes one of the few remaining pillars of support for the Alawite leader among the majority sect that has risen up against him. The powerful explosion struck as al-Buti, an 84-year-old cleric and religious scholar who appeared often on TV, was giving a religious lesson in the Eman Mosque in the central Mazraa district of Damascus, according to state TV. The Eman Mosque was completely destroyed after a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti . A suicide bomber blew himself up during evening prayers inside a mosque in Damascus Thursday, killing a top Sunni Muslim preacher and longtime supporter of President Bashar Assad . Suicide bombings blamed on Islamic extremists fighting with the rebels have become common in Syria's two-year-old civil war. But today's explosion marked the first time a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a mosque. Syrian TV footage showed wounded people and bodies with severed limbs on the blood-stained floor and later, bodies covered in white body bags lined up in rows. Sirens wailed through the capital as ambulances rushed to the scene of the explosion, which was sealed off by the military. Al-Buti's death was a blow to Syria's embattled leader, who is fighting mainly Sunni rebels seeking his removal. Al-Buti has been a vocal supporter of his regime since the early days of Assad's father and predecessor, the late President Hafez Assad. Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti, a top Sunni Muslim preacher and longtime supporter of President Bashar Assad was killed in a suicide bombing in the Eman Mosque, at the Mazraa district . Sunnis are the majority sect in Syria while Assad is from the minority Alawite sect - an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He was the regular preacher of the . eighth century Omayyad Mosque, but Syrian TV said he was giving a . religious sermon to students at Eman Mosque when the explosion occurred. In . recent months, Syrian TV has carried his sermon from mosques in . Damascus live every week. He also has a regular religious TV programme. Syrian .

The Observatory said seven people, including three children, were killed yesterday by government shelling of villages in the area. Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the fighting around the town of Arnabeh intensified today, a day after rebels captured it. He added that the rebels captured two nearby army posts.

New explosive documents kept hidden for a century have revealed the Titanic's owners ignored warnings that they did not have enough lifeboats just hours before her doomed maiden voyage. Experts say hundreds of passengers may have survived had White Star Line listened to safety inspector Maurice Clarke, who told them the liner needed at least '50 per cent more lifeboats'. The civil servant surveyed the ship five hours before its departure from Southampton on April 10, 1912, but his plea for more safety equipment was suppressed by the ship's owners who were bent on making sure it left for New York on time. Clarke was told to keep quiet and threatened with the sack after he said Titanic must have 30 not 20 lifeboats, which could have saved more than 600 lives when the liner later hit an Atlantic iceberg and sank. Scandal: The Carpathia carries rescued lifeboats from the Titanic after the disaster in 1912, but new documents show a safety officer warned that the Titanic needed '50 per cent more' but was shut up . Disaster: Inspector Maurice Clarke was on board Titanic five hours before the ship left Southampton (pictured) and told he would lose his job if he spoke out . The cover-up has emerged a century after Mr Clarke's 'smoking gun' documents, as they have been made available for sale at auction. They show he boarded the vessel at 8am on April 10, 1912 to carry out his checks before granting Titanic a certificate to allow her to carry emigrant passengers. Under the heading 'boats', he acknowledged it was not possible to double the number of lifeboats from 20 to 40 to cover 'all hands' due to cost and extra manning. But Mr Clarke, the emigration officer for the government's Board of Trade, wrote: 'I suggest 50 per cent more.' Telling: Zooming in on Mr Clarke's notes, it shows he wrote that he wanted 50% more lifeboats on the Titanic . He stated that an increase of 50 per cent would mean 30 lifeboats that would carry 1,767 people in an emergency. He wrote: 'This permits of all persons being transferred to another ship in one return, not 3. 'A sufficiency of boats would allay a panic.' But he added, tellingly: 'To deviate...would leave me without support. I might be shifted as suggest to me by owners if I enforced my views as to efficiency.' Incredible: His report will be going to auction and has been hidden for a century . Page: This handwritten note includes the key warning: 'to deviate from regulations...would leave me without support' Incredibly, his notes also reveal that Titanic only had six life buoys on board, which equated to one per 370 people. In the event, the Titanic left Southampton for New York with the legal minimum 20 lifeboats that had a capacity for 1,178 people. Only 706 passengers and crew made it into the boats and 1,522 people died after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on April 15, 1912. Despite his concerns, Mr Clarke towed the party line when he later gave evidence at the official inquiry into the disaster and did not repeat his views. When asked whether Titanic was in a proper order to go to sea as an emigrant ship he replied: 'Undoubtedly.' His documents are to be sold at auction by Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire. Conspiracy: Chief officer Henry Wilde (back, second from left) carried out the lifeboat check with Maurice Clarke but warnings were ignored by those at the very top . Andrew Aldridge said: 'This has to be the most controversial document relating to the Titanic that has emerged in the last 100 years. 'This is clear evidence that a company, namely White Star Line, had sufficient influence to gag a government employee. 'Maurice Clarke felt the number of lifeboats on Titanic was inadequate and he wanted 50 per cent more. 'But he was told, or he was under the impression, that he would be moved from his position if he proceeded with this course of action. 'He felt he could not go go public or make his views known to the powers that be because the owners had made it clear that he wasn't allowed to. Survivors from the Titanic are pictured here rowing towards rescue ship the Carpathia in what appear to be relatively calm seas . 'Had he done so, in his words he would have been shifted, which I think would mean moved position or demoted. Dubbed the 'unsinkable' ship, the Titanic famously struck an iceberg and sank in under three hours on April 15, 1912. Of the 2,224 on board, 1,517 passengers and crew perished. It lay unseen on the ocean floor for decades, until 1985, when an American-French expedition identified its final resting place 329 miles south-east of Newfoundland. The wreck, which was split into two sections 2,000ft apart, has now been the focus of research by scientists and historians for decades. 'This statement implies that the Board of Trade officials in charge of clearing Titanic had been pressurised by White Star Line with regard to the subject of insufficient lifeboats. 'This is a fact that has never been known before. It was a judgement which had calamitous results only five days later when Titanic sunk. 'If his recommendations for 30 lifeboats been accepted then potentially more than 1,000 out of the 1,500 people who died could have been saved. 'In hindsight, there was a very strong case to bring charges of corporate manslaughter against White Star Line over the disaster. 'If that had happened, then this document would have been the smoking-gun piece of evidence that would have helped convict them. 'Yet when Maurice Clarke gave his evidence to the official enquiry he played it with a very straight bat and towed the party line.' The documents were obtained by a solicitor more than 50 years ago and it is his son who is now selling them with a pre-sale estimate of £30,000. They also include a typed statement from Mr Clarke to the Board of Trade in response to receiving a list of questions he was likely to be asked at the inquiry.

Held: Veniamin Konstantinovich Balika, 34, was arrested after detectives found a truck he was driving with roughly $200,000 worth of stolen Muenster cheese . Most crimes are unpleasant but this one most definitely stinks. When detectives stopped a truck being driven through New Jersey they were left stunned to discover it contained about $200,000 worth of stolen cheese. Veniamin Konstantinovich Balika, 34, of Plainfield, Illinois, was arrested by police officers at a service area off the New Jersey Turnpike. He is alleged to have provided false paperwork to the distributor of K&K Cheese in Cashton so he could get the Muenster cheese loaded onto his 18-wheel truck last week. Speaking to Channel3000.com, Kevin Everhart, general manager of K&K, said: 'This is the first time this has ever happened to us. 'The trucking company we contract with will take care of the money we lost, but it's still a shame.' The huge cheese load was initially supposed to go to Texas but was instead intercepted thousands of miles away by the New Jersey state police. K&K - which operates under the Old Country Cheese Factory label, processes 120,000 pounds of milk every day and ships Amish cheese all over the U.S. It is alleged that Balika was looking to sell the cheese to retailers on the east coast. The cheese will now be inspected by health authorities and if found safe will be donated to charity. Stinker: Detectives say the truck contained $200,000 worth of stolen Muenster cheese which was supposed to be going to Texas. This is a file picture of Muenster cheese . Theft: The cheese was taken from K&K - which operates under the Old Country Cheese Factory label. This is one of its factories . Because K&K cannot guarantee that the cheese has not been tampered with, it has not asked for the product back. Detective Oliver Sissman said this was the first time the force had found stolen cheese. But he knew immediately where it had come from. 'When I looked inside and saw stolen cheese, I thought, of course it's from Wisconsin.' he said.

However, an unusual reaction in Sullins' has left her having to have both her legs amputated below the knees and all her fingers removed apart from her thumb. 'What's clearly happened here is that the bacteria has gotten into the bloodstream,' Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center told ABC News. 'Once into the blood stream it has created sepsis, a serious infection which has an effect on all the bodies regulatory and inflammatory mechanisms.'

In Sullins case it caused blood vessels in her hands and legs to clot. 'Both of her legs had turned black below the knees,"" her mother Carol Wilson told the broadcaster. 'Her body was literally dying, her extremities were dying, it's like a horror movie, I can't put it into words.' 'Everybody is devastated, we are probably more devastated than she even is because she's got the spirit,' Wilson added. 'Everybody is standing by her, she has not been by herself for one minute. 'We feel very confident that not only will she walk again with prosthesis, but she is going to make the most of what she has.'

A former city trader dubbed 'the Bernie Madoff of Frinton-on-Sea' has been jailed for five years after conning lifelong friends and colleagues out of their savings. Married father-of-two Ian Dickinson, of Ipswich, promised his victims huge returns as part of the 'shameful' £3.3 million fraud. The former Frinton Rotary Club president was a respected member of the Essex seaside town's social set and used this status to gain trust, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. The 50-year-old, who ran his business . FX Trading from his former home in Frinton, pleaded guilty to two fraud . offences at an earlier hearing. His . Ponzi scheme involved promising returns to investors by trading in . foreign investments while in fact using the money for his own benefit. Over . five years he received total investments of more than £11 million from . 113 victims. The vast majority lost some or all of their money as less . than £8 million of this was returned. Victims included fellow rotary . members and golf, cricket and tennis club friends. Passing sentence, Judge David Turner said that the fraud involved 'alarming' sums of money. 'Your conduct has left an appalling legacy of stress, anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and huge financial hardship,' he added. 'What you were involved in was a shameful scam, playing on the trust and admiration others had for you.' At court, prosecutor Rakesh Somaia said: 'The reality was that between 2005 and 2010 he was running what was effectively a Ponzi scheme. Convicted: The former Frinton Rotary Club president was a respected member of the Essex seaside town's social set and used this status to gain trust . Criminal: Fraud mastermind Bernard Madoff is pictured with his wife Ruth . Sent down: Ian Dickinson outside Chelmsford Crown Court today . 'He used the proceeds to fund a luxury lifestyle, a large house, cars and private education for his children.' 'His membership of the rotary club in particular was a sign to many investors that he could be trusted,' Mr Somaia said. 'His charity work for the rotary club added to the impression he was a trustworthy individual.' Mr Somaia said that many raided their . 'nest eggs' to invest in the scheme. Some used their entire life . savings, cashed in pension funds or remortgaged their homes, he added. One victim, Sylvia Baines, who the court heard had been a family friend of 30 years, lost £15,000.The biggest single loss to a victim was £188,000. Gavin Holme, mitigating, described Dickinson as a 'well-thought of individual whose vanity took hold'. He added: 'He is fully aware of the impact this has had on the community and those who lost money.' Mr Holme added his client had raised large amounts for local and national charities, including a cardiac unit at a children's hospital. Dickinson worked as a foreign exchange broker in London during the 1980s and later joined a Chelmsford-based consortium of investors, initially trading with his own money. He declared himself bankrupt in December 2010. Shortly before that he tried to kill himself and told paramedics: 'I have big financial issues and it was better for everyone that I just die,' the court heard. Dickinson pleaded guilty to participating in a fraudulent business carried out by a sole trader and another count of not being authorised in relation to a regulated activity. The offences began in 2005 and continued until November, 2010. After his 2011 arrest, neighbours spoke of their shock and compared him to disgraced Wall Street financier Madoff.","Ian Dickinson promised his victims huge returns as part of £3.3 million fraud .

High-rise housing blocks should be bulldozed and replaced with rows of traditional terraced housing to cut crime and raise living standards for the poorest in British society, a key report has found. Homes modelled on those built across the UK for centuries are how 'people want to live' and would reduce their stress and even save their marriages, influential think-tank the Policy Exchange said today. At least 140,000 households with children live on the second floor or . above in England, despite evidence that multi-storey flats attract . higher crime rates and social breakdown, their paper found. Vision: Planners believed that high-rise blocks like these on the Heygate Estate in South London were better, but an influential think tanks says they all should be bulldozed and replaced with terraced housing . Back to the future: Traditional terraced Victorian, like these in Greenwich, London, are 'how people want to live', the Policy Exchange say . These tower blocks, built across the UK in the last 70 years, have become 'no-go areas' and must be 'ripped down', they say. Around 300,000 of these flats have been put up since the 1950s, but they could fit 600,000 homes and flats in the same footprint, the Policy Exchange claim. Using that calculation London alone 260,000 new homes could be built in seven years by demolishing tower blocks in the capital. The paper's author, Nicholas Boys Smith, warned that residents of such estates - mostly social tenants - suffered more stress, mental health problems and marriage breakdowns. Report: The document shows how large numbers of homes can be built in the footprint of housing blocks . Changes: Huge numbers of traditional terraces were demolished to make way for high-rise blocks but they should build them again to cut crime, the report says . Bygone: Living in a house, with only two storeys is good for health and well-being, according to the author . High-rises could also pose fire dangers and were more expensive to build and maintain, he said. 'It's time we ripped down the mistakes of the past and started building proper streets where people want to live', Mr Boys Smith said. 'We must not repeat mistakes by building housing which makes people's lives a misery. 'Bulldozing the high-rise tower blocks and no-go zone estates and replacing them with terraced homes and low-rise flats is the best way to build both the number and the quality of homes that we need.' And it appears the Government, at least in part, agrees. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'Ministers have scrapped the last government's Whitehall targets which forced local authorities to build high-density flats rather than family homes and attractive terraces. 'Good design is vital to avoid the mistakes of the last century that lead to ugly and crime-ridden tower blocks. 'Communities can now use their own Neighbourhood Plans to decide themselves what type and design of homes are built in their area and their councils should actively support them in this process.' It was the estate that Tony Blair visited to make his first keynote speech as Prime Minister in 1997. And now the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, South London, is in the middle of a huge £1.5bn regeneration, but not into the terraced housing that the Policy Exchange suggests. Mr Blair said at the time that he would provide hope and new opportunities for Britain's army of 'forgotten people', and famously waved from a balcony on the notorious estate promising them new homes. 13 years later the work started. Prince William and a party of his Eton classmates were even sent there to witness first hand how the other half live on one of London's most rundown estates. His visit was part of an A-level geography field trip. But now the estate of 2,700 homes is being redeveloped (below). The buildings are . being taken down as they were constructed, rather than with a wrecking . ball, to minimise disruption. It was built between 1967 and 1977 as an attempt to link estates between Peckham and Elephant and Castle. It became renowned as an area of deprivation, blighted by crime and anti-social behaviour. Television programmes such as The Bill and Spooks would often choose it as a backdrop when filming gritty scenes. Three sites on the estate are being developed, with about 4,000 new homes, 50 per cent of which will be social housing. The new development will feature homes to rent and buy, and is designed to minimise the number of potential crime hotspots.","High-rise estates raise crime and are now 'no-go areas', think-tank says .

These fascinating images show the final resting places of two moon probes which crashed onto the moon. An eagle-eyed NASA spacecraft managed to locate the crash sites of the twin spacecraft Ebb and Flow and took these images of their final resting spots. Yesterday, the space agency released the before-and-after pictures of the lunar north pole where Ebb and Flow came to rest. Crash site: These NASA images show the crash site before, left, and after, right, where one moon probe crashed onto the surface of the moon. Small craters and dots mark the site . The images show small craters and dots which mark the impact sites. The spacecraft broke into smithereens upon impact and pinpointing the small craters they carved was difficult, said Arizona State University researcher Mark Robinson, who operates the camera of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Even the mission's chief scientist, Maria Zuber, was surprised when she saw the images of the impact sites which looked like dots. 'I was expecting to see skid tracks,' said Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ebb and Flow deliberately plunged into a lunar mountain in December after mapping the moon's gravity field in unprecedented detail. The location was chosen because it was far away from the Apollo landings and other historic sites. Damage: These before, left, and after, right, images show the crash site of the second moon probe. These images were taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter . Since the finale occurred in the dark, telescopes from Earth did not capture it. Even the reconnaissance orbiter had to wait until sunlight streamed to the northern lunar region. Launched in 2011, the spacecraft spent nearly a year flying in formation, exclusively collecting gravitational data. Among the discoveries: The lunar crust is much thinner and more battered than scientists had imagined. Initially flying at 35 miles above the lunar surface, the spacecraft dipped lower and lower in altitude during the $487 million mission. Resting places: This topographic map shows the two impact areas of the twin spacecraft Ebb and Flow. It deliberately crashed into the surface of the moon last year . Scientists are still pouring through the last chunk of data beamed back just before their demise. The Ebb and Flow crash sites were named in honour of mission team member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space who died last year. Ride's educational company supplied the cameras on the mission that allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other geological features.","Crash sites of twin spacecraft Ebb and Flow located .

Facebook has mapped out the national sentiment for the 68 teams competing for the championship, based on more than one million Facebook users who Liked one of the participating college basketball teams on the social media website. The colorful map shows the allegiances in 3,140 counties in the U.S. and the data was split various ways to show team spirit nationally, by the four divisions and by state rivalries. Madness: Facebook mapped out NCAA team loyalties by Likes on the social media website. Over 1 million U.S. Facebook users have Liked a page for one of the 68 teams in the tournament. Poor Texas, no school in the Lone Star state made it this year leaving Texans unsure of who to root for . Most teams posted a strong showing in . their home state. Gonzaga, located in Spokane, Washington, is the crowd . favorite in the Pacific Northwest. In the Midwest there is absolute . loyalty for the teams in Minnesota, Illinois and Indiana, it is the home of the Hoosiers after . all. Even President Obama, whose roots are in Illinois, picked Indiana . as the champion for 2013 in his NCAA bracket. Sadly, the Lone Star state seemed . confused on who to root for. With no Texas teams in the tournament, the . state was a smorgasbord of Likes for random teams, with residents unable . to throw their support behind any home team. Undoubtedly, if the Aggies had progressed into the tournament - the state would be a solid maroon. Some users cried foul, though, for the . map's portrayal of the strong support for the UNC Tar Heels in North . Carolina, with only a tiny show of support in North Carolina for Coach . K's Duke. There were only three small specks of dark blue representing . fans of the Blue Devils. 1 Seeds: Of the the four #1 seeds, Indiana and Kansas seem to pull the most supporters while Gonzaga and Louisvillle fans are pretty much clustered in their regions . In the separately created maps for the four divisions competing for the NCAA title, Duke was redeemed. Among the 18 teams playing the Midwest Division, much of the country is rooting for the private school in Durham. In the map portraying favorites in the South Division, of 16 teams, Duke's rival UNC stole the show. Much of the Plain is rooting for the Kansas Jayhawks and Minnesota also showed strong support for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The Wild West lived up to its name, the map for the 17 states in this division shows no clear frontrunner though Gonzaga certainly charmed a large percentage of Facebook fans. East Coasters are loving the Hoosiers, with the exception of New York, who showed unquestioning loyalty to Syracuse. Midwest: Of the 18 teams competing in this division, Duke is the favorite by far though Kentucky favors Louisville and Oklahoma roots for the home team . South: There is clearly a deep love for the Tar Heels in this division, though fans of Minnesota, Kansas and Michigan proudly support their teams. South Dakota State and Northwestern State deserve sympathy though, not even one Like! West: The Pacific Northwest goes hard for Gonzaga while most of the other 17 teams in the division are feeling the love in their home states . East: The Hoosiers have widespread appeal among the 17 teams in the East division but fans of Syracuse and Illinois aren't afraid to show their true support . The data was also spliced to show national Likes by rivalries. Down south in North Carolina, the Duke-UNC competition is among the fiercest but again UNC has won the hearts and minds of the nation. Similarly there was a clear favorite in the University of Kansas and Kansas Sate rivalry, with the UK Jayhawks coming out as the clear favorite. March Madness kicked off on Thursday and Americans are intensely watching the college basketball teams face off to monitor how they will fare in their NCAA Tournament Brackets. Millions of Americans will fill out a bracket to predict the outcome of the games, though a scientist at Georgia Tech has calculated that a person's chances of perfectly predicting the correct outcome to all 68 games is 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (9 quintillion). Though the odds are really not in a person's favor, that doesn't stop people from putting money where their mouth is. Estimates suggest as much as $3 billion could change hands in office betting pools. These colors don't bleed: There must be something in the water in North Carolina. Between Duke (dark blue) and North Carolina (light blue), UNC is the national favorite . We're not in Kansas anymore: No question, the KU Jayhawks (blue) are the national favorite among this rivalry. Sorry Kansas State, don't mean to kick a man when he's down (K-State lost to La Salle on Friday and had to kiss their dream of advancing in the tournament goodbye) Great Lake State: University of Michigan (yellow) pretty much dominated Michigan State (green) in terms of support .","Map shows fan support in 3,140 counties in the U.S.

A Hollyoaks actress has been digitally recreated as part of a groundbreaking virtual head that could replace the text emoticons we use today. Researchers say the interactive computer face, based on 31-year-old soap actress Zoe Lister, can display six emotions including happiness, anger, and fear. The lifelike figure, which generates voice and facial expressions from typed text, can combine these basic emotions to create hundreds of others. Talking head: Hollyoaks actress Zoe Lister, 31, is the basis for the most expressive ever talking head, just developed by researchers at Cambridge University . And tests showed that the virtual head's emotions are so convincing that observers found it easier to read her emotions than those of the actress she is modelled on. Researchers spent several days recording Ms Lister's speech and facial expressions - best known as Zoe Carpenter in the Channel 4 series Hollyoaks. The new system - also called Zoe - bears a striking resemblance to the ship's computer in the British sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. Its inventors say it could be used as a digital assistant for smartphones - or even as a more lifelike equivalent to the commonly used emoticons. For example, users could write the text message 'I'm going to be late' and ask the computer to set the emotion to frustrated. Their friend would then receive a message with the computerised face repeating saying it in a frustrated way. Future generations of the technology could even be personalised with users' own faces and voices. It is hoped that the technology will also be used to help autistic and deaf children to read emotions and lip-read. Expressive: Researchers say the interactive computer face can display six emotions. Left shows Zoe making angry expression; on the right, she is showing a sad expression . Researchers say the face is the most . expressive controllable avatar ever created - replicating human emotions . with unprecedented realism. 'This . technology could be the start of a whole new generation of interfaces . which make interacting with a computer much more like talking to another . human being,' said Cambridge engineering professor Roberto Cipolla. 'It took us days to create Zoe, because we had to start from scratch and teach the system to understand language and expression. 'Now . that it already understands those things, it shouldn't be too hard to . transfer the same blueprint to a different voice and face.' Combinations: But the lifelike figure, which generates voice and facial expressions from typed text, can combine these basic emotions to create hundreds of others. Left is a happy expression; right, afraid . He added: 'Present day human-computer interaction still revolves around typing at a keyboard or moving and pointing with a mouse. 'For a lot of people, that makes computers difficult and frustrating to use. 'In the future, we will be able to open up computing to far more people if they can speak and gesture to machines in a more natural way. 'That is why we created Zoe - a more expressive, emotionally responsive face that human beings can actually have a conversation with.' The future of communication? Its inventors say it could be used as a . digital assistant for smartphones - or even as a more lifelike . equivalent to the commonly used emoticons . Tests showed the computer Zoe was an even better actress than the real Zoe, with 77 per cent of people recognising the virtual expressions compared to 73 per cent recognising the actress's expressions . The researchers created mathematical . algorithms which gave them the voice and image data they needed to . recreate expressions on the digital face from text alone. Zoe's voice has six basic settings - happy, sad, tender, angry, afraid and neutral. TV star: Zoe Lister, 31, plays the role of Zoe Carpenter in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks . The user can adjust these settings to different levels, as well as altering the pitch, speed and depth of the voice. By combining the levels it is possible to create a practically infinite amount of emotional reactions. Combining . happiness with tenderness and slightly increasing the speed and depth . of the voice, for example, makes it sound friendly and welcoming. And a combination of speed, anger and fear makes Zoe sound as if she is panicking. Zoe has performed well in tests with researchers getting a 77 per cent success rate of 20 volunteers recognising the emotion she was displaying. Bizarrely the recognition rate for the real-life Ms Lister was only 73 per cent. The program used to run Zoe is just tens of megabytes in size meaning it can be easily incorporated into even the smallest computer devices, including tablets and smartphones. The head is the result of collaboration between researchers at Toshiba's Cambridge Research Lab and the University of Cambridge's Department of Engineering. Futuristic BBC comedy Red Dwarf, starring Craig Charles, ran for eight series over an eleven year period before it was axed in 1999. But the series returned in 2008, with a three-episode production was commissioned by the digital channel Dave and a new series in October 2012.","System generates voice and facial expression from typed text .

But we are only at the beginning of that process for liver disease.' The new information was collated from millions of items of data from doctors, hospitals and councils. Across England, about one million people are thought to be alcohol-dependent. However, treatment is subjected to a postcode lottery with only 6 per cent of those affected currently receiving help.

While she wears her heart on her sleeve, it seems she is in a minority in modern fiction. New British books show significantly less emotion than they did a century ago, academics say. Hankies at the ready! British books published before the 1960s were far more emotional than their American counterparts . Academics analysed how frequently ‘mood’ words - those reflecting anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise - were used in more than five million books published between 1900 to 2000. According to lead researcher Dr Alberto Acerbi from the University of Bristol, the average book published at the start of the 20th century has 14 per cent more emotional content than a novel from the end. ‘Our main point was to show that we can detect this trend - that use of emotional content changes over time,’ said Dr Acerbi, a Newton Fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology. ‘The average 1900 book is 1.14 times more emotional than the average book in 2000. This means that if a book had 1000 emotional words in 1900, now it will have 877 emotional words.’ Modern day books have far less passion in them, and researchers say people fear ridicule for showing emotion . Speaking about the research author Jilly Cooper said: ‘People are unsure how to express emotions now. They think it is a bit wet going over the top, and maybe people fear ridicule. There is certainly less conviction and passion in modern books. ‘My books are very full of joy, they are like a knickerbocker glory of love.’ The research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that as well as general decrease in emotions, the use of positive or negative mood words seemed to reflect historical events. Author Jilly Cooper says her books are 'a knickerbocker glory of love' There were two happy peaks where greater ‘joy’ words were used in books - those published after the First World War and in the 1960s. In contrast, researchers found a sad peak corresponding to the Second World War. ‘We were initially surprised to see how well periods of positive and negative moods correlated with historical events,’ said Dr Acerbi. ‘The Second World War, for example, is marked by a distinct increase in words related to sadness, and a correspondent decrease in words related to joy.’ Until the middle of the last century, British writers used slightly more emotional language than their American counterparts. But the study found that since the 1960s there has been a divergence in style, with American books becoming decidedly more emotional, a possible reflection of the differing fortunes of the ‘baby boomer’ generation on each side of the Atlantic. The same divergence was also found in the use of content-free words, which are words that carry little or no meaning on their own like conjunctions such as ‘and’ or ‘but’, and articles such as ‘the’. ‘This is particularly fascinating because it has recently been shown that differences in usage of content-free words are a signature of different stylistic periods in the history of western literature,’ said Dr Acerbi. The divergence in emotional content between the two forms of English suggests a more general stylistic divide. Co-author Professor Alex Bentley said: ‘We don’t know exactly what happened in the Sixties but our results show that this is the precise moment in which literary American and British English started to diverge. We can only speculate whether this was connected, for example, to the baby-boom or to the rising of counterculture. ‘In the USA, baby boomers grew up in the greatest period of economic prosperity of the century, whereas the British baby boomers grew up in a post-war recovery period so perhaps ‘emotionalism’ was a luxury of economic growth.’ The study also recorded an increased occurrence of anxiety and paranoia in our literature, with the average book in 2000 possession 12 per cent more words indicating fear than a 1960 publication.","There were two happy peaks where greater ‘joy’ words were used in books - those published after the First World War and in the 1960s .

The showjumping event would feature 30 of the world's top riders and would have taken over part of the West London park for a month. However, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council refused him planning permission for the event because it decided  it would have a detrimental effect on the home of his own family members. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Phillips said:  'We are extremely disappointed but we are determined that we are going to run the Global Champions Tour in the UK in 2013 and we are looking at a number of potential venues that we will confirm shortly.

The council said the event would fail to preserve or enhance the Kensington Palace setting or the character of the area. A petition and 300 objections from residents was sent to the council along with just four letters of support. The proposal which went before the council involved 292 horses being stabled in the park along with a 3,200 seat arena and hospitality marquees for 700 people. According to the Daily Telegraph, a spokesman for the council said part of the reason permission was refused was because the park took longer than expected to recover from a temporary theatre which was put up last year. It is also believed the council did not want to set a precedent for events to be held in the park every year.","Peter Phillips wanted to hold event in grounds of Kensington Palace .

Although Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was a commendable effort, it oozed 'identity crisis'. The former's trademark gore was sacrificed while the idea of DC characters doing 'finishing moves' didn't quite work. Thankfully, NetherRealm Studios addressed this, releasing the brilliant and brutal Mortal Kombat in 2011. Claws are out: Catwoman is one of the playable characters, and she can use her whip to damage opponents . Now the same team have developed Injustice: Gods Among Us... and it's looking like the game superhero fans have been waiting for. A large part of this is down to the clever narrative design. Similar to Mortal Kombat, NetherRealm  want to make the entire experience feel like an interactive movie. Gone are random fragmented bouts, replaced by battles cleverly connected by game-engine-rendered (and often interactive) cut-scenes. Thankfully, fighting is superb. There are lots of famous characters available, ranging from Batman and Bane, to Superman and Deathstroke. Each one has their own abilites and fighting style. Batman, for example, is a master of martial arts and this is reflected in his wide-range of kicks, punches and grapples. He can also use gadgets such as the Batclaw and explosive Batarangs. Superman, in contrast, can fire lasers from his eyes and use his immense strength to throw foes around like ragdolls. Each character has a selection of special moves. When you build up enough points, pressing both triggers sees them launch into a brutal combination. Batman can call in the Batmobile to run his foe down, while The Flash sprints around the planet before landing a devastating uppercut on his opponent's chin. Brutal: Characters all look and move realistically, while environments offer different sections to explore . If both of you do a similar move at the same time, you enter a Wager mode, a quick-time event where you gamble points on whether you can press the button before your foe does. The environment can take damage, too, and clever level design means each one has multiple tiers. When at certain parts of a level, a move can be unleashed which launches your opponent into a new section of the arena. It's a brilliant mechanic, and each level has a different cut-scene, giving you lots of incentive to explore. Graphically, the game is strong. Although the Unreal 3 Engine looks somewhat strained rendering larger expanses and NPCs in the cinematics, main character models look brilliantly detailed - clearly displaying tears and cuts after gruelling exchanges.

Her first outing on the PlayStation signalling the beginning of a new generation of gaming. Now, as the life of current gen starts to fade, who better than Lara Croft to celebrate the end of an era and offer us a glimpse of what's to come. But this is no 'normal' Tomb Raider, and Crystal Dynamics have worked tirelessly to reboot the series. Perhaps their biggest statement of intent is getting Terry Pratchett's daughter, Rhianna, to pen the story. Birth of an icon: All alone and battling the elements, Lara is ambushed by wolves early on in the game . As such, Lara is part of a team of archeologists that washes up on an island after a storm destroys their ship. Isolated and all alone, it's not long before Lara bumps into a bunch of crazed Sun God-worshipping locals called the Solari who are killing any 'outsiders' in an attempt to bring their deity back. How Lara deals with these obstacles help mould her from from naive, timid archeologist to gun-wielding femme fatale. It's a breathless ride from start to finish, broken up with set pieces that give the Uncharted games a run for their money. However, some may feel the whole 'you can do it, Lara' theme (primarily from Lara's mentor, Roth) and constant sign-posting is a tad strong. Still, this feels like a Tomb Raider game, albeit with a few welcome modifications. As the game progresses, Lara can upgrade her equipment and skills. These range from combat upgrades such as the ability to throw dirt in enemies' eyes, to enhanced survival instincts that improve salvage and hunting ability. Levels are well deigned, too, offering a surprising level of freedom in some parts. Often venturing off the beaten track rewards you with a secret tomb which can be explored for ancient treasures. It's a living, breathing island too. Hungry wolves roam the forest at night, while timid rabbits and deer can be seen grazing on the island's lush greenery. The game lets you hunt all of these, but it feels more like an optional extra than something necessary for her survival. Shine a light: When exploring dark caves and tombs, Lara can light a torch to help illuminate her path. When climbing ladders, though, Lara does not extinguish the torch and flames cover her face. Thankfully, this amusing feature does not cause her any damage . Combat is fast and frantic and the formidable enemy AI is a challenge whatever the difficulty. Lara has a variety of weapons available to her ranging from shotguns to assault rifles and pistols. By far the most fun to use is the bow (later modifications make it even better). It's brilliantly rewarding watching a well-placed arrow hit a foe - a grisly death animation shortly following. But the graphic deaths are not just for your foes, and - in similar vein to the previous games - Lara can meet her end in a number of gruesome ways. Whether it's being crushed by a rock, impaled on a spike or eaten by wolves, all are particularly disturbing given how realistically Lara is portrayed. This is thanks to actress Camilla Luddington, who conveys Lara's transformation brilliantly. She's sobbing her eyes out one minute, then boisterously taunting her foes the next. The developers have mentioned their admiration of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, and this influence is clear throughout - both in the in-game cinematography and the dark, tense orchestral score. Some gameplay decisions, however, may jar with fans. Although Crystal Dynamics have placed the odd puzzle here and there, this is very much an action game. Indeed, Lara's kill count by the end of the game reaches genocidal proportions, which may make her 'transformation' feel less believable. Run and gun: In fire fights, it pays to keep moving. If you stay in one place, enemies will throw firebombs and dynamite to flush you out from cover . Graphically, the game is strong - with impressive detail on even the most distant environmental features. Pop up is negligible and there's enough variation (although earlier levels are perhaps too dark) to keep the adventure from feeling stale. But it's Lara's animation that steals the show. What starts as cautious footsteps and clumsy clambering soon turns into graceful rock climbing and death-defying leaps. Not all of it is silky smooth, but more often than not it looks fantastic. Lara's facial animations, too, capture every drop of her initial doubt and anxiety, only to subtly become more confident and aggressive as the game goes on. Naturally, the game looks its best on PC. On 'Ultimate' settings, textures are eye-poppingly realistic, and draw distances put consoles to shame. Most notable, though, is Lara's hair. Gone are her blocky locks, replaced by a free-flowing, insanely realistic head of hair made possible by TressFx. The campaign offers between 8-10 hours or gameplay, and multiplayer adds some more longevity. However, although competent, multiplayer is not why you buy a Tomb Raider game. You buy it for the story and in that respect, Tomb Raider delivers in almost every way. Tomb Raider is out now. WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW HERE: .

For thousands of parents, it has become a familiar story. They lend their children their iPads and mobiles to play ‘free’ games. Then days later, they receive a bill revealing the game involved all sorts of expensive add-ons, and find that their children have run up bills of hundreds or even thousands of pounds at the touch of a button. This week, Doug Crossan, a 48-year-old father from Somerset, revealed that his 13-year-old son Cameron had incurred an astonishing £3,700 bill for games bought from Apple’s online App Store. Theirs is just the latest in a long line of similar stories, though it’s unlikely other parents have had such a draconian response as Mr Crossan and reported their child to the police. In the past month alone, there have been three other such cases involving these underhand charges. In Bristol, eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry ran up a bill of nearly £1,000 on his parents’ iPad buying virtual doughnuts — some costing £69.99 — while playing the Simpsons game Tapped Out. Then, five-year-old Danny Kitchen, who also lives with his parents in Bristol, spent £1,700 buying ammunition on ‘free’ zombie shoot-’em-up games. Danny downloaded 19 different  add-ons in just ten minutes — simply by pressing on a shopping trolley icon. In Northwich, Cheshire, Grace Walker downloaded a My Little Pony app on her mother’s iPad — then spent £900 on virtual gems to decorate the animals. The six-year-old innocently clicked on the ‘buy now’ option which appeared on the touchscreen more than 12 times in half an hour. In each of these three cases, Apple refunded the money lost, but only after appeals from the parents. As these incidents grow ever more common, it is becoming increasingly important that parents become more savvy about how these games work — and how to protect themselves from falling foul of unanticipated charges. Cases: In the past month alone, there have been three other such cases involving underhand charges incurring high costs for gaming . The problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ‘free’, so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded. But once the children start playing the games, they are offered various add-ons and extras. These might be special items or abilities for game characters — such as gems to decorate ponies or weapons for a questing medieval knight — or a ‘pass’ which allows players to skip to the next level of a game. It is easy enough for a trusting child to purchase all manner of extras without ever realising that they are spending real money. More worrying still, is a security loophole which leaves users signed into their accounts for a full 15 minutes after they have first entered their password. The problem is that many of the games or apps aimed at children are initially described as ¿free¿, so parents willingly give their children their passwords so that the games can be downloaded . This means that if a parent buys a relatively cheap game for, say, £1.99, and then hands their iPad to their child, that child then has a 15-minute window of opportunity to purchase whatever they want without having to re-enter the password. These games have been dubbed ‘freemium’ — free to download, but with expensive premium enhancements. And as these games and apps have become more sophisticated, the risks of them costing parents a fortune have grown, not that the companies that make and market them are complaining. One game that relies heavily on these add-ons is the Smurfs’ Village app — based on the popular Smurfs books and films — which encourages players to collect the ‘game currency’ of Smurfberries. Smurfberries can be used for several different things throughout the game, such as purchasing special buildings or speeding up the time it takes to grow crops. But these virtual berries are bought with real money: a small Smurfberry bush costs £2.99 while a wagon-load is £69.99. Both can be bought with just a tap of a finger. Similarly, even in the highly popular Angry Birds games, which David Cameron once admitted to playing, a variety of ‘in-app’ purchases are now available to buy on a game that was once completely free. No wonder more and more parents — who often fall back on an iPad as an electronic nanny at the busiest times of the day — are angry about the cynicism of firms that produce games marketed at children which sneakily encourage the purchase of expensive extras. The Drager family from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were caught out by these enticing add-ons. In December, seven-year-old Jack Drager ran up a £1,300 bill on the family iPad in just four days after his parents downloaded the free Tap Zoo app for him. The aim of the game is to turn a zoo which starts with just one animal into a world-class safari park. Yet the Drager family didn’t realise that some of the add-ons, such as a trunk of coins which can be used to buy new animals, cost up to £79.99 each — and that Jack had been collecting them. Doug Crossan, a 48-year-old father from Somerset, revealed that his 13-year-old son Cameron (pictured) had incurred an astonishing £3,700 bill for games bought from Apple¿s online App Store . His mother Heidi Drager, 32, echoes the lament of many others stung by these charges when she says: ‘It was a free download. We read the terms and conditions but I just didn’t see the warning saying there were costs involved.’ The Tiny Monsters game works along the same lines: gamers collect and create monsters to fill a virtual island. Last September, six-year-old Will Smith, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, ran up £2,000 on his grandfather’s credit card while playing the game. Without his grandfather realising, Will bought virtual food and coins costing up to £70 each time. After legal actions in America, free games must now warn users if they offer options to buy extras — though these often appear buried in the small print of the Terms & Conditions — and a password must be entered on the first purchase that’s made. After that first purchase, however, there is still a 15-minute window when other things can be bought without the password being re-entered — but Apple say this window can be removed by changing the game’s settings. A spokesman said: ‘Parents can easily use our parental-control settings to restrict app downloading and turn off in-app purchasing. But it is vital parents keep their passwords safe and do not share them with  their children.’ Of course, by giving children unrestricted access to their iPads and smart phones, parents are at least partly to blame, and some will wonder why they allow young children to play with a cutting edge and expensive gadget like an iPad in the first place. But many are simply unaware of the risks of their child accruing a huge bill, or not sufficiently tech-savvy to activate the controls on their phones and iPads which restrict such purchases. Surely, though, the real finger of blame should be pointed at the multi-billion-pound firms whose greed allows children to throw away thousands of pounds of their parents’ money on a computer game.","Doug Crossan, 48, revealed son Cameron, 13, incurred £3,700 bill .

But this hot cross bun that was baked in 1821 is a cherished treasure that has been passed down through five generations. The Easter treat was baked on Good Friday in 1821 and still has a cross on the top. The fruity bun, which has even retained its smell, was made by Nancy's great, great, great grandfather, William Skinner, who owned a bakery in London . Nancy said: 'It's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every Good Friday' Nancy Titman cradles the 192-year-old bun - which shows no trace of mould . Nancy Titman, 94, keeps the 192-year-old bun in a box and, although undoubtedly past its sell-by-date, still shows no traces of mould. The . fruity bun, which has even retained its smell, was made by Nancy's . great, great, great grandfather, William Skinner, who owned a bakery in . London. It was made in the same year as Napolean died, George IV was crowned king, poet John Keats passed away and John Constable painted his famous Hay Wain picture. 'It's a relic which has been passed down through our family and we get it out every Good Friday,' said Nancy. 'It is rock hard like a fossil and the currants have disintegrated, but it still smells and looks like a hot cross bun, with the cross on the top.' Nancy was given the bun, which has the date March 1821 on the base, by her mother. Now she plans to hand it down to her own daughter, Anthea and her 10-year-old granddaughter, Hannah. 'My mum said our ancestors worked in a baker's shop and they believed buns baked on Good Friday didn't go mouldy, which this has proved,' added Nancy, from Deeping St James, Lincolnshire. 'I think it was kept as it was made on . Good Friday, which was a very special day. It has been preserved in a . box for nearly 200 years now. The practice of eating special small cakes during Spring dates back at least to the ancient Greeks. The English custom of eating spiced buns on Good Friday was perhaps institutionalized in Tudor times, when a London bylaw was introduced forbidding the sale of such buns except on Good Friday, at Christmas, and at burials. English folklore suggests that sharing a hot cross bun would ensure friendship throughout the coming year. If taken on a voyage hot cross buns are said to protect against shipwreck. If hung in a kitchen they are thought to protect against fires and ensure that all breads turn out perfectly. 'It's a rather unusual family heirloom, but I'm proud of it and we still get the bun out of its box every Easter.' Hot cross buns with their combination of sweet, spicy and fruity flavours first became popular in Tudor times and have long been an Easter tradition, with the pastry cross symbolising the crucifixion. In the 19th century many people believed that hot cross buns baked on Good Friday would not go mouldy and had special healing powers. They thought the buns could be used as a cure for medical complaints such as indigestion. Some people even grated fossilized remains of the Easter snack on wounds to help them heal or mixed it with water to make medicine. The preserved bun has astonished bakers, who can't believe it has survived so long. Fresh hot cross buns usually only last for a few days before they start to go off. Conrad Taylor, owner of Holmelea Bakery, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, said: 'It's quite amazing that it has survived for so long and extremely unusual. 'I've been told that you can varnish buns to keep the air out and stop them going mouldy, but I haven't heard of bakery products surviving without that.'","Made in same year that Napolean died and George IV was crowned king .

The economy will grow by more than expected this year but the crisis in the euro is ‘a major risk’ to Britain, the Chancellor said today. George Osborne said growth forecasts for 2012 have been nudged up from a paltry 0.7 per cent to a still feeble 0.8 per cent. Delivering his third Budget, he said Britain would ‘avoid a technical recession’ with a return to growth in the first quarter of the year. Scroll down for video . Mr Osborne said the economy has ‘carried a little more momentum into the New Year than previously anticipated’. He predicted growth of 2 per cent next year, 2.7 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in both 2015 and 2016. In a sign that the battered public . finances are improving, the Chancellor said the government would borrow . £126 billion this year – slightly less than the £127 billion predicted . in November. Grin and bear it: The news was depressing for Osborne, pictured today . The deficit will then fall to £120 billion next year, then £98 billion, £75 billion, £52 billion and £21 billion in 2016-17. ‘So in total, borrowing is £11 . billion less than I last forecast in the Autumn,’ said Mr Osborne. ‘This . will be used to pay down debt.’ But with the single currency still in . crisis, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury watchdog Mr . Osborne set up to stop Chancellors fiddling the figures, said it now . expects the eurozone to shrink by 0.3 per cent this year. It previously . expected 0.5 per cent growth. ‘Of course, Britain is not immune . from these developments in our largest export markets,’ said Mr Osborne. ‘And the OBR say today that ""the situation in the euro area remains a . major risk to our forecast"". ‘Another risk they identify is a . ""further spike in oil prices"", and there is no doubt that the high oil . price - driven both by real demand and the Iranian situation - is of . great concern across the world.’ Howard Archer, chief UK economist at . IHS Global Insight, said: ‘The new forecasts from the OBR provide a rare . recent luxury for a UK Chancellor with the growth forecasts being . essentially unchanged from those contained in last November’s Autumn . Statement and the projected public finance shortfalls trimmed for the . next five years. ‘This is of welcome relief to the . Chancellor and spares him having to tighten overall fiscal policy . further. Indeed, the Chancellor has indicated that the budget is . fiscally neutral over the next five years. ‘Having said that projected GDP . growth of 0.8 per cent in 2012 is still worryingly weak and hardly a . matter for celebration. And the very disappointing public finance data . for February itself highlights that there are serious risk to the . government meeting its fiscal targets.’ The February figures – published just three hours before the Budget – showed that the government borrowed £15.2bn in February. Warning: Fitch Ratings last week issued a warning that the UK is facing losing its AAA credit rating within the next two years . That was nearly double the £8bn expected and the £8.9bn shortfall clocked up in the same month last year. It meant that the deficit for the . first 11 months of the fiscal year was £110bn, according to the Office . for National Statistics, compared with £118.9bn last time around. The unexpected surge in borrowing made grim reading for Mr Osborne as he put the finishing touches to his third Budget speech. The towering national debt also jumped to £995bn – around £40,000 per household. Philip Shaw, chief UK economist at .

This will be worth around £600. Speaking to the Commons, the Chancellor said individual servicemen and women would benefit from his budget. 'We will fund an extra £100million of improvements in the accommodation of our armed forces and their families,' he said. 'I will also double the families . welfare grant which is used to provide additional support to the . families left behind when people deploy. 'We've already doubled the operational allowance.

The potential of a new airport in the Thames estuary a step closer after Mr Osborne warned that Britain needed to  ‘confront the lack of airport capacity’ in the South East of England. The Government aviation review is currently looking at the project - dubbed 'Boris island' after London Mayor Boris Johnson. The £50billion airport would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually. Mr Osborne’s comments are also set to anger environmentalists and fuel concerns that the Government is softening on its opposition to the expansion of Heathrow airport. The relaxation of planning law is seen as a sign of approval for a new airport to the east of London . The £50billion airport would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually. Mr Osborne said: 'We're the first British government to set out in a National Infrastructure Plan the projects we are going to prioritise in the coming decade. 'The roads, railways, clean energy and water, and broadband networks we need are all identified. 'I also believe this country must confront the lack of airport capacity in the South East of England - we cannot cut ourselves off from the fastest growing cities in the world. 'The Transport Secretary will set out Government thinking later this summer. Further investment is expected in London's transport system on top of what has already been done such as Crossrail . 'We want to look at the opportunities for increasing the role of private investment in the road network, learning lessons from the water industry. 'I confirm today that Network Rail will extend the Northern Hub, adding to the electrification of the Transpennine rail route, by upgrading the Hope Valley line between Manchester and Sheffield - and improving the Manchester to Preston and Blackpool, and Manchester to Bradford lines. 'For years, transport investment in the north of England was neglected. Not under this Coalition Government. 'We are working with our great cities to devolve decision-making powers - and we are striking a ground-breaking deal with Manchester to support £1.2 billion in growth-enhancing infrastructure. Speaking . about changes in planning law, the Chancellor said: 'Of course, those . projects succeeded because they were not killed off by the planning . system. 'You can't earn your . future if you can't get planning permission. Global businesses have . diverted specific investments that would have created hundreds of jobs . in some of the most deprived communities in Britain to countries like . Germany and the Netherlands, because they couldn't get planning . permission here. 'That is unacceptable. 'Next . week my Right Honourable Friends the Communities Secretary and the . Planning Minister will publish the results of our overhaul of planning . regulation. 'We're replacing . 1,000 pages of guidance with just 50 pages. We're introducing a . presumption in favour of sustainable development; . 'While . protecting our most precious environments.

David Cameron vowed to protect the most precious parts of the UK's countryside which could include areas such as the Ribble Valley Area of outstanding Natural Beauty . 'So we will introduce legislation limited to relaxing the Sunday trading laws for eight Sundays only, starting on July 22.' Adam Royle, spokesman for the Campaign . to Protect Rural England, said Mr Osborne's reference to protecting . 'the most precious environments' could spell bad news for the wider . countryside. 'From the Chancellor's words we fear the long-standing protection for the wider countryside will be abandoned. 'That would mean that 55per cent of . English countryside, including many locally loved green spaces, could be . placed at the mercy of developers. 'Also extremely worrying is the . suggestion that communities may not be given any time to ensure their . local plans conform to the new framework. 'This could leave more then one third . of areas that don't currently have a plan exposed to a crude . 'presumption in favour of sustainable development'.' Friends of the Earth's executive . director Andy Atkins said: 'Osborne says new planning rules will protect . our most precious environments but unless they address the . environmental challenges we all face, ministers will pave the way for a . development free-for-all that will cost us all a fortune in the long . run. 'Bringing in the changes will put local plans at risk and allow developers to ride roughshod over local communities.' Determined: The PM shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul, saying he wants a Victorian-style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth . Accepting . there would be ‘costs and protests’, Mr Cameron shrugged off opposition . to the planning overhaul, saying he wants a Victorian-style blitz on . new infrastructure building to boost growth. He warned that failure to act would condemn Britain to being a second-rate nation. But . his plans were quickly condemned by rural groups and green campaigners . as a blueprint for ‘disfiguring’ the countryside that would damage the . fabric of Britain. In a . speech at the Institute of Civil Engineering in London, the Prime . Minister vowed to overcome what he called a ‘failure of nerve’ on . planning. Mr Cameron . rejected calls by groups such as the National Trust to tear up its new . National Planning Policy Framework, due shortly, saying it would provide . ‘the biggest simplification of our bureaucratic, top-down planning laws . in 60 years’. He said . the Government would protect green belts and national parks, but added: . ‘We also urgently need to find places where we are prepared to allow . significant new growth to happen.’ Vowing to recreate a ‘visionary plan’ from 1944 to build new towns across the South East, Mr Cameron said: . ‘The growth of our towns and cities has been held back by a planning . system which has encouraged development of the wrong sort in the wrong . places.’ He said . places such as Hampstead Garden Suburb, Letchworth and Welwyn Garden . City were ‘not perfect but popular’ and the coalition would seek to . build more towns that were ‘green, planned, secure, with gardens, places . to play and characterful houses, not just car-dominated concrete . grids’. Mr Cameron said the Government would begin consulting later this year ‘on how to apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth, in places people want to live’. He added: ‘We must get our planning system fit for purpose. It needs to be quick. It needs to be easier to use. And it needs to better support growth, jobs and homes.’ The Prime Minister said the Government needed to be similarly ‘bold’ about air transport too. Risking a fresh row with the Liberal Democrats, who oppose all airport expansion in the South East, he said: ‘I’m not blind to the need to increase airport capacity, particularly in the South East. ‘We need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel, not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai.’ The Tories have ruled out a third runway at Heathrow but Mr Cameron made warm noises about building a new international hub airport East of London. ‘Yes, this will be controversial. We . will be bringing forward options in our aviation strategy which will . include an examination of the pros and cons of a new airport in the . Thames estuary.’ He praised Boris Johnson, saying he had ‘done very well in driving forward this agenda’. Mr Cameron also unveiled £150million of new investment in ‘shovel ready’ building projects that already have planning permission but are stalled by lack of investment. Chancellor George Osborne will also be announcing ten ‘super-connected’ cities that are to have universal access to super-fast broadband as part of the drive to improve telecommunications. Neil Sinden, Director of Policy for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, attacked the plans for building in the countryside. He said: ‘If the Government’s planning reforms remain unchanged from the draft published last year, pressure for sprawling development is precisely what we can expect. ‘Unless the final planning framework recognises the intrinsic value of our countryside as a whole, we fear a rash of sporadic and inappropriate development across the country, disfiguring the rural landscape which is so valued by local communities.’ But Mr Cameron vowed to stand up to the critics. ‘There will be costs and protests. And I am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage,’ he said. ‘I can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already.’ But he added: ‘We will take difficult decisions, we will risk short-term unpopularity. ‘We will hold fast to our vision in the face of vested interests, because our motivation and our duty is to protect and champion the national interest.’","Move signals support for airport in the Thames Estuary .

Stamp duty on all homes that cost more than £2million will soar to seven per cent from tonight, George Osborne announced in a tax grab on the wealthy. A new 15 per cent tax will also be imposed on all properties over £2million which are bought via a company in an attempt to close a loophole. Mr Osborne said the clampdown on stamp duty avoidance will help raise five times more than the 50p tax which 'may raise nothing at all'. The Chancellor added that the Government will consult on a 'mansion tax' - an annual charge on properties worth at least £2million - in a concession to the Liberal Democrats . New rate: Homes such as these will be subject to the new rate. The move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £1m . The seven per cent tax will mean a . minimum tax contribution of £140,000 by someone buying a residential . house costing £2m or more. The move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £1m. The new rate will allow the . Government to milk high-end wealth particularly in expensive enclaves of . London, appealing to 'squeezed middle' voters. However, estate agents have warned the raid on £2million plus homes could hit all homeowners and buyers by triggering a slowdown in the areas of the property market which have been vital to supporting prices. They said the Chancellor risks 'killing . the goose that lays the golden egg' at a time when much of the housing . market remains flat elsewhere. Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that he was determined to crackdown on property tax avoidance - and close a loophole that has allowed wealthy homeowners to dodge stamp duty by placing their properties in overseas tax shelters. Clampdown: Mr Osborne unveiled a crackdown on Stamp Duty tax avoidance in his budget today . The average asking price in one . exclusive corner of London, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, . hit £2m for the first time this week. A . decade ago, the average asking price in the area was just £650,000. Those paying the new rate of stamp duty now face bills of at least . £140,000 if the new 7% rate is implemented. Before 1997 they would have paid little more than £20,000 . because stamp duty was a flat 1 per cent. There are thought to be around 80,000 homes in Britain worth £2million or more. The price of homes such as those in London's most expensive boroughs has shot up in recent years, partly due to an influx of foreign wealth. Throughout the capital, average prices were typically £455,159, up 7.3% year-on-year. Overall Britain is set for a house price boom, a Bank of England expert predicted yesterday. Demand will rise as a result of our ageing population, an influx of immigrants and a record low in the number of new houses being built. More than £100billion of property in . central London alone has been placed offshore beyond the reach of the . taxman, costing the nation billions in lost revenue. The Chancellor said: 'If you buy a property in Britain . that is used for residential purposes, then we will expect stamp duty to . be paid. That is the clear intention of Parliament. 'I will not hesitate to move swiftly, . without notice and retrospectively if inappropriate ways around these . new rules are found. People have been warned.' He added: 'It is fair when . money is tight, and so many families could do with help, that those . buying the most expensive homes contribute more. 'From midnight tonight, we will introduce a new Stamp Duty Land Tax rate of 7 per cent on properties worth more than £2 million.' A Land Registry inventory of 18,700 . title deeds shows that in some areas of London more than one in 20 . properties are owned offshore. The dodge has spread across the country, . with Manchester, Leeds, Derby and even Torbay among the locations for . properties held in tax havens. The . schemes enable the rich to avoid stamp duty, as long as they are not . resident or domiciled here for tax. Their heirs also avoid inheritance . tax, charged at 40 per cent. Experts . say the loophole is cheating the Treasury out of up to £500million a . year in stamp duty and as much as £1.3billion in inheritance tax. Mr Osborne said that the crackdown on avoidance and new taxes on the wealthy would raise five times more than the 50p tax which brought in just £1bn a year. It is being replaced with a 45p tax. He said: 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that. 'And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I've announced today, we'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society. 'So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again.' Today's move will avoid a costly . general revaluation of homes across the country that would have been . required if the Lib Dem's 'mansion tax' or annual levy was implemented. Peter Rollings, chief executive of . estate agent Marsh and Parsons, said the new stamp duty band could hit . the property market at all levels. 'Not only will this policy . disproportionately target London, where house prices are in a league of . their own, it risks killing the goose that lays the golden egg. 'With the property market still far . from healthy, we need to see the Government supporting activity at all . levels, rather adding yet another tax burden.' London homes have been vital in . keeping average prices up, with the capital often viewed as the most . 'healthy' and stable area at a time when the housing market generally . remains weak and patchy. Statistics from the Land Registry show that the new top rate of stamp duty will overwhelmingly hit London buyers. In November – the latest month for . which figures are available – 121 homes were bought for more than . £2million in England and Wales and 98 of these were in London. The thresholds: How Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) hits housebuyers . Money raised by the new stamp duty . level will be used to plug the £3bn gap in public finances as the . Chancellor also announces a rise in the income tax base threshold to . £9,205. Mr Osborne’s stamp duty shake-up arrives just a few days before first-time buyers lose a generous exemption from the tax. The . two-year holiday, which was introduced by Labour’s Alistair Darling in . his final Budget, covered properties worth up to £250,000. The . 7 per cent stamp duty band is a watered-down version of Liberal . Democrat plans for a mansion tax – pushed by Business Secretary Vince . Cable yesterday. The National Association of Estate Agents said the Government had missed an opportunity to completely overhaul the 'outdated' stamp duty system, a tax which is seen as causing distortions in the market. NAEA president Wendy Evans-Scott said: 'To reinvigorate this struggling market will require specific stimulus across the entire housing spectrum to help people buy and sell homes, not further penalties on those able to do so.' Former NAEA president Trevor Kent said every homeowner would be hit by the new top-end tax, with 70 per cent of first-time buyers relying on the progression of a 'chain' of sales. He said: 'Higher stamp duty always results in property price pressure, in this scenario there is little doubt that prices will fall across the board. Some may think ‘great’, but mortgage lenders will not - they rely on the expectation of a gentle long-term rise to safeguard their loans.' Mr Kent predicted that lenders would generally start demanding higher deposits to protect themselves if prices dipped.","7 per cent top band for stamp duty on homes costing £2million or more .

George Osborne leaves Downing Street this morning before unveiling the moves to raise the income tax threshold . Millions of workers will be hundreds of pounds a year better off after the income tax threshold was raised by Chancellor George Osborne in his budget speech today. Some 23 millions basic rate taxpayers will see their personal allowance - the amount they can earn before paying tax - rise to £9,205 from April 2013. The figure will then rise again to £10,000 in April 2014. The move will lift two million people out of paying income tax all together. In total, from April next year the average worker earning under £100,000 will save £179 a year. By 2014 they will save £250 a year. And 23 million basic rate taxpayers will take home an extra £346 a year when the allowance rises to  £9,205. They will then take home even more when it increases again to £10,000. Many of those expected to be completely lifted out of paying tax will be women doing part-time jobs, as well as youngsters with weekend jobs and semi-retired elderly workers. The tax reductions have been brought in a year earlier than planned after pressure from the Liberal Democrats keen to show that they are helping low and middle income earners. Raising the personal allowance will cost the Treasury around £3bn a year. But Mr Osborne said today that the savings would be made elsewhere. Speaking today in the House of Commons, Mr Osborne said that the Government would save money by cutting waste. He also announce a new personal tax statement that will show people what the Government is spending their money on. Mr Osborne said the Budget will support working families and those looking for work and 'unashamedly back business'. The Budget will 'reaffirm our unwavering commitment' to deal with debt,' he added. He said: 'Mr Deputy Speaker, that brings me on to the personal allowance - and central goal of this Budget: which is to support working families. 'This Coalition Government believes that the best way to support working people on the lowest incomes is to take them out of tax altogether. 'And the best way of getting money directly into pockets of working families on middle incomes is to increase the amount of their earnings they can keep before they pay tax. 'That is why this Government has set itself the goal of raising the personal tax free allowance to £10,000 - and we've promised real increases every year to reach that. Tax breaks: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne delivers his Budget statement to the House of Commons today . Support: George Osborne delivers his budget speech on income tax to the House of Commons today as David Cameron and Nick Clegg look on . 'In my last two Budgets, we have made great strides forward. 'We need a tax system that supports work. Two hundred years Adam Smith set out a tax system of taxation and those principles remain today. 'We will take low paid people out of the tax system all together.' Mr Osborne said that the increases have taken over a million low income people out of tax.He added: ' I am announcing the largest ever increase in the personal allowance - the amount people can earn tax free. From next April that amount will increase by £1,100. 'Every working person on low or middle incomes will benefit. People will be able to earn up to £9,205 before they have to pay any tax. Millions of working people will be £220 better off every year. That's £170 better off after inflation. 'Because higher rate earners will also benefit, 24 million people earning less than £100,000 a year will gain from this measure. We are in touching distance of the goal of £10,000 personal allowance that we all share. 'And I can tell the country that as a result of our budgets, people working full time on the minimum wage, will have seen their income tax bill cut in half. And this coalition Government will have taken two million people on the lowest incomes out of tax altogether. Raising the threshold: Many of those lifted out of paying tax all together are expected to be women in part time jobs (file picture) Low paid workers and young people who take weekend jobs while they study will also benefit from the higher personal tax allowance (file picture) Mr Osborne said that the Government . has not settled for a 'do nothing' Budget. He added: 'We have not ducked the difficult choices - we've taken them head on. A competitive top rate of tax. 'More revenues from those best able to pay. Fewer reliefs. A tax cut for . working people. Support for families. Low income earners taken out of . tax altogether. 'Alongside it, one of the lowest . rates of business tax in the world. A simpler tax code. And a country . where its citizens know the tax they are paying - and what they are . paying it for. 'We have achieved all this - and kept . to our deficit plan. Let us be resolved. No people will strive as the . British will strive. No country will adapt as the British will adapt. No . country will value those who work as we will value them.' Mr Osborne concluded his speech to rapturous applause by . saying: 'Together, the British people will share in the effort and share . the rewards. This country borrowed its way into trouble. Now we're . going to earn our way out. I commend this Budget to the House. The measures are being seen as the . centre piece of Mr Osborne's budget and ones that will bring political . support from cash-strapped families and low income workers. Measure . to raise the income tax threshold will be seen as  a major victory for . the Lib Dems who have lobbied for the move. Nick Clegg took the unusual . step in January of publicly calling for the rise. Under the Coalition deal put in place after the last general election in 2010, the allowance had been due to rise from £6,475 to £10,000 by 2015. It previously only rose in line with inflation or rises in wages. The tax-free allowance currently stands at £7,475 and will increase to £8,105 this April. It was due to rise to £8,735 in April 2013, but is now expected to rise to about £9,000. The £9,000 bracket was not due to come into effect until 2014 but is now being implemented a year earlier than planned. The £10,000 allowance will also be brought forward a year and rolled out from 2014. Pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander as they arrived at Downing Street today ahead of the budget . Raising the income tax threshold will cost the Treasury £3bn a year but Mr Osborne said the losses will be covered by 'efficiency' savings elsewhere . Each £100 increase in the personal allowance, above inflation, costs the Exchequer £500 million. Many of the savings are expected to be made in other areas such as cuts in public spending. The Chancellor also said that lower government spending means he can put some money back in people's pockets. The Government has been trying to reduce overall government spending which spiralled out of control after Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007. Mr Osborne also said he will press ahead with a cut in Labour’s 50p top rate of tax, paid on income over £150,000, to 45p, despite polls suggesting two-thirds of Conservative voters oppose the move. Mr Osborne believes that the Budget will outline a significant package of 'tax reform and simplification'. He said that the introduction of the 50p higher rate of tax had caused 'massive distortion' in the tax system. 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing.' The Chancellor said the the 50p tax rate had raised just a third of the £3bn the Labour government claimed that it would. Labour leader Ed Miliband tore into the Budget today after George Osborne announced plans to cut the top rate of income tax. He told MPs: 'After today's Budget, millions will be paying more while millionaires pay less.' The Chancellor had 'failed the fairness test' by choosing to make his priority tax cuts for the wealthiest, he added. 'In his response to the statement, Mr Miliband told the Commons it marked the end of the Government's claim that 'we are all in it together'. The Labour leader warned Mr Osborne: 'Every time in the future you try to justify an unfair decision by saying 'Times are tough', we will remind you that you are a man who chose to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on those who need it least.' He blasted the Government for 'wrong choices, wrong priorities, wrong values', claiming it was 'out of touch', and adding: 'Same old Tories.' Mr Miliband turned his fire on Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, whom he branded 'the hapless accomplice'. Mr Miliband added: 'Only the Lib Dems could be dumb enough to think George Osborne's Budget is a Robin Hood Budget - Calamity Clegg strikes again.' Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: 'The Chancellor's Budget has given a helping hand-out to his rich friends in the City and delivered a slap in the face to the unemployed and low-paid families. 'Osborne should be delivering policies to get the 2.67 million unemployed people back into work and economically active. Instead, the Government's cuts agenda is making the situation worse by adding to those numbers month by month.' Gillian Guy, chief executive at national charity Citizens Advice, said: 'Raising the personal tax allowance is an empty gesture to struggling families on low wages. 'Poorer working families who get housing and council tax benefits will not get all of the money in their pocket, because as their income goes up, their benefits will go down.'","Personal allowance to rise to £9,205 from April 2013 and £10,000 in 2014 .

Reneged: MPs said the Prime Minister faces a backlash on plans to legalise gay marriage as members resign in mass protest . David Cameron is facing a backlash over his support for gay marriage from within his own party as members desert Tory ranks in droves, it emerged today. Large numbers of activists are resigning or refusing to renew their membership in protest at the Government's plans to equalise marriage, MPs say. It is claimed those quitting range from a handful in some seats to dozens in others and more than a hundred in some. Although Tory party headquarters has no up-to-date record of membership, the evidence of MPs points to many hundreds if not thousands, of deserters. 'This is the straw that broke the camel's back,' one MP told The Times. David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate and an opponent of gay marriage, said: 'There's serious unrest in the grass roots. 'You cannot avoid the fact that the troops are unhappy. People are drifting away.' It comes as Mr Cameron dashed Tory hopes of a tax break for married couples in next month’s Budget. A senior Government source said the Prime Minister had delayed the manifesto promise yet again after talks with George Osborne. The Chancellor does not want the issue of the tax break to distract from the Budget’s focus on the economy. The decision will dismay many Tories who were demanding action on the flagship pledge. It was hoped that the tax break would help to quell the anger over the decision to press ahead with a divisive vote on gay marriage next week. Former leader Iain Duncan Smith, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are among the Cabinet ministers who have lobbied Mr Cameron to act on tax for married couples. They argued that it was vital to bring the measure in now, so married couples would feel the benefit before the election – warning that it would be dismissed as a ‘token’ gesture if it was delayed again. Malcolm Higgs and Don Rainbow (in white) were one of the first gay couples to tie the knot in England. The ceremony was held in Richmond, west London . Pledge: Mr Osborne has always been less enthusiastic about the proposal, which was initially included in the party's election manifesto . Pressure: Former leader Iain Duncan Smith, left, Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling, right, and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are . among the Cabinet ministers who have lobbied Mr Cameron to act . A senior Government source last night . said the Prime Minister – who was yesterday on a visit to Monrovia, . Liberia – remained committed to the policy, but agreed to a delay after . talks with Mr Osborne, who has always been less enthusiastic. ‘The recognition of marriage in the . tax system will be put forward,’ the source said, adding, ‘It won’t be . in this Budget but it will be in this Parliament,’ suggesting it will be . enacted before the next election, due in 2015. The Government's gay marriage proposals do not go far enough, according to a poll of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The controversial introduction of same-sex marriage will be put to a Commons vote next week. But in a survey, six out of 10 gay people said the Government's plans would not create 'equal marriage', and that equality would only be achieved when churches, synagogues and mosques are required to carry out same-sex weddings. The poll found that half of all LGBT people expect the courts to remove the remaining protections on places of worship. Nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) believed Prime Minister David Cameron was trying to extend marriage to LGBT people to make the Tories look more compassionate rather than because of his convictions. The poll - which questioned more than 500 LGBT people - was commissioned by the Coalition for Marriage - an alliance of groups and individuals opposed to attempts to redefine marriage. ‘It’s . an agenda the Prime Minister is very committed to,’ the source said. ‘It will be put forward – it is right to recognise marriage and . recognise commitment. It’s in the Coalition agreement and I can confirm . it will be going ahead.’ Under Mr Cameron’s plans, it is . expected that one member of a married couple or civil partnership would . be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free personal allowance, . reducing their partner’s tax bill. This would be worth about £150 a year . to basic rate taxpayers. On Thursday, the Daily Mail reported . that Mr Cameron was signalling the tax break would be left out as the . Government struggles to control spending. Confirmation of the delay . comes days after Nick Clegg poured scorn on the idea of the tax break. He said people would think it ‘odd’ to help families on the basis of whether they were married or not. The . Lib Dem leader, whose MPs will be allowed to abstain on the break when . it does comes to parliament, said: ‘The more people will look at this, . the more they will think – why should you be giving, whatever it is, £3 a . week to married couples.’ The Prime Minister is said to disagree with those Tories who say acting on marriage tax was a ‘quid pro quo’ for forcing through gay marriage. A source said: ‘There is a link between the two in that he believes strongly in both for similar reasons. If two people want to commit to each other and get married, and if they’re gay, they should be able to. ‘He also believes in recognising commitment in the tax system. There is a connection but there is not a quid pro quo.’ The source said Mr Cameron acknowledged that gay marriage was a ‘difficult’  issue for some in the Conservative party but said that he was ‘proud’ to be championing it. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Our complicated tax system makes it harder for people to start a family and often discriminates against married couples. 'Introducing an allowance that lets families share some of their personal allowance would help tackle poverty and reduce the perverse disincentives created by our dysfunctional tax code. 'The Government could go much further and reform our tax system to help everybody who is struggling with the cost of living, not just married couples.'","Activists are resigning or refusing to renew their membership over issue .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 08:07 EST, 21 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 21 March 2012 . Budget plans: Chancellor George Osborne holds up his red Ministerial Box outside 11 Downing Street today . Every taxpayer is to get a personal annual statement revealing how each pound taken from them by the Revenue is spent, the Chancellor announced in his budget today. George Osborne said every worker has the right to know how their taxes are spent once the money enters the public purse. From 2014 every taxpayer will receive a breakdown of how much they've paid and what the Government spends. The Chancellor told the House of Commons today that he will introduce a 'simple and transparent' tax system. He said: 'In the information age people should know what tax they're paying and what their money is being spent on. 'The idea was introduced by my Right Honorable from Ipswich and I think it's an excellent idea and I intend to put it into practice. 'This will be effective from 2014.' In some cases, the results are likely to prove startling. A higher-rate taxpayer earning £50,000 this year would be told they paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance – of which around a third, £4,727.67, is spent on welfare. At the same time, £2,469.68 is spent on health, £1,848.73 on education, £818.52 on defence and £705.62 on public order and safety. A further £141.12 is given to foreign aid and £70.56 is handed to the EU. A Treasury source said: ‘It’s quite right that people know how much tax they pay and  what it’s spent on.’ The Chancellor believes that revealing exactly how the money from Britain’s 29million taxpayers is used will change for ever public attitudes to Government spending. Tory ministers are also hopeful that if the public is more aware of how much they really contribute, they will be more inclined to vote for parties which favour lower taxes. And they believe making more taxpayers aware that the basic rate is 31p, not 20p – once national insurance is included – would help transform voters’ relationship with the state. The Chancellor is also considering even more radical reform, which would see income tax and National Insurance merged. As well as saving businesses billions in administration costs, Labour would not be able to use increased National Insurance contributions as a politically cost-free way of raising money to spend in areas such as the NHS. Treasury Minister David Gauke said: ‘For a lot of people, the tax line on their pay slip is the only time they see just how much they’re paying in tax, but the Government doesn’t think that’s good enough. Breakdown: A mocked-up form for a Mr J Smith and released by the Treasury shows how the new style of personal statements which every taxpayer is set to receive could look . ‘We want to make tax more transparent and we want people to be more engaged with their own tax affairs. We plan to lift the lid on tax so that people understand how much they are paying, what their overall tax rate is and what they should be paying.’ Conservative MP Ben Gummer, who has championed the idea of personal statements, said: ‘Few of us would part with more than a few pence without a record of how it was spent. From supermarket receipts to electricity bills, we expect an itemised breakdown of where our money goes. ‘Yet for our largest monthly payment, to the taxman, we get just two numbers printed on a pay slip. We are not told the overall value of our taxation obligation. ‘We are not told what proportion of our income it represents. Crucially, we are not told how the Government spends the money we are made to give it. This must change. ‘Just as we are under an obligation to pay tax, the Government should be obliged to tell us how it spends our money. ‘It . is a simple idea that could change the way we do politics. For the . first time people will get a real feel for the relative distribution of . their taxes. ‘Tax statements could be implemented quickly and cheaply. They help the Government merge income tax and National Insurance and do more than anything else to help it achieve transparency in the tax system.’ In tomorrow’s Budget, the Chancellor will announce that from 2014/15, 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement. They will be made up of the  eight million who fill out a self assessment form each year along with the 12million who receive a Treasury notice telling them of a change in their tax code. The scheme will then be rolled out to the remaining nine million taxpayers at a later date. Labour is likely to protest that the statements reveal nothing about the benefits they get from public spending, such as  NHS treatment or child benefit. Breakdown of spending: A higher-rate taxpayer earning £50,000 this year will learn they paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance - of which around a third, £4,727.67, goes on welfare . However, the Treasury will argue making such a calculation would be so complicated that it would be impossible to produce. Administering the new system is expected to cost around £800,000 a year. Yesterday it emerged that former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson was back in 11 Downing Street a fortnight ago to celebrate his 80th birthday and advise the Chancellor on tax reform. In his famous 1988 budget, Lord Lawson slashed the top rate of income tax from 60p to 40p – a move that caused such an outcry that the House of Commons sitting had to be suspended. The whole truth: The Chancellor, pictured visiting a branch of Barclays bank in London today, believes that revealing exactly how taxes are used will change public attitudes to Government spending . Your money: Mr Osborne, pictured talking to bank workers in South London, will announce that from 2014/15, 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement . Money troubles: The Prime Minister, pictured at a Budget meeting with Treasury secretary Danny Alexander, is said to still be wavering over whether to indicate that top rate of tax will come down further to 40p in 2014 . Mr Osborne is tomorrow expected to announce he is cutting Labour’s 50p top rate to 45p from April next year, as well as raising the income tax threshold for 23million basic rate taxpayers to around £9,000. He is also expected to pledge a review of alternative wealth taxes to replace the 50p rate, which will hit the best off twice as  hard. The Lib Dems are pushing for a mansion tax on homes worth £2million or more, or a levy on ‘unearned wealth’. The Prime Minister and Mr Osborne were said last night to be wavering over whether to indicate they will bring the top rate of  tax down further to 40p in 2014, or leave it until the next Budget, following a mixed reaction to leaks of the plan. Government sources said the pair were still thrashing out final details of tomorrow’s Budget with Nick Clegg and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander at a meeting yesterday.","Taxpayers earning £50,000 will have paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance, with around a third, £4,727.67, going on welfare .

The victim of an alleged sexual assault has claimed that Brooklyn Nets star Andray Blatche watched her being attacked from the doorway of his luxury hotel suite. A 21-year-old female filed a complaint saying that she . was assaulted by someone at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia at around 4am on Tuesday. Blatche, along with two friends, were questioned and released by the Philadelphia Police Department Special Victims Unit. No charges have been brought. Scroll down for video . Denials: Brooklyn Nets forward Andray Blatche leaves the Four Seasons in Philadelphia on Tuesday after a woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by another man in his hotel suite . The alleged victim told ABC-6 Action News that Blatche did not sexually assault her but stood in the doorway of his room and watched. The woman said that 'he was aware the whole time' that she was being assaulted. Blatche, 26, denied the woman's accusations. He told the New York Post: 'I’m not worried at all. I know everything…when the truth comes out, then everybody will realize what really happened. In the meantime I can’t really have too much comments on it.' The Nets player had been with friends on Monday night at Delilah's strip club in Philadelphia, celebrating his contract extension with the Brooklyn team. Delilah's is described as a 'premiere . destination for business travelers, celebrities, and uninhibited . Philadelphians alike and home of the world's most beautiful Showgirls'. A woman, who is described as a stripper by the Post, allegedly went back with the group to the Four Seasons. She told ABC that she had been drinking but felt like she had been drugged at the club. Focused on the game: Nets forward Andray Blatche was questioned by police on Tuesday morning after an alleged sexual assault and released . The woman called police at around 3.30am to say that she had been assaulted. She was taken to a local hospital to be examined. Police who searched the hotel suite initially said a date-rape drug appeared to have been found but was later identified as another substance. In addition to Blatche, two other men, aged 41 and 25, were questioned by police. All three were later released. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Blatche was among the witnesses interviewed by police on Tuesday. Ramsey told reporters that preliminary findings of the investigation show Blatche wasn't involved. Commissioner Ramsey also took the unusual step of publicly questioning a potential rape victim's credibility. He told the New York Times: 'She was so intoxicated. She is not going to be a very good witness.' Night out: Blatche and friends were enjoying a night out at Delilah's Strip Club in Philadelphia . After news of the investigation broke, Blatche tweeted: 'Im ok and I didn't do anything jus was n the area when it happened.' He soon removed the message and instead posted: 'Gettin ready for the game.' Hours after the attack, Blatche helped the Brooklyn Nets route the Philadelphia 76ers with the final score 109 - 89. Nets coach P.J. Carlesimo had little patience for questions about Blatche's off-court issues, saying: 'He's been playing well and I expect him to play well today.' Police were waiting to talk to the woman before deciding whether to file any charges in the case, according to CBS Philly. A representative for the Four Seasons said, 'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation.' The Brooklyn Nets released the following statement on Tuesday: 'We are aware of the ongoing police investigation regarding a member of . the Brooklyn Nets.

As millions of people prepare to place their orders during 'Cyber Monday' tomorrow, customers are being urged to check they are not paying over the odds. Third-party sellers on Amazon change their prices depending on the demand for a product. Confusing: Parents shopping for the Christmas must-have toys such as Furby, pictured, may be paying more online. Furby was priced on Amazon at £84.95 - almost £25 above its recommended price . It means the price of an item can change significantly within just a few hours and leave shoppers confused about whether they are getting the best deal. The Sunday Times found the price of a Furby toy - one of 2012's most wanted gifts - went from £71.70 to £84.95 within six hours. It has a RRP of £59.99. The price of toy gun the Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail Fire was £43.99 on Wednesday but the following day was on sale for £49.11 - £15 more than it was being sold for at Tesco Direct . As the supply of a product falls - including in-demand Christmas toys - prices tend to increase. Third-party sellers on Amazon use complicated equations to price items according to supply and demand.

'You might not want to sell now; you might want to wait until a competitor who is willing to sell at a very low price has sold out.' However, other retailers said some soaring prices for the most popular items are 'outrageous'. Gary Grant, found of Entertainer, the UK's largest independent toy retailer, told the Sunday Times: 'As a company we have made the decision that we should treat all customers fairly and our online prices should reflect those offered in stores. He said the demand for Furby toys are one-third more than availability. He said: 'That's why you will see traders on Amazon selling the £60 Furby for £80, £90 or £100. It is outrageous. I'm disappointed to be seeing that.' Tomorrow - dubbed Cyber Monday - will be one of the two busiest online shopping days of the year - along with Black Friday.

"By . Simon Walters . UPDATED: . 18:52 EST, 28 January 2012 . Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott was caught up in a new row last night over claims that she fell asleep during a Westminster debate on abortion laws. The allegations surfaced after Ms Abbott’s shock resignation from a  parliamentary committee established to consider whether women should  be offered independent advice when deciding whether to terminate a  pregnancy. Yawning: Diane Abbott denies accusations she fell asleep during an important Westminster debate on abortion laws . Fellow committee member Tory MP Nadine Dorries claimed Ms Abbott’s walkout came after she played virtually no part in any of the committee’s three meetings. Ms Abbott vehemently denied nodding off. But Ms Dorries, who has campaigned for a tightening of abortion criteria, said she ‘slept through’ the first meeting, ‘didn’t turn up’ for the second and ‘arrived late’ for the third. Ms Dorries claimed that at one point, the chairman of the committee, Health Minister Anne Milton, spoke loudly to try to rouse slumbering Ms Abbott. Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson backed up Ms Dorries, saying: ‘I was virtually sitting opposite Diane Abbott at one meeting and she was definitely dropping off during part of it.’ Controversial: Labour health spokesman Ms Abbott has been the centre of a number of controversies, including allegations she posted a racist message on twitter . Rebuke: Diane Abbott was rebuked by Labour leader Ed Miliband for her 'whites divide and rule' comment on twitter . Ms Abbott and Ms Dorries clashed angrily in a showdown on BBC2’s Newsnight, during which host Kirsty Wark challenged Ms Abbott about the claims she had fallen asleep. The committee was set up last year after Ms Dorries’s call for women to be offered independent abortion advice failed to win the support of MPs. She claims charities such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service cannot guarantee to offer impartial advice because they receive money for  carrying out abortions. Critics say that Ms Dorries’s proposal could threaten a woman’s right to have a termination. When her plan failed to win backing in the Commons, the Government pledged to set up a committee to seek public opinion. It is made up of MPs from both sides of the debate. Vocal: Diane Abbott is a prominent Labour MP and a regular on political programmes . Ms Dorries said: ‘Diane’s conduct on the committee was appalling. She barely contributed. She slept through the first one, so much so that when the Minister addressed her, she had to speak up because it appeared Diane hadn’t heard because she was asleep. ‘She didn’t turn up for the second one and was late for the third one. From what I recall, her longest contribution in any of the meetings was to explain why she was late.’ Ms Abbott denied ‘storming off’ the committee. She said she had resigned because she believed it was a ‘fix’ intended to favour Ms Dorries’s views on abortion. Ms Dorries said: ‘I suspect the real reason she resigned is because when she is asked what her input is, she won’t be able to say. She is not fit to be the Opposition health spokeswoman.’ Last night a spokesman for Ms Abbott said: ‘Diane attended two meetings and, unfortunately, had to miss one. Nadine is being a bit silly when she says Diane slept through a meeting. It’s an attempt to distract from the real issues.’ Earlier this month Ms Abbott came under fire over her ‘whites divide and rule’ comment after the trial of the racist killers of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. Labour leader Ed Miliband forced her to apologise.","Tory MP brands her conduct on the committee 'appalling'

Guilty: Hotel receptionist Attila Ban, pictured at work in his uniform, has been found guilty of killing two colleagues . A hotel receptionist who killed two colleagues and then hid from police inside the bed where he dumped one of the bodies is facing life in prison after being found guilty of their murders. Attila Ban stabbed Tibor Vass, 20, before murdering Alice Adams, also 20, after participating in a threesome with the pair. The 32-year-old killer even updated his Facebook status from his hiding place during the early hours of August 10 last year as police searched for clues into the violent deaths of his co-workers, writing: 'I'd like to wake up from this nightmare.' A jury at the Old Bailey heard how performing arts student Miss Adams, who had only worked at the hotel as a receptionist for three weeks, was found fully-clothed lying on the floor of Ban's staff quarters at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow Airport, with a cushion over her face like 'a discarded rag doll'. She had been stabbed 22 times on the . front and back of her body, penetrating her heart, left lung, spleen, . stomach and diaphragm. Hungarian-born . Ban had stabbed Mr Vass twice in the heart and carried his body to a . double bed after cutting off the dead man's t-shirt and boxer shorts, . leaving him naked. The . court was told that openly gay Ban had an unrequited crush on fellow . Hungarian Mr Vass, becoming agitated in the days before the killings . after Mr Vass won a place at a university back in Hungary. Ban . had been jealous about Mr Vass’s relationships, and just days before . the killing launched an outburst at his victim during a team building . exercise when he took a picture that did not feature Ban, the court . heard. The divan bed where Attila Ban (right) dumped Tibor Voss's body and hid from police for two days . The court heard it was the sight of the pair kissing that drove Ban to murder after the group had played drinking games, took poppers - a well-known sexual stimulant - and toyed with the idea of group sex. Colleagues discovered the bloodied scene when the three receptionists failed to turn up for work the next morning, summoning police to the flat in New Road, Harlington. Detectives combed the sealed-off quarters for clues but did not discover Ban, who was named as the hotel's employee of the year in 2010, until the second day of their investigations. He was lying on another double bed after attempting to take his own life. He had tried to slit his wrists with modelling knives and electrocute himself with a hairdryer in the bath. Officers found that Ban had water and his mobile phone with him and had cut a slit in the divan bed that he hid in so he could observe the investigation. Tibor Vass was due to return to Hungary to attend university, while Alice Adams studied performing arts . 'So throughout the time of those that had been in the flat dealing with the investigation and removing the bodies, it appears Ban was concealed under the bed, no doubt able to hear everything that was said and sufficient presence of mind to keep himself concealed despite all that that was going on around him in that flat at the time.' Ban had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but the jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of the double murders. Officers had searched the loft area of the quarters after failing to find bloodied footprints leading away from the crime scene. Outside court, Detective Inspector John Finch said police had not been negligent for not looking under the bed. He said: 'I have looked back at this several times with senior management. It was such a strange and bizarre thing for a person to do. It beggars belief.' He said crime-scene examiners would lose crucial forensic evidence if they lifted up beds looking for people who were not there. Mr Finch added: 'I would not want anyone to do anything differently in the future.'","Attila Ban stabbed Tibor Vass, 20, and Alice Adams .

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 12:11 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:12 EST, 15 August 2012 . Scientists are developing new theories on how man first colonised Europe. They believe the first Europeans were two separate groups - one adept at farming, and another hunter gatherers. They also claim the spread of farming through Europe was a key part of how we became modern Europeans. Researchers say the first Europeans fell into two main group - hunter gatherers, and farmers . Researchers say new analytical . techniques are changing long-held, simplistic views about the . evolutionary history of humans in Europe. Their findings indicate that many cultural, climatic, and demographic events have shaped genetic variation among modern-day European populations and that the variety of those mechanisms is more diverse than previously thought. Recent advances in paleogenetics are providing never before seen glimpses into the complex evolution of humans in Europe, helping researchers piece together the events that ultimately created what is now known as modern man. Following the period when ice sheets were at their maximum extension across the earth - between 27,000 and 16,000 years ago - hunter-gatherer populations re-colonised most parts of Europe. Then around 8,000 years ago, the first farming populations appeared on the continent during the so-called Neolithic transition. For several thousand years, two separate modes of life coexisted in Europe: hunter-gatherer populations continued to rely on wild food resources, while farming populations had an entirely different demographic profile and lifestyle that consisted of domesticated crops and livestock, pottery, housing, and storage technology. For some decades, it was assumed that the genetic diversity of contemporary Europeans was shaped mainly during the Neolithic transition. Early Europeans were thought to fall into two main groups, farmers and hunter fatherers. New research has found the spread of farming through Europe was key to the evolution of the area. However, it now appears that it was also affected both before and after this key event. And the spread of farming is likely to have varied to a great extent by region, leading to varying impacts of migrating farmers’ and local hunter-gatherers’ genetic contributions to future populations. The study’s first author Doctor Ron Pinhasi, of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said: 'We are currently at a stage in which next-generation sequencing technologies, ancient DNA analyses, and computer simulation modelling allow us to obtain a much more accurate and detailed perspective on the nature and timing of major prehistoric processes such as the colonization of Europe by modern humans, the survival of human populations during the ice age, the Neolithic transition, and the rise and fall of complex societies and empires. 'The development of inter-disciplinary approaches is crucial to elaborate realistic models of human evolution. 'These methods and technologies hold great potential to shed new light on past genetic variation, the onset of major cultural and technological changes that left their imprint on past and present genomes, and potentially on the impact of changes in lifestyle and demography on the appearance of certain diseases and genetic disorders.' The findings were published in the journal Trends in Genetics.","Farming key to the development of Europe .

Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden primate specialists say two-month-old 'Gladys' is in good health, developing and growing quickly with loving care from 10 humans imitating a gorilla mom's behavior. This week she began supporting herself on all fours. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Growing up: Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden Primate Team Leader Ron Evans lays with baby Gladys, seen here at just 2-months-old . Taken care of: Gladys is said to be in good health while in the loving care of 10 humans imitating a gorilla mother's behavior after her biological mother showed no interest in her . Life together: Mr Evans works on paperwork on a bed of hay as Gladys sleeps on his back cloaked in black hair meant to resemble a gorilla's . Gladys came to Cincinnati last month . from Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas, after she was born there . Jan. 29 to a first-time mother who showed little maternal instinct. It was decided to move her to . Cincinnati's zoo because of its extensive experience in raising gorilla . babies and its availability of experienced gorilla mothers. 'The next step, she'll be able to walk around by herself,' said Ron Evans, primate team leader, commonly now seen with Gladys on his back. Growing strong, Gladys also is teething and has begun eating some cooked foods, such as sweet potatoes and carrots, besides being bottle-fed five times a day. 'She's at the age now where she really starts growing by leaps and bounds,' Mr Evans said. Role model: Primate Keeper Ashley O'Connell carries Gladys, an endangered Western Lowland Gorilla on her back, in an effort to model other gorilla behavior . New home: Zoo specialists think she will be ready within a few months to be moved to the care of one of four perspective mother gorillas they believe will latch onto her . Support: Ms O'Connell, who just had her first child five months ago, cuddles with Gladys who flashes a bright pink tongue and wide, energetic eyes . Human surrogates dress in black, wear furry vests and kneepads and make gorilla sounds to help prepare Gladys for the transition to a real gorilla family. They have been showing her to other gorillas and letting them touch her. ‘I'm not gonna lie, she's waking up now too, it's fun, but, more importantly it's a big responsibility that we do not take the least little bit lightly,’ Mr Evans told the Cincinnati Enquirer while lying in a bed of straw. The little gorilla was seen nestled on his black back. ‘It's a privilege to get the opportunity to do it and despite how much we might like hanging out with Gladys,  the thing that we are looking most for in return is the day she goes in with a mother gorilla,' he continued. It's especially important with western lowland gorillas being critically endangered in the wild. Newborn: In February adorable photos of the baby being cared for at the Texas zoo after her birth were released . Left behind: The zoo said that after the baby was born in January its mother just walked away, showing no interest in caring for it . Cared for: Zoo workers immediately went to work making sure the newborn was bottle fed every two hours . Experts: The baby was later sent specifically to the Ohio zoo because of their experienced care with newborn gorillas . The Enquirer reports that zoo specialists think she will be ready within a few months to be transferred to a new mother. There are four potential adoptive moms among their gorillas. 'The gorillas have to decide who this baby's mom is going to be,' said Mr Evans. 'That will be the day that all this hard work pays off,' said primate keeper Ashley O'Connell, crawling around with the 9-pound gorilla riding on her back.

Walmart is considering a radical plan to have customers visiting their stores deliver packages to online buyers on their way home, it was revealed today. Asking customers to deliver goods would put the world's largest retailer squarely in middle of a new phenomenon sometimes known as 'crowd-sourcing,' or the 'sharing economy.' The company hopes the plan will help it compete with online rival Amazon, which has expanded from an internet bookstore to practically corner the market in all online shopping. A Walmart store in Paramount, California: The company is mulling a radical plan to 'crowd-source' its online deliveries by asking in-store customers to drop off packages to internet buyers on their way home . Such an effort would, however, face numerous legal, regulatory and privacy obstacles, and Walmart executives have admitted it is still at an early planning stage. Walmart is making a big push to ship online orders directly from stores, hoping to cut transport costs and gain an edge over Amazon and other online retailers, which have no physical store locations. The company does this at 25 stores currently, but plans to double that to 50 this year and could expand the program to hundreds of stores in the future. Walmart currently uses carriers like FedEx Corp for delivery - or, in the case of a same-day delivery service called Walmart To Go that is being tested in five metro areas, its own delivery trucks. 'I see a path to where this is crowd-sourced,' said Joel Anderson, chief executive of Walmart.com in the U.S., in an interview with Reuters. Walmart has millions of customers each week, some of whom could tell the retailer where they live and sign up to drop of packages for online customers who live on their route home, Mr Anderson explained. In return, Walmart would offer a discount on the customers' shopping bills, effectively covering the cost of their petrol in return for making the deliveries, he added. Walmart.com: Walmart currently uses carriers like FedEx Corp for delivery - or, in the case of a same-day delivery service called Walmart To Go that is being tested in five metro areas, its own delivery trucks . 'This is at the brain-storming stage, . but it's possible in a year or two,' said Jeff McAllister, senior vice . president of Walmart U.S. innovations. However, . Matt Nemer, retail analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the . likelihood of the plan being broadly adopted across the Walmart's . network of more than 4,000 U.S. stores is low. 'I'm sure it will be a test in some stores,' he said. 'But they may only keep it for metro markets and for higher-priced items.' Start-ups such as TaskRabbit and . Fiverr already let individuals rent out their time and expertise to . companies and people looking for small jobs to be completed. Zipments . was founded in 2010 as a crowd-sourced delivery network that allowed . anyone over 18 years old with a vehicle, a text-enabled phone, and a . PayPal account to bid on courier services for local businesses. Such . online match-making businesses often push legal boundaries - and a . Walmart crowd-sourced delivery program would be no different, according . to Mr Nemer. Online packages delivered by customers may never reach their destination, either through theft or fraud, he said. Such . a crowd-sourced delivery service may not be as reliable as FedEx or . United Parcel Service, which have insured drivers, he added. 'You . are comfortable with a FedEx or UPS truck in your driveway, but what . about a stranger knocking on your door?' Mr Nemer said. The Amazon Phoenix Fulfillment Centre in Goodyear, Arizona: Walmart hopes to gain an edge over internet rivals, which have no shops, by shipping goods sold online from its network of 4,000 stores across the U.S. While Zipments started out with a pure crowd-sourcing approach, the company now does more screening of drivers before allowing them to be part of its delivery network, chief executive and co-founder Garrick Pohl said. Theft, fraud and late deliveries have never been a problem, but insurance and licenses were an obstacle, Pohl explained. Drivers often need personal liability insurance to cover package delivery activities. Cargo insurance is also needed. Zipments self-insures this risk up to $250, but the firm encourages its couriers to buy additional coverage for higher-value packages, Mr Pohl said. In some areas, like downtown Chicago, people also need a courier license to deliver things, he added. 'Zipments now helps people get all these things set up before allowing them to deliver goods,' Mr Pohl said. Still, he said the issues are not insurmountable, citing pizza restaurants, which have used part-time drivers to deliver food for years. 'It's a great solution for large retailers like Walmart,' Mr Pohl said. 'We'd like to see them move quicker, but it's great that they are considering it.' Zipments is trying to provide such services to retailers, although Mr Pohl declined to say which companies the start-up is talking to about this.","Company hopes the plan will help it out-compete online giant Amazon .

Miss Cortez poses next to a Bentley luxury car, which may or may not be the vehicle she has just acquired . TMZ reported that Delia Cortez, who is in her late 20s and is studying to become a veterinarian, was in an 'intimate relationship' with Buss. She currently lives in Honolulu. A MySpace page in her name contains bikini modeling photos and a shot of her next to a light blue Bentley, but it's not known whether it is the one that she just acquired. The luxury car goes for anywhere between $166,000 to $203,000. The rest of Buss' possessions were left to his family trust, which is headed up by his daughter, Jeanie Buss, who is engaged to former Lakers coach Phil Jackson. Buss, who bought the team in 1979, died on February 18 while battling cancer. He was 80 years old. News of his death came just days after it was reported that he had been suffering from the disease and hospitalized in intensive care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Buss acquired, nurtured and befriended a staggering array of talented players and basketball minds during his Hall of Fame tenure. Few owners in sports history can even approach Buss' accomplishments with the Lakers, who made the NBA finals 16 times through 2011 during his 32 years in charge, winning 10 titles between 1980 and 2010. The Lakers easily are the NBA's most successful franchise since he bought the club in 1979. He was also beloved by his players, and often referred to the team as his extended family. Working with front-office executives . Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak, Buss spent lavishly to win his titles . despite lacking a huge personal fortune, often running the NBA's highest . payroll while also paying high-profile coaches like Jackson and Pat Riley.

Playboy: Buss is pictured with singer Paula Abdul, Lakers legend Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and rapper Snoop Dogg . He co-founded a basic-cable sports television network and sold the naming rights to the Forum at times when both now-standard strategies were unusual, adding justification for his induction into the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. Magic Johnson and fellow Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy formed lifelong bonds with Buss during the Lakers' run to five titles in nine years in the 1980s, when the Lakers earned a reputation as basketball's most exciting team with their glamorous Showtime style. Jackson then led Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant to a three-peat from 2000-02, rekindling the Lakers' mystique, before Bryant and Pau Gasol won two more titles under Jackson in 2009 and 2010. Although Buss was proudest of his two . hands full of NBA title rings, he also was a scholar, Renaissance man . and bon vivant who epitomized California cool - and a certain LA . lifestyle - for his entire public life. The father of six was rarely seen without an attractive - and much younger - woman on his arm.

Legends: Buss speaks at his Basketball Hall of Fame induction as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Pat Riley look on . Buss earned a Ph.D. in chemistry at age 24 and had careers in aerospace and real estate development before getting into sports. With money largely from his Santa Monica real-estate ventures, Buss bought the then-struggling Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and both clubs' arena - the Forum - from Jack Kent Cooke in a $67.5million deal that was the largest sports transaction in history at the time.= . Magic: Buss hugs Magic Johnson in the locker room after they won the 1980 NBA championship against the Philadelphia 76ers . In January 2011, Forbes estimated the Lakers were worth $643million - the second-most valuable NBA franchise. Buss also helped change televised . sports by co-founding the Prime Ticket network in 1985, even receiving a . star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006 for his work in television. Breaking . the contemporary model of subscription services for televised sports, . Buss' Prime Ticket put beloved broadcaster Chick Hearn and the Lakers' home games on basic cable. Immediately, Buss transformed the Lakers into the NBA's most glamorous franchise, winning 10 NBA championships under his watch - with the first in 1980. Buss' children moved into leadership roles with the Lakers in recent years. Jim Buss, the Lakers' executive vice president of player personnel and the second of Buss' six children, has taken a leading role in basketball decisions, while daughter Jeanie plays a major role in running the franchise's business side. Yet Jerry Buss was deeply involved the Lakers' most recent major moves, including the acquisitions of Steve Nash and Dwight Howard last summer, along with the firing of coach Mike Brown and the hiring of Mike D'Antoni this season.

She tried to fight him off but he sank the blades into her chest, back and throat ten times at their home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, last May. 'Brutal': Robert Dunson, left, murdered wife Jean, right, after she discovered his secret love child from an affair with his ex-wife . Bloodbath: The couple's home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where the attack happened . The drunken explosion came after she demanded a divorce having discovered his 14-year-old son he had kept hidden from her after an affair with his ex-wife. Dunson was today jailed at Reading Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years. The court heard how Mrs Dunson, a lawyer, noticed the teenager at the defendant’s mother’s 80th birthday party in 2010 and recognised his similarity to her husband. Dunson admitted the betrayal and his wife filed for divorce but they continued living together in separate rooms. Out-of-work Dunson attacked his more successful on May 4, last year. The jury heard how his prospects without his wife were glum as he was out of work, having previously managed a William Hill bookmakers in Harlesden, North West London. One the night of the bloodbath he drank a litre of brandy while watching sports and stalked into her room. The attack was so ferocious that one of the blades broke off in his wife's body. Bespectacled Dunson was found by police in the kitchen with the sword hilt against the wall and the edge resting on his chest. The prosecution said during the trial that this was a 'staged' attempt by Dunson at a suicide. His wife was then pronounced dead where she lay, with her phone dangling just yards away hinting at a final bid to call for help. Sentencing the husband Judge John Reddihough said: 'You murdered your wife in the most violent and brutal manner, inflicting many wounds upon her with two separate knives, one of which you left embedded in her body.' In an impact statement read in court, her sister Janet Donofrio said: 'My sister Jean was a very intelligent, articulate and caring and courageous woman. She was a daughter, sister, mother and wife. 'The pain, devastation and loss our family is feeling now are indescribable. All we have now are memories of a person who loved life.' Trial: Robert Dunson was jailed for life at Reading Crown Court, pictured, after murdering his wife with a Samurai sword . Mrs Dunson, described by Judge Reddihough as 'an attractive, intelligent, hard working, professional woman', was a bright pupil growing up in Watford, Hertfordshire, and went on to get a law degree from Birmingham University. She met Dunson in the 1980s, when he was already married and had two sons but he left his wife for Mrs Dunson in 1991 and was divorced in 1992. A year later they set up home but during an affair, between 1995 and 1996, he left his ex-wife pregnant and kept the truth secret. The jury was read a letter Mrs Dunson had written after discovering the love child. The letter said: 'You are a liar, a cheat and a coward. I discovered you have been lying to me for 14 years. 'You haven’t even had the decency to tell me. I feel foolish, gullible and silly. 'Typical you continued to see some sort of evil masterplan, when there was none. 'You claim you love me. Well, if the way you treated me and lied to me is love, you can keep it.' Benjamin Adejowon Aina QC, defending, described the attack as 'an explosion of unfortunate emotion.' He said: 'The defendant was going through a messy divorce. The defendant was suffering from a certain amount of mental illness, however slight that might have been. 'Set against that background and a number of incidents that had taken place that didn’t involve violence but unpleasant behaviour he snapped. 'He carried out the acts that he carried out, which were not characteristic.'","Robert Dunson drank a litre of brandy then launched frenzied attack .

The sharp increase in the number of women over 30 who are having abortions is due in part to the recent financial crisis, experts have claimed. Terminations carried out by women between 30 and 34 increased by 10 per cent between 2009 and 2011, according to Department of Health figures. Increased financial pressure, more widely available IVF treatment allowing women to have children later, and career ambitions are all said to have contributed to the rise, according to experts. Pregnancy scare: The number of abortions in England and Wales has risen for the second year running, according to the Department Of Health . Experts said one reason was many 30-something women believe they could delay motherhood by using IVF in their 40s. Only last month it emerged that women in their early 40s could be given fertility treatment for free on the NHS despite success rates at this age being low. Tracey McNeil, UK director of Marie Stopes, the sexual health charity, told the Sunday Times: 'There is good evidence that, in a recession, women delay marriage and taking out mortgages into their late 20s. 'That in turn delays them having families until their early or mid-thirties. 'If they have an unplanned pregnancy at a certain stage in their career, or have just embarked on a mortgage and can't afford maternity leave, they may consider termination.' Josephine Quintavalle, of pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘At some stage these women are going to decide they really want children and then by that stage it may be too late. 'Meeting women's needs': Ann Furedi said that there was no 'right' number of abortions . ‘It just seems to be abortion on demand. It’s like a form of contraception. ‘Without making judgement, you would think that by this age women should know better. It may be that because IVF is available they can always delay having a baby.’ Last year there were 29,579 abortions carried out on women aged 30 to 34 compared with 27,978 in 2010 – a rise of 1,601. In contrast, the number of those aged between 25 and 29 rose by under 4 per cent, from 40,800 in 2010 to 42,321 last year. For all age groups, 189,931 terminations were carried out in 2011 – an increase of 0.2 per cent in a year. Around 36 per cent  were carried out on women who had had an  abortion. Only last week it emerged that some teenagers have already had eight abortions, fuelling  concerns many think of it as a form  of contraception. Figures revealed under the Freedom of Information Act showed that 5,300 girls last year had a ‘repeat’ abortion. Ann Furedi, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: ‘Abortion is a service that a third of women will need in the course of their reproductive lifetimes so they can plan the timing and size of their families, and play a role in society. By age: The percentage of women who had one of more abortions in England and Wales in 2011 . ‘There is no “right” number of abortions above and beyond ensuring that every woman who needs to end an unwanted pregnancy can do so.’ Julie Bentley, of the Family Planning Association, said: ‘The number of abortions hasn’t changed significantly in the past few years and this is to be welcomed. ‘However, we do know cracks are beginning to appear in contraception services. If we are going to bring down abortion numbers, this needs to change. Contraception is an essential not a luxury.’ Public health minister Anne Milton said: ‘Having an abortion can be traumatic and stressful and should never be seen as a form of contraception.’ Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists vice president David Richmond, said: ‘We need to continue to reduce the need for abortion in  the first place particularly for  repeat abortions.’","There were 189,931 abortions performed for women resident in England and Wales in 2011 .
This was a 0.2% rise on 2010 and 7.7% rise on 2001 .
36% of women undergoing abortions had one or more previous abortions - a rise of 31% since 2001 ."

Roberto Mancini is at loggerheads with his captain Vincent Kompany after claiming the Belgian defied him by playing for his country in midweek. Having not played for Manchester City since injuring his calf at the end of January, Kompany surprised everybody by playing for Belgium in their World Cup win over Macedonia in midweek. Despite the Belgian FA telling Sportsmail last night that Mancini’s medical staff were fully aware of Marc Wilmots’ intention to play Kompany, the City boss launched a wide-ranging attack at the player and his national coach. Defiant: Roberto Mancini says Yaya Toure will not leave Manchester City this summer . How they stand: City are 15 points behind United . Mancini said: ‘I said to him, “Stay . here to have more treatment but don’t go to play because it would be . taking a risk for us because these next two months are really . important”. He said that the manager called him and he should go. ‘I can’t put him in jail for two . weeks, can I? It is OK for him to go there and have a fitness test with . their medical people but after that he should come back. ‘It was important that Vinny worked . here and prepared well for the last two months of the season because he . hasn’t played for us for 60 days. World's best: Yaya Toure (centre) will return to the midfield after missing the Everton defeat with a migraine . Furious: Mancini is angry that Vincent Kompany played for Belgium against Macedonia . Return: Mancini was disappointed that Belgium opted to play his star centre half after injury . Manchester City v Newcastle United . Manchester United v Manchester City . Manchester City v Wigan Athletic . Tottenham v Manchester City . Manchester City v West Ham United . Swansea City v Manchester City . Reading v Manchester City . Manchester City v Norwich City . ‘I hoped he would come back after one . day, two days. I think sometimes the player has to understand that the . club is more important. ‘I’m not saying that international football is not important because I never say to my players, “Don’t go to the national team”. ‘But there are some cases when the . club is more important. If he had got another injury, or if on Saturday . he is not ready to play because he played for the national team, and I . lost him for another month, for me this is not correct by the player or . the manager.’ Last night the Belgian FA hit back at . Mancini. A spokesman said: ‘We’re surprised by Mr Mancini’s reaction as . he did know Vincent was playing the second game, as there were close . contacts between our medical staff and the doctors at Manchester City. ‘Vincent wasn’t fit to play against . Everton two weeks ago or in our first game but our medical staff made . him ready for the second game. We don’t understand why they are . complaining. They got their player back in full fitness.’ Professionalism: City's stars will be hoping to seal second place, starting with a victory over Newcastle . Wrapped up: Sergio Aguero in City's bootroom ahead of training . Mancini hopes Kompany will be fit for tomorrow’s Barclays Premier League game against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium. ‘I don’t know if he is OK or not — we will see his condition today,’ he added. ‘He didn’t play for us for 60 days and . went to play for the Belgian national team. I did not agree with it. Managers of national teams should understand. These players play for . their clubs, and every month the clubs pay their salary. ‘I tried to talk to the Belgium manager when Vinny was first injured. But probably he didn’t understand very well.’ In contention: Sergio Aguero (right) and David Silva are put through their paces .
